Roderick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.930\nAnd in these upcoming episodes\nwe're gonna be covering the CCSP or\n\n5\n00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.920\nthe Certified Cloud Security Professional,\n\n6\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.230\nput on by ISC squared and the CSA or\nthe Cloud Security Alliance.\n\n7\n00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.800\nSo we're gonna be covering these courses.\n\n8\n00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.300\nAnd Sean,\nyou know this is obviously a new cert,\n\n9\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.080\na relatively new\ncertifications that are out.\n\n10\n00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.680\nSo tell us a little bit about who might\nbe interested in taking these videos.\n\n11\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.960\n>> Well, it, the.\n\n12\n00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.190\nWhen you talk about the cloud security\nprofessional, this is actually\n\n13\n00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.610\na certification that would be\ngeared towards someone that is both\n\n14\n00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.470\nan IT professional, someone that really\nknows their stuff as far as IT goes,\n\n15\n00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.920\nthe more advanced user, as well as someone\nthat would be around the level of a CCSP.\n\n16\n00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.320\nAnd that's an important little detail\nthere as a matter of fact is someone that\n\n17\n00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.360\nholds a CCSP credential would be pretty\nmuch be qualified to set the CCSP.\n\n18\n00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.090\nYou're just gonna need to unload the\nmaterial, of course, but you've already\n\n19\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.820\nmet the core requirements for the most\npart if you already have the CCSP.\n\n20\n00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.170\nSo, if you look at what the CCSP is and\nwho that type of person is,\n\n21\n00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.250\nwhich is a high-level\nsecurity professional.\n\n22\n00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.840\nI should say mid-to-high\nlevel security professional.\n\n23\n00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.480\nThat's kind of what we're looking at\nas far as theory and all that goes.\n\n24\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.310\nIn practice, yeah,\nyou should be an IT person.\n\n25\n00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.110\nYou should have some experience with\napplications, databases would be great but\n\n26\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.330\nnot necessary to have but\nyou should know your IT stuff so\n\n27\n00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.640\nyou understand some of the issues and\nthings that go on with that.\n\n28\n00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.510\nAnd of course, like I said,\n\n29\n00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.300\nthe CSSP is gonna give you\nthe security side of things.\n\n30\n00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.100\n>> So this is really geared towards those\npeople that might be responsible for\n\n31\n00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.730\nmigrating their resources up to\nthe cloud in an organization.\n\n32\n00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.540\nOr if you are already in\nthe cloud managing and\n\n33\n00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.320\nmaintaining your cloud service.\n\n34\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.020\nBecause really when it comes down to it,\nsecurity in the cloud\n\n35\n00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.350\nis a lot different than what we're used to\ndealing with our internal infrastructure.\n\n36\n00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.310\nRight there is a whole new set of things\nthat we got to worry about some of our\n\n37\n00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.370\nprocedures that we use now\nare not gonna be the same, or\n\n38\n00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.410\nnot work the same up in the cloud, huh?\n\n39\n00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.110\n>> Yeah,\nthings are not gonna be the same old,\n\n40\n00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.110\nsame old stuff as you move to the cloud.\n\n41\n00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.190\nThat's something that could very\neasily get you into trouble.\n\n42\n00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.550\nAnd so, what the CCSP tries to teach you\nis it tries to teach you how to plan\n\n43\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.080\neither that migration or\n\n44\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.530\nthe integration of cloud technologies\ninto what you already have.\n\n45\n00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.860\nSo whatever you currently have,\nif you're hosted in house or\n\n46\n00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.680\nyou're working with an external provider,\nand remember an external\n\n47\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.380\nprovider doesn't have to mean you're\nworking with a cloud provider already,\n\n48\n00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.600\nyou could be using something\nentirely different than that.\n\n49\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.300\nIt's talking about how to\nbring what you have now, and\n\n50\n00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.510\nsomehow, put the cloud into that mix.\n\n51\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.010\nAnd do it safely and securely,\ninstead of just saying, well, hey,\n\n52\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.550\nsnap my fingers, put the cloud in there\nand everything's all said and done.\n\n53\n00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.130\nYou definitely wanna avoid that.\n\n54\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.950\nI mean, cuz that's happen a lot of times\nin the past with new technology as,\n\n55\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.670\nhey that's great.\n\n56\n00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.080\nLet's, it sounds great.\n\n57\n00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.180\nLet's all the benefits and all that or\njust look awesome on paper.\n\n58\n00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.210\nLet's bring that in.\n\n59\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.145\nBut it's how do you get there\nfrom where you are right now.\n\n60\n00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:25.625\nThe CCSP is designed to do that.\n\n61\n00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:29.455\nIt's designed to help you plan and\naddress certain issues and\n\n62\n00:03:29.455 --> 00:03:32.445\ndecide which model of deployment\nis really best for you.\n\n63\n00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:35.534\nIt's not just a case of either\nyou have the cloud or you don't,\n\n64\n00:03:35.534 --> 00:03:37.472\nit's how much of the cloud do you have.\n\n65\n00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:40.492\nAnd you could almost say there's\nas many different models of clouds\n\n66\n00:03:40.492 --> 00:03:43.114\nas there are clouds in the sky,\nyou really could.\n\n67\n00:03:43.114 --> 00:03:47.272\nYou kinda gotta be aware of those to\nsee which one's the best fit for you.\n\n68\n00:03:47.272 --> 00:03:51.042\n>> Right, because we're gonna have those C\nlevel executives coming to us, and they've\n\n69\n00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:54.302\nheard the buzzwords, they know some of\nthe power that we can get from the cloud.\n\n70\n00:03:54.302 --> 00:03:57.242\nAnd then they come to us and say well,\nlet's get our stuff out there.\n\n71\n00:03:57.242 --> 00:03:59.160\nWe want to be in the cloud as well.\n\n72\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.290\nBut it's not quite that easy.\n\n73\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.890\nYou can't just push a button and\nmake everything go up there.\n\n74\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.440\nLots of things are managed differently.\n\n75\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.480\nSecurity is managed differently,\nforensics is managed differently.\n\n76\n00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.110\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n77\n00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.140\n>> It's a big game changer.\n\n78\n00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.470\nThat's what this certification is\nreally geared towards, is teaching us,\n\n79\n00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.210\nmaking sure that we can implement what\nthose C level executives want out of us.\n\n80\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.720\nI've got the ISC webpage pulled up again.\n\n81\n00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.100\nThis is one of the providers,\nit was a partnership between the ISC and\n\n82\n00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.320\nthe Cloud Security Alliance or the CSA.\n\n83\n00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.700\nAnd I'll make sure we throw\nthis in the show notes.\n\n84\n00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.760\nBut if we look, this particular\nexam is gonna be four hours,\n\n85\n00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.610\nabout 125 questions on that exam,\nmultiple choice.\n\n86\n00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.380\nYou need about a 700 out of\n1000 to pass that exam, and\n\n87\n00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.480\nthe pricing is a little\nsteep on this one Sean.\n\n88\n00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.300\nIt is right up there with the CISSP.\n\n89\n00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.980\nWe're looking at the CCSP\nexam $549 to take that,\n\n90\n00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.555\nand we can take that, let me just\ndouble check that, through prometric.\n\n91\n00:04:57.555 --> 00:05:01.815\nThrough Pearson Vue, sorry, Pearson Vue\nis gonna be the exam provider for that.\n\n92\n00:05:01.815 --> 00:05:06.405\nSo that's the idea, if you're getting\nready to migrate your infrastructure out\n\n93\n00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:11.070\nto the cloud, or integrate cloud services\ninto your existing infrastructure,\n\n94\n00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.280\nthese are gonna be the episodes for you.\n\n95\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.080\nStay tuned as Sean and\nI progress through the CCSP, or\n\n96\n00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.227\nthe Certified Cloud Security\nProfessional Objectives.\n\n97\n00:05:21.227 --> 00:05:27.079\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.991\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:17.875\nAnd with me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:20.390\nSean, what you got lined up for us today?\n\n6\n00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.720\n>> Well,\nwe're gonna start off on our journey and\n\n7\n00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.920\ncloud technologies is what we're gonna do.\n\n8\n00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.120\nAnd when we go through the CCSP,\n\n9\n00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.530\nwhich is our cloud security\nprofessional certification.\n\n10\n00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.530\nWhat we have to do is we have to\nunderstand what the cloud is, kind of\n\n11\n00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.280\nhow it's lined up and what the terminology\nis for this specific credential.\n\n12\n00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.140\nAnd let me also say this terminology isn't\nspecific to this credential entirely.\n\n13\n00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.600\nA lot of these terms maybe the first time\nyou hear them as we go through the CCSP,\n\n14\n00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:53.870\nbut it's not the only place.\n\n15\n00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.970\nIn fact, it should be something that you\nshould get used to using, because it's not\n\n16\n00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.350\nonly going to get you to the point where\nyou understand more about the cloud.\n\n17\n00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.169\nBut also it's gonna help you\nto speak the language of what\n\n18\n00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:08.177\nthe cloud service provider is gonna do.\n\n19\n00:01:08.177 --> 00:01:11.157\nYour ISPs, you really wanna make\nsure you're on the same page and\n\n20\n00:01:11.157 --> 00:01:12.630\nknow what you're looking for.\n\n21\n00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.360\n>> Yeah, and some of these terms\nI've never seen them before.\n\n22\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.660\nBut now all of a sudden they're\npopping up everywhere I go.\n\n23\n00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.790\nCloud services, IaaS, SaaS, PaaS.\n\n24\n00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.360\nAnd at the very beginning\nthey were very specific,\n\n25\n00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.420\nonly if you were dealing with cloud.\n\n26\n00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.830\nBut now I'm seeing them in Microsoft\ncourses and things like this,\n\n27\n00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.700\nyou're seeing it everywhere.\n\n28\n00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.950\n>> Yeah, their definitely\npopping up wherever you look.\n\n29\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.690\nI mean Cloud being so popular nowadays,\n\n30\n00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.430\nit's something that you keep hearing\nthe word Cloud, Cloud, Cloud.\n\n31\n00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.000\nBut that's just a very, very generic term,\nbecause you can get enough feel for\n\n32\n00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.670\nwhat the Cloud is and even then\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n33\n00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.320\n>> Getting the feel for\n\n34\n00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.340\nwhat the Cloud is like,\nit's a off recorded term but\n\n35\n00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.930\nreally what does that mean.\n\n36\n00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.060\nSo we kinda gotta clear that up before\nwe can even get things going is.\n\n37\n00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.300\nWhat is the cloud?\n\n38\n00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.630\nWhat type of things are we talking\nabout that characterize the cloud?\n\n39\n00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.290\nBecause think about it, if I put that\nout to really any of you out there.\n\n40\n00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.670\nHow many could have actually say you\nreally could describe the cloud and\n\n41\n00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.240\nbe consistent about it.\n\n42\n00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.890\nI could probably ask 20 IT people and\nget 40 different answers,\n\n43\n00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.290\n50 different answers.\n\n44\n00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.330\nSo we wanna make sure that while all those\nanswers may dance around the point and\n\n45\n00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.550\nkind of touch on different aspects of it.\n\n46\n00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.110\nOr you might be saying one thing and\nsomeone might be saying something\n\n47\n00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.045\ndifferent but\nit really means the same thing.\n\n48\n00:02:38.045 --> 00:02:40.150\nWe gotta make sure we're\nall on the same page.\n\n49\n00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.090\nAnd so that's what we wanna get out of\nthe way on this in this first episode.\n\n50\n00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.386\n>> Is there anybody that puts\nout a set of standard terms?\n\n51\n00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:49.417\nOr anybody we should really say, okay,\n\n52\n00:02:49.417 --> 00:02:52.750\nthese are the ones that are laying\nit out and let's go with that.\n\n53\n00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.020\n>> There really kind of isn't.\n\n54\n00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.982\nIt's unfortunately,\n\n55\n00:02:56.982 --> 00:03:02.676\nit seems like everyone's kind of\ngot their own little description.\n\n56\n00:03:02.676 --> 00:03:05.677\nOne of the things I like\nabout when ISC put out\n\n57\n00:03:05.677 --> 00:03:08.694\nthe CCSP with the Cloud Security Alliance.\n\n58\n00:03:08.694 --> 00:03:12.730\nAs this was really kind of the first\nattempt for someone to say, heck we're\n\n59\n00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.550\ngoing to start putting terms out that\nreally start explaining what the cloud is.\n\n60\n00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.930\nIn such a way that incorporates all the\nthings other people have been saying, but\n\n61\n00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.590\nare really gonna put it in black and\nwhite.\n\n62\n00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.685\nSo everyone's kinda got a vendor neutral,\nI almost said gender neutral.\n\n63\n00:03:30.685 --> 00:03:34.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Vendor-neutral set of guidelines.\n\n64\n00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.890\nSo you can go and apply them to\nyour Microsofts, your Googles,\n\n65\n00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.228\nyour Amazons,\nwhomever your cloud provider actually is.\n\n66\n00:03:41.228 --> 00:03:43.800\nYou can apply that guidance to them.\n\n67\n00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.790\nAnd so just keep that in\nmind when you're doing this,\n\n68\n00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.870\nis that these things should apply\npretty broadly across a spectrum.\n\n69\n00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.180\n>> All right, so where do we start?\n\n70\n00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.980\nWhat are some of the first things we\nneed to understand about the cloud.\n\n71\n00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.586\n>> Well, let's start [LAUGH]\nat the very beginning here and\n\n72\n00:04:00.586 --> 00:04:04.124\ntalk about what\nare the characteristics of the cloud.\n\n73\n00:04:04.124 --> 00:04:09.560\nWhat are we talking about when we really\nget into saying we mean the cloud?\n\n74\n00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.645\n>> I've had people tell me that\nin the cloud just the internet?\n\n75\n00:04:17.645 --> 00:04:20.020\nAnd I'm like, sort of.\n\n76\n00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.510\n>> It does kind of fit\ninto that whole idea.\n\n77\n00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.380\nBut you see it all over the place\nwhenever they diagram out the cloud.\n\n78\n00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.020\nIt's that big fluffy thing out there,\nit's a cloud, you know?\n\n79\n00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.015\nSo you can kinda see where it\ncould cause some confusion.\n\n80\n00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:38.220\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> And the definitions that are out there\n\n81\n00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.270\ndo kind of lend themselves to saying,\nwell isn't that the Internet?\n\n82\n00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.400\nSo we really kinda gotta clear that up,\ncuz we just can't have that.\n\n83\n00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.640\nThat's not gonna work for\nanything we have going forward.\n\n84\n00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.020\nSo what we're gonna borrow here is\nwe're going to use what NIST says,\n\n85\n00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.990\nthe National Institute of\nStandards in Technology.\n\n86\n00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.275\nAll right, I knew I had it, it was close.\n\n87\n00:05:02.275 --> 00:05:04.295\nOne letter off.\n\n88\n00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:10.835\nSo what NIST has done is they\nhave actually put out some things\n\n89\n00:05:10.835 --> 00:05:15.845\nthat say this is what the cloud actually\nis or what characterizes the cloud.\n\n90\n00:05:15.845 --> 00:05:17.765\nThe first thing we have when we look at,\n\n91\n00:05:17.765 --> 00:05:21.405\nwe have really five points that\nsummarize what the cloud is.\n\n92\n00:05:21.405 --> 00:05:23.770\nIs a broad network access, so\n\n93\n00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.880\nit means that you have people that can\nreally access it from really any place.\n\n94\n00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.860\nIt's got kind of universal\naccess if you will.\n\n95\n00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.590\nNow there may be some limits on that.\n\n96\n00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.640\nDon't assume broad network\naccess means public access.\n\n97\n00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.810\nIt absolutely does not mean that.\n\n98\n00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.100\nIt just means that we have a resource.\n\n99\n00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.690\nThat can be accessed by good number\nof individuals or parties or\n\n100\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.720\napplications, what have you.\n\n101\n00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.772\nThat's what that gets into.\n\n102\n00:05:50.772 --> 00:05:53.830\n>> It has a pretty fundamental\nchange in our thinkings.\n\n103\n00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.220\nYou and I being in it for\n\n104\n00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.450\na while, our resources are at\ncorporate headquarters, right?\n\n105\n00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.450\nAnd you connect to it when you get to work\nor maybe you can connect to it remotely.\n\n106\n00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.370\nNow we're talking about something\nthat's available when you're at work,\n\n107\n00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.210\nwhen your at home,\n\n108\n00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.608\nwhen you're traveling, that's kind of\nwhat they mean by that, broad access.\n\n109\n00:06:10.608 --> 00:06:11.743\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n110\n00:06:11.743 --> 00:06:14.970\nAnd you're getting that\nmuch more widespread access\n\n111\n00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.340\nwith this type of technology.\n\n112\n00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.220\nSo a cloud has to have that,\nso that's number one.\n\n113\n00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.890\nThe next thing you wanna have is what\nthey call on-demand self service.\n\n114\n00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.440\nWhat that means is that\nmeans we have a way\n\n115\n00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.380\nof provisioning and taking care\nof the service when we need to.\n\n116\n00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:40.630\nAnd so if you think about it, it could\nbe where you go to a provider where\n\n117\n00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.490\nyou are hosting your mailbox or\nyour mail services with.\n\n118\n00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.910\nYou can add on mailboxes just by paying\nfor the appropriate fees or whatever.\n\n119\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.790\nAnd saying how many you wanna add on and\n\n120\n00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.250\nthey will start provisioning\nthose things and set them up.\n\n121\n00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.580\nAnd there you go,\nyou have x number of mailboxes.\n\n122\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.920\nYou need more space.\n\n123\n00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.900\nYou tell them how much\nmore space you need.\n\n124\n00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.770\nYou do the appropriate\ntransactions financially and\n\n125\n00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.020\nall of a sudden you got more space.\n\n126\n00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.280\nIf that's an internal thing, then it's\nnot even the financial part of it.\n\n127\n00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:16.260\nIf you're doing it as a privately hosted\nCloud, one inside an organization.\n\n128\n00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.750\nIt's just a matter of how much more do\nyou need and someone sets it up for\n\n129\n00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.130\nyou and that's it.\n\n130\n00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.810\nSo a Cloud has to have that.\n\n131\n00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:30.750\nSo that's even a change from what we have\nin lot of the descriptions of the cloud.\n\n132\n00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.740\n>> Absolutely.\n\n133\n00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.990\nYeah, I was just talking to somebody\nthis weekend who used a great example.\n\n134\n00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.740\nThat's exactly what this organization did.\n\n135\n00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.460\nThey ran their own\ninternal mailbox server.\n\n136\n00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.560\nGot tired of dealing with it.\n\n137\n00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.083\nDIdn't have the manpower to have\nsomebody dedicated to that or\n\n138\n00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:47.483\nkeep trained up in that.\n\n139\n00:07:47.483 --> 00:07:49.890\nAnd I'm like,\nwe're just gonna move it out to the cloud.\n\n140\n00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.120\nProblem solved.\n\n141\n00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.800\nOf course, they had to do their research\nand all this stuff that we're gonna teach\n\n142\n00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.840\nyou about during the course\nof these next few episodes.\n\n143\n00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.950\nBut that was what they did.\n\n144\n00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.400\nThey moved that out to the cloud, and\nthey're got that expandability now.\n\n145\n00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.009\nThat ability to Scale up\ninstantly if they need it.\n\n146\n00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:08.829\n>> Yeah that's a big,\nbig point to mention here.\n\n147\n00:08:08.829 --> 00:08:12.749\nIn fact that is one of the five\ncharacteristics that we're talking about\n\n148\n00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:15.846\nfor a Cloud model is something\ncalled Rapid elasticity.\n\n149\n00:08:15.846 --> 00:08:21.316\nIt means that yeah you can very easily\nadjust that to what your needs are,\n\n150\n00:08:21.316 --> 00:08:26.426\nthat's one of the big benefits of\nthe cloud that a lot of people quote\n\n151\n00:08:26.426 --> 00:08:31.740\nwhen you really drill down to the cloud\nand asking, what is the cloud?\n\n152\n00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.368\nWell, mentioned something where we\ncan scale it up as our needs grow.\n\n153\n00:08:37.368 --> 00:08:41.600\nWell, that is in its essence\na rapid elasticity that you\n\n154\n00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.591\ncan dynamically adjust.\n\n155\n00:08:43.591 --> 00:08:46.366\nTo whatever your current needs are.\n\n156\n00:08:46.366 --> 00:08:47.698\nYou need more mailboxes.\n\n157\n00:08:47.698 --> 00:08:50.461\nYou need more storage space for\nyour database.\n\n158\n00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:51.819\nWhat have you.\n\n159\n00:08:51.819 --> 00:08:54.413\nYou can scale up for that and account for\n\n160\n00:08:54.413 --> 00:08:59.601\nthat without having to worry about all\nthe underbelly or whatever you wanted,\n\n161\n00:08:59.601 --> 00:09:04.003\nbut you don't have to worry about\nall the details, let the cloud,\n\n162\n00:09:04.003 --> 00:09:08.340\nthe CSP, the cloud service provider\nworry about that part of it.\n\n163\n00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:13.710\nSo we've got three characteristics\nright there, so we do have\n\n164\n00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:18.820\na couple other ones that we can bring\ninto the mix, one of them is, another\n\n165\n00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.810\none is Resource pooling, which means that,\nwell the name kind of says it all.\n\n166\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:28.030\nBut it's where you have,\nyou have the ability to bring together\n\n167\n00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:31.960\nmultiple systems, which, if you\nunderstand the back end for the cloud.\n\n168\n00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.850\nThe cloud really is bringing together\na bunch of machine some place.\n\n169\n00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:35.810\nThat's really all it is.\n\n170\n00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:38.250\nIt's a bunch of computers and\nstuff like that.\n\n171\n00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.530\nAnd they're just acting as one big thing.\n\n172\n00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:43.460\nYou don't see all that physical\n\n173\n00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.620\nstuff unless you happen to be\nworking at the CSP of course.\n\n174\n00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.840\nYou don't have to worry about all that.\n\n175\n00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.370\nThey can put extra space and all there.\n\n176\n00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:55.060\nTo you, it's just, there's more space,\nthere's more resources available.\n\n177\n00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:00.230\nIt acts like one big blob that\ncan be provisioned appropriately.\n\n178\n00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:04.653\nThat's a really, really cool thing\nabout this type of technology.\n\n179\n00:10:04.653 --> 00:10:07.677\nThe last one we want to have,\n\n180\n00:10:07.677 --> 00:10:12.856\nis we want to have the idea\nof a measured service.\n\n181\n00:10:12.856 --> 00:10:18.279\nSo your CSP or even if you own the cloud,\nyou can adjust the service\n\n182\n00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:24.720\nlevels to guarantee certain quality\nof service level, stuff like that.\n\n183\n00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.310\nThat can be done with the cloud.\n\n184\n00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:32.330\nSo if we're looking overall at things,\nthose five characteristics.\n\n185\n00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.540\nYou know we have the broad network access,\nthe on demand self service,\n\n186\n00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.180\nthe resource pooling.\n\n187\n00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:39.940\nThe measured service and\nthe rapid elasticity,\n\n188\n00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:45.820\nthose are five things that we should\nsee in any cloud to some degree.\n\n189\n00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:50.150\nAnd that doesn't matter what type of\ndeployment that you actually have,\n\n190\n00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.230\nit should be in some way, shape or\n\n191\n00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:57.110\nform, it should include those\nparticular characteristics.\n\n192\n00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:58.141\nAnd think about it, you probably were.\n\n193\n00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:03.319\nYou know ifIfprobably were\ntalking about those already.\n\n194\n00:11:03.319 --> 00:11:07.144\nIt was just a case of,\nyou know well I dance around the point,\n\n195\n00:11:07.144 --> 00:11:13.030\nkind of using all this, no pun intended,\nfluffy language and everything for it.\n\n196\n00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.400\nNow you've got five points.\n\n197\n00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.300\nReally nice and succinct points\nthat say cloud has to have this.\n\n198\n00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:19.970\n>> All right.\n\n199\n00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:20.540\nVery good, all right.\n\n200\n00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.410\nSo now we've got a good idea of\nwhat the heck the cloud is and\n\n201\n00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.940\nhow we can define that.\n\n202\n00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.760\nWhat else do we need to be familiar\nbecause they're not all the same, right?\n\n203\n00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.440\nIt's not just the cloud.\n\n204\n00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.440\n>> Yeah, that's the next thing that we\nhave in here is really when you kind of\n\n205\n00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:40.010\nbreak apart the cloud on, so\nwe know what a cloud has to have, but\n\n206\n00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:45.560\nokay, so it's not just one possible\ndeployment scenario for a cloud.\n\n207\n00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:49.110\nYou already heard me kind\nof mention two in my whole\n\n208\n00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.930\nrun up there when I was defining\ndifferent kinds of cloud characteristics.\n\n209\n00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.610\nYou know I did say kinda public and\nprivate.\n\n210\n00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.060\nOkay that's implying right there,\n\n211\n00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.330\nif you picked up on that,\nthat there are two types of clouds.\n\n212\n00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:06.640\nWell turns out that we actually have four\ntypes of clouds that we need to get into.\n\n213\n00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.080\nWe need to kinda really make\nsure that we understand that.\n\n214\n00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:16.950\nThe one that most people are familiar with\nis just going to be the public cloud.\n\n215\n00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:21.290\nI'd say 90% of the people out\nthere that talk about the cloud,\n\n216\n00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.490\nthat's the cloud they're talking\nabout is the public cloud.\n\n217\n00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.547\nWhether they use that name or not,\nthey're talking about the public cloud.\n\n218\n00:12:26.547 --> 00:12:30.810\nIt's something where they can\ngo to a provider some place and\n\n219\n00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.163\nthat provider hosts it for them.\n\n220\n00:12:33.163 --> 00:12:36.414\nAnd they just go ahead and do whatever and\nthey give the public access.\n\n221\n00:12:36.414 --> 00:12:41.368\nI mean you look at something like one of\nthe big Cloud service providers you know\n\n222\n00:12:41.368 --> 00:12:46.021\nAmazon's web services their used on a ton\nof back ends as back end on a ton of\n\n223\n00:12:46.021 --> 00:12:51.230\nwebsites right now you just don't know\nabout it, because it's hidden from you.\n\n224\n00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:55.190\nThere's a layer of abstraction between\nthe application and what that, and\n\n225\n00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.810\nthe cloud service provider,\nyou don't need to see this.\n\n226\n00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.760\nHowever, when you go through that website,\nyou are getting access to it.\n\n227\n00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:05.210\nAnd anyone going to that website would\nget access to that stuff, indirectly.\n\n228\n00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.690\nThere's a layer of abstraction.\n\n229\n00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:11.220\nBut they're getting access to it, so that\nwould be an example of a public cloud.\n\n230\n00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:15.601\nIf something's accessible publicly\neither directly or indirectly, and\n\n231\n00:13:15.601 --> 00:13:19.701\nyou can go ahead and interact with that,\nit's got very, very broad,\n\n232\n00:13:19.701 --> 00:13:23.803\nto go back to our characteristics it\nhas very broad network access, so\n\n233\n00:13:23.803 --> 00:13:25.979\nthat's what we have going on there.\n\n234\n00:13:25.979 --> 00:13:31.820\nSo, that would be one the other side of it\nthat people are aware of is the private\n\n235\n00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.778\nCloud, the private Cloud is\nsomething that you host internally,\n\n236\n00:13:36.778 --> 00:13:41.130\nyou own it, lock, stock, and\nbarrel as the saying goes.\n\n237\n00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:45.764\nYou own everything so, you're just taking\nthe stuff that Amazon or Google, or\n\n238\n00:13:45.764 --> 00:13:50.677\nMicrosoft, or whoever's hosting for you\nand you're just bringing it on in-house\n\n239\n00:13:50.677 --> 00:13:55.290\nand you're babysitting the whole thing,\nso that's you now.\n\n240\n00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.331\nSo why would you do something like that?\n\n241\n00:13:57.331 --> 00:14:01.983\nWell, we're gonna get into more issues on\nthis but just to kind of to put it out\n\n242\n00:14:01.983 --> 00:14:06.730\nthere, why would you wanna bring up\nthe cloud inside your organization?\n\n243\n00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.492\nWell, maybe for legal reasons\nyou just can't put it out there,\n\n244\n00:14:09.492 --> 00:14:11.759\nmaybe security reasons you\ncan't put it out there.\n\n245\n00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:15.892\nThere's just too many questions on hey,\neveryone has access to that, and\n\n246\n00:14:15.892 --> 00:14:20.616\nI don't feel comfortable or I don't have\nany way of guaranteeing other people can't\n\n247\n00:14:20.616 --> 00:14:25.140\nmonkey with it, and I don't know what\nsomeone else is doing that's managing it,\n\n248\n00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.247\nso I'm just gonna go ahead and\nbring it in-house, so.\n\n249\n00:14:28.247 --> 00:14:32.717\n>> You can still take advantage of some of\nthe other features I guess you could say,\n\n250\n00:14:32.717 --> 00:14:36.053\nof cloud, like we can still\nhave our broad network access,\n\n251\n00:14:36.053 --> 00:14:38.408\nthe elasticity in the managed services.\n\n252\n00:14:38.408 --> 00:14:41.102\nWe're just doing it ourselves\ninstead of a service provider.\n\n253\n00:14:41.102 --> 00:14:41.786\n>> Yeah.\n\n254\n00:14:41.786 --> 00:14:45.723\nReally, all of the characteristics,\nit's good that you point that out, Mike.\n\n255\n00:14:45.723 --> 00:14:49.054\nAll those characteristics that we have,\nthose five points, they're still there.\n\n256\n00:14:49.054 --> 00:14:52.328\n>> it's just to varying degrees,\nbut they're still there.\n\n257\n00:14:52.328 --> 00:14:54.522\nThat broad network accesses\nthat's brought up.\n\n258\n00:14:54.522 --> 00:14:59.541\nThat broad network access isn't as broad\nas it would be as a fully published cloud,\n\n259\n00:14:59.541 --> 00:15:02.552\nbecause we're limiting\nthe scope a bit more, but\n\n260\n00:15:02.552 --> 00:15:05.439\nit still fits the definition\nof a broad access.\n\n261\n00:15:05.439 --> 00:15:10.080\nSo, that's an important\ndetail to mention there.\n\n262\n00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:14.500\nOkay, so that brings us to,\nso we got the two ones that\n\n263\n00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.800\npeople would be familiar with, or\nmore likely are familiar with.\n\n264\n00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.910\nLet's go to the other two.\n\n265\n00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:24.600\nOne of them is a community cloud.\n\n266\n00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.365\nA community cloud, this one, I don't know.\n\n267\n00:15:27.365 --> 00:15:31.605\nThis one, every time I hear it,\nit kind of messes with me a bit,\n\n268\n00:15:31.605 --> 00:15:35.525\nbecause when I look at it,\nit's one of those things that,\n\n269\n00:15:35.525 --> 00:15:40.571\nwhen they say community cloud,\nwasn't that a community, hear the term?\n\n270\n00:15:40.571 --> 00:15:42.138\nIsn't that a public cloud?\n\n271\n00:15:42.138 --> 00:15:43.276\n>> Yeah, right.\n>> It sounds like it.\n\n272\n00:15:43.276 --> 00:15:45.377\nWell, yes and no.\n\n273\n00:15:45.377 --> 00:15:50.074\nA community cloud really\nis a situation where\n\n274\n00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:54.278\nthe grouping together of individuals or\n\n275\n00:15:54.278 --> 00:16:00.226\nclients into a situation where\nthey have similar needs.\n\n276\n00:16:00.226 --> 00:16:05.684\nInstead of just saying well here's a cloud\nand you're all gonna go ahead and use it.\n\n277\n00:16:05.684 --> 00:16:10.279\nI'm gonna provision clouds in such\na way that I'm gonna start grouping\n\n278\n00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:12.051\npeople together by needs.\n\n279\n00:16:12.051 --> 00:16:16.855\nSo they can say here's a cloud that's\ntailored toward your specific needs\n\n280\n00:16:16.855 --> 00:16:21.480\nmight be providing mail services,\nit's optimized for that.\n\n281\n00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.090\nThere might be another one for web\napplications that's optimized for that and\n\n282\n00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:29.204\nthere would be another for storage and\nvirtualization and so on and so forth.\n\n283\n00:16:29.204 --> 00:16:33.410\nThat's so you have something that\na community can actually use,\n\n284\n00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.310\ncuz they have common needs, so\nthat would be where that would come in.\n\n285\n00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:41.040\nSo it is something that you\ncould say is a public cloud.\n\n286\n00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:45.100\nBut then again, anything I just said\nwhen I described a community cloud,\n\n287\n00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:47.920\nanything could also be fit\nover to a private cloud.\n\n288\n00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.900\nSo that's where they kind of\nmake it it's own thing and\n\n289\n00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.800\nsay, this is a community cloud\nbecause it exist in both, so\n\n290\n00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:57.650\nlet's just bring in as it's\nown subtype of cloud in here.\n\n291\n00:16:57.650 --> 00:16:59.650\nSo, that's what that is.\n\n292\n00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.215\nAnd then, there's a one last one and\nthat's the fourth one.\n\n293\n00:17:03.215 --> 00:17:06.475\nAnd it's really, really easy,\nand when you hear the name for\n\n294\n00:17:06.475 --> 00:17:09.550\nit you'll get the whole idea,\nis a hybrid cloud.\n\n295\n00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.414\nA hybrid cloud just means\nyou're mixing and matching.\n\n296\n00:17:12.414 --> 00:17:18.705\nYou're deciding that you wanna\nhave some mishmash of services and\n\n297\n00:17:18.705 --> 00:17:25.104\nstuff like that, so what do you do,\nyou create a hybrid solution and\n\n298\n00:17:25.104 --> 00:17:29.710\nthat's really the easiest\nway to explain it just\n\n299\n00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.793\nmixing stuff up ask yourself,\nwhy would you do that?\n\n300\n00:17:34.793 --> 00:17:39.292\nMaybe you've got a situation where, let's\nlook at the organization that has some\n\n301\n00:17:39.292 --> 00:17:43.934\nsort of legacy application or something\nthey've custom developed an application.\n\n302\n00:17:43.934 --> 00:17:45.455\nIn fact, that's probably a better one,\n\n303\n00:17:45.455 --> 00:17:47.520\nthat they've developed\na custom application.\n\n304\n00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.510\nWell that custom application,\nthey've decided for security reasons,\n\n305\n00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:54.550\nthey're going to host it right\ninside on their own private cloud.\n\n306\n00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:55.590\nOkay, boom, done.\n\n307\n00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.810\nSo we've got our application there.\n\n308\n00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:03.150\nHowever, they've got mail services too,\nand their mail services,\n\n309\n00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:07.200\nwell, those don't fit the same\nsecurity level as this application,\n\n310\n00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.440\nthe same care and feeding needs,\nso what do they do?\n\n311\n00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.810\nThey go to someone like Microsoft,\nor GMail, or whatever or\n\n312\n00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.750\nGoogle, and say well, we're gonna\nhost our web services with you.\n\n313\n00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:23.740\nSo now they have a cloud model or\nbusiness model that incorporates\n\n314\n00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:28.800\nboth a private cloud and a public cloud.\n\n315\n00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.250\nIt's got both of them mixed into that.\n\n316\n00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:36.230\nAnd you can have integration with the mail\nservices and that application, which\n\n317\n00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:41.580\ncould very well happen, in which case, you\ndefinitely have those two hybrid solutions\n\n318\n00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.360\ncoming together where you've offloaded\nthe mail services to a certain degree or\n\n319\n00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:51.040\na pretty high degree in that case, and\nyou've kept your applications internal.\n\n320\n00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:57.000\n>> Seems like a lot of things would\nend up being a hybrid then in the end.\n\n321\n00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.714\n>> Yeah, I think that's kind of\nfair to say that you could have\n\n322\n00:19:00.714 --> 00:19:04.876\na hybrid in a lot of situations just\nbecause it seems to incorporate\n\n323\n00:19:04.876 --> 00:19:07.278\nthe greatest amount of flexibility.\n\n324\n00:19:07.278 --> 00:19:11.552\nBut then I could also say, probably\nin a lot of cases, it would also be\n\n325\n00:19:11.552 --> 00:19:15.901\na public cloud too, because if you\nlook at a lot of organizations, one\n\n326\n00:19:15.901 --> 00:19:20.768\nof the ways they kind of test the waters\nof cloud technologies is through mail,\n\n327\n00:19:20.768 --> 00:19:23.538\nthat's usually the first thing that goes.\n\n328\n00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:26.673\nAt least from what I've seen, I don't know\nif anyone out here disagrees with that.\n\n329\n00:19:26.673 --> 00:19:29.784\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That seems to be the way to kinda dip\n\n330\n00:19:29.784 --> 00:19:33.444\ntheir toes into that technology,\nis that okay,\n\n331\n00:19:33.444 --> 00:19:36.770\nwe're going to do mail services out there.\n\n332\n00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.480\nSo once their mail services,\n\n333\n00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.290\nthey're strictly using that\npure public cloud model.\n\n334\n00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:47.320\nBut somewhere along the way they might\ndecide well, we can do other things and\n\n335\n00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.590\nonce they start introducing a private\nmodel, or that community model,\n\n336\n00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.840\nmodel, then they're definitely gone right\ninto a hybrid solution of some sort.\n\n337\n00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.803\nThey've rolled their own solution.\n\n338\n00:19:57.803 --> 00:19:59.102\n>> Yeah, I can definitely see that.\n\n339\n00:19:59.102 --> 00:20:01.609\nWhy is it mail is always\nthe first one we go?\n\n340\n00:20:01.609 --> 00:20:04.389\nMaybe it's because there's a lot\nof providers out there and\n\n341\n00:20:04.389 --> 00:20:06.851\nit's one of the ones we want\nto get rid of the fastest.\n\n342\n00:20:06.851 --> 00:20:13.260\n>> Yeah, I think you kind of hit that\none on the head right there, definitely.\n\n343\n00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:13.940\nOh, shoot.\n\n344\n00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.310\nAll right, so what's next then?\n\n345\n00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.670\nSo we've got our characteristics, we've\ngot some of the different models that we\n\n346\n00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.670\nhave available,\nwho are working with the cloud.\n\n347\n00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.160\nWhat other terms do we need to\nknow to fully understand cloud?\n\n348\n00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:30.100\n>> Well, I think on something else that\nkinda needs to be hit on in here is going\n\n349\n00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.250\nto our next one is talking\nabout our service models.\n\n350\n00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:40.240\nOur service models are really,\nreally important to get is that we have\n\n351\n00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:46.820\ninfrastructure as a service, software as\na service, and platform as a service.\n\n352\n00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.330\nOkay, those are important\nto really get a grasp\n\n353\n00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:56.490\non the differences between each, because\nagain, the cloud's just not the cloud.\n\n354\n00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.880\nIt's something that you kinda\ngotta really break down.\n\n355\n00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.630\nAnd I'm sure already, with the different\ndeployment models that we talked about,\n\n356\n00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:08.420\nthe cloud models which are deployment\nmodels hybrid and public,\n\n357\n00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.450\nI mean that's probably got you thinking\nabout bit more, and you know some of\n\n358\n00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:15.600\nthe stuff we talked about characteristics\ngot you thinking a bit more about it,\n\n359\n00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.620\nwell now we want to bring this stuff in\nand get you thinking a bit more about some\n\n360\n00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.900\nof the different variations or\nshades of the cloud that we have.\n\n361\n00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.660\nSo when we look at it,\nthings that we have is we have for\n\n362\n00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.270\nexample software as a service.\n\n363\n00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.770\nSoftware as a Service is, again,\n\n364\n00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:35.570\nis one of the ones that you probably\nare gonna go right into first,\n\n365\n00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:40.870\nbecause the beset example is software\nservice is something like mail.\n\n366\n00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:44.560\nYou know, you're gonna have your\nmail off loaded some place else.\n\n367\n00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:48.040\nAnd they're hosting all the software and\nall that stuff there.\n\n368\n00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.040\nYou're just hosting\nthe client applications.\n\n369\n00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.250\nAnd you plug into their stuff and\nyou're really kind of done.\n\n370\n00:21:54.250 --> 00:21:59.070\nIt's probably the first thing that\nyou've had any experience with.\n\n371\n00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:03.670\nIt's not the only thing that\nfits that definition, but\n\n372\n00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:09.530\nit's quite often the one that most\npeople step into from the get-go,\n\n373\n00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:14.100\nyou can have databases in there,\nthat fit in there as far as software for\n\n374\n00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:19.230\nthe service goes, it's really any type\nof situation where you're hosting some\n\n375\n00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:23.910\nsort of application out there that you\nwould normally be hosted internally,\n\n376\n00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:27.340\nyou're put in someplace else, and\nthat's where you gotta be careful.\n\n377\n00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.080\nIt's really an application type\nthing rather than anything else.\n\n378\n00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.990\n>> So at this point, they're hosting,\nlet's say Exchange, and\n\n379\n00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:38.380\nthey're taking care of doing the updates\nfor Exchange and all of that stuff.\n\n380\n00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.870\nWe're just consuming that\nservice at this point?\n\n381\n00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:45.414\n>> Yeah, that's really what it is,\nis that you've now become someone that is\n\n382\n00:22:45.414 --> 00:22:49.400\njust passively using that service\nI guess is a better way to put it.\n\n383\n00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:53.228\nIs that, all of the stuff you have\nwith baby sitting in the Exchange,\n\n384\n00:22:53.228 --> 00:22:55.936\nand doing all that nastiness\nthat can go with it.\n\n385\n00:22:55.936 --> 00:22:58.712\nNo offense to anybody that\nmanages Exchange, of course.\n\n386\n00:22:58.712 --> 00:23:01.056\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And of course you should know better.\n\n387\n00:23:01.056 --> 00:23:06.020\n[LAUGH] Anybody that manages Exchange\nknows, all those things have now been\n\n388\n00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:11.540\noffloaded to someone else, and they\nwere the one that takes care of all that\n\n389\n00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:16.880\nstuff that goes with Exchange or whatever\nyou ask them to take care of in Exchange.\n\n390\n00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.960\nThat's something we'll get into in a bit.\n\n391\n00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.460\nAs far as these services go,\n\n392\n00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:25.270\nthere's different shades and\nvariations within them, but\n\n393\n00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:30.370\nwe haven't gotten to that level yet, so\nthat would be Software as a Service.\n\n394\n00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:35.340\nThen you have the other one, another on,\nInfrastructure as a Service.\n\n395\n00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:42.580\nThis one is also gaining ground and\nstream as we kinda look at it.\n\n396\n00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.220\nOne of the things we have when we look\nat infrastructure as a service would be\n\n397\n00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:46.840\nMicrosoft.\n\n398\n00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.140\nIn their case,\nof hosting an active directory.\n\n399\n00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:54.330\nMicrosoft can host active directory for\nyou now, and so that means that when they\n\n400\n00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:59.369\nhost active directory, the core of your\ninfrastructure for Microsoft domain\n\n401\n00:23:59.369 --> 00:24:04.482\nservices and all that, that's being\nhosted someplace else, so very much your\n\n402\n00:24:04.482 --> 00:24:09.402\ninfrastructure is being provided as\na service by somebody out in the cloud.\n\n403\n00:24:09.402 --> 00:24:12.659\nYou have a very minimal\nrequirement on your side and\n\n404\n00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:17.067\nthe rest of it just goes right out\nthere in the cloud and you're done.\n\n405\n00:24:17.067 --> 00:24:22.036\nSo, it's not the only thing that's\nput out there in the cloud as\n\n406\n00:24:22.036 --> 00:24:26.830\ninfrastructure, but\nit's one of the more common ones.\n\n407\n00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:30.460\nYou'll see stuff that kind of\nfits in infrastructure but\n\n408\n00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:34.520\nalso kind of fits in software as\na service, is stuff like anti-viruses\n\n409\n00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:39.110\nwill be put out there, sometimes you see\nsome firewall services put out there.\n\n410\n00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:44.240\nSo, you can have a lot of different\nthings put out there in the cloud and\n\n411\n00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.030\nbe provided infrastructure\nas a service if you want.\n\n412\n00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.620\nThere's a lot of providers for it.\n\n413\n00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:49.490\n>> Gotcha.\n\n414\n00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:51.420\nAnd then that last one we've got.\n\n415\n00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.660\n>> The last one would be\na platform as a service.\n\n416\n00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:58.770\nPlatform as a service,\nreally what it is is something where,\n\n417\n00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.160\njust think you're hosting\nvirtualization someplace else.\n\n418\n00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.860\nSomeones providing you the platform\nto virtualize or install stuff on.\n\n419\n00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.040\nThat's really what's happening there,\ntheir providing you just the basic stuff,\n\n420\n00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.560\nand you bolt on what you\nwant on top of that.\n\n421\n00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.890\nSo it's just that underlying platform or\nservice that they're giving you.\n\n422\n00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.500\nAnything else you bring to the table.\n\n423\n00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.120\nSo now we're saying instead of\njust having infrastructure or\n\n424\n00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.680\nsoftware out there,\nwe're stripping all that away and\n\n425\n00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:30.570\njust providing you the core stuff and\nthen you put on what you want on top.\n\n426\n00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:35.270\nAnd at that point you're the one,\naside from managing the cloud stuff,\n\n427\n00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:38.410\nyou're the one in charge of doing\nwhat you want to out there.\n\n428\n00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:41.920\n>> So with that one they're giving us the\nworst power, how much disk space we want,\n\n429\n00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.630\nhow much processor and\nRAM, stuff like that, but\n\n430\n00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:48.600\nwe're picking the actual software\nwe're running and the applications.\n\n431\n00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.760\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n432\n00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:55.670\nAnd it's a popular solution if\nyou're doing stuff like testing,\n\n433\n00:25:55.670 --> 00:26:00.400\nif you're doing stuff like doing\ndevelopment that the other ones may not\n\n434\n00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:07.060\nfit your particular situation, or\nyou just have a custom solution.\n\n435\n00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.729\nIf you have a completely\ncustom solution and\n\n436\n00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.620\ninfrastructures may not fit you,\nand software may not fit you.\n\n437\n00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:18.850\nIn fact, if you have to do some\nreally kind of exotic solution or\n\n438\n00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:22.690\nin some industry that's got some very\nunique legal requirements and all that.\n\n439\n00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:27.251\nYou may indeed be looking at platform as\na service, because it gives you the most\n\n440\n00:26:27.251 --> 00:26:31.828\nflexibility, but it also gives you a lot\nof potential pitfalls in there, too.\n\n441\n00:26:31.828 --> 00:26:36.751\nSo, we have to be aware of those and\nthat's something that the CCSP will teach\n\n442\n00:26:36.751 --> 00:26:41.933\nyou what to look for, so you're not going\nto fall into those holes along the way.\n\n443\n00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:42.820\n>> Very good.\n\n444\n00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.620\nAnd then you get down\nhere deployment models,\n\n445\n00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.890\nas if we didn't have enough models\nto deal with already we got more.\n\n446\n00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:52.200\n>> Yeah, those deployment models what\nthose go into is that the deployment\n\n447\n00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:58.570\nmodels are really talking back towards\nthe public and private, and the community.\n\n448\n00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:01.740\nAnd when we talk about those\nthose are the models and\n\n449\n00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.430\nhow they fit into your\ndeployment scenarios.\n\n450\n00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:07.860\nWell really one of the things that\nwe're gonna see in here is that, yeah,\n\n451\n00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:13.990\nyou've got those four things, but how do\nyou choose which one's the best for you?\n\n452\n00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:17.590\nWell which one you're gonna\ndeploy your environment into.\n\n453\n00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:24.054\nWell really that's kinda where a lot of\nthis course is going to take you through.\n\n454\n00:27:24.054 --> 00:27:28.929\nIt's gonna take you through hey let's\ncollect the information about what we\n\n455\n00:27:28.929 --> 00:27:30.310\nneed to be doing.\n\n456\n00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:32.450\nAnd then that can drive our solution.\n\n457\n00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:36.520\nOne of the things as far as choosing one\nof those models as the way we're going\n\n458\n00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.250\nto deploy our solution is if we\nlook at that public versus private,\n\n459\n00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:43.860\njust to kind of narrow it\ndown to the two easiest ones.\n\n460\n00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.840\nIf we may be leaning towards\na public solution and saying,\n\n461\n00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.210\nokay well it's great,\nwe have a public solution.\n\n462\n00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:56.920\nWe can go to someone like a Google or\na Microsoft or what have you.\n\n463\n00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:01.840\nGo to them and have them host everything\nand take care of all the babysitting and\n\n464\n00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.440\nall that stuff.\n\n465\n00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.110\nAnd we just have to sit back and\nreap the benefits.\n\n466\n00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:08.870\nAll I gotta do is write a check every so\noften to them, and hey, we're good.\n\n467\n00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.170\nWe don't have anything\nelse to worry about.\n\n468\n00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:18.050\nHowever, depending on your situation,\nyou could have some potential\n\n469\n00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:23.710\nproblems there that prevent you from going\nto a public solution to deploy into.\n\n470\n00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:27.450\nYou kind of actually mentioned it, Mike,\nin a little bit of your intro there is,\n\n471\n00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:30.250\nyou mentioned about\nthe forensics part of it.\n\n472\n00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:35.570\nForensics is an issue that an instant\nresponse would fit into that.\n\n473\n00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:41.450\nThose things could very well drive you\naway from going to a public hosting\n\n474\n00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:47.550\nsolution, because you cannot really\nhave the same time of instant handling.\n\n475\n00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:52.274\nAnd definitely not the same forensics\nsituation if you're doing a publicly\n\n476\n00:28:52.274 --> 00:28:55.533\nhosted cloud because\nthere's other people there.\n\n477\n00:28:55.533 --> 00:29:00.603\nSo that's something that could very\neasily say okay, your deployment was,\n\n478\n00:29:00.603 --> 00:29:05.829\nyou went through your checklist and\nit was steering towards a public solution,\n\n479\n00:29:05.829 --> 00:29:11.150\nthen boon, all of a sudden now it's a\nprivate solution because I can't do this.\n\n480\n00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:13.900\nAnd I've seen situations\nwhere that's happened.\n\n481\n00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:17.430\nWhere it was like people were kind of\nringing their hands, everything going,\n\n482\n00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:20.520\nokay, this is gonna be great, we're\ngoing to get to offload all this stuff.\n\n483\n00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.190\nAnd all this hardware and software,\ngonna have to put it someplace else.\n\n484\n00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.620\nBut then it turns out that no,\nno, that's not for you.\n\n485\n00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.300\nYou can't have a public solution.\n\n486\n00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.240\nYou're gonna have to build.\n\n487\n00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.700\nIf you want a cloud solution\nthat's going to be 100% entirely\n\n488\n00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.120\ninside your organization,\nyou have to buy all the stuff for it, and\n\n489\n00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.270\ntake care of it, and\ntrain people up on the stuff.\n\n490\n00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:45.430\nBecause you cannot go that way, because\nit would be way too much of a risk.\n\n491\n00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:47.950\n>> Yeah, and then I know another big thing\nwe've gotta worry about especially if\n\n492\n00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:52.180\nwe're going with public clouds is the fact\nthat we're not the only customer, right?\n\n493\n00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.140\nSo now all the sudden I've got\nthose issues to deal with.\n\n494\n00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:56.790\n>> Yeah, that's a big one,\n\n495\n00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:02.930\nis what you're talking about is the\nmultitenancy issues is the lingo for that.\n\n496\n00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:07.900\nIs when you have a public cloud, you do\nhave a situation where you have multiple\n\n497\n00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:13.210\ntenants and you could technically in\na private cloud have multiple tenants and\n\n498\n00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.080\nyou'd be totally fine in saying that.\n\n499\n00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.210\nBut what I wanna clarify that\nmulti tenant solution is saying\n\n500\n00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:21.549\nthat if you're hosting something.\n\n501\n00:30:22.550 --> 00:30:27.090\nExternally, your public cloud\nis gonna have a situation where\n\n502\n00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:31.010\nyou're not the only company or\nindividual hosting stuff there.\n\n503\n00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:34.630\nThere's other companies with\ndiffering requirements in there.\n\n504\n00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.090\nAnd you don't know who those are.\n\n505\n00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:41.820\nYou don't know how things are being\nprovisioned on the back end.\n\n506\n00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:46.090\nYou have to have confidence that all those\nthings are being handled on the up and\n\n507\n00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:51.210\nabove and being done correctly because if\nthey're not your stuff will be at risk.\n\n508\n00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:55.860\nAnd there's a lot of things\nthat you may not be seeing\n\n509\n00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.920\nright off the get go\njust by me saying that.\n\n510\n00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:04.060\nIf you start thinking about it,\nwhat happens if you are in a situation\n\n511\n00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:08.950\nwhere you're in a cloud provider where\nsomeone's using platform as a service,\n\n512\n00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:13.380\nand they're just using it for storage?\n\n513\n00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.180\nThey're just shoving stuff up there.\n\n514\n00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:20.320\nNow you happen to be using it to host your\nwhatever application that you've custom\n\n515\n00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.680\ndeveloped up there.\n\n516\n00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.980\nHowever, someone else, another tenant\nin there happens to be somebody that's\n\n517\n00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.450\nposting some sort of pirated software\n\n518\n00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:37.120\nor movies, or music,\nor something like that.\n\n519\n00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.080\nAnd they get busted, well\n\n520\n00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.930\nwhat happens to your stuff because one of\nthe things we learned in our forensics\n\n521\n00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:52.095\ncourse is if that,\nif there's subpoena's served.\n\n522\n00:31:52.095 --> 00:31:54.705\nThey're gonna come in and\nthey're gonna get their data but\n\n523\n00:31:54.705 --> 00:31:57.835\nthey're gonna try to limit their\ninformation to, their search warrant's\n\n524\n00:31:57.835 --> 00:32:03.055\ngonna say you're gonna try to limit\nit to just that particular subject.\n\n525\n00:32:03.055 --> 00:32:06.975\nBut there's nothing saying that they're\nnot going to grab some of yours.\n\n526\n00:32:06.975 --> 00:32:10.985\nThey have to limit that, but\nthey maybe very well grab some of yours.\n\n527\n00:32:10.985 --> 00:32:15.380\nNow they legally have to do\nsomething to protect that, but\n\n528\n00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.750\nif they do get some of your information.\n\n529\n00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:17.352\nNow what are you gonna do?\n\n530\n00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:21.571\nTell your customers, well,\nwe were hosting our stuff some place and\n\n531\n00:32:21.571 --> 00:32:26.860\nthere was a raid happened on our provider\nand all that, it's gonna reflect on you.\n\n532\n00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:31.450\nIt's definitely gonna reflect on you, and\nso that may not be a risk you wanna have,\n\n533\n00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:34.190\nbut that's probably a very minor issue.\n\n534\n00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:37.500\nThat's not something that you're probably\neven gonna hear about all that much.\n\n535\n00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.030\nBut, it's something that\ncould very well happen.\n\n536\n00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:44.660\nIt could very well be also can you\nguarantee the same level of security\n\n537\n00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.590\nout there too if you have\na multi tenant type situation.\n\n538\n00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:52.606\nSo, there's a lot of things that\ncould when you have a multi tenant\n\n539\n00:32:52.606 --> 00:32:56.063\nsituation that can definitely\nkind of come into the mix.\n\n540\n00:32:56.063 --> 00:32:59.813\nAnd that's not even\nmentioning other things that\n\n541\n00:32:59.813 --> 00:33:04.930\ncould potentially impact us on\nthe legal side, what about HYPA?\n\n542\n00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:06.620\nTalking healthcare stuff.\n\n543\n00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.380\nCan you really guarantee\non a public cloud, for\n\n544\n00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:14.280\nexample, can you guarantee 100% that that\n\n545\n00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:19.330\ninformation is gonna be safe from\nanyone else compromising it?\n\n546\n00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:24.279\nEven the people on the back end that are\nmaintain all the infrastructure that makes\n\n547\n00:33:24.279 --> 00:33:25.649\nthat cloud possible.\n\n548\n00:33:25.649 --> 00:33:29.350\nAre you sure that they're\nnot tampering with it, okay?\n\n549\n00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:32.053\nNow we know the old saying with security.\n\n550\n00:33:32.053 --> 00:33:34.020\nThere's no thing as a 100% security.\n\n551\n00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:36.330\nSo you know where that's going.\n\n552\n00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:41.880\nImmediately, if you can't say with\na high degree of confidence that\n\n553\n00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.220\nit's bulletproof.\n\n554\n00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.530\nYou better think twice about you're doing,\n\n555\n00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:51.020\nbecause you do not wanna be in\nthe crosshairs of a legal action.\n\n556\n00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.656\n>> No, at that point it's either\na private cloud or no cloud, I think.\n\n557\n00:33:53.656 --> 00:33:54.705\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\n\n558\n00:33:54.705 --> 00:33:57.506\nwell I'll tell you what,\nladies and gentlemen,\n\n559\n00:33:57.506 --> 00:33:59.450\na lot of great information there.\n\n560\n00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:03.249\nSome terminology to get us started\nthroughout these episodes that we're\n\n561\n00:34:03.249 --> 00:34:04.175\ngonna shoot for.\n\n562\n00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:06.292\nJust kinda get our feet wet, and\n\n563\n00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:10.300\nthe basics of what we mean by\nthe cloudism standardization.\n\n564\n00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.790\nSo as we talk about it\nwe're all on the same page.\n\n565\n00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:14.870\nAnd hopefully what you're whistle for\nmore to come.\n\n566\n00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:18.000\nBecause we got a lot more\ninformation coming your way.\n\n567\n00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.290\nBut for this episode we are out of time.\n\n568\n00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:23.090\nSo signing out for\nITProTV I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n569\n00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.420\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n570\n00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.378\n>> And

00:00:16.730\nI'm your host Mike Broderick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.042\nAnd we're gonna be covering our\narchitecture planning model.\n\n5\n00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:23.010\nSo Sean, what kind of good\nstuff do you have for us today?\n\n6\n00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.820\n>> Well, hopefully some good\ninteresting stuff right?\n\n7\n00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.214\n>> Always with you.\n[LAUGH]\n\n8\n00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:28.027\n>> Well I try.\n\n9\n00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:33.571\nWell, what we're gonna be doing is,\nobviously we're talking about the cloud\n\n10\n00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:39.210\nand just how to get things moved into\nthe cloud is really the objective here.\n\n11\n00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.290\nAs to get things moving in the cloud, but\nalso do it safely, securely, and just do\n\n12\n00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.410\nthings the right way with as little or\nas few hiccups as possible, right?\n\n13\n00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.798\nYou know there's always going to\nbe snags with any big project, but\n\n14\n00:00:52.798 --> 00:00:55.009\nyou can try to do your\nbest to minimize them.\n\n15\n00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:58.405\nAnd so what we're gonna be doing\nis we're going to be looking\n\n16\n00:00:58.405 --> 00:01:01.535\nat some of the first things and\ngetting that migration or\n\n17\n00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:06.400\nintegration going as the case may be by\nlooking at some models to get that done.\n\n18\n00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.660\nNow, what I want to say about\nthese models is that we have two\n\n19\n00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.090\nbig ones that we're gonna be looking at.\n\n20\n00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.660\nOne from the CSA,\nthe Cloud Security Alliance, and\n\n21\n00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.870\none from the Jericho Group,\na networking group out there.\n\n22\n00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.300\nThese are the two big ones.\n\n23\n00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.400\nAnd what these do is these define\nways that you can get your stuff\n\n24\n00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.460\nmoved in the cloud and determine what\nthe best solution is for you and\n\n25\n00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.660\nhow much security that you're gonna have\nto consider as part of your solution.\n\n26\n00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.750\nAnd that's a big important part\nbecause when you think about it,\n\n27\n00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.030\nyou're gonna move stuff into the cloud and\n\n28\n00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.170\nyou know that you're gonna have to\nhave some responsibility for security.\n\n29\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.680\nYou know it's gonna be there.\n\n30\n00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.780\nIf you don't then you probably\nshould not be starting this journey.\n\n31\n00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.010\nYou need to do some other things first.\n\n32\n00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.850\nSo we need to figure out what our\nsolution's gonna look like and\n\n33\n00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.820\nthen what type of security\nwe're gonna be responsible for\n\n34\n00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.690\nand what that picture's gonna look like so\nwe can kind of figure out\n\n35\n00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.778\nwhat type of mechanisms and policies and\nthings we have to put in place.\n\n36\n00:02:07.778 --> 00:02:10.880\nAnd this is also gonna help determine,\nwhen we start using these models,\n\n37\n00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.000\ngonna determine you know levels of risk,\nand stuff like that.\n\n38\n00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.690\nWe haven't talked about risk yet.\n\n39\n00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.970\nWe will be talking about risk,\nin a few episodes here actually.\n\n40\n00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.730\nWe talk about how you\nstart evaluating risk, and\n\n41\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.900\nwhat type of risk there actually exists.\n\n42\n00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.071\nSo these models start giving you kind of a\npicture instead of you just brainstorming\n\n43\n00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:33.229\nand just throwing stuff at a whiteboard,\nsee if it sticks, and\n\n44\n00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:34.613\nwe want to see where we are.\n\n45\n00:02:34.613 --> 00:02:37.780\nSo you have two models out here.\n\n46\n00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.610\nOne is a little more complex than\nthe other, but it does offer,\n\n47\n00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.100\neven though it's more complex,\ndoes offer a clearer picture.\n\n48\n00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.240\nBut it may be somewhat rigid\nin how it does things.\n\n49\n00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.130\nThe other one's a little more wide open,\nbut it doesn't give you so\n\n50\n00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.760\nmuch guidance, but it helps, it gives you\nsome, but doesn't give you all of it.\n\n51\n00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.730\nSo what you need to know before you\nget into these cloud models is,\n\n52\n00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.780\nyou kinda need to know what it is, that\nyou are gonna be involving the cloud with.\n\n53\n00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.740\nIs it gonna be a new application,\n\n54\n00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.900\nare you gonna be hosting\na certain platform out there?\n\n55\n00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.500\nWhat are you actually gonna be hosting\nat the end of the day in the cloud?\n\n56\n00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.070\nWhy do you want that solution?\n\n57\n00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.550\nIt shouldn't be just, hey,\nI want the cloud, okay.\n\n58\n00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.235\nWhy do you want the cloud?\n\n59\n00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:26.677\n[LAUGH] It's not just a matter of-\n>> Cuz the CIO told me it was cool and\n\n60\n00:03:26.677 --> 00:03:27.654\nhe wants to be in the cloud.\n\n61\n00:03:27.654 --> 00:03:29.970\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's not accounted for\n\n62\n00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.700\nin the models.\n\n63\n00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.830\nInterestingly enough, it has to be\nreally a lot more clear than that.\n\n64\n00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.125\nWhat I would tell you is just to\nkind of focus your thinking here,\n\n65\n00:03:43.125 --> 00:03:48.500\nis just think of going into these models\nstart thinking of maybe your company,\n\n66\n00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.040\nand if your company is\nusing the cloud hey great.\n\n67\n00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.220\nIf not, that's fine too but think of your\nown company or think of a company and\n\n68\n00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.830\nthink of what type of solution you may\nhave and you want to move into the cloud.\n\n69\n00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.410\nNow I'm positioning it that way and\ntelling you kinda to get a vision in your\n\n70\n00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.460\nhead of what you want because it will help\nyou understand these models a bit better.\n\n71\n00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.424\nI'm gonna leave it up to you to determine\nwhat type of solution you're gonna move\n\n72\n00:04:20.424 --> 00:04:21.455\ninto the cloud.\n\n73\n00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:26.051\nBecause I want you to pick something in\nyour mind that you are familiar with and\n\n74\n00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:29.234\nthat you really know,\nif that's Active Directory,\n\n75\n00:04:29.234 --> 00:04:34.682\nif that's some database application, if\nthat's some virtualization-type scenario,\n\n76\n00:04:34.682 --> 00:04:37.964\nif that's just a storage scenario or\nall of the above.\n\n77\n00:04:37.964 --> 00:04:42.926\nI want you to determine what it is that\nyou wanna move in the cloud, and so\n\n78\n00:04:42.926 --> 00:04:48.139\nonce you've got a good feeling for\nthat in your mind, start figuring out,\n\n79\n00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.480\nthe type of things that are part\nof that solution, right now.\n\n80\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.870\nWhen you look at something\nlike Active Directory,\n\n81\n00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.660\nstart thinking about maintenance\nrequirements, security requirements,\n\n82\n00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.090\nlegal requirements,\nall those things go in.\n\n83\n00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.800\nIf you're moving data, same thing.\n\n84\n00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.866\nWhat type of maintenance do you have,\nhow often do you have to back that up,\n\n85\n00:05:06.866 --> 00:05:09.580\nwhat type of insert response do\nyou have to have in place for\n\n86\n00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.810\nthat, what type of forensic\nissues do you have to deal with?\n\n87\n00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.830\nWhat type of disclosure issues and\n\n88\n00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.650\nconfidentiality and\nintegrity issues do you have to deal with?\n\n89\n00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.280\nAvailability issues, the CIA triad.\n\n90\n00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.702\nYou know just go right down the list.\n\n91\n00:05:24.702 --> 00:05:31.740\nTalk to the lawyers, are they gonna have a\nsay in this as far as what's gonna happen?\n\n92\n00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.900\nThen think about stuff like encryption,\ncould even be part of it.\n\n93\n00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.300\nWell, encryption's a big\npart of your solution.\n\n94\n00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.903\nOkay, well that should\nbe a line item in there.\n\n95\n00:05:38.903 --> 00:05:45.194\nBut really start thinking about whatever\nsolution it is that you are familiar with,\n\n96\n00:05:45.194 --> 00:05:50.597\njust pick something that you're\nfamiliar with at an enterprise level,\n\n97\n00:05:50.597 --> 00:05:55.735\nand think about the types of things\nthat that solution that you have,\n\n98\n00:05:55.735 --> 00:06:01.782\nthings that you have to maintain if you're\ngonna move it into a cloud situation.\n\n99\n00:06:01.782 --> 00:06:05.790\nAnd if you don't know what all the issues\nare, list as many as you can think of.\n\n100\n00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.930\nIt's better to have them\nthere on paper and say, okay,\n\n101\n00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.430\nwell I didn't really\nneed to consider that.\n\n102\n00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.880\nThat's something that's in\na non-cloud environment.\n\n103\n00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.291\nOkay, fine.\nAt least you made the determination that's\n\n104\n00:06:16.291 --> 00:06:17.569\nnot in a cloud environment.\n\n105\n00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:20.376\nI'd rather have that than say,\noh well, I don't know so\n\n106\n00:06:20.376 --> 00:06:23.431\nI'm just going to list these ones and\nthen forget something.\n\n107\n00:06:23.431 --> 00:06:27.645\nSo get something that you're familiar with\ncuz that's the way it would actually work\n\n108\n00:06:27.645 --> 00:06:31.389\nin the real world before you even went\nto these models, they'd call you in as\n\n109\n00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.665\na subject matter expert on a solution\nthat you are familiar with and\n\n110\n00:06:34.665 --> 00:06:36.630\nask you what type of issues do you have.\n\n111\n00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:37.750\nYou would know them.\n\n112\n00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.510\nAnd then you'd start taking those\nthings over to the models to figure\n\n113\n00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.760\nout what your solution's gonna look like.\n\n114\n00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.220\n>> Now is this something\nthat gets set in stone or\n\n115\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.930\nwould these models be pretty flexible?\n\n116\n00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.250\nLike if we start out with one and\n\n117\n00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.460\nwe decide that maybe we'd be better\noff following the other model or\n\n118\n00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.890\nmaybe even taking the best of both and\nusing that for us?\n\n119\n00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.093\n>> You could do any of that.\n\n120\n00:06:58.093 --> 00:07:05.315\nYou shouldn't be so locked in with\nit that you can't adapt to change.\n\n121\n00:07:05.315 --> 00:07:11.832\nSo, if you find out that you're a little\ndifferent than what model is proposing,\n\n122\n00:07:11.832 --> 00:07:17.970\nthen fine, you should still be able to\nuse the model to give you a clear picture\n\n123\n00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:23.374\nof where you're going and\nwhat type of issues need to be addressed.\n\n124\n00:07:23.374 --> 00:07:25.152\nThat's really what we're looking at.\n\n125\n00:07:25.152 --> 00:07:30.098\nI could personally care less if you\nstick 100% by the model or not.\n\n126\n00:07:30.098 --> 00:07:34.100\nAnd that's not just to be somebody\ncallous about it and say, man,\n\n127\n00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.050\nI don't care what you're gonna do.\n\n128\n00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.334\nNo, it's that these models, you should at\nleast be able to look at the models and\n\n129\n00:07:40.334 --> 00:07:44.556\nsay, okay, even if you don't match\nthem 100%, you should be able to say,\n\n130\n00:07:44.556 --> 00:07:48.680\nokay, well, these issues roughly fit\nin this area or this area or this area.\n\n131\n00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.243\nAnd it gives you an idea\nof how much security and\n\n132\n00:07:51.243 --> 00:07:55.779\nwhat types of countermeasures you may need\nto look at and what type of things you may\n\n133\n00:07:55.779 --> 00:07:59.790\nneed to do in your ultimate design to\nget this secure and safe solution and\n\n134\n00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.053\nbest solution for your specific needs.\n\n135\n00:08:02.053 --> 00:08:06.707\nSo something I could relate that to then\nmight be like to OSI model is a model that\n\n136\n00:08:06.707 --> 00:08:07.235\nwe use.\n\n137\n00:08:07.235 --> 00:08:09.150\nTCP/IP follows the model, but not exactly.\n\n138\n00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.360\nIt's doesn't have every\nlayer represented in there.\n\n139\n00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.910\nBut that OSI model was\ntheir starting point and\n\n140\n00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.960\nwhat they're used to model the TCP/IP.\n\n141\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.570\nProtocol on this would be\nkinda similar to that then.\n\n142\n00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:22.536\nDude, you just mentioned OSI,\nhalf these people's eyes glazed over.\n\n143\n00:08:22.536 --> 00:08:26.500\n[LAUGH] But yeah it's,\n\n144\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.180\nI would say that's a pretty fair\nassessment to say, is that OSI is\n\n145\n00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.180\nis close,\npeople followed it kind of close but\n\n146\n00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:41.870\nnot quite, so\nyeah kind of the same type of idea.\n\n147\n00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.410\nIf you discard the other stuff with\nOSI and look at just from that\n\n148\n00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:50.910\nviewpoint yeah that would be a good\napproximation of what we're talking here.\n\n149\n00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.860\nSo where do we start, I guess the first\nthing we need to know then is\n\n150\n00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.120\nwhat these models entail so we can try to\nfigure out which one best suits our needs.\n\n151\n00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.820\n>> Yes, so that's really it.\n\n152\n00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.930\nSo what I am going to go through here\nis I'm gonna go through two models.\n\n153\n00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:07.930\nOne is the CSI, CSA reference model.\n\n154\n00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.390\nThis is a crime how bad\nsome people do that.\n\n155\n00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.500\nSo, but we've gotta talk about\nthe CSA reference model,\n\n156\n00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.030\nthe cloud security alliance\nreference model and\n\n157\n00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.660\nthen we're gonna look at what they\ncall the Jericho cloud cube model.\n\n158\n00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.320\nThat sounds kind of nice doesn't it?\n\n159\n00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.280\n>> That's the one I'm going with.\n\n160\n00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.350\n>> It sounds, you know, like you said like\na rubix cube type successor type thing.\n\n161\n00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.370\nRemember, when you look at this model,\nlook at these layers,\n\n162\n00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.740\na very important thing to keep in mind\nis that as you move up the layers\n\n163\n00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.980\nwho does what dictates who's\ngonna handle security.\n\n164\n00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.170\nIf you're talking about handling\nthe solution on your own\n\n165\n00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:48.350\nas you move from the bottom\nall the way towards the top.\n\n166\n00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.320\nThe further up you move and\ndecide to handle more and\n\n167\n00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.300\nmore of that, that means the more\nsecurity you're responsible for.\n\n168\n00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.810\nSo if you're assigned to take care of\neverything from the bottom, all the way up\n\n169\n00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:03.780\nto a layer or two below the top,\nthen that means that that's all secured,\n\n170\n00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.850\nyou have now said you are going\nto be responsible for, okay.\n\n171\n00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.130\nNow, on the other hand, if you're saying\nthat the CSP is gonna be responsible for\n\n172\n00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.990\neverything from the bottom to just\na layer or two below the top,\n\n173\n00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.680\nthen you're saying they're responsible for\nthat instead of you.\n\n174\n00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.440\nSo you do have to remember to keep that\nin mind when you're doing this is that\n\n175\n00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.910\nthat's what that translates to,\nand you start saying okay,\n\n176\n00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.020\nwell I've mapped out my application and\nmy solution.\n\n177\n00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.680\nWhen I mapped this out,\nthis is what I'm saying.\n\n178\n00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.640\nThey are responsible for\nwhat I'm responsible for.\n\n179\n00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.530\nAnd you really need to\nthink things through.\n\n180\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:44.380\nAnd do remember when you at this whole\nthing, and I'm gonna zoom in on this for\n\n181\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.140\nyou so again, don't freak out too much.\n\n182\n00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.010\nIs it doesn't account for for\neverything, and you know,\n\n183\n00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:55.390\nsome of the stuff that hasn't been\ndiscussed yet, really in depth, but\n\n184\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.350\nwe're getting there is things\nlike the legal issues.\n\n185\n00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.270\nThe legal issues are not discussed here.\n\n186\n00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:05.170\nI mean you can kind of see some\nplaces where they could creep in, but\n\n187\n00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:06.840\nthat's another issue\nthat has to be addressed.\n\n188\n00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.890\nThis is just talking about the technical\nside of things, the application,\n\n189\n00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:15.070\nthe infrastructure, whatever it is\nyou choose to push towards the cloud.\n\n190\n00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:19.080\nSo we're going to look at\nthat left-hand block there,\n\n191\n00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.740\nthat's the actual description\nof what things are,\n\n192\n00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.400\nAPIs and all that, and\nthen what we have on the right-hand side,\n\n193\n00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.780\nwell I guess I should say in the middle\nnot the green boxes, is just examples\n\n194\n00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:38.670\nof what those various services are, so\nyou kinda know what we're looking at.\n\n195\n00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.840\nSo let me zoom in on here for you.\n\n196\n00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.710\nAnd so what we see here is like a, so\nI can zoom out just a little bit so\n\n197\n00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.045\nyou can put put it in\ncontext a bit better.\n\n198\n00:11:49.045 --> 00:11:52.685\nSo you can see at the bottom,\nfacilities obviously.\n\n199\n00:11:52.685 --> 00:11:55.105\nYou know, where you're housing everything.\n\n200\n00:11:55.105 --> 00:11:57.975\nBut as you move up you see your hardware,\nyour straction,\n\n201\n00:11:57.975 --> 00:12:03.125\nstuff like your virtualization,\nyou know virtualization all that stuff.\n\n202\n00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:09.270\nThen you see your connectivity services,\nyour networking and all that good stuff.\n\n203\n00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:13.740\nAPI's for plug it in to the operating\nsystems in the hardware.\n\n204\n00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:14.780\nAnd as you move up,\n\n205\n00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:20.200\nyou can see integration in middleware, you\ncan see the things they have put there,\n\n206\n00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.640\ndata basing, messaging, and\nthen we just keep going up.\n\n207\n00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.430\nThis stuff up top, this would be\nvery much application related.\n\n208\n00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.650\nYou know application related stuff.\n\n209\n00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.370\nYou can see we have data,\n\n210\n00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:35.550\nmetadata content, you're very\nmuch seeing stuff at that level,\n\n211\n00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.640\nyour software as a service which is what\nwe have there: our software as a service.\n\n212\n00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.090\nRemember when we were talking about an\nexample of software as a service would be\n\n213\n00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.770\nstuff like our email, well that would\ndefinitely fit into it because we look at\n\n214\n00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:53.390\nall the stuff from that\nthat dark purple box down.\n\n215\n00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.000\nEverything from there down,\nthat would be, in fact,\n\n216\n00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.420\nthat purple layer it says,\nwell that was messaging, so email.\n\n217\n00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.190\nSo for talk or something like exchange or\n\n218\n00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.730\nGmail from Google's side,\nthat would be there.\n\n219\n00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:13.550\nAll the stuff up top in these orange area\nthat would be all your client side stuff.\n\n220\n00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:18.340\nYour mailboxes that you're hosting\nlocally or your PST files or\n\n221\n00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.080\nwhatever you're downloading locally,\napplications,\n\n222\n00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.320\nhow you're presenting that\nto the actual end user.\n\n223\n00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.880\nAll that stuff would be there.\n\n224\n00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.190\nSo that's what we see kind\nof how things break down.\n\n225\n00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:34.230\nSo when you're looking at this model,\nI told you at the beginning of this whole\n\n226\n00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:39.200\nthing, I was telling you think of\na solution that you're familiar with.\n\n227\n00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.820\nAnd I was trying not to\nbe too specific about it.\n\n228\n00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:48.370\nI was just trying to say choose\nsomething that you are familiar with it.\n\n229\n00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:53.160\nYou have really good knowledge of, because\nI want you to use the example that you're\n\n230\n00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.050\nfamiliar within the real world,\nand know the intimate details of.\n\n231\n00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:00.850\nSo you can pick out these little things\nand see, okay yeah this would map here and\n\n232\n00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:01.800\nhere and here.\n\n233\n00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.780\nAnd if I want to push\nthis out to the Cloud.\n\n234\n00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.630\nI could line up these things on\na technical level and say okay,\n\n235\n00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.580\nwell those things are available and\nI'm okay at handing that\n\n236\n00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.460\noff at least from a technical level\nI'm okay at handing that off.\n\n237\n00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.165\nWe haven't talked about the legal side.\n\n238\n00:14:17.165 --> 00:14:21.695\nThat just hasn't crept into this yet and\nreally made it's big appearance yet.\n\n239\n00:14:21.695 --> 00:14:26.245\nIt's been talked about but\nhasn't made it's big deal in here yet.\n\n240\n00:14:26.245 --> 00:14:29.635\nSo the CSA model gives you a very very\n\n241\n00:14:29.635 --> 00:14:32.795\ngood way of visualizing how\nthings should be laid out.\n\n242\n00:14:32.795 --> 00:14:39.480\nLike I said, keep in mind, this is kind\nof the us versus them type of situation.\n\n243\n00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:42.550\nYou know,\nwhat are you gonna retain control of and\n\n244\n00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.670\nwhat are you gonna give control to them.\n\n245\n00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.950\nBecause that determines\nwho's gonna handle security.\n\n246\n00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:49.710\nWho's responsible for what.\n\n247\n00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.890\nAnd as we'll see later on,\n\n248\n00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:55.960\nwho handles what's also good definitely\nhave impact on the legal side of things.\n\n249\n00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.750\nYou know.\nAbsolutely gonna have impact on legal side\n\n250\n00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.560\nof things as well as\na definitely impact the risk.\n\n251\n00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:06.550\nSo That's the CSA model,\nso hopefully looking at\n\n252\n00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:10.660\nthat from that angle would give\nyou a good way to visualize stuff.\n\n253\n00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.330\nBut as we said, the gain of it,\nthis isn't the only way of doing things.\n\n254\n00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.340\nThis is just one way of looking at it.\n\n255\n00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:23.950\nThis gives you a really kind of a real\nkind of technical look at things.\n\n256\n00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.880\nHowever, we do have another model and\n\n257\n00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.710\nthat is this one,\nthis is the Jericho Cloud Cube Model.\n\n258\n00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:36.670\nNow this one looks kind of interesting\nwhen you get down to it but, really,\n\n259\n00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:40.780\nit looks interesting, but\nafter you kind of get past the well,\n\n260\n00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:45.760\nit looks interesting, but\nwhat the heck is that actually saying?\n\n261\n00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.930\nI don't know.\n\n262\n00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:47.430\n[LAUGH] No, no.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n263\n00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:48.906\n>> [LAUGH] Well, what is this saying?\n\n264\n00:15:48.906 --> 00:15:52.664\nYou're gonna have to do some visualization\n\n265\n00:15:52.664 --> 00:15:57.651\nin your head here a bit.\nFirst of all, we can see that we see we\n\n266\n00:15:57.651 --> 00:16:02.729\nhave a cube in there, of course.\nYou can see we have eight blocks\n\n267\n00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:07.400\nin there that make up the cube.\nWhat we have on the, at the front,\n\n268\n00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:11.636\nwe have the light blue,\nin the back we have the purple part of it.\n\n269\n00:16:11.636 --> 00:16:14.576\nWhat you wanna look at is that when you\n\n270\n00:16:14.576 --> 00:16:17.900\nare talking everything\nin that light blue cube,\n\n271\n00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.480\nthat means everything's\nkept fully in house.\n\n272\n00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:26.500\nAs you move towards that purple cube, and\nget fully encompassed by that purple cube.\n\n273\n00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.820\nThat means everything's being\npushed completely to the outside.\n\n274\n00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:30.360\nOkay.\n\n275\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.790\nSo that represents your two extremes,\nif you will.\n\n276\n00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.580\nOkay.\nNow when we start breaking it down,\n\n277\n00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:43.469\nyou could see how the perimeterized and\nde-perimeterized on the bottom right.\n\n278\n00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.000\nSide there.\n\n279\n00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.565\nAnd yes,\nthat is spelled in the British way.\n\n280\n00:16:48.565 --> 00:16:51.365\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I did not spell it that way.\n\n281\n00:16:51.365 --> 00:16:52.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n282\n00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.230\njust trying to give you guys culture.\n\n283\n00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:55.790\nSo.\nBut\n\n284\n00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.260\nwhat that is when we say perimeterize or\nde-perimeterized, when you say it's\n\n285\n00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.295\nperimeterized that means you're within\nthe control of your organization.\n\n286\n00:17:04.295 --> 00:17:06.979\nDe-perimeterized means\nyou're pushing it outside.\n\n287\n00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.080\nSo that's what that means you're\nstarting to break down the barriers\n\n288\n00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.780\nof your organization you're\nputting on the outside.\n\n289\n00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.500\nThen we look across the front and\nwe see proprietary versus open,\n\n290\n00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:21.160\nwell I think that one kind of\nexplains itself really but\n\n291\n00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.683\njust to kind of make sure we're clear on\nit, proprietary and open proprietary and\n\n292\n00:17:24.683 --> 00:17:28.260\nclosed-source, something that\nwe've developed internally,\n\n293\n00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:30.420\nwe don't have access to,\nit's closed source.\n\n294\n00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.030\nWe'll look at it that way.\n\n295\n00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.240\nThe open is the Open Source stuff.\n\n296\n00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.980\nAnd then the internal, external, that is\nyou know who's hosting internally, or\n\n297\n00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:39.260\nexternally.\n\n298\n00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.550\nNow as you move through those cubes,\n\n299\n00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:47.170\nyou will fall within some\nmixture of those three elements.\n\n300\n00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:49.350\nYou pick any cube on there,\n\n301\n00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.640\nyou're gonna get something that is\nbecomes from being very closed.\n\n302\n00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.070\nIf you look at that bottom cube,\nthe light blue one,\n\n303\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:00.740\nit's hosting internally,\nit's proprietary, and it's perimeterised.\n\n304\n00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.940\nIt means it's right, it's in control\nof an organization, it's fully,\n\n305\n00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:09.520\nwe're maintaining control of it,\nit's a solution that we built.\n\n306\n00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.200\nIt's all internal, makes sense.\n\n307\n00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.899\nIt's the nice secure solution,\nis that where you wanna have stuff?\n\n308\n00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.450\nAnd then you can look at\nthe purple at the top.\n\n309\n00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.370\nIt's de-perimeterized,\nit's open source and it's external.\n\n310\n00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.380\nIt's completely on the opposite extreme.\n\n311\n00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.150\nIt's outside your organization.\n\n312\n00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.160\nIt's hosted by someone on the outside.\n\n313\n00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:38.040\nIt's open source,\nit's got all that stuff going for it.\n\n314\n00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.300\nSo what you're going to do,\nwhat you're going to ask yourself\n\n315\n00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.610\nis you can actually combine\nthis with the other model.\n\n316\n00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:47.590\nThe other model, the CSA model,\nthat's all technical oriented.\n\n317\n00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:52.710\nThis one is gonna help you look\nat what you currently have,\n\n318\n00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:57.110\nwhere you actually fit, and\nsee where you're actually trying to go.\n\n319\n00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:03.120\nYou can start figuring out, most places\nare going to start somewhere inside\n\n320\n00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.920\nthat light blue cube, and they're going\nto move out, if you will, from there.\n\n321\n00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.850\nIf you kinda visualize this in 3D,\nyou can kinda see that the arrows\n\n322\n00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:13.350\nare going to be pointing out in some,\nand in some way from that.\n\n323\n00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.940\nSo you're gonna be moving to\none of those other cubes.\n\n324\n00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.280\nEither it's a lateral move.\n\n325\n00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:17.950\nDiagonal.\n\n326\n00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.160\nOr you're gonna move it straight back.\n\n327\n00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.100\nYou gonna move it some way like that.\n\n328\n00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.200\nAnd that's gonna determine\nhow much you are off loading.\n\n329\n00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.070\nAnd what type of solution\nyou're gonna have.\n\n330\n00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:31.840\nI mean if you look at this really you\ncould get to a solution where you can\n\n331\n00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:36.850\nfind a mix where you have internal open\nsource solution, you can have that.\n\n332\n00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.600\nYou can have some really\ninteresting combinations here.\n\n333\n00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.680\nYou could have something that or there's\nways you can actually have something\n\n334\n00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:50.190\nthat is outsourced but you're doing it in\nsuch a way that it's controlled by you.\n\n335\n00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.410\nYou look at outsourced but\nit's perimeterized.\n\n336\n00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:57.470\nWhat you're saying is you might go out out\nto someone like, I know IBM does this.\n\n337\n00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.010\nIBM's got a situation where\nyou can outsource it,\n\n338\n00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:04.360\nbut what will happens if you outsource it,\nbut they host it within your company.\n\n339\n00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.850\nSo it's within your perimeter, but\nyou're outsourcing to someone else.\n\n340\n00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.130\nSo they're bring it inside\nwith open source solutions.\n\n341\n00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.399\nIBM likes open source solutions.\n\n342\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.080\nWhat you're doing is you're going to, or\nthey like to have, they do have a lot of\n\n343\n00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.600\nopen source solutions they do have\nsome closed source too let's be fair.\n\n344\n00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:27.640\nBut you can go to them and say well\nI want to have a data center on-site,\n\n345\n00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.040\nI can't have it hosted externally,\nand IBM can come in and\n\n346\n00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:36.020\nsay well yeah we can do that and\nthey can bring in their own people,\n\n347\n00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:40.560\nset up a data center and have their\npeople and their stuff all set up and\n\n348\n00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.980\nbe handling it for you, but\non site within your own network.\n\n349\n00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:52.050\nSo now you have a situation where you have\noutsourced open source but perimiterised.\n\n350\n00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:59.990\nAnd just by the way, it's not to say, well\nokay, IBM, well I'm a big fan of them.\n\n351\n00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:05.010\nYeah, I am a big fan of them, but\nIBM just one I do know that does that,\n\n352\n00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.100\nbut not the only one that does that.\n\n353\n00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.450\nThere are other companies.\n\n354\n00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:13.234\nI don't think Amazon or,\nwhat's the other one, or\n\n355\n00:21:13.234 --> 00:21:17.362\nGoogle provides that,\nI don't know about Microsoft but\n\n356\n00:21:17.362 --> 00:21:22.694\nthere are several people that do provide\nsolutions like that where you can\n\n357\n00:21:22.694 --> 00:21:28.112\nget their people where you're outsourcing\nthem, but they will come in and\n\n358\n00:21:28.112 --> 00:21:32.850\ndo everything inside of your\norganization which is kind of neat.\n\n359\n00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:38.200\nIf you're an organization that\nneeds a private cloud solution, but\n\n360\n00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.580\nyou don't have the expertise really to,\nor don't wanna develop the expertise\n\n361\n00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.930\ninternally to do that,\nthen there's a solution for you.\n\n362\n00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:46.980\nYou're not stuck.\n\n363\n00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.210\nYou 're not saying, well,\nI gotta develop all these things and\n\n364\n00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.470\ntrain all these people,\nand that's a huge expense.\n\n365\n00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:57.000\nYou might just say, well,\nI'm gonna outsource it but,\n\n366\n00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.970\nI'm gonna still outsource it, but\nmaintain a private cloud system, so\n\n367\n00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:05.540\nyou can do that, and that has been done,\nI do know of a solution like that.\n\n368\n00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:09.150\nI choose IBM because I've seen\nthem do a solution like that.\n\n369\n00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:13.030\n>> Now,\nwhen we look at these kind of models,\n\n370\n00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.230\nmight we have a different model for\ndifferent services?\n\n371\n00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.470\nLike we might go one route\nwith our authentication.\n\n372\n00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.820\nBut then a different\nroute with our messaging.\n\n373\n00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.680\n>> You could.\nThat would probably more on the CSA model\n\n374\n00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.690\nthat it would be here.\n\n375\n00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:32.790\nYou could use this one for that to help\nvisualize that and see where you're going.\n\n376\n00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.260\nBut you'd probably be doing the really\n\n377\n00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.250\non the ground planning with\nthe CSA model for that.\n\n378\n00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:42.180\nBut yeah, there are some situation\nreduce service as specific one.\n\n379\n00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:46.990\nAnd that would be the hybrid model that\nwe talked about is that you're mixing\n\n380\n00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.580\ntogether different solutions.\n\n381\n00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.320\n>> And then I'm assuming there's probably\nother models that are out there,\n\n382\n00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.720\nbut these are the two that\nare focused on on our exam.\n\n383\n00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.550\n>> Yeah, there are other ones out there,\nto be sure.\n\n384\n00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.280\nYeah.\nBut these are the ones you gonna see on\n\n385\n00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.290\nthe actual exam.\n\n386\n00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:06.950\nThat their that they spent time you know,\nkind of a you know, walking through.\n\n387\n00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:11.150\nSo, you're gonna wanna spend\ntime figuring these out.\n\n388\n00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:15.984\nNow, if it's your first time encountering\nthese, and the first time you see them,\n\n389\n00:23:15.984 --> 00:23:19.380\nI know first time I saw was\nlike Jericho cloud cube model.\n\n390\n00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:20.330\nThe CSA.\n\n391\n00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.170\nThe CSA.\n\n392\n00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:25.650\nCloud reference model, I was like,\nI don't wanna do this anymore.\n\n393\n00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.660\nThat was kind of my feeling\nwhen I got into it,\n\n394\n00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.408\nbut when you look at it,\nthey actually do make sense.\n\n395\n00:23:33.408 --> 00:23:38.600\nI tried to regurgitate it and explain\n\n396\n00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:43.760\nit in such a way that it really kind of\ncrystallizes it, but you can find very\n\n397\n00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.950\nhefty amounts of documentation on both of\nthese if you really wanna get into it.\n\n398\n00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:52.150\nThe Jericho Networking Association or\nwhatever they're calling themselves,\n\n399\n00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:56.640\nthey actually have a bunch\nof white papers on this so\n\n400\n00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.430\nif you really wanna get down into it and\nfigure out how to\n\n401\n00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:05.620\nget into all the nitty-gritty of how this\ncube model works, they've got it for you.\n\n402\n00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:10.320\nJust like the CSA has pages\nafter pages after pages of\n\n403\n00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.530\nstuff on their specific model.\n\n404\n00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.320\nBut, yeah, there are other models.\n\n405\n00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:19.470\nNow, for some industries, they may even\nhave specific models for those industries.\n\n406\n00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:21.070\nThat does happen now and then.\n\n407\n00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.130\nSo do be aware of that.\n\n408\n00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.160\nBut these are two that get you going and\n\n409\n00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.820\nif you look at it in the right\nway can get you pretty far.\n\n410\n00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:28.850\n>> Very good.\nAll right, Sean.\n\n411\n00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.030\nA lot of good information there on\nour architecture planning models.\n\n412\n00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.630\nAnything else we wanna\nthrow into this episode?\n\n413\n00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:39.570\n>> Like I said, the best way to\nlearn these models is to really\n\n414\n00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:44.050\nget in an environment that you know.\n\n415\n00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:49.580\nAnd think about how you would\nactually outsource it and plan it.\n\n416\n00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:50.730\nLook at different scenarios and\n\n417\n00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.950\nthink about how that would\nactually impact things.\n\n418\n00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.620\nThat's really the best way.\n\n419\n00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.540\nJust looking at these models and\nsaying, okay, I kinda get it.\n\n420\n00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:02.810\nThat's helpful but, being able to actually\nvisualize the solution will help you out\n\n421\n00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.060\nmuch, much more.\n\n422\n00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:04.600\n>> Very good.\n\n423\n00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.480\nAll right.\nWell ladies and\n\n424\n00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.920\ngentlemen, that's gonna do it for\nthis episode.\n\n425\n00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.720\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n426\n00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.620\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n427\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.867\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n428\n00:25:13.867 --> 00:25:19.490\n>>

00:00:15.794\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr.\n\n4\n00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:19.166\nSean Oriyano and\nwe're going to be discussing security.\n\n5\n00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:21.140\nOr, at least we're going to start\ngetting into security in the cloud.\n\n6\n00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.210\nSean, it's a pretty big topic when\nit comes to the could, right?\n\n7\n00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.831\n>> Oh yes.\n\n8\n00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:27.207\nIt is a very, very, very big issue so\n\n9\n00:00:27.207 --> 00:00:30.910\nwe're definitely gonna get\nstarted on that cuz we've.\n\n10\n00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.200\nWe kind of danced around it a bit you know\nwe talked about the models you know, so\n\n11\n00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.580\nwe're going to start rolling in\nsome security issues here and\n\n12\n00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.170\nyour going to hear a lot of recurring\nthemes as we go through this.\n\n13\n00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.563\nAnd that's something for you guys to keep\nin mind when you watch this, is that,\n\n14\n00:00:46.563 --> 00:00:50.660\nyou're gonna hear certain things\ncome up again and again and again.\n\n15\n00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.800\nJust remember it's not just necessarily\na repeat of the information,\n\n16\n00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.800\nit's just giving that information but\na different context.\n\n17\n00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.750\nSo there's several things that will show\nup, but they'll show up in several areas,\n\n18\n00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.500\nbut they're being applied in\na slightly different way.\n\n19\n00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.380\nI do want you to remember that.\n\n20\n00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.700\nAlso remember when you're\ngoing through this, and\n\n21\n00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.010\nyou're listening to all this,\nI was telling you in the previous episode\n\n22\n00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.180\nto visualize a solution\nthat you are familiar with.\n\n23\n00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.460\nSome environment from the real world.\n\n24\n00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.650\nI would advise you to really\nget the most out of it.\n\n25\n00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.590\nStart thinking about that solution and\nkind of like modeling that and\n\n26\n00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.340\nthinking about this as you go through it.\n\n27\n00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.140\nLike I said, I'm gonna leave that up to\nyou to decide what that solution's gonna\n\n28\n00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.250\nbe, but I kind of want you to\nbe thinking about that and\n\n29\n00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.260\napplying this guidance to it to\nsee how it shapes your decision.\n\n30\n00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.450\nAnd it'll really,\nreally give you more bang for\n\n31\n00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.790\nthe buck at this instead of me\njust talking in an abstract way.\n\n32\n00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.460\nI'm gonna give you examples from the real\nworld things that I've encountered, but\n\n33\n00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.140\nalso think about it in context\nof stuff like that you've done.\n\n34\n00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.160\nIf you already have a cloud\nsolution it may actually help you\n\n35\n00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.270\nfigure out how they got to where they\nare or maybe help you look at things and\n\n36\n00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.877\nsay well,\nmaybe we're missing something too.\n\n37\n00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:09.357\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hopefully you don't have too much\n\n38\n00:02:09.357 --> 00:02:10.025\nof that.\n\n39\n00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:11.440\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n40\n00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.855\n>> But you never know.\n\n41\n00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:16.993\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's see what we've got here when\n\n42\n00:02:16.993 --> 00:02:23.737\nwe go forward with this is that, in the\nprevious episode we talked about models,\n\n43\n00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:28.090\nwe talked about the CSA\ncloud reference model.\n\n44\n00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.270\nAnd then we also talked about\nthe Jericho Cloud Cube model.\n\n45\n00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.020\n>> We had those two.\n\n46\n00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.008\nOne dealt with the technical issues,\n\n47\n00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:39.550\none dealt with kind of the deployment\nissues and choosing the right solution.\n\n48\n00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.380\nSo what we're gonna do is we're kinda\ngonna roll it over here again and\n\n49\n00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.920\ntalk about, kind of when we look at\nthat first model, the CSA model.\n\n50\n00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.600\n>> We're gonna look at that and\nkinda start changing our focus just a bit.\n\n51\n00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.380\nSo do remember that model,\ndifferent layers that we had.\n\n52\n00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:03.180\nAs we were saying, as you moved up that\nmodel, depending on the more layers\n\n53\n00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.230\nyou took on, or you had over someone else,\nit dictated how much security.\n\n54\n00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.670\nYou or\nthe other person was going to have and\n\n55\n00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.880\nwhat your responsibilities\nwere going to be.\n\n56\n00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.170\nSo we had that and\nwe talked about that but\n\n57\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.470\nlet's talk about some of the other issues.\n\n58\n00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.360\nSpecifically when we get down\nto the security part of it.\n\n59\n00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.695\nOne of the biggest things we got You got\nto think about is issues with the cloud\n\n60\n00:03:24.695 --> 00:03:25.250\nitself.\n\n61\n00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.975\nOkay, we haven't really talked about that,\nright?\n\n62\n00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:32.178\nWe've said cloud, but you know-\n>> So far, I've got this picture of this\n\n63\n00:03:32.178 --> 00:03:36.408\nperfect environment that I can just move\nmy stuff up to, and once it's up there,\n\n64\n00:03:36.408 --> 00:03:37.545\nI let them manage it.\n\n65\n00:03:37.545 --> 00:03:39.680\nAnd there's nothing to do, and\nit couldn't get any better.\n\n66\n00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.298\nIt's IT nirvana.\n\n67\n00:03:41.298 --> 00:03:45.490\n>> [LAUGH] That's not quite the case,\nright Shawn?\n\n68\n00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.590\n>> No, definitely not.\n\n69\n00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.350\nWhat we want to start looking\nat here is first thing,\n\n70\n00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.745\nwhat types of issues do we have for\nthe cloud.\n\n71\n00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:56.747\nOkay, you may already be able\nto think of some of them,\n\n72\n00:03:56.747 --> 00:03:59.980\nbut let's put them out there.\n\n73\n00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.500\nFirst of all, you gotta think about\nthe fact that with the cloud,\n\n74\n00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.750\nyour handing your stuff\noff to someone else.\n\n75\n00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.620\nReally.\nThat what it boils down to is you're\n\n76\n00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.120\nhanding your stuff to someone else.\n\n77\n00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.290\nSo that is a good thing and\nit's a bad thing.\n\n78\n00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.540\nWhen you hand off to someone else, yes you\nare from the bean counters side of things.\n\n79\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.520\nYou're cutting costs is the way\nthey look at it, of course.\n\n80\n00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.290\nI know there's probably, I'm not even\ngonna look at the chat room cuz I know\n\n81\n00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.420\nthere's people probably going,\noh, I've got an example for you.\n\n82\n00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.940\nThere's always an example of where\nthe B counters are screwed up and\n\n83\n00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.700\ndon't count all the little details of it.\n\n84\n00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.810\nI've seen it I know you're going to go\nwith it, so we don't need to go there.\n\n85\n00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.380\nOn paper, that's what they may look at,\njust the costs, offloading it.\n\n86\n00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.801\nBut there are other things with security\nissues we have offloading to the cloud is\n\n87\n00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:52.890\nsomeone else is managing your stuff.\n\n88\n00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.120\nYou don't have eyes on that,\nnecessarily don't have eyes on.\n\n89\n00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.940\nIf you talk a private cloud,\nwhich we could still factor into this.\n\n90\n00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.820\nA private cloud still brings in\ncertain issues because there's things\n\n91\n00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.390\nwe have to consider as far as securing\nit in that environment, even privately.\n\n92\n00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.590\nYour still talking about securing\nthe facilities around that cloud system.\n\n93\n00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.240\nBut those shouldn't be too\ndifferent than you have for\n\n94\n00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.470\nreally any of your other IT systems.\n\n95\n00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.330\nIf you're putting a lock and key around\nall your servers you definitely should be\n\n96\n00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.590\ndoing it around whatever your cloud system\nis, so that should be no big shock to you.\n\n97\n00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.700\nSo, if we talk cloud specific\nissues that would be part of it.\n\n98\n00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.710\nSomething I want to start\nbringing into this.\n\n99\n00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.287\nThose when you talk about the Cloud,\nis it's gonna come up again but,\n\n100\n00:05:47.287 --> 00:05:52.021\nI really kinda wanna start bringing it\nto the picture now is when you think\n\n101\n00:05:52.021 --> 00:05:54.385\nabout the hosting provider.\n\n102\n00:05:54.385 --> 00:05:58.260\nOkay, the hosting provider,\nthink about what they're there for.\n\n103\n00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.230\nThe hosting provider is\nthere to sell you a service.\n\n104\n00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.010\nThat's it.\n\n105\n00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.910\nIt may came as a shock that\nthat's what they want to do, but\n\n106\n00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.880\nthey're there to sell you a service.\n\n107\n00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.000\nThe person you're talking to on the phone\nline or comes to meet with you,\n\n108\n00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.520\na solution provider, they're probably\njust gonna be a sales person and\n\n109\n00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.100\nthey're concerned with selling\nyou that product or service.\n\n110\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.540\nThey may bring someone of their\nown technical people in but\n\n111\n00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.350\nthey still don't know your environment.\n\n112\n00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.170\nThey've gotta figure that stuff out.\n\n113\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:36.470\nYou need to remember that these CSPs that\nare going to be providing you the service.\n\n114\n00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.870\nWhy they may have the tools in place and\n\n115\n00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.710\nvery well should have the tools in place\nto help you do something safely and\n\n116\n00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.950\nsecurely, that typically\nisn't their focus.\n\n117\n00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.830\nThey're relying on you to do that.\n\n118\n00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.687\nSo, you have to ask questions and if\nyou're just deciding that you don't need\n\n119\n00:06:51.687 --> 00:06:55.737\ntheir consultant or whatever or\ntheir own technical expertise,\n\n120\n00:06:55.737 --> 00:07:00.594\nyou just need to buy certain services off\nthe menu and make your own solution you\n\n121\n00:07:00.594 --> 00:07:04.560\nstill need to be aware of what\nquestions need to be asked.\n\n122\n00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.540\n>> Are you saying that these sale people\nmight not be forthcoming with all\n\n123\n00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.530\nthe issues that they may have, and-\n>> Vulnerabilities of their systems.\n\n124\n00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.405\n>> Are the sales people\nhere watching this.\n\n125\n00:07:15.405 --> 00:07:16.236\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well.\n\n126\n00:07:16.236 --> 00:07:20.208\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well that's just not their area of\n\n127\n00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:26.016\nexpertise right that's is the thing\nwell whether you want to say it's for\n\n128\n00:07:26.016 --> 00:07:29.490\nmalicious or not or is there whatever.\n\n129\n00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:34.380\n>> I'll leave that up to you, but\nyeah, that's not their main focus.\n\n130\n00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.630\nSo, they're going to\nsell you this service and\n\n131\n00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.750\na lot of cases are gonna\nexpect you to ask questions.\n\n132\n00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.550\nAnd so, you really gotta make,\n\n133\n00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:47.599\ngotta educate yourself on what the issues\nare in any specific situation.\n\n134\n00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:55.410\nFor example, there's hosts and\nproviders where unless you ask them\n\n135\n00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:00.600\nabout things like doing regular backups,\nthose things aren't going to get done.\n\n136\n00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.775\nSo if you didn't ask,\nthey're not getting done and\n\n137\n00:08:02.775 --> 00:08:04.660\nguess what's going to\nhappen at some point?\n\n138\n00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.965\nIt's just the law of\naverages Gonna bite you.\n\n139\n00:08:07.965 --> 00:08:12.740\nSo you have to be aware of,\nokay I need to choose that off the menu.\n\n140\n00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.020\nThen you may need to ask about,\n\n141\n00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.960\nif you're gonna encrypt stuff on their\nsystem, how the keys are stored.\n\n142\n00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.510\nAre they gonna give you the key, or\nthey gonna keep the keys in key escrow,\n\n143\n00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.590\nhow's that gonna be handled?\n\n144\n00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.110\nSo there are some things that, you know,\n\n145\n00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.050\ngo with that cloud environment that you\nneed to be aware of asking questions for,\n\n146\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.630\nbecause you may not have to\nask those questions currently.\n\n147\n00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.950\nSo that can be problem number one or\nissue number one you gotta address.\n\n148\n00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.790\nBut I would say probably\nthe biggest one people have is,\n\n149\n00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:49.370\nyou know, Handing it off to\nsomeone else because, if it's for\n\n150\n00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:53.140\nexample, a commercial provider,\nit's not on site, it's someplace else.\n\n151\n00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.780\nI'm worried about who's touching it,\n\n152\n00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.530\nwho's maintaining it,\nhow you're gonna keep conductivity to it.\n\n153\n00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.040\nAll those things go in.\n\n154\n00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.380\nSo that's something that is,\nthose would be the big ones.\n\n155\n00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.640\nI'd also add in support issues.\n\n156\n00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.698\nAnybody that's in IT, I'm sure people over\nhere in the discussion group can sit here\n\n157\n00:09:14.698 --> 00:09:19.756\nand talk about, there's probably a number\nof people that could probably sit here and\n\n158\n00:09:19.756 --> 00:09:24.040\ntalk about when they've gone to the cloud,\nand they've had a problem,\n\n159\n00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.027\na problem that they could have easily gone\nover, and just visualized in their head,\n\n160\n00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:32.720\nand said I could just flip\na couple switches and fix that.\n\n161\n00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.810\nYou can't do that anymore\nif that's not on site.\n\n162\n00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.020\nIf that's somewhere.\n\n163\n00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.380\nIn another state, that's no\nlonger something that you can do.\n\n164\n00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.690\nYou can't just go over and\nsay I'm going to do this.\n\n165\n00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:45.930\nSo, you have to kind of\nestablish with this cloud issue,\n\n166\n00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.610\nhow is support gonna work?\n\n167\n00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:48.860\nHow responsive are they gonna be?\n\n168\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.590\nAre they competent enough to handle this?\n\n169\n00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.140\nSo do remember that type of thing.\n\n170\n00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.010\nSo that would be kinda the first thing,\nis the cloud specific issues.\n\n171\n00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.360\nNot your stuff yet.\n\n172\n00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.100\nBut the environment\nyou're pushing it into.\n\n173\n00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.540\n>> Alright, and once we get a good\nhandle on the cloud itself, and\n\n174\n00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.420\nwe feel comfortable with that,\nthen what do we worry about?\n\n175\n00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.410\n>> Then you're going to get to your stuff,\nright?\n\n176\n00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.540\nThe stuff you're putting into that cloud,\nyour application,\n\n177\n00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.480\nyour data, and all the stability\nissues that go around it.\n\n178\n00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.510\nThose things are now getting into the mix.\n\n179\n00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:26.670\nSo, we'll say, tor the most part,\nthat you've resolved or\n\n180\n00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.780\naddressed your cloud issues,\nyour cloud-centric issues, so\n\n181\n00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.840\nnow the technology is\ngoing inside of that.\n\n182\n00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.860\nSo application issues can be\n\n183\n00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.340\nall over the spectrum as far\nas security is concerned.\n\n184\n00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.200\nYou've gotta remember the fact that\n\n185\n00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.480\nIf you're just doing something\nlike software as a service.\n\n186\n00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.270\nWell, if it's something like email,\n\n187\n00:10:52.270 --> 00:10:55.640\nall you're doing is get in\nthe mailbox as provision.\n\n188\n00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.130\nJust about all of the applications\nthat you used are over on that side of\n\n189\n00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.045\nthe fence, they're no longer.\n\n190\n00:11:01.045 --> 00:11:05.510\nBut on my side of the fence I just\nhave to request a mailbox be set up.\n\n191\n00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.110\nI may be able to self provision it too.\n\n192\n00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:11.690\nJust go into a control panel and say I\nneed this x number of mailboxes, click,\n\n193\n00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.170\nclick, click, and set them up,\nand they're done.\n\n194\n00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.840\nI mean one of the core\ntenets of cloud technology\n\n195\n00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.290\nis that you can do on demand provisioning.\n\n196\n00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:26.000\nSo you can do that type of self service\ntype deal, which indeed does happen.\n\n197\n00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.650\nBut what about other things if you\nhave an application that you made and\n\n198\n00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:38.140\nyou're putting some place else, does that\nplace have the ability to support it?\n\n199\n00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.600\nAre you gonna be able to support\nit in that cloud environment?\n\n200\n00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.140\nAnd what happens if you have just\na piece of it over there and\n\n201\n00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.470\na piece of it on your side and you have\nsort of middle ware deal in there.\n\n202\n00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.770\nWell how you gonna securely\nexchange data back and forth?\n\n203\n00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.400\nCan they support the level\nof security that you need?\n\n204\n00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.310\nThat is going to be a very,\n\n205\n00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:59.350\nvery, very big issue and\nwe don't even know all the issues yet.\n\n206\n00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:03.780\nWe're just talking generically\nabout an application.\n\n207\n00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.270\nWe're not talking about\na little nuanced stuff.\n\n208\n00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:09.440\nI mean we can't talk about all\nthe nuances because there's way too many\n\n209\n00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.910\napplications for that.\n\n210\n00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.004\nBut you need to think about\nstuff like data exchange,\n\n211\n00:12:14.004 --> 00:12:18.020\nwhere data's sitting as well as do\nyou have any compliancy issues.\n\n212\n00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.330\nAnd we're going to get to that one.\n\n213\n00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.160\nThat's something else that pops up.\n\n214\n00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:28.350\nSo once we have the application,\nlike we said, the data is mixed into that.\n\n215\n00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.750\nSo application taking care of data.\n\n216\n00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:35.160\nAnd then any sort of stability issues,\nand stability would be with the cloud,\n\n217\n00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.680\nyour application, and\nthe two working together, okay?\n\n218\n00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:43.850\nBoth may be fine on their own, but\nwhen you put them together at main or\n\n219\n00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.440\ndo some uncertainties in there\nwhich has been known to happen.\n\n220\n00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.770\nAny time you mix a couple things\ntogether it tends to happen.\n\n221\n00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:55.110\nSo you gotta kind of figure out what\ntype of issues you're gonna have there.\n\n222\n00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.910\nCause remember,\n\n223\n00:12:55.910 --> 00:13:01.230\nwhen your core concept of security is CIA,\nwe do have that availability issue.\n\n224\n00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:06.180\nSo you need to think about, are those\nthings going to be there when you need it?\n\n225\n00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.330\nIf they go down, how long are they\ngonna be long on average?\n\n226\n00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:13.818\nHow long does it take the company\nto respond to problems?\n\n227\n00:13:13.818 --> 00:13:18.390\nI would say though,\nmost people have noticed,\n\n228\n00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.990\nif you haven't already noticed this,\nwith cloud providers.\n\n229\n00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:24.230\nI mean, there's a lot of them.\n\n230\n00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.110\nThere are a lot of cloud providers\nout there, being the buzzword.\n\n231\n00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:31.060\nYou can go to a lot of different places\nand see, a lot of different places online,\n\n232\n00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.400\nand say, oh we provide the cloud, we\nprovide the cloud, we provide the cloud.\n\n233\n00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:35.430\nIt's all over the place.\n\n234\n00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:41.170\nReally what you're seeing nowadays, and\nthis doesn't mean to endorse any one of\n\n235\n00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:46.050\nthem, but you're seeing it tends to come\ndown to Microsoft, Google, or Amazon.\n\n236\n00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.960\nThose tend to be the big three and\n\n237\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.460\nthose ones tend to be gobbling\nup some of these other ones.\n\n238\n00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:57.380\nIt's not to say the other\nones are incapable of handing\n\n239\n00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.430\nyour stuff It just means that you might\nwanna take a closer look at them.\n\n240\n00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:04.570\nYou can pretty much be sure that\nsomebody like Amazon or Microsoft or\n\n241\n00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:09.200\nGoogle is probably gonna have enough\nmoney and all that, and technical\n\n242\n00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.080\nexpertise all in invested in their stuff,\nthat you're probably not gonna run into\n\n243\n00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.810\na lot of these stability issues of\nsomething being there or not be there.\n\n244\n00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:18.130\nBut, you don't know.\n\n245\n00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.140\nBut they're a lot less\nlikely to happen there.\n\n246\n00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.710\nWhereas you go with the smaller one,\nthen you don't know.\n\n247\n00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.200\nYou're gonna wanna start looking\nat reviews and stuff like that,\n\n248\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.950\nhow they can handle things.\n\n249\n00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:33.180\nThe stuff that you're seeing by the way,\njust in the Cloud community,\n\n250\n00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:39.020\nis you're seeing some of the same stuff\nthat you saw like in the early to mid 90s,\n\n251\n00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.510\nwhere remember in the early to\nmid 90s internet became popular.\n\n252\n00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.025\nYou could find ISPs just anyway.\n\n253\n00:14:46.025 --> 00:14:46.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You threw\n\n254\n00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.370\na rock you could hit a hundred of them,\nno problem.\n\n255\n00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.890\nNot nearly as many as that anymore.\n\n256\n00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.850\nThere used to be dial-up\nall over the place.\n\n257\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.110\nNow those places are gone.\n\n258\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.400\nThey started getting gobbled up by\nbigger ISPs and consolidating more.\n\n259\n00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.890\nYou're seeing the same stuff\nin the cloud arena too,\n\n260\n00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.560\nwhere there's a bunch of them and\nnow they're being consolidated a bit more.\n\n261\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.546\nBut, remember,\nyou don't wanna have to take something and\n\n262\n00:15:11.546 --> 00:15:15.000\nput it in the cloud and\nthen have it not be available.\n\n263\n00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.310\nA lot of people have\nfallen victim to that.\n\n264\n00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:19.470\nJust because they think,\nhey, cloud's better.\n\n265\n00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.390\nCloud's not necessarily better.\n\n266\n00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:26.560\nI mean, putting some untested and\nuntried mix out there into the cloud,\n\n267\n00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.630\ncould definitely cause you a big problem.\n\n268\n00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.840\nSo, you want to be careful,\ndefinitely, with that.\n\n269\n00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.260\nDon't just rush to it.\n\n270\n00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:37.430\n>> I've see a few of them,\nthat were here one day.\n\n271\n00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:38.630\nAnd gone the next.\n\n272\n00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:43.540\nAnd if your company had invested all\ntheir money into that particular CSP,\n\n273\n00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.700\nall your data's up there.\n\n274\n00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.001\nAnd all of a sudden they go bankrupt,\nor they go out of business,\n\n275\n00:15:48.001 --> 00:15:49.420\nwhere does that leave you?\n\n276\n00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.960\nSomething you've gotta consider.\n\n277\n00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.280\nYeah, you just don't know and\nthink about it.\n\n278\n00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.180\nThink about the money you may\nhave invested putting something\n\n279\n00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.680\ninto the cloud and then all the sudden,\nyou know, you got to redo that?\n\n280\n00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.450\nThat's not pretty.\n\n281\n00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:05.920\nThat's\n>> It's just not gonna be pretty at all.\n\n282\n00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.435\n>> There's been so many things\nwith people rushing into the cloud\n\n283\n00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:12.090\nwithout thoroughly\nthinking things through,\n\n284\n00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:15.890\nthat it's impacted them adversely\nwhen it really didn't have to.\n\n285\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.100\n>> And then of course, we gotta bring\nall our legal considerations in.\n\n286\n00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:23.420\nBecause the cloud, I'm sure,\nchanges that and quite a bit as well.\n\n287\n00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:28.420\n>> Yeah, it definitely has a huge\nimpact on the legal side of things and\n\n288\n00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.893\ndo not be surprised when you hear\nthis come up over and over and\n\n289\n00:16:32.893 --> 00:16:37.457\nover again, because it's woven\nthrough everything you do in\n\n290\n00:16:37.457 --> 00:16:42.310\nthe cloud to varying degrees to\na whole bunch of varying degrees.\n\n291\n00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:48.127\nBecause we don't know what you're hosting\nhere when we talk about this credential,\n\n292\n00:16:48.127 --> 00:16:52.893\nwe're just talking about how you\nwould plan that integration and, or\n\n293\n00:16:52.893 --> 00:16:54.770\nmigration into the cloud.\n\n294\n00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:59.922\nWe don't know what type of data or\napplications or whatever you're hosting,\n\n295\n00:16:59.922 --> 00:17:03.210\nso we need to just say that\nthere are legal issues.\n\n296\n00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:08.696\nSo legal issues, some of the ones\nthat do come in are pertained\n\n297\n00:17:08.696 --> 00:17:13.350\nto that the fact that you\naren't hosting it on site.\n\n298\n00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:18.632\nThere's ones that come up on that mainly,\nbecause if you not hosted on site,\n\n299\n00:17:18.632 --> 00:17:22.310\nyou really do not have control\nof your stuff anymore.\n\n300\n00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:24.100\nIt's in someone else's hands.\n\n301\n00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.810\nYou can say that you have control over it,\nbut it's in someone else's hands now.\n\n302\n00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:30.670\nSo you have to account for that.\n\n303\n00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:35.550\nNow while you can do some things\nto kind of mitigate that,\n\n304\n00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:38.200\nencryption being one of them.\n\n305\n00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.920\nIt's in someone else's hands,\nbut you can encrypt it.\n\n306\n00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.179\nSo they can't actually read it, that could\nbe something that's a big help for you and\n\n307\n00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:47.380\nsomething that you should consider doing.\n\n308\n00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:52.630\nBut then we talk about encryption,\nwell, just encryption in itself.\n\n309\n00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.380\nIs that enough to help you out legally?\n\n310\n00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.930\nWell, think about this.\n\n311\n00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.618\nFrom the encryption side of things,\n\n312\n00:17:59.618 --> 00:18:04.050\nif you encrypt your information,\nwell, who gets that key?\n\n313\n00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:09.213\nIt has already come up where cloud\nservice providers have loud,\n\n314\n00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:12.655\nyou do encrypted information with them and\n\n315\n00:18:12.655 --> 00:18:16.590\nthen they hold that key for\nyou for safekeeping.\n\n316\n00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:21.259\nWell, the thing is that if that cloud\nservice provider gets subpoenaed,\n\n317\n00:18:21.259 --> 00:18:24.890\nlet's say, by here in the US\nby the federal government.\n\n318\n00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.460\nThey have to respond to that subpoena\nsaying, we need that person's information.\n\n319\n00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.211\nSo that information's subpoenaed and\n\n320\n00:18:31.211 --> 00:18:34.970\nthey have to provide it in\nresponse to that subpoena.\n\n321\n00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:38.537\nThat subpoena may also say, well,\nthey have no obligation to tell you or\n\n322\n00:18:38.537 --> 00:18:40.300\nnot allowed to tell you that did it.\n\n323\n00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:42.230\nIt might be a part of the investigation.\n\n324\n00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:46.136\nAnd now you have a situation where\nthey've grabbed or someone's come in,\n\n325\n00:18:46.136 --> 00:18:47.810\nsubpoenaed your information.\n\n326\n00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.800\nThey've grabbed, they have a copy of it.\n\n327\n00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.831\nThey've also got the key without your\nknowledge and they have decrypted\n\n328\n00:18:54.831 --> 00:18:59.130\nyour stuff and are sifting through it and\ndo whatever with it.\n\n329\n00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.880\nThat's not gonna sit well\nwith a lot of people.\n\n330\n00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.060\nAnd indeed,\nit hasn't sat well with a lot of people.\n\n331\n00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:08.942\nBecause that issue has already come up\nhere in the US, it's not something that's,\n\n332\n00:19:08.942 --> 00:19:11.850\noh, I'm just making up\nsome wild scenario here.\n\n333\n00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.840\nIt has already come up.\n\n334\n00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.650\nSo one provider the way they\ndealt with it was, is they said,\n\n335\n00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:21.165\nwe'll we're still gonna allow\nyou to do encryption and\n\n336\n00:19:21.165 --> 00:19:25.750\nprotect all your stuff that way,\nbecause we know it's a powerful tool.\n\n337\n00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.759\nBut what we're gonna do\nis once you encrypt it,\n\n338\n00:19:28.759 --> 00:19:30.800\nwe will not hold the key for you.\n\n339\n00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.890\nIt's not being offered\nas a service anymore.\n\n340\n00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:34.640\nIt's now under your control.\n\n341\n00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.340\nYou're responsible for it, you lose it.\n\n342\n00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.140\nOh, well, we don't have any\nknowledge of it, you're stuck.\n\n343\n00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.768\nBut the thing being that,\n\n344\n00:19:40.768 --> 00:19:45.948\nif they're subpoenaed it takes them out of\nthe firing line, if whoever comes in and\n\n345\n00:19:45.948 --> 00:19:49.880\ntries to subpoena that information,\nthey can't provide it.\n\n346\n00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:54.693\nAnd the reason why they did that is\nthe cloud service provider didn't feel\n\n347\n00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:57.797\ncomfortable in this\nspecific case was saying,\n\n348\n00:19:57.797 --> 00:20:02.470\nhey, we have provided information and\nwe can't tell our client that.\n\n349\n00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:04.321\nSo it puts us in an awkward position,\n\n350\n00:20:04.321 --> 00:20:07.380\nbecause we got a response legally\nafter responds over here.\n\n351\n00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.434\nBut we also have a responsibility\nto our clients and\n\n352\n00:20:09.434 --> 00:20:11.170\nwe don't like being caught in the middle.\n\n353\n00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:14.065\nSo they just went through and\ncut themselves out of the middle saying,\n\n354\n00:20:14.065 --> 00:20:14.760\nyou get the key.\n\n355\n00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.550\nAnd if anybody subpoenas it,\nhey, we can't decrypt it.\n\n356\n00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.380\nYou're gonna have to go to that person to\nget it, so now you have to inform them.\n\n357\n00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:28.300\nSo that's been one way that that's\ndealt with, so that's one issue.\n\n358\n00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.753\nOther things that come you,\nforensics have come up and\n\n359\n00:20:31.753 --> 00:20:36.484\nthat's when it's still being dealt\nwith as well is when you do forensics,\n\n360\n00:20:36.484 --> 00:20:39.130\nwell how do you do forensics in the cloud?\n\n361\n00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:42.519\nThat issues still being\nkind of sifted through,\n\n362\n00:20:42.519 --> 00:20:47.398\nbecause forensics doesn't work the same\nway in the cloud as it does and\n\n363\n00:20:47.398 --> 00:20:51.880\nthe stuff that we taught when we\ndid our whole forensics course.\n\n364\n00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:57.653\nIt does not just not work that same way,\nbecause of the elasticity of the cloud,\n\n365\n00:20:57.653 --> 00:21:01.720\nthe way resources are allocated and\npooled and reused.\n\n366\n00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.945\nYou can't do the same things\nthe exact same way, so\n\n367\n00:21:04.945 --> 00:21:07.197\nnew methods have to be developed and\n\n368\n00:21:07.197 --> 00:21:11.640\nsome of those methods are still on\nthe bleeding edge to put it lightly.\n\n369\n00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.810\nSo that if you need to do forensics,\nthat could be a big problem.\n\n370\n00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:23.130\nThen there's also reusing of resources,\nfor example, disc space.\n\n371\n00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:26.720\nThe disc space due to\nthe elasticity of the cloud.\n\n372\n00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:31.162\nWell, can you guarantee when your\nstats no longer using that space or\n\n373\n00:21:31.162 --> 00:21:36.063\nshifted some place else that whoever\ncomes in after has our application host\n\n374\n00:21:36.063 --> 00:21:38.450\nin there multi-tenant situation.\n\n375\n00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.470\nThey come in there, are they able to\nread the stuff at that level now?\n\n376\n00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:47.210\nCan they retrieve the files that's\nsupposedly should have been?\n\n377\n00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:50.670\nDeleted by you,\ncan they still go ahead and grab that?\n\n378\n00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:54.420\nThat's gonna open up another\nlegal can of worms potentially.\n\n379\n00:21:54.420 --> 00:22:00.140\nSo there's a lot of them, you can factor\nin incident handling and stuff like that.\n\n380\n00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:05.509\nSo I think the big question here is when\nyou get down to it is where do you go for\n\n381\n00:22:05.509 --> 00:22:06.630\ninformation?\n\n382\n00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:11.878\nI mean,\nI'm not gonna even pretend I'm a lawyer,\n\n383\n00:22:11.878 --> 00:22:15.550\nit's just not something I can say.\n\n384\n00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.210\n>> Although he plays one on ITProTV.\n\n385\n00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.270\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n386\n00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.351\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm not a lawyer, but\n\n387\n00:22:21.351 --> 00:22:24.060\nI've had to talk to quite a few.\n\n388\n00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:29.170\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So where do you go for information?\n\n389\n00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:36.680\nI can at least give you a couple examples,\nwhat I've got here on my screen.\n\n390\n00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.220\nHere's one is you can go to the HIPAA.\n\n391\n00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:44.301\nHIPAA has plenty of resources on it, so\n\n392\n00:22:44.301 --> 00:22:49.249\nyou can go to websites\nlike this that provide you\n\n393\n00:22:49.249 --> 00:22:53.470\nall sorts of stuff pertaining to HIPAA.\n\n394\n00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:54.710\nI mean, you can see in here.\n\n395\n00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.630\nIt's even got a security thing right here.\n\n396\n00:22:57.630 --> 00:22:59.100\nIt's got the privacy section.\n\n397\n00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.060\nIt's got all sorts of\nstuff relating to the law.\n\n398\n00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.327\nIf this is not your cup of tea or\nyour specialty,\n\n399\n00:23:05.327 --> 00:23:09.260\nthen you need to recruit some\nsort of legal help to get it.\n\n400\n00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.318\nDon't just start reading through this and\nassume you know it and don't go to Mr.\n\n401\n00:23:13.318 --> 00:23:16.550\nInternet lawyer and\nassume that they know know everything too.\n\n402\n00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.460\nI've seen a lot of people, oh,\nI read it on the internet.\n\n403\n00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.470\nIt must be true,\ncuz no one lies on the internet.\n\n404\n00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:21.090\n>> That's right.\n\n405\n00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.260\n>> Of course, they don't.\n\n406\n00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.045\nSo there's that and\n\n407\n00:23:24.045 --> 00:23:29.720\nthen there's also stuff like psi\nin the payment card industry.\n\n408\n00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:34.091\nIf you have an applications\nthat's processing payments for\n\n409\n00:23:34.091 --> 00:23:36.840\ncustomers, which is very possible.\n\n410\n00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:42.970\nThat you have a product or service,\nthat is being distributed this way.\n\n411\n00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:47.800\nLet's say, you're distributing\nproducts digitally, software.\n\n412\n00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.300\nYou are gonna be processing\npayments online.\n\n413\n00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.119\nPeople are gonna be doing e-commerce\nto get that digital download.\n\n414\n00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:57.857\nSo if they're running credit cards through\nand any sort of payment card, well,\n\n415\n00:23:57.857 --> 00:24:01.212\nthe PCI industry,\ntheir regulations are gonna come in.\n\n416\n00:24:01.212 --> 00:24:05.415\nSo This would be a place that you\nwould go for guidance on that.\n\n417\n00:24:05.415 --> 00:24:09.676\nAnd they provide a whole bunch\nof resources as do many of\n\n418\n00:24:09.676 --> 00:24:13.640\nthe organizations that\npertain to this laws.\n\n419\n00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.900\nIn fact both with HIPAA and PCI, they\neven have these train sections in here,\n\n420\n00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:25.410\nthat they offer classes some of them free,\nsome of them not so free.\n\n421\n00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:30.730\nThat give you information on\npertains to that specific body loss.\n\n422\n00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:33.600\nSome of them actually do\ncover cloud specifically.\n\n423\n00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.200\nSo they can tell you, okay,\nhere's what the cloud is and\n\n424\n00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.640\nthen they will sell you hey here's some of\nthe things that need to be addressed and\n\n425\n00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.990\nthey will give you guidance and\neven have white papers and\n\n426\n00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.540\nstuff like that in a lot of cases to\nhelp get you in the right direction.\n\n427\n00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:50.330\nYou still may, ultimately,\nyou have to enlist the aid of a lawyer.\n\n428\n00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.510\nAnd I would definitely encourage that.\n\n429\n00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:54.400\nBetter safe than sorry.\n\n430\n00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:59.500\nBut, these white papers and doing some\nof your own legwork will help you\n\n431\n00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.930\nbe able to focus your questioning and\nget the answers that you need to know.\n\n432\n00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:08.620\nYou don't want to go to a lawyer with just\nfrom the stand point of a technical person\n\n433\n00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.625\nand start throwing that information at\nthem because that's not their specialty.\n\n434\n00:25:11.625 --> 00:25:12.930\nThey're there for the law.\n\n435\n00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.970\nThey may know technical stuff,\nbut don't count on it.\n\n436\n00:25:15.970 --> 00:25:18.490\nBe prepared to do your homework.\n\n437\n00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:22.060\nThat's something that I point\nout to people for a long time is\n\n438\n00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:30.720\nthat where we can be IT people,\nbut we're not lawyers for example.\n\n439\n00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.560\nLawyers, they're trained to be lawyers,\nand not trained to be IT people.\n\n440\n00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.930\nNow it doesn't always hold that\nthat's always gonna be the case.\n\n441\n00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.220\nI mean if you go back to my area.\n\n442\n00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.940\nI'm not too far some Silcone Valley,\n\n443\n00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:46.550\nyou might very well find a bunch of\nlawyers that are also very tech-savvy,\n\n444\n00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:50.220\nbecause that's the nature\nof the culture down there.\n\n445\n00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:53.510\nBut count on, if you're going some other\nplace that they're gonna know that,\n\n446\n00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:57.150\nso you need to be prepared, done your\nhomework, know what questions to ask.\n\n447\n00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:59.590\nAnd interpret that to them so\nthey can help you.\n\n448\n00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:04.590\nBut, bottom line, make sure get\nthe legal help you need before you start\n\n449\n00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:09.950\ndeploying a solution because it\ncan dramatically impact the final\n\n450\n00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:16.260\nshape of your solution and these laws\naren't just stuff like PCI and HIPAA.\n\n451\n00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.050\nThese are federal laws and guidelines.\n\n452\n00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:21.540\nThey also have state laws.\n\n453\n00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.530\nThey have local ones.\n\n454\n00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.630\nThey have industry specific ones.\n\n455\n00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.200\nThere's a whole bunch of\nthem that can come together\n\n456\n00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.470\nthat can really shape solutions.\n\n457\n00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.540\nI know, just to give you an example,\n\n458\n00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:36.470\nhow radically these things can\nimpact the shape of your solution.\n\n459\n00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:44.170\nI know of a company that still\ndoes process its health care\n\n460\n00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:50.320\ninformation back in California and\nthe information that they process,\n\n461\n00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.830\nthey originally were thinking\nwe want to do a cloud solution.\n\n462\n00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:56.970\nAnd they were looking at the cloud\nsolutions that were hosted by\n\n463\n00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:57.620\nsomeone else.\n\n464\n00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:00.900\nThey figured that would be a great thing\ncuz they could get rid of a lot their\n\n465\n00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:06.680\ninfrastructure or essentially a huge chunk\nof it, and push it off some place else.\n\n466\n00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:10.090\nBut once consultants came in and they\nreally looked at the solution, it took\n\n467\n00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:14.120\nthem a year to go through the process that\nwe're gonna be talking about this week.\n\n468\n00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.590\nIt took them a year to go through that.\n\n469\n00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:21.330\nAnd ultimately, solutions determined\nthat it had to be a private cloud.\n\n470\n00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:25.670\nThere was no way that they could do\nall the stuff that they needed to,\n\n471\n00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.350\nand then guarantee\nthe level of security and\n\n472\n00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:32.070\nregulatory compliance,\nwithout doing it all privately.\n\n473\n00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:35.960\nBut fortunately, the private solution\nwas still able to save them.\n\n474\n00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.510\nQuite a bit of money, and give them\nthe scalability that they needed.\n\n475\n00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:40.160\n>> Hm.\n\n476\n00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.670\nVery good.\n\n477\n00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.290\nWell, Shawn, a lot of things we got\nto think about when it comes to\n\n478\n00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:48.100\nmoving our infrastructure out to\nthe cloud or whatever it is we choose to\n\n479\n00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.640\nmove out to the cloud, legal\nconsiderations, security considerations.\n\n480\n00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.480\nAnd I know we just scratched the surface.\n\n481\n00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.770\nWe got a lot more to go over.\n\n482\n00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.590\nAny final considerations for\nus before we wrap this one up?\n\n483\n00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:05.170\nWhat I'm gonna tell you is, right\nupfront is when you are evaluating it.\n\n484\n00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:07.760\nI know I've mentioned it already,\nwhen you're evaluating a solution.\n\n485\n00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.360\nThat solution that you guys,\n\n486\n00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.510\nI've been advising that you keep something\nin your head when you're going through\n\n487\n00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:16.999\nthis, is really get to know\nwhat that application is.\n\n488\n00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:20.610\nAnd start itemizing\nthe different technical issues,\n\n489\n00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.520\nsecurity issues that might come up.\n\n490\n00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:27.800\nAll those things, start listing them out\nand making sure they're getting addressed.\n\n491\n00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.260\nIf you don't know them all that is fine.\n\n492\n00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:35.510\nMake sure you enlist the help of subject\nmatter experts on the specific areas.\n\n493\n00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:39.410\nWhether it's legal, whether it's other\ntechnical people because you have a large\n\n494\n00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:43.170\nsolution you gotta take care of,\nmake sure you got that.\n\n495\n00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:46.210\nThere's a lot of things that\ncan quite easily with this\n\n496\n00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:47.760\nslip through your fingers.\n\n497\n00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:51.319\nThat cloud solution with that health\ncare company I was talking about,\n\n498\n00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.170\nthat was something that they just\nthought by all the marketing hype, and\n\n499\n00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:59.720\neverything that was out there,\nhey we can take this and put it out there.\n\n500\n00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.050\nAnd deliver all the same stuff\nthat we've been doing so far.\n\n501\n00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.660\nThe reality is,\nis that they couldn't do it and\n\n502\n00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:11.400\nguarantee, all the safety and\nsecurity that they wanted to.\n\n503\n00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.210\nSo, they actually had to say,\nwell it's got, it all has to be internal.\n\n504\n00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:20.230\nWe got to build that whole solution\nout internally to make it work.\n\n505\n00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:21.510\nAnd it works beautifully now.\n\n506\n00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:25.360\nThey have, the solution they\nhave It just purrs, you know?\n\n507\n00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.350\nSo always make sure that you\nknow which way you need to go,\n\n508\n00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:29.880\nwhich way you want to go.\n\n509\n00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:35.020\nAnd also remember, it's perfectly\nfine to go through this process and\n\n510\n00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.545\ndecide, really,\nthe cloud just isn't for you, you know?\n\n511\n00:29:38.545 --> 00:29:40.600\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> I've seen that happen.\n\n512\n00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:45.030\nJust because it's out there,\ndoesn't mean that you need to use.\n\n513\n00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:48.060\nSee if it's actually the right thing.\n\n514\n00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.450\nI've seen that, too.\n\n515\n00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:53.760\nHeck, I've seen a company that spent\nsix figures on setting up a whole cloud\n\n516\n00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.850\nprivately.\n\n517\n00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:57.170\nThey didn't have any\nreason to have a cloud.\n\n518\n00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:59.560\nThere was zero reason for it.\n\n519\n00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:02.810\nAnd if they were gonna use it,\nthey were using it to set up, you\n\n520\n00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:07.910\nknow some places set up virtual labs and\nstuff for training and things like that?\n\n521\n00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:10.040\nThere's plenty of third-party\nproviders that do that.\n\n522\n00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.660\nFor training, you don't need to have\nyour own private cloud to do that.\n\n523\n00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.270\nThere's really not a big\nbenefit in that in most cases.\n\n524\n00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:18.320\nThere are some cases where it is.\n\n525\n00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:22.010\nAnd so they decided to spin up their\nwhole solution and make it internally.\n\n526\n00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:24.160\nThere was no reason to do it.\n\n527\n00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.060\nIt didn't provide what they needed.\n\n528\n00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:29.390\nAnd now they have investment\nin all this hardware and\n\n529\n00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:31.670\nsoftware to support the cloud\nthat they're not suing.\n\n530\n00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:37.310\nThey only had it up for maybe like six\nmonths before they said, yeah this is it.\n\n531\n00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.880\nAll that money, six months and\nyou didn't make it out to a year.\n\n532\n00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.590\nSo, you may find that this is just not\nsomething for you, and that's fine.\n\n533\n00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:46.235\n>> And that's why we find\nsuch great deals on eBay.\n\n534\n00:30:46.235 --> 00:30:47.300\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n535\n00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.835\nYou could buy your own cloud on eBay.\n\n536\n00:30:48.835 --> 00:30:51.750\n>> [LAUGH] All right, Sean, well,\na lot of great information there.\n\n537\n00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.850\nLooking forward to more, but\nfor now, we are out of time, so\n\n538\n00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:57.460\nsigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n539\n00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:58.280\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n540\n00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:59.450\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n541\n00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:05.100\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14.560\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.320\nWith me today,\nnone other than Sean Oriyano and\n\n5\n00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.670\nSean, this time we're going to\ntalk about Hosting providers.\n\n6\n00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.170\nThere's a whole bunch\nof them out there and\n\n7\n00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.430\nwe've gotta figure out which one to use.\n\n8\n00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.340\nNot that you're gonna tell us\nexactly which one to use, but\n\n9\n00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.710\nthings we need to consider when\nwe're picking our provider, right?\n\n10\n00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.552\n>> Just happens I own this\ncloud provider company.\n\n11\n00:00:34.552 --> 00:00:39.510\n>> [LAUGH] He gets kickbacks so he's gonna\ntell you go to Oriyano.com and sign up for\n\n12\n00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.640\nall the services you need.\n\n13\n00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.720\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n14\n00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.645\n>> Get right on that.\n\n15\n00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:47.340\n[LAUGH] Yeah, when we're talking\nabout Cloud Service Providers,\n\n16\n00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.390\nor what they sometimes call brokers, CSBs,\n\n17\n00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.850\nis some of that's going to be\nproviding that cloud service to you.\n\n18\n00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.450\nSo the question is What\nchoices do you have to make?\n\n19\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.320\nWhat issues are involved with that?\n\n20\n00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.280\nI mean there's gonna be\na potential lot of them.\n\n21\n00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.220\nYou're entering into a relationship\nwith a provider which\n\n22\n00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.950\nis gonna be something that's\ngonna be presumably long-term.\n\n23\n00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.760\nYou're not gonna have a short-term\nrelationship with this provider.\n\n24\n00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.550\nBecause,\n>> I sure hope not,\n\n25\n00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.070\nafter getting it all set up and\njust bounce to a different one.\n\n26\n00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.970\n>> Can you imagine that.\n\n27\n00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.130\nThat would be a mess.\n\n28\n00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.620\nI mean, its possible.\n\n29\n00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.675\nI mean, it's possible you could\nset something up temporarily and\n\n30\n00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:32.320\nshort-term could definitely\nbe a relative term.\n\n31\n00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.210\nIt could be, You know,\na solution that's up there for a year or\n\n32\n00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.880\ntwo while you work on a project,\nthen torn down and gotten rid of.\n\n33\n00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.230\nBut more than likely you're looking\nat much longer churn than that.\n\n34\n00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.480\nEspecially, yeah, if you're talking\nabout some large, complex solution.\n\n35\n00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.120\nI'm not gonna just spend all this time and\nmoney and effort of planning all this\n\n36\n00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.720\nstuff and putting all these matrices\nout to see what features I need and\n\n37\n00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.590\nDifferent compliance issues that come in,\njust to say nah, no I'm done.\n\n38\n00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.200\nI'm gonna go someplace else.\n\n39\n00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.620\nThat would be a horrendous\nwaste of time and\n\n40\n00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.950\nmoney and\njust not the way you want to do things.\n\n41\n00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.430\nSo you really kinda wanna think About this\nprovider you're gonna be going through,\n\n42\n00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.140\nand really do your research, and look at\nreviews and stuff like that, but also,\n\n43\n00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.420\nin addition to all of that, you need to\nstart thinking about issues that arise\n\n44\n00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.330\nwhen you start moving stuff to that\ncloud environment with that provider.\n\n45\n00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.060\nThat provider themselves could introduce,\nbecause there could be a number of things\n\n46\n00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.060\nthat they introduce that You\nmay just not wanna deal with.\n\n47\n00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.370\nSo, be you know, be prepared for that.\n\n48\n00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.410\nYou know, sort of the things\nyou might wanna think about is,\n\n49\n00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.080\nwhat type of potential hosting\nissues might be talking about.\n\n50\n00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.680\nWell, there are number of them\nthat can pop up in there.\n\n51\n00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.670\nWe just haven't.\n\n52\n00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.470\nReally kind of flushed them out and\n\n53\n00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.390\nwe're gonna flush more of\nthese out as we go through.\n\n54\n00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.910\nOne of them would be, and\nI would think this would happen\n\n55\n00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.360\nmore on the smaller providers than\nit would on the larger providers.\n\n56\n00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.400\nIs a smaller provider,\nif you go with them,\n\n57\n00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.460\nthey could suffer from not having\nthe amount of resources they need.\n\n58\n00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.730\nTo take care of your request that's\ndefinitely been known to happen, it's\n\n59\n00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.370\nsomething called resource exhaustion where\nthey just, they just don't have enough\n\n60\n00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.630\nit's like it looks like the have enough\nbut they dont have enough to deal with\n\n61\n00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.340\nyour increasing demands of their adding\non other people in addition to you or\n\n62\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.790\nmaybe you start getting surges\nOf traffic or requests.\n\n63\n00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.370\nIn which case, that can also cause\nproblems with your hosting environment.\n\n64\n00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.120\nSo you need to be thinking about that.\n\n65\n00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.710\nFortunately if you go with one of those\nbig three, or someone along those,\n\n66\n00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.280\nlike that size or\nexperienced with it You're probably\n\n67\n00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.480\ngoing to be okay for\nsure just to be to sure about it.\n\n68\n00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.270\nIf you're going with your own private\ncloud then that's going to be a capacity\n\n69\n00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.360\nplanning issue which for\nthat That's pretty much a basic IT\n\n70\n00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.910\nissue at that point is figuring out how\nmuch capacity you have on that cloud and\n\n71\n00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.240\nwhat your space requirements are,\ngrowth requirements, and\n\n72\n00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.930\nall that stuff that we would with\nnormal application planning,\n\n73\n00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.110\nservice planning in IT, and\njust build the solution around that.\n\n74\n00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.340\nBut if you're going with a hosting\nprovider, then you're gonna need to be\n\n75\n00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.440\nasking do they have\nthe capacity to help you grow?\n\n76\n00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.400\nAnd to handle these spikes and\nsurges of requests that come in.\n\n77\n00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.700\nAny of those things so\nyou're not caught out cold.\n\n78\n00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.160\nYou definitely do not\nwant to find those things\n\n79\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.200\nout when you're just in\nthe thick of things.\n\n80\n00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.300\nThat's gonna be a big problem.\n\n81\n00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.860\nYou don't wanna be on the phone going,\nwhat's going on and have them going,\n\n82\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.030\nwe don't know.\n\n83\n00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.710\nYou know, that could be a very bad thing.\n\n84\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.340\n>> We ran out, we're sorry.\n\n85\n00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.400\n>> Yeah, we just sent someone to\nthe store to get a cup of bandwidth,\n\n86\n00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.800\ndon't worry, we'll be right back.\n\n87\n00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:03.105\nSo, yeah, you definitely want\nto have that stuff in mind.\n\n88\n00:05:03.105 --> 00:05:08.089\nWe're downloading more RAM.\n\n89\n00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:10.830\n[LAUGH] Don't worry.\n\n90\n00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.520\nBut, you have that sort of thing.\n\n91\n00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.050\nSomething else that comes\nout with hosting issues,\n\n92\n00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.510\nwhich we're gonna explore a bit later on,\nas we get into, but to\n\n93\n00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.820\njust kind of pop it up here is something\nthat they quantify as isolation failure.\n\n94\n00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.910\nIsolation failure, it means if\nyou're on a multi-tenant solution,\n\n95\n00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:38.630\nyou wanna make sure that they've addressed\nany issues, or ask them what they're\n\n96\n00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.050\ndoing to prevent one tenant from having\ntheir stuff bleed over into another.\n\n97\n00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.890\nOr having another tenant be able to\nread what's going on with another one.\n\n98\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.440\nYou know so you wanna make sure that if\nthey're provisioning it for multiple,\n\n99\n00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.230\nClients from different industry\nsegments or different whatever.\n\n100\n00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.210\nMake sure they have a way\nof separating that.\n\n101\n00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.130\nThe issue from that comes with,\nif they're gonna be doing isolation,\n\n102\n00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.690\nwhich they very well should be if\nthey're doing a multi-tenant solution.\n\n103\n00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.900\nNot everyone has the same security level.\n\n104\n00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.730\nIt just doesn't work that way.\n\n105\n00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.410\nYou know.\nSo you have to look at it as well,\n\n106\n00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.390\nhow are they gonna break it out.\n\n107\n00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.550\nNow if you do end up in a situation\nwhere they have like a community type\n\n108\n00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.380\ncloud model.\n\n109\n00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.260\nWe talked about that way\nback at the beginning now.\n\n110\n00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.940\nYou look at that community model you might\nsay a common community need is to have\n\n111\n00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.830\nhigh security hosting.\n\n112\n00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.490\nThat indeed could be a common need.\n\n113\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.380\nIt fits the criteria to\nhave high security hosting.\n\n114\n00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.120\nEven if that's the case where everyone is\ngonna have to maintain the same level of\n\n115\n00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.980\nsecurity, if your different clients,\nI don't want you reading my stuff.\n\n116\n00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.680\nPeriod.\n\n117\n00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.750\nEnd of story.\n\n118\n00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.920\nThat's the way it works.\n\n119\n00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.000\nIf I wanted you to read my stuff,\nwe'd probably be the same company or\n\n120\n00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.710\nin a partnership already and\nI wouldn't be worried about that.\n\n121\n00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.130\nSo, that's something else that comes in.\n\n122\n00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.890\nBut then we got to look at other things\nand this is kind of where the the legal\n\n123\n00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.840\npart plus some other issues come in,\nand I want to really bring into this,\n\n124\n00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.125\nis, you know, what if you go with,\nThe hosting provider, and\n\n125\n00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:15.275\nthat hosting provider happens,\nI know, Mike, you mentioned\n\n126\n00:07:15.275 --> 00:07:19.315\none earlier today about Microsoft,\nyou were saying, what was that one?\n\n127\n00:07:19.315 --> 00:07:21.435\nIf you want to give them\nthe background on that one.\n\n128\n00:07:21.435 --> 00:07:23.540\n>> I don't know all the details.I\nknow that Microsoft\n\n129\n00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.420\n>> Facing a, I guess they got, who is it?\n\n130\n00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.350\nIt was the D.E.A., I believe.\n\n131\n00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.860\nThe Drug Enforcement Agency was trying\nto get some emails in a case but\n\n132\n00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.359\nthe emails were being stored\non a server in Ireland and\n\n133\n00:07:37.359 --> 00:07:41.246\nThey try to get Microsoft to\nreveal those or give those up and\n\n134\n00:07:41.246 --> 00:07:46.496\nMicrosoft is saying no, you have to deal\nwith the Irish government to get that.\n\n135\n00:07:46.496 --> 00:07:49.109\nSo it's a big thing that's\ngoing on right now,\n\n136\n00:07:49.109 --> 00:07:52.974\nthat really could change a lot of\nwhat we're talking about right now.\n\n137\n00:07:52.974 --> 00:07:57.095\nWhatever this US court comes up with in\ntheir decision could affect everything.\n\n138\n00:07:57.095 --> 00:07:58.454\nYeah, it's.\n\n139\n00:07:58.454 --> 00:08:01.275\nI put you on the spot for that one.\n\n140\n00:08:01.275 --> 00:08:02.818\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It just popped into my head.\n\n141\n00:08:02.818 --> 00:08:03.890\nIt's like, hey,\nwe were just talking about that.\n\n142\n00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.323\n>> It's a great example because here's\nthis company, this U.S. based company,\n\n143\n00:08:08.323 --> 00:08:12.900\nthat's maintaining servers in another\nnation and there's data stored on there.\n\n144\n00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:18.450\nAnd we're talking about forensics and\ncriminal activities and things like that.\n\n145\n00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:22.280\nWho do they go to, do they go to the\nstorage provider in Ireland to request it?\n\n146\n00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.740\nDo they go to the main company\nwhich is here in the U.S.\n\n147\n00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.200\nwho has the authorization, the authority?\n\n148\n00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.790\nIt's a mess and nobody really knows.\n\n149\n00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.760\nAnd that's why it's going\nto the court right now.\n\n150\n00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.914\n>> Whatever comes out of that one is\ndefinitely gonna have a impact on what\n\n151\n00:08:36.914 --> 00:08:38.470\nwe're talking about right here.\n\n152\n00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.923\nYou've got a company that's based\nin the U.S., but they have their,\n\n153\n00:08:42.923 --> 00:08:46.792\nthey have their hosting centers\nspread out you know globally so\n\n154\n00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:50.430\nit becomes the question there is,\nwho do you go to?\n\n155\n00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:55.541\nAnd as Mike was talking about, you know so\nthat's something that you may have to,\n\n156\n00:08:55.541 --> 00:09:00.354\nyou may have to deal with depending on\nthe size of your company and what you deal\n\n157\n00:09:00.354 --> 00:09:05.350\nwith that you may find yourself dealing\nwith, in your specific organization.\n\n158\n00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:10.671\nI would also factor into that,\nanother kind of variation of that is,\n\n159\n00:09:10.671 --> 00:09:14.615\nfor certain countries,\nI know here for the US, for\n\n160\n00:09:14.615 --> 00:09:20.125\ncertain countries, and\ncertain industries within those countries,\n\n161\n00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:25.470\nthere are situations where you\ncannot host your stuff offshore.\n\n162\n00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.230\nIt just will not work.\n\n163\n00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.220\nI mean there are certain things,\nhere in the US,\n\n164\n00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.930\nthat you can host it in\nthe cloud if you want.\n\n165\n00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.940\nI mean they will tell you\nif you can do that and\n\n166\n00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.980\nin most cases you can but for certain\nindustries you could host in the cloud but\n\n167\n00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.830\nyou can't put it someplace over in Europe.\n\n168\n00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.860\nYou can't put it someplace up in Canada,\nor Mexico, or\n\n169\n00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.030\nAsia, or Middle East,\nor anything like that.\n\n170\n00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.880\nIt will not go there.\n\n171\n00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:54.290\nIf they find out it's there,\nyou're gonna be in really big trouble.\n\n172\n00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.140\nYou're running afoul of\nthe State Department here and\n\n173\n00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.600\nwhen the feds sink their teeth into you,\nyou got a problem.\n\n174\n00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.373\nSo if you're somebody that's working for,\nlet's say,\n\n175\n00:10:03.373 --> 00:10:07.570\nyou're somebody that's working for the\nDOD, you know, Department of Defense here.\n\n176\n00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.358\nWell, if you're working for\nthem, they could say, yeah,\n\n177\n00:10:11.358 --> 00:10:16.260\nyou can host your email system, all your\nemails, you can set that up on Gmail,\n\n178\n00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:20.716\nyou can set it up on Outlook for\nall we care, but you better make sure that\n\n179\n00:10:20.716 --> 00:10:25.890\nwherever those servers are, they're here\nin the US, serviced by US nationals.\n\n180\n00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.210\nNot by with somebody that's here on H-1B,\nor anything else like that.\n\n181\n00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:35.882\nAnd noticed how that's worded, is that\nhas to be hosted here on US soil and\n\n182\n00:10:35.882 --> 00:10:38.445\ntaken care of by US nationals, or\n\n183\n00:10:38.445 --> 00:10:44.080\nsomebody they can do a background\ncheck and all that on, because.\n\n184\n00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.500\nCompanies were trying to get around\nit by saying well, if you want.\n\n185\n00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.940\nIt's cheaper to host our cloud overseas so\nthe hosting provider would say okay we'll\n\n186\n00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.450\nput the cloud overseas but we'll bring\nin U.S. nationals over there to do it.\n\n187\n00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:01.510\nSo we can still reap the benefits\nof having lower labor costs and\n\n188\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:06.180\nlower hosting costs overseas but still\nsatisfy the U.S. national requirement.\n\n189\n00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:10.660\nThat was rewritten to say no we'll be\nhere on U.S. soil and it will be by U.S.\n\n190\n00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.970\nnationals, and we're not the only\ncountry to do that and it makes sense.\n\n191\n00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.780\nIt's like,\nyou don't want sensitive information being\n\n192\n00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:22.100\nput some place where it's not regulated or\nyou don't know who's handling it.\n\n193\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.390\nIf you're not in one of those industries,\n\n194\n00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.450\nthan you still have some\nof the same problems.\n\n195\n00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.920\nDo remember that when you put your\nstuff out there in the cloud,\n\n196\n00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.000\nwho's touching that.\n\n197\n00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.704\nThe cloud storage provider is touching it.\n\n198\n00:11:36.704 --> 00:11:41.288\nSomething that should be coming to your\nmind is do you trust that cloud service\n\n199\n00:11:41.288 --> 00:11:45.319\nprovider enough that they're doing\nbackground checks on people.\n\n200\n00:11:45.319 --> 00:11:49.126\nAdequate background checks on people\nwhen they come in and start doing it.\n\n201\n00:11:49.126 --> 00:11:54.650\nSo are they just hiring someone\noff the streets off, so to speak.\n\n202\n00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.600\nHey, you got good IT skills,\ncome on in and do this stuff.\n\n203\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.450\nDo they know who that person is?\n\n204\n00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.060\nHave they really done\na thorough background check?\n\n205\n00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:06.150\nAre they just trying to fill\na spot in that environment?\n\n206\n00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.140\nIt has been known to happen.\n\n207\n00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.770\nI've heard of companies\nactually hiring people\n\n208\n00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.020\nthat have been hackers,\nthat were actually black hats.\n\n209\n00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.530\nWhich isn't to say that they can't reform,\n\n210\n00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.550\nit's just that, they didn't know that till\nthey were there for about a year or two.\n\n211\n00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:26.400\nThen they found out, that's not the time\nyou want to find out is that, hey,\n\n212\n00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.600\nI got someone that's a black hat in here.\n\n213\n00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.610\nWell are they former or\nare they not former?\n\n214\n00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:35.560\nAnd even aside from that, why am I\nfinding this out now, why didn't I\n\n215\n00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.340\nfind this out during the screening\nprocess, or background check process?\n\n216\n00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.340\nSo those are just some of\nthe things that can come in.\n\n217\n00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:44.740\nAnd we're not even talking about stuff\nthat could go on at the facilities and\n\n218\n00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.440\nall that, too.\n\n219\n00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:50.148\nI mean, I would definitely be thinking\nabout that as somebody that's wanna\n\n220\n00:12:50.148 --> 00:12:54.853\nhand my stuff off to a cloud service\nprovider is, do they have the ability now\n\n221\n00:12:54.853 --> 00:12:59.730\nif there's a natural disaster or something\nlike that, can they cope with it?\n\n222\n00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:04.122\nFor example, something like Microsoft, or\nGoogle, or any of, or Amazon, or any of\n\n223\n00:13:04.122 --> 00:13:08.270\nthose big three, you can pretty much be\nassured that they can roll the stuff off.\n\n224\n00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.186\nThey've got enough replication,\nall that going, that if something hits one\n\n225\n00:13:12.186 --> 00:13:16.180\nof their data centers, it's easily gonna\nbe taken, picked up by another one.\n\n226\n00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.610\nThey can handle it.\n\n227\n00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:21.650\nBut can your smaller search providers,\nare they gonna be able to do it?\n\n228\n00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:27.070\nA lot of them do have their whole\nact together and can handle that.\n\n229\n00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.740\nBut you have to ask those questions.\n\n230\n00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:35.010\nHow do you maintain the spice nine or\nsix nine availability?\n\n231\n00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:38.040\nBut how do you provide that?\n\n232\n00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.140\nWhat measures do you put in place?\n\n233\n00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:42.121\nAnd see if they're gonna do that.\n\n234\n00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:44.180\n>> So it really sounds like\nwe need to educate ourselves.\n\n235\n00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.613\nIt's not just as simple as going out there\nand breaking open the phone book, right,\n\n236\n00:13:48.613 --> 00:13:50.810\nand picking up a cloud service provider.\n\n237\n00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:54.260\nYou gotta know what we need,\nwhat requirements we have,\n\n238\n00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.245\nwhat legal requirements we have.\n\n239\n00:13:56.245 --> 00:14:01.065\nSo, we can ask the right questions then,\nwhen we go in to pick a provider.\n\n240\n00:14:01.065 --> 00:14:02.715\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n241\n00:14:02.715 --> 00:14:04.825\nYou do not roll dice on this.\n\n242\n00:14:04.825 --> 00:14:08.955\nThat could have a very bad\noutcome if you roll dice and\n\n243\n00:14:08.955 --> 00:14:11.240\njust, And choose the wrong provider.\n\n244\n00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.900\nRIM providers, you should always\nbe asking the right questions and\n\n245\n00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.750\nmake sure you're getting the right\nanswers, or the answers you want to it\n\n246\n00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.550\nbefore you commit to say that's\nthe provider that I want.\n\n247\n00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:29.070\nBecause they're not just\ngonna volunteer this to you.\n\n248\n00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.950\nAnd it's not that they're\ntrying to hide something,\n\n249\n00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:35.000\nit's just that They're gonna give\nthe answers in their site, that they think\n\n250\n00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.830\nare the ones that most people wanna ask,\nmost people wanna know the answers to.\n\n251\n00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:42.800\nThe other ones, they give you\ncontact numbers and e-mails so\n\n252\n00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:47.520\nthey can talk to, that you can talk to\nthem, and hopefully get those answers.\n\n253\n00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.924\nI would tell you, if you can't\nget the answers that you want or\n\n254\n00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:55.331\nneed to go forward, then maybe you should\nconsider going to another provider.\n\n255\n00:14:55.331 --> 00:15:00.292\nYou don't want to have to,\nas Mike was saying about all the money and\n\n256\n00:15:00.292 --> 00:15:02.790\nexpense that goes into this.\n\n257\n00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:04.800\nYou wouldn't want to do this short term.\n\n258\n00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.570\nYou don't want to find out that,\nhey, you go with someone and\n\n259\n00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:08.420\nthey can't do what you want.\n\n260\n00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.660\nNow you gotta figure out another thing and\nroll everything over to that one.\n\n261\n00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.360\nI don't want to do that.\n\n262\n00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.230\nI'm going to be pretty\npissed if that happens, and\n\n263\n00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:19.130\nso Let's just try to avoid that, and make\nsure we get the right questions asked.\n\n264\n00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:24.760\nUsually, the providers will not be\nevasive when you ask these questions,\n\n265\n00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:28.210\nbut you have to ask them,\nbecause they will not offer it either.\n\n266\n00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:33.170\n>> And as simple as,\nare you hosting it here in the US?\n\n267\n00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.964\nWho, as a new person getting ready\nto bring their stuff to the cloud,\n\n268\n00:15:36.964 --> 00:15:40.237\nyou might just assume, hey,\nit's a US-based business,\n\n269\n00:15:40.237 --> 00:15:44.250\ntheir servers are probably in their\nback room or in somewhere like that.\n\n270\n00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:45.677\nAnd that's not the case anymore either.\n\n271\n00:15:45.677 --> 00:15:48.244\nEven these smaller providers\ncan be outsourced or\n\n272\n00:15:48.244 --> 00:15:51.493\nhave data centers all around the world,\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n273\n00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:55.388\nThey want to give us that fault tolerance\nand things like that, or Like us, for\n\n274\n00:15:55.388 --> 00:15:59.639\nexample, with our services that we use, we\nhave it hosted in different places around\n\n275\n00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:02.080\nthe world primarily for\nspeed of connectivity.\n\n276\n00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.440\nBut, it just shows you that a smaller\nshop can still have their stuff spread\n\n277\n00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.370\nall around the world.\n\n278\n00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:08.395\nSo, we gotta keep that in mind.\n\n279\n00:16:08.395 --> 00:16:11.734\nAnd then other deployment\noptions we gotta think about,\n\n280\n00:16:11.734 --> 00:16:14.105\nthe whole public versus private thing.\n\n281\n00:16:14.105 --> 00:16:18.326\n>> Yeah, and this is something\nthat just kinda, to hit on again,\n\n282\n00:16:18.326 --> 00:16:24.185\nwhen we're doing this, when we're choosing\nwhat the right solution is for you.\n\n283\n00:16:24.185 --> 00:16:25.175\nWe already hit on it.\n\n284\n00:16:25.175 --> 00:16:30.120\nIf those hosting issues that we talked\nabout aren't suitable for you, or\n\n285\n00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.610\nthe risks are too high, I mean,\nyou can't get a nice warm,\n\n286\n00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:38.180\nfuzzy feeling that they've vetted\nthe people they're working for, that\n\n287\n00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.020\nthey're gonna maintain availability, that\nthey're gonna be able to be compliant,\n\n288\n00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.140\nwhich is another question\nyou would be asking.\n\n289\n00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.570\nFor example, let's say you are in health\ncare, hey do you have any experience?\n\n290\n00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.250\nAsk your provider.\n\n291\n00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:53.270\nDo you have any experience\nwith HIPAA compliance?\n\n292\n00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.320\nDo you understand what that is?\n\n293\n00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.230\nOkay, if you don't,\nnot the end of the world.\n\n294\n00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:02.000\nDo you have any other clients that\nare in the field of health care?\n\n295\n00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.680\nCan I talk to those to see what they're\ndoing, what they're encountering?\n\n296\n00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.506\nSee if they can get you the information or\n\n297\n00:17:08.506 --> 00:17:10.560\nsee if they can put you\nin touch with someone.\n\n298\n00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:16.148\nIf they can't do that, I for one,\nif they can't give me that warm,\n\n299\n00:17:16.148 --> 00:17:20.658\nfuzzy feeling on that, or\nthat they can provide that,\n\n300\n00:17:20.658 --> 00:17:25.680\nthen that's a check mark against\nthem with me going to that.\n\n301\n00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:31.280\nAnd that may ultimately be a case where\nI do need to go to a private solution.\n\n302\n00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.160\nBut remember, a private solution\ncomes with some serious expense.\n\n303\n00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.570\nA cloud isn't something as much as they\nwould like you to have you believe by when\n\n304\n00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.440\nwe watch TV, or go on certain\n\n305\n00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.840\nwebsites where you could have\nthis personal cloud for home.\n\n306\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:48.770\nThey have that.\n\n307\n00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.110\nIt's a big hard drive is what\nthey're offering you at home.\n\n308\n00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:53.390\nIt's not a personal cloud, okay?\n\n309\n00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:54.370\nIt's not.\n\n310\n00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:55.820\nI hate that term.\n\n311\n00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.890\nIt's not that easy.\n\n312\n00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:01.832\nAnd when you set up a real cloud,\nthat requires some serious investment and\n\n313\n00:18:01.832 --> 00:18:07.200\nserious time and serious manpower to\nget that done, and done correctly.\n\n314\n00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.030\nNotice how I said that there's that one\n\n315\n00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.950\ncompany I know in California\ndoes health care.\n\n316\n00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:15.850\nNotice I told you took them\na year to get that set up.\n\n317\n00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:17.990\nIt's because of this process.\n\n318\n00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:19.320\nThey had to do it thoroughly.\n\n319\n00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:23.840\nThe solution they have now,\nthey absolutely love it,\n\n320\n00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:29.020\nhave had no problems with it, performs\nreally well, is perfectly compliant.\n\n321\n00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.230\nIt's an auditable system.\n\n322\n00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.610\nThey're able to do all that,\nwhich is what you wanna have.\n\n323\n00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:38.450\nIf you can't do that with a public\nsolution, then you may have to go private.\n\n324\n00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.330\nAlso remember from the get go,\nthere are certain\n\n325\n00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:47.440\nthings that might say that there's no\noption for you to do public, period.\n\n326\n00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.530\nIt's not even choice.\n\n327\n00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:51.470\nDon't even go ask anybody\nbecause you're just not allowed.\n\n328\n00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:57.854\nOne that I would point out which would\nbe obvious, it would be the military.\n\n329\n00:18:57.854 --> 00:19:02.100\nMilitary, they're not gonna\ngo to Google or Microsoft.\n\n330\n00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:06.020\nHey, can you host our stuff for\nour new secret X111, whatever?\n\n331\n00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.457\nNo, they're not gonna do that.\n\n332\n00:19:07.457 --> 00:19:12.000\nThey're gonna bring a cloud\ncompletely into the private\n\n333\n00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:16.720\nspace and do all the security and\nstuff like that right there.\n\n334\n00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:17.980\nIt will not go any place.\n\n335\n00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.340\nThat will be housed in its own\nfacility with all the bells and\n\n336\n00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.360\nwhistles to protect it,\nand all the other stuff.\n\n337\n00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:30.160\nIn that type of situation,\npublic was pulled right off the table.\n\n338\n00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.180\nThere was no choice.\n\n339\n00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:32.780\nThere was private, and there was private.\n\n340\n00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.290\nThat's your two choices right there.\n\n341\n00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.130\nSo do remember that.\n\n342\n00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.920\n>> Now, Sean, just because we go private,\n\n343\n00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.780\nthat doesn't immediately make it\na secure solution though, right?\n\n344\n00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.810\nYou see, I think, people making that\nassumption like, well if I go public,\n\n345\n00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.990\nI've got to worry about\nother people accessing it,\n\n346\n00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:51.050\nsharing me a multi-tendency,\nall this stuff.\n\n347\n00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.110\nIf we go private, we eliminate all that.\n\n348\n00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:57.060\nIt's perfectly secure and\nwe're good to go.\n\n349\n00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.640\n>> You're absolutely right in there.\n\n350\n00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:04.080\nA private solution does not equate\nto having a secure solution.\n\n351\n00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:08.710\nAny more than having,\nthan taking your computer, or\n\n352\n00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:14.020\nyour notebook, whatever, and leave it on\nyour desk cuz it's gonna make it secure.\n\n353\n00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:15.610\nIt just doesn't.\n\n354\n00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:22.040\nOne of the jokes I make about this is,\nyou look at these TV shows,\n\n355\n00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.770\nbut you could also ask\na real police officer this.\n\n356\n00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.098\nIt's like, do you lock your\nlocker at the station house?\n\n357\n00:20:29.098 --> 00:20:32.155\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like you'd expect the last people.\n\n358\n00:20:32.155 --> 00:20:34.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like, do you log it?\n\n359\n00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:35.370\nReally, why?\n\n360\n00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:40.440\n[LAUGH] Yeah,\nI've got friends that are police\n\n361\n00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.170\nofficers and they're always kinda going,\nyeah, it's a good question.\n\n362\n00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.140\nAll right, I get it.\n\n363\n00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.550\nI get it.\n[LAUGH] It's something for\n\n364\n00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.550\na good laugh, but it's the same thing.\n\n365\n00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.930\nThey're not stupid.\n\n366\n00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:58.940\nIt's something that even though it's in\nthat environment, there's a risk there.\n\n367\n00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.390\nSo they're just eliminating that risk.\n\n368\n00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.320\nSo just because you have a private cloud,\n\n369\n00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.170\ndoes not mean that it's\ngonna be 100% secure.\n\n370\n00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.730\nI mean, there's things that you\ncould still have to deal with.\n\n371\n00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:12.100\nYou could do a lot of stuff and\nstill have to deal with problems.\n\n372\n00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.780\nWhat are you gonna do if someone\ndecides to target you and\n\n373\n00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.960\ndoes denial of service against you?\n\n374\n00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:18.600\nGuess what?\n\n375\n00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.710\nYou're not immune to that.\n\n376\n00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:25.340\nSo you're gonna have to\ndo things to mitigate or\n\n377\n00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:30.510\nblunt the impact of that,\nbecause someone can very well target you.\n\n378\n00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.495\nWhat about the stuff we had with\nthe cloud search provider, public?\n\n379\n00:21:33.495 --> 00:21:37.665\nWe said about them vetting in doing\nbackground checks on the people out there\n\n380\n00:21:37.665 --> 00:21:39.115\nthat are working for them.\n\n381\n00:21:39.115 --> 00:21:44.485\nSo you're telling me if to pry with you,\ntrust with everyone you work with 100%.\n\n382\n00:21:44.485 --> 00:21:47.855\nThere's places where they'll eat\nyour food out the fridge, so-\n\n383\n00:21:47.855 --> 00:21:49.534\n>> I'm looking around the studio now and\n\n384\n00:21:49.534 --> 00:21:50.905\nit's thinking no, I don't.\n\n385\n00:21:50.905 --> 00:21:53.819\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n386\n00:21:53.819 --> 00:21:57.980\nthat's the type of thing\nyou have to deal with.\n\n387\n00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:02.268\nI mean, you have to remember that you\ncould have those same type of problems\n\n388\n00:22:02.268 --> 00:22:04.120\nhappen with the private cloud.\n\n389\n00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.360\nSo you're not out of the woods.\n\n390\n00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:11.380\nIt just means that you now have\npositive control of the situation, and\n\n391\n00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.560\npresumably you can do more.\n\n392\n00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:16.615\nBut you also have to do more.\n\n393\n00:22:16.615 --> 00:22:19.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you gotta think if that's something\n\n394\n00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.700\nyou're willing to do as part of this.\n\n395\n00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.150\nThere are a lot of benefits.\n\n396\n00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:26.830\nThere's a lot of downsides in doing\nthat too with either solution\n\n397\n00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.460\n>> Now if we go with the public solution,\n\n398\n00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:32.480\nand even a private solution\nwith the way it's laid out,\n\n399\n00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.350\nthere's documents that\ncan kinda protect us,\n\n400\n00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:39.770\nthat can assure that we get our certain\nlevel of service provided to us.\n\n401\n00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:43.390\n>> Yeah, there's things that\nwill hep you with either one and\n\n402\n00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.240\nthe thing that's gonna come down to that,\nfirst of all is when you get down to it,\n\n403\n00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.310\nis really knowing which\nyou expect right upfront.\n\n404\n00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.980\nIt's what your requirements are gonna be.\n\n405\n00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.750\nNow, that's gonna be speaking in\nreally any four languages to anybody\n\n406\n00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.180\nthat's playing out,\nthat's doing anything in IT.\n\n407\n00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:02.270\nYou should not be in the situation\nwhere you are saying,\n\n408\n00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.090\nwell, how do I figure out what my\nrequirements are for the cloud?\n\n409\n00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.730\nWell, that's really gonna be the same\ntype of stuff you figure out for\n\n410\n00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:14.920\nyour regular applications and all that for\nyour current environment that's non-cloud.\n\n411\n00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.470\nYou're gonna look at how much space\nyou need, what type of horse power,\n\n412\n00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.730\nthe hosting environment you need.\n\n413\n00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:25.120\nAnd see if that can be provided by\nwhatever solution you're looking at,\n\n414\n00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.800\nnow and on into the future.\n\n415\n00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.250\nAnd can it be upgraded as necessary.\n\n416\n00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:33.249\nThat's what's gonna happen to make\nsure you're not bottle-necked or\n\n417\n00:23:33.249 --> 00:23:35.360\nbogged down by anything.\n\n418\n00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:42.110\nSo, you should be in good shape if you\nreally start thinking about those things.\n\n419\n00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:44.770\n>> All right, so Sean,\nlot of great information there.\n\n420\n00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:48.532\nWe had a lot of things we've got to think\nabout when we're picking that service\n\n421\n00:23:48.532 --> 00:23:52.294\nprovider, deciding what it is we wanna go\nwith or who it is we wanna go with, and\n\n422\n00:23:52.294 --> 00:23:55.660\nwhether or not we wanna do it ourselves or\nget somebody else to do that.\n\n423\n00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.560\nWe've got those service level\nagreements that we've gotta consider.\n\n424\n00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.550\nAnything else we gotta think\nabout with our hosting providers?\n\n425\n00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:04.260\n>> Yeah,\nyou did mention that last one in there,\n\n426\n00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.990\nthe service level agreement in there.\n\n427\n00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:10.600\nThat is the one little detail here that,\nyeah, I didn't wanna overlook.\n\n428\n00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.689\nI'm glad you brought that up.\n\n429\n00:24:12.689 --> 00:24:15.139\nI'm still on West Coast time,\npeople, okay?\n\n430\n00:24:15.139 --> 00:24:19.470\nJust get off my case.\n\n431\n00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.640\nBut service level agreements,\nsee who's responsible for what.\n\n432\n00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.190\nThat's really what it comes down to,\nis who's responsible for\n\n433\n00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.090\nwhat in the event of a failure?\n\n434\n00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:29.700\nAlways ask those questions and\n\n435\n00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:33.670\nmake sure you gonna SLA that really\nyou understand and defines that.\n\n436\n00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.530\nSo you don't catch yourself up\nthe creek without a paddle.\n\n437\n00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:41.290\nYou definitely do not wanna\nbe in that situation.\n\n438\n00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:47.330\nRemember one of the things you\nwanna when you're doing this and\n\n439\n00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:52.160\nclarifying it is, goes back to some of the\nstuff we talked about earlier is that you\n\n440\n00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.340\nneed to make sure that what\nthey're gonna provide you.\n\n441\n00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.360\nAnd make sure you ask the right\nquestions upfront and\n\n442\n00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.620\nthen get the SLA based on that.\n\n443\n00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.292\nAnd so you understand ahead of time.\n\n444\n00:25:02.292 --> 00:25:05.640\nDon't ever, ever, ever wait for\na disaster to happen and\n\n445\n00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.550\nsaying, let's go dig out the paperwork.\n\n446\n00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.690\nOkay, it says right here, oops.\n\n447\n00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.550\nNo, no that's not where you wanna be.\n\n448\n00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.590\nLook at it ahead of time to make sure\nyou've asked the right questions.\n\n449\n00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:17.520\nYou've got it in black and\nwhite, got it into document and\n\n450\n00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.330\nthat meets your expectations and\nthen you should be good.\n\n451\n00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:24.090\nBut also make sure you've\ngot the legal stuff met too,\n\n452\n00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:26.980\ncuz sometimes the legal side\nhas something to say about.\n\n453\n00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.030\nTechnical side, we might say hey,\nthis is great, looks awesome.\n\n454\n00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:30.649\nLet's go ahead.\n\n455\n00:25:30.649 --> 00:25:32.000\nLet's run with that.\n\n456\n00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.988\nLegal side says whoa, whoa, not so fast,\n\n457\n00:25:34.988 --> 00:25:40.390\nthat doesn't meet the requirements that\nwe need you to have to make us happy.\n\n458\n00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.380\n>> Yeah, all right, well, very good, Sean.\n\n459\n00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.840\nI think that's gonna do it for\nthis one, though.\n\n460\n00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.570\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n461\n00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:49.480\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n462\n00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.520\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n463\n00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:56.920\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.340\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and with\nme today is the infamous Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.980\nAnd this one Sean, we're going to\nbe talking about some security and\n\n5\n00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.040\nCSP requirement.\n\n6\n00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.300\n>> Yeah that's, you know things we\nneed to start getting into, and\n\n7\n00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.080\nreally what this is starting to get\ninto when we talk about requirements.\n\n8\n00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.690\nYou know we could actually say\nthis is getting into risk.\n\n9\n00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.890\nIt's that, you know risk,\nconsidering risk would definitely be\n\n10\n00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.920\npart of the requirements that you\nhave to really bring into the mix.\n\n11\n00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.670\nBecause you really can't just start going\ndown the road, applying a solution,\n\n12\n00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.580\nlook at all the other requirements,\n\n13\n00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.450\nwithout thinking about one of\nthe core requirements here.\n\n14\n00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:56.050\nIt's not just a matter of what you can do,\nbut what also can negatively impact you.\n\n15\n00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.968\nSo we definitely want to throw it\nunder the banner of requirements so.\n\n16\n00:01:01.968 --> 00:01:05.520\nWe're going to start talking about, you\nknow, what these risks actually are that\n\n17\n00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.860\nyou really really need to\ntake a good close look at.\n\n18\n00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.850\nRemember, from a legal standpoint,\nit is a requirement.\n\n19\n00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.040\n>> And it's not the same as what, we might\nhave done all kinds of risk management.\n\n20\n00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.810\nShould have done all kinds of risk\nmanagement internally on our own\n\n21\n00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.650\ncorporate network.\n\n22\n00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.520\nBut taking it out to the cloud,\nthat changes everything.\n\n23\n00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.740\n>> Yeah, absolutely, as there's a lot\nof things that are going to come into\n\n24\n00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.860\nplay here that we really need\nto take a good, close look at.\n\n25\n00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.300\nSo let's start going through the list of\nthings that are going to come into play.\n\n26\n00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.470\nOne of the things I kind of like to\nbring up right at the beginning,\n\n27\n00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.040\nis something that's happened for a long\ntime, and it's not a cloud specific thing,\n\n28\n00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.620\nbut it's definitely carried over\nin the cloud, is think about\n\n29\n00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.000\nany of you out there, think about\nthe real world situations you've been in.\n\n30\n00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.850\nI'm pretty sure there's a lot of you,\nI know I've seen them I've seen these\n\n31\n00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.450\nsituations, with probably a good number\nof situations that you could name or\n\n32\n00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.475\nhave experienced or been involved in.\n\n33\n00:02:09.475 --> 00:02:12.880\nWhere a solution was chosen and\n\n34\n00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.410\nonce that solution was chosen, everything\ngot pushed into it and it was integrated,\n\n35\n00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.000\nand once you did it, you're pretty much\nhandcuffed to that solution, that was it.\n\n36\n00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.400\nGetting out of that solution,\nwhatever it was, or\n\n37\n00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.380\nwhatever it is, could be a very,\nvery costly, if not impossible endeavor.\n\n38\n00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.130\nI've seen that numerous times\nin my time in this field.\n\n39\n00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.870\nYou name it, you name the industry,\nor name a situation.\n\n40\n00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.380\nI've seen a number of them.\n\n41\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.110\nI can think of once when I used to work\nwith mechanical engineering people or\n\n42\n00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.060\ncomputer design people,\njust more generically, where\n\n43\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.970\nthey would go with one solution,\nand it did a good job for them,\n\n44\n00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.680\nbut once they start scaling up,\nit needed more requirements.\n\n45\n00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.790\nThe solution that they had said on\nthe box that they got it, it said,\n\n46\n00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.640\noh yeah you can very easily export out to\nthis format which is universal format, and\n\n47\n00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.230\nyou can go ahead and put it into\nwhatever program you want, no problem.\n\n48\n00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.370\nWe're 100% compatible.\n\n49\n00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.240\nYeah, well that was a line of bunk,\nis what it was.\n\n50\n00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.256\nBecause it was never 100%.\n\n51\n00:03:25.256 --> 00:03:30.550\nSo one of the situations I was in,\nlike I said, they had that solution.\n\n52\n00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.620\nThey exported stuff out onto the other\none, all their designs were hopelessly out\n\n53\n00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.690\nof scale, and so they had to spend a lot\nof hours actually re-scaling those, and\n\n54\n00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.460\nthen checking for accuracy, because there\nwas manufacturing being done off those.\n\n55\n00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:51.360\nSo, it was something that cost them\na lot of time and money, took them quite\n\n56\n00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.460\na long time to get resolved, they got it\nresolved, but took quite a long time so\n\n57\n00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.920\nyou got to think about that lock in\nscenario is that even if a provider says\n\n58\n00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.860\nthat, well you can easily move your\nstuff of our solution whatever it is,\n\n59\n00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.140\nthink about what that would actually\nentail to do that if you had to do it.\n\n60\n00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:19.320\nMaybe do kind of like a thought experiment\nis what they call it in science.\n\n61\n00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.830\nDo something like that on paper,\nwhere you figure out what it would take if\n\n62\n00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.230\nyou did have to move out of that\nsolution to go to another one.\n\n63\n00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.510\nWhat would it were require and\nhow practical it would be.\n\n64\n00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.848\nThink about this, it's like saying,\nhow many, you look at the database for\n\n65\n00:04:37.848 --> 00:04:38.530\na CSV file.\n\n66\n00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.680\nCSV file, you can export from one\ndatabase to another using a CSV file.\n\n67\n00:04:42.835 --> 00:04:46.085\nYeah, you can but--\n>> You lose a little bit in\n\n68\n00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:46.905\nthe translation.\n\n69\n00:04:46.905 --> 00:04:47.645\n>> Yeah.\n\n70\n00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:48.945\n>> The formatting.\n\n71\n00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:52.055\n>> You know, I mentioned, I think in a\nprevious episode, a cloud service provider\n\n72\n00:04:52.055 --> 00:04:55.735\nthat had gone out of business, and we're\ntalking about picking your providers.\n\n73\n00:04:55.735 --> 00:04:59.695\nThere were there was more than one\ncompany that had chosen this as,\n\n74\n00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:04.580\nthem as their, CSP, their cloud service\nprovider, and when that cloud service\n\n75\n00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.180\nprovider went under, these companies went\nunder, you know, because they had invested\n\n76\n00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.750\ntheir time, and they're effort, and their\nmoney in this particular provider, and\n\n77\n00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.250\nthere was no recovery for them\nbecause of all the data loss they had,\n\n78\n00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.400\nthey couldn't afford to just go and switch\nto another provider and start all over.\n\n79\n00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.190\nSo, it actually cost them their business.\n\n80\n00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.620\nSo, it's It is one of those things,\nyou've got to plan ahead.\n\n81\n00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.050\nYou've got to take everything\ninto consideration.\n\n82\n00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.821\nAnd you've got to have these\nquestions that you're asking and\n\n83\n00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:32.170\nmake sure they meet all the requirements.\n\n84\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.645\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that's a really good\n\n85\n00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:40.525\npoint to bring up,\nis the whole idea of what would happen if\n\n86\n00:05:40.525 --> 00:05:44.915\nthat cloud service provider went under,\nor just cease doing business?\n\n87\n00:05:44.915 --> 00:05:47.245\nIt does happen from time to time.\n\n88\n00:05:48.395 --> 00:05:50.055\nThat's another thing, and\n\n89\n00:05:50.055 --> 00:05:54.925\nI'm definitely not trying to pick-up on\na small business or something like that,\n\n90\n00:05:54.925 --> 00:05:59.250\nbut that is one of the risks with\ngoing with a smaller business,\n\n91\n00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.970\nis that they may not be able to long term,\nbe able to sustain what they have.\n\n92\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.400\nSo, you need to think of, is that\nsomething that you're willing to kind\n\n93\n00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.420\nof put your money and\nyour effort behind and keep using that,\n\n94\n00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.170\nbecause that may be a situation where you\nmight save money going with a small one,\n\n95\n00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.700\nit might feel good about helping a small\nbusiness, I can understand that, but\n\n96\n00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.550\non the other hand it could\ncause some problems with you,\n\n97\n00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.340\nif they're not on stable footing or\nif the economy takes a downturn and\n\n98\n00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.590\nthey go away,\nyou may have a mess on your hands.\n\n99\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.330\nAnd it may not be a mess that's easily,\nis easy something to clean up,\n\n100\n00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.455\nand it also factors in when its\nnot just the termination part.\n\n101\n00:06:44.455 --> 00:06:47.310\nIt's also what happens if they,\nif they're smaller and\n\n102\n00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:53.745\nhas a failure of any sort of hardware or\npersonnel, natural disaster.\n\n103\n00:06:53.745 --> 00:06:57.095\nAnything like that happens,\nhow would they be able to deal with it?\n\n104\n00:06:57.095 --> 00:07:01.125\nThat could be another big, big,\nbig part of your planning, and\n\n105\n00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:02.760\nshould be a big part of your planning.\n\n106\n00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.095\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n107\n00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:07.465\n>> And we're just starting\nto scratch the surface.\n\n108\n00:07:07.465 --> 00:07:09.630\nNot to worry about it.\n\n109\n00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.570\nYou know, and another one that comes in,\nwould be a really good one to bring in,\n\n110\n00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:20.300\nwould be the whole idea of a loss\nof governance of your stuff,\n\n111\n00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.290\nis that you give something to a provider,\nand you\n\n112\n00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.840\nare going to have to make some adjustments\nto move your stuff to a provider.\n\n113\n00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.938\nWe understand that, we know that.\n\n114\n00:07:30.938 --> 00:07:33.940\nThere's going to be some adjustments,\nquestion of how many adjustments, and\n\n115\n00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:35.930\nare those adjustments going to\nbe practical for you to do.\n\n116\n00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.680\nOne of the things that makes\nan adjustment practical for you to do or\n\n117\n00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.240\nnot is if you're going to be able\n\n118\n00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.340\nto maintain whatever your business does\nby making that switch over to the cloud.\n\n119\n00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.245\nKeep in mind that moving to the cloud,\nit's like anything.\n\n120\n00:07:53.245 --> 00:07:55.172\nSecurity, anything else like that.\n\n121\n00:07:55.172 --> 00:07:57.124\nThe job of security, the cloud,\n\n122\n00:07:57.124 --> 00:08:00.141\nany technology to support\nwhat the business does.\n\n123\n00:08:00.141 --> 00:08:03.763\nIt's not for the business\nsupport in the other way around.\n\n124\n00:08:03.763 --> 00:08:06.253\nSo I shouldn't have a situation where,\nfor example,\n\n125\n00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:10.000\ninstead of security supporting the\nbusiness, the business supports security.\n\n126\n00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.600\nThat's not the way it works.\n\n127\n00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.590\nIt's supposed to be the other way around.\n\n128\n00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:16.970\nThe cloud isn't there for\nthe business to support it.\n\n129\n00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:19.660\nIt's for the cloud to support\nthe operations of the business.\n\n130\n00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:26.210\nSo you gotta make sure that, whatever\nCSP you're hammering your solution into,\n\n131\n00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.500\nthat it's while you make\nadjustments it's not enough that\n\n132\n00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.400\nyou're gonna lose a situation where the\ntwo aren't in concert with one another.\n\n133\n00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.140\nYour business goals are going one way and\nyour cloud's going another way.\n\n134\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.720\nOr your business is now starting\nto bend it too far towards\n\n135\n00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.850\nsupporting what the cloud does and\nthe other way.\n\n136\n00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.110\nYou don't want to change\nthe way things work too much.\n\n137\n00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.610\n>> So\na lot of things we gotta keep in mind.\n\n138\n00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.920\nHow do we even, I don't know if you can\nanswer this, you know, how do we know what\n\n139\n00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.530\nwe should ask, or what kind of\nthings we should look for in a CSP?\n\n140\n00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.930\n>> You know, that's a very,\nvery good question.\n\n141\n00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:09.730\nFortunately, you know,\nyou can get guides from the CSA,\n\n142\n00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:13.110\nCloud Security Alliance,\nthey have guidance on their site.\n\n143\n00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.360\nThat will help you do your planning.\n\n144\n00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:21.260\nMicrosoft has, for their products,\nthey have the planning design guides.\n\n145\n00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.910\nYou can actually find one for their cloud\ntechnologies and, the Microsoft ones,\n\n146\n00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:28.780\nto be fair, you don't have to just\nuse it with their technologies,\n\n147\n00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.930\neven though Microsoft may\nnot like hearing that, but\n\n148\n00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.730\nyou don't have to use it just with their\ntechnologies because it, it still is,\n\n149\n00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:39.990\nyou still can, do enough with\ntheir planning design guides\n\n150\n00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.946\nto get yourself moving in the right\ndirection of questions to ask.\n\n151\n00:09:44.946 --> 00:09:49.480\nSo you can get that way,\nbut really, a lot of it's\n\n152\n00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.290\ngonna come down to not just asking asking\nwhat the provider can do, but asking what,\n\n153\n00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.390\nfunny enough, what it is you really\nneed to move over to that environment.\n\n154\n00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:00.890\nIf you don't know what you're\nmoving over to the environment,\n\n155\n00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:05.080\nI can't very well go to a CSP and\nsay hey, can you do this, this and this?\n\n156\n00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.410\nOkay, yeah, we can do this.\n\n157\n00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:12.168\nGood, well what are the technical\nrequirements of the solution you're\n\n158\n00:10:12.168 --> 00:10:13.730\ntrying to put in place?\n\n159\n00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.740\nWhat encryption requirements?\n\n160\n00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:16.780\nWhat compliance requirements?\n\n161\n00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.910\nWhat audit requirements?\n\n162\n00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.690\nWhat incident handling requirements?\n\n163\n00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.570\nYou know,\nall those things are gonna come into play.\n\n164\n00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:25.860\nYou need to make sure you have those\nall itemized and put in place.\n\n165\n00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.660\nYou should already know those.\n\n166\n00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.080\nHopefully you already know those.\n\n167\n00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.880\nIf not, then just do some investigation.\n\n168\n00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.950\nI mean, I understand that you\nmay not be the one that set up\n\n169\n00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:35.950\nthe solution originally.\n\n170\n00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.620\nYou may not be the one that set up that\ndatabase or set up the directory server,\n\n171\n00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.590\nset up that authentication mechanism,\nwhatever it is.\n\n172\n00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:48.020\nYou may not be the one that set it up and\nhopefully the documentation is there but\n\n173\n00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:53.500\nif it's not, then you can go through and\nanalyze that solution to figure out these\n\n174\n00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.160\nthings are critical, these things are not\nso critical and move on down a list and\n\n175\n00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.990\nsay prioritize them and then see,\nhey, where does that CSP fit in?\n\n176\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.420\nCan they support those type of things?\n\n177\n00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.340\nCan they support integration\nwith Active Directory?\n\n178\n00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.650\nCan they support Kerberos?\n\n179\n00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.550\nCan they support, do they have,\n\n180\n00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:18.760\ncan they support whatever my\ntechnology is, my web application?\n\n181\n00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.220\nWhatever it is,\ncan they work with me on that?\n\n182\n00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.600\nOr can I add in, from my end,\nsomething that can do that?\n\n183\n00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.290\nSo there's a lot of questions you\ncan ask but you can go to places,\n\n184\n00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:33.520\nlike I said, the CSA.\n\n185\n00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.960\nThe Cloud Security Alliance.\n\n186\n00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.160\nYou can go to Microsoft.\n\n187\n00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.350\nThere are different\nguidance out there on it.\n\n188\n00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.340\nBut a lot of it's gonna be on the folks,\n\n189\n00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.790\nit's gonna be on you to see what your\napplication or hosting requirements are.\n\n190\n00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.930\nAnd then tack those on to everything else\n\n191\n00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.350\nto make sure that those\nquestions are getting asked.\n\n192\n00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:56.630\nRemember, as much as you want to say\n\n193\n00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:00.990\nthat those CSPs are there to help you out,\n\n194\n00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:05.230\nthey're also there to sell this stuff,\nand that's what their main focus is.\n\n195\n00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:10.140\nSo, they may not actually ask you\nall the questions, they don't\n\n196\n00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:14.260\nknow your environment, they don't know all\nthe questions to ask you, they're gonna\n\n197\n00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.150\nask you some generic questions,\nprobably off a checklist or something.\n\n198\n00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.360\nSo they are not going to\nask you all those things.\n\n199\n00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.820\nYou're going to have to know,\ndo you do backups?\n\n200\n00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:25.440\nOkay, how often do you do backups?\n\n201\n00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.280\nIf you don't do back ups,\nwhat does it cost to get that service?\n\n202\n00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.970\nHow can I get it to be done more?\n\n203\n00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.770\nDo those backups go off site?\n\n204\n00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:35.510\nAre those backups encrypted?\n\n205\n00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:41.130\nAbout your personnel,\nhow do you verify who works for you?\n\n206\n00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.610\nDo you screen these people?\n\n207\n00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:47.790\nDo you have experience working\nwith people in this industry?\n\n208\n00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.270\nHow, what's your average uptime?\n\n209\n00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.980\nThose type of things.\n\n210\n00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.600\nWhat does your SLA look like?\n\n211\n00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.130\nAsk all those type of things\nto make sure that you\n\n212\n00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:05.070\nare getting the things answered\nthat you need to get answered.\n\n213\n00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.872\nYou know,\nit's kind of a big loaded question.\n\n214\n00:13:07.872 --> 00:13:08.742\n[CROSSTALK] to ask that let me tell you.\n\n215\n00:13:08.742 --> 00:13:11.321\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Almost hated to throw that at you, but\n\n216\n00:13:11.321 --> 00:13:11.902\ngood job.\n\n217\n00:13:11.902 --> 00:13:13.989\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] No problem that's what I am\n\n218\n00:13:13.989 --> 00:13:14.880\nhere for.\n\n219\n00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.220\n>> All right and then we've got you know\npotential solutions to security problems.\n\n220\n00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:24.340\nSo the good side is moving to the cloud\nand doing our proper risk analysis.\n\n221\n00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.990\nCould be.\n\n222\n00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.030\nThere are solutions to our problems.\n\n223\n00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:31.812\n>> Yeah, there's always gonna be,\nor hopefully always gonna be,\n\n224\n00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:34.710\nsome sort of solution\nyou can put in place.\n\n225\n00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:39.530\nAnd this is something where when you get\ndown to it, that some of the risks that\n\n226\n00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:44.470\nyou face from a technical standpoint, this\nmay also be the breaking point between\n\n227\n00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.210\na private cloud and a public cloud.\n\n228\n00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:55.780\nOne of the things I'd put in place would\nbe a large denial of service attack.\n\n229\n00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.070\nA large denial of service attack, if you\nhave a cloud that you're hosting and\n\n230\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.710\nit's acting as the back\nend of something that,\n\n231\n00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:05.820\nto an application that you're\nexposing to the public.\n\n232\n00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.620\nIt's possible a denial of service\ncould hit you and hit you pretty hard.\n\n233\n00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:13.600\nIf you're a business you've gotta\nthink about how you're gonna start\n\n234\n00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:19.680\ndefeating that attack, and maybe you\ndon't have the horsepower to do it.\n\n235\n00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.810\nAnd if you still need to maintain\na private cloud, if you can't push out to\n\n236\n00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:27.240\nthe public cloud and let them deal with\nthat, then you're gonna have to figure out\n\n237\n00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.350\nwhat other solutions could\nyou snap in place to do it.\n\n238\n00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.860\nHeck, it may very well be something where\nyou're gonna do a software infrastructure\n\n239\n00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:38.400\nas a service, where you start\ngetting some sort of situation where\n\n240\n00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.320\nyou do load balancing or something through\nthere to kind of distribute that out and\n\n241\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.610\nkeep it from being as bad.\n\n242\n00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:51.110\nSo you can find solutions\nto these types of things.\n\n243\n00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.600\nSomething else could be in there,\n\n244\n00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:57.050\nwhich is a little less tangible, is what\nabout something they call an economic?\n\n245\n00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:01.472\nThis is a unique cloud service one or\nit's one they started\n\n246\n00:15:01.472 --> 00:15:06.540\nbringing out more with the cloud is,\nan economic denial service.\n\n247\n00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.670\nYou can tell from the name\nwhat they're implying, but\n\n248\n00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:13.552\nit's one that they started really\nbringing into the forefront when\n\n249\n00:15:13.552 --> 00:15:16.230\nthey started bringing\nin the cloud into play.\n\n250\n00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.250\nAnd EDOS would be where you start\ngetting your economic flow or\n\n251\n00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.811\nfinancial flow impacted by someone\ndoing something to either disrupt\n\n252\n00:15:24.811 --> 00:15:29.678\nwhat your service flow is or knock it\noffline, or throw a monkey wrench into\n\n253\n00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:34.760\nit to keep you from doing,\nyour revenue stream from going through.\n\n254\n00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.020\nAnd the thing that you can have happen\nwith the cloud is that if you have\n\n255\n00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:44.880\na multi-tenant solution, someone else here\nhas picked a fight here with somebody or\n\n256\n00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.360\nhas done something stupid or\nwhat have you.\n\n257\n00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.388\nThey just, somehow, became the person\nwith that big red target on their back.\n\n258\n00:15:52.388 --> 00:15:55.602\nWell now what's happening is\nthat they're getting hit but\n\n259\n00:15:55.602 --> 00:15:59.146\nyour in a multi-tenant cloud so\nyou're getting hit by that too.\n\n260\n00:15:59.146 --> 00:16:00.887\nSo you are being slowed down by whatever.\n\n261\n00:16:00.887 --> 00:16:05.067\nYou know, shenanigans, either directly or\nindirectly, they're involved in.\n\n262\n00:16:05.067 --> 00:16:09.422\n>> Yeah cuz when they attack they're\nattacking the service provider,\n\n263\n00:16:09.422 --> 00:16:12.890\nwhich then can't provide\nyou services either.\n\n264\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.020\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n265\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:19.630\nThat's kind of a unique situation there\nthat you can run into with the cloud.\n\n266\n00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:21.826\nGranted, you would see another\ncloud hosting environment's.\n\n267\n00:16:21.826 --> 00:16:25.683\nBut it is, tends to be a little more\nunique with the cloud situation,\n\n268\n00:16:25.683 --> 00:16:30.074\nbecause there's such a diverse amount\nof stuff that could be hosted there, so\n\n269\n00:16:30.074 --> 00:16:32.350\nyou really gotta kind of think about it.\n\n270\n00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:36.580\nAnd it could also be done by someone\nelse in that same environment,\n\n271\n00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.320\none of the other tenants doing some\nsort of testing or monkeying around and\n\n272\n00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.540\nconsuming resources,\nmore than they're supposed to be.\n\n273\n00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.112\nAnd it could be impacting you.\n\n274\n00:16:45.112 --> 00:16:49.101\nGranted, that cloud hosting should\nbe provisioned in such a way that\n\n275\n00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:53.158\nthey're limited a bit more and\nsandboxed a bit more from doing that but\n\n276\n00:16:53.158 --> 00:16:57.662\nit still could happen and that's something\nthat you may have to think about.\n\n277\n00:16:57.662 --> 00:16:59.930\nBut there are solutions to everything.\n\n278\n00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.060\n>> Then you got,\ncontractual security requirements.\n\n279\n00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:05.960\n>> Yes.\n\n280\n00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:11.390\nThat's a mouthful,\nreally is what you have there.\n\n281\n00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:16.440\nThe contractual security requirements,\nthose are, you know the name says it,\n\n282\n00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.060\nyou know it's something that you have,\nyou know, on paper.\n\n283\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.480\nYou know saying,\nyou know this is what we're agreeing to.\n\n284\n00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.250\nKind of like an SLA type thing, saying\nthat this is what they're agreeing to.\n\n285\n00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:29.860\nWhat you're doing if you're doing\na contractual security requirement,\n\n286\n00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:35.638\nit's a security form of\nan SLA saying that that\n\n287\n00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:40.520\nCSP is guaranteeing you a certain level\nof performance, a certain level of\n\n288\n00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.870\nsecurity and guaranteeing that certain\nmechanisms are gonna be kept to date.\n\n289\n00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.970\nAnd ready, and that they're always\ngoing to be improving those.\n\n290\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.510\nBecause you need to have these\nthings in place, you know.\n\n291\n00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:56.110\nFor example,\nif you're working in certain industries,\n\n292\n00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.150\nthey have to have 256 bit encryption,\nlet's say.\n\n293\n00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:02.340\nIt has to be AES,\nit can't be some other, something else.\n\n294\n00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.660\nIt has to be that.\n\n295\n00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.790\nSo they're telling you that they are\ncontractually obligated to maintain that.\n\n296\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.590\nAnd that they will maintain support for\nthat.\n\n297\n00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.440\nThey won't just go ahead and\n\n298\n00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.370\nswitch it out to something else\nwithout you knowing about it.\n\n299\n00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:17.580\nThey'll tell you that hey,\nwe're not supporting that or\n\n300\n00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.030\nwe're closing out support for\nthis or we're upgrading it.\n\n301\n00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:25.850\nThey'll tell you those sorts of things,\nso it's setting it up.\n\n302\n00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.260\nSaying that this is, that this is\nwhat they're going to agree to.\n\n303\n00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:31.380\nWhich is definitely one of the things\nthat you want to have in place.\n\n304\n00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.760\nReason why we say that,\nis you look at for example, and\n\n305\n00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.910\nI could pull this as an example\nfrom the real world.\n\n306\n00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:44.090\nLook at the situations where we have,\nyou know one of the things I mentioned in\n\n307\n00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:48.480\nour ethical hacking stuff and all that, is\nlook at the situation where you have SSL,\n\n308\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:54.690\nthere's a SSL downgrade attack,\nwe called it a poodle attack or whatever.\n\n309\n00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.525\nWe call it that where we could actually\ndown grade cause a server to downgrade to\n\n310\n00:18:59.525 --> 00:19:05.955\nan older version of SSL, and then use\nthat as a way to, that broken version,\n\n311\n00:19:05.955 --> 00:19:10.325\nas a way to attack a system and\nbypass the stronger SSL systems.\n\n312\n00:19:10.325 --> 00:19:13.445\nWell, ISPs just went ahead and\ndid the right thing, and\n\n313\n00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:17.130\nthey disabled that across the board, well.\n\n314\n00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:19.810\nLet's just say you happen to be one\nof the people that still needed\n\n315\n00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.290\nold support for that.\n\n316\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:25.220\nIf you had a contract with them saying\nthat hey, we need to support this,\n\n317\n00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.860\nthey're gonna need to find a way to make\nsure that that is still supported for\n\n318\n00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:32.470\nwhatever it is, for\nyou at least, specifically.\n\n319\n00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.910\nOr they're gonna tell you hey,\nwe can't support you anymore,\n\n320\n00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.070\nand you're out of your contract.\n\n321\n00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:38.520\nYou can take your,\n\n322\n00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:43.670\nyou could take your stuff and go find\nanother ISP that can provide that for you.\n\n323\n00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.820\nSo that's something that\ncould also come into play.\n\n324\n00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.930\nThey have to make a change to your\nenvironment and tell you, hey,\n\n325\n00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:52.610\nwe either can't support you anymore or we\nhave a better alternative and so on and so\n\n326\n00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.450\nforth in there.\n\n327\n00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.526\n>> Now is this also where\nwe should also discuss,\n\n328\n00:19:55.526 --> 00:19:57.240\nsay I'm doing software as a service.\n\n329\n00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.350\nSo all I really need is an application.\n\n330\n00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:04.900\nAnd so I'm not dealing with cuz that means\nat this point they're responsible for\n\n331\n00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.080\neverything there down.\n\n332\n00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:11.480\nPatching the operating systems, doing\nsecurity patches against things like that.\n\n333\n00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.670\nIs that where this would fall in?\n\n334\n00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.330\n>> That's definitely where\nthis is gonna fit in.\n\n335\n00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.720\nYou would hope it's on regular\nmaintenance that they're doing it,\n\n336\n00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.860\nbut don't just assume, hey,\nyou know how that saying goes.\n\n337\n00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.910\nDon't just assume they're\ngonna go through and do that.\n\n338\n00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.510\nWhat you wanna do is\nyou want to make sure.\n\n339\n00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.320\n>> Because your SLA probably\nwouldn't mention that.\n\n340\n00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.230\nIf your SLA is going to deal with,\nif you're doing software as a service.\n\n341\n00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.980\nYou're just talking about software.\n\n342\n00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:31.660\n>> Yeah.\n\n343\n00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.370\nThat's absolutely the thing.\n\n344\n00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:38.990\nAnd you know it's a good point that's\nyou're kind of digging into another\n\n345\n00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:44.350\narea in there is that always kinda know\nwhen you look at those different models,\n\n346\n00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:48.810\nmake sure you understand where you\nactually stand and what they're\n\n347\n00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.860\nproviding or supposed to be providing and\nwhat you're bringing to the table and\n\n348\n00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:57.130\nwhat they're guaranteeing and\nwhat they're not guaranteeing.\n\n349\n00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:01.070\nSome providers will only guarantee that,\njust the platform, that's it.\n\n350\n00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.170\nThat's all they're providing.\n\n351\n00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.250\nEverything from here on up,\nyou're putting it on our stuff, but\n\n352\n00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.500\nwe have nothing to do with that.\n\n353\n00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:07.450\nWe don't care.\n\n354\n00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:08.090\nWe've got this.\n\n355\n00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:10.410\nSo if you call up and go hey,\nsomething up here broke.\n\n356\n00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.660\nAll right, whatever, good to know.\n\n357\n00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.100\nWell how's life treating you?\n\n358\n00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:17.210\nThat's kind of what they're gonna have.\n\n359\n00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:20.780\nSo you wanna make sure you know\nwhat you're responsible for and\n\n360\n00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.720\nhave that contract.\n\n361\n00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.723\nThat is SLA, but\nthat is stuff going into the whole thing.\n\n362\n00:21:25.723 --> 00:21:30.000\nMake sure you're asking that\nquestion when you go in and\n\n363\n00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.641\nsaying, well, at the end of the day,\nwhat are you going to,\n\n364\n00:21:34.641 --> 00:21:40.931\nif I go with you as a solution provider,\nwhat extent does your support help me out?\n\n365\n00:21:40.931 --> 00:21:43.611\nOr what's the extent of\nyour responsibilities.\n\n366\n00:21:43.611 --> 00:21:47.127\nIs it just this little piece at the bottom\nand everything else up here is mine?\n\n367\n00:21:47.127 --> 00:21:52.993\nOr you're going to have additional\nservices I can purchase a la carte and\n\n368\n00:21:52.993 --> 00:21:58.840\nadd on top of this or am I just kind of,\ngotta figure it out on my own.\n\n369\n00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.410\nYou know, you'll have to make sure\nyou make those determinations.\n\n370\n00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.540\nThat was one of the things that I\ntalked about that health care provider,\n\n371\n00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:11.610\nthat's one of the issues they\nrun into is that these CSP's\n\n372\n00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:17.530\nweren't really, the bigger ones were\na little more forthcoming with it.\n\n373\n00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:20.310\nYou still had to know how to\nask the right questions, but\n\n374\n00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.220\nthey were better prepared for it.\n\n375\n00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:27.330\nSome of the mid-range ones that were\nout there and some of the smaller ones,\n\n376\n00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.820\nwhich were pretty much off the table for\nthat solution.\n\n377\n00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:34.110\nOr for that situation, they just weren't\nprepared to answer those questions.\n\n378\n00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:37.800\nThey really couldn't guarantee where they\nwere gonna come in, they're saying, oh\n\n379\n00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:42.360\nwell we can figure that out, we can write\nthat up for you, or something like that.\n\n380\n00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.480\nThey're a little more kinda fuzzy on it,\nwhere the bigger ones were saying, hey,\n\n381\n00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:51.560\nif you go for platform as a service, well,\nwe'll support everything up to this point,\n\n382\n00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.860\nor software as a service,\nwe'll go up to this point.\n\n383\n00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.980\nThis is all our stuff,\nand then this is all you.\n\n384\n00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.990\nAnd then we guarantee this level of\nservices if there's a problem or\n\n385\n00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.560\nsupport if there's a problem.\n\n386\n00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.970\nThey put those sayings out there, but\nyou always want to be clear on that.\n\n387\n00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.540\nDo not find out after the fact.\n\n388\n00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:13.260\nThere have been cases where people have\nput stuff out in the cloud, had a failure,\n\n389\n00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:18.570\nand they just expected they would have\nwith their websites years ago, that\n\n390\n00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:22.260\nif a website failed, hey there's probably\na backup someplace where they could just\n\n391\n00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:26.190\ncall up their ISP and say, hey well,\nrestore the back up from such and such.\n\n392\n00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.870\nWell, that doesn't necessarily\nhappen with the cloud.\n\n393\n00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:30.819\nYou can't just call up and\nsay, oh restore backup.\n\n394\n00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.300\nWhat, you didn't pay for that.\n\n395\n00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.990\nSo, we don't have a backup,\nthat was what you're supposed to be doing.\n\n396\n00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.250\nWhy you calling us?\n\n397\n00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.119\nYou know, so\nmake sure you understand those things,\n\n398\n00:23:41.119 --> 00:23:45.263\nbecause when you have a failure, and\nyou need a backup restored for example,\n\n399\n00:23:45.263 --> 00:23:47.457\nthat's not the time you wanna find out.\n\n400\n00:23:47.457 --> 00:23:51.496\nSo, always ask the right, always make\nsure you're asking these questions.\n\n401\n00:23:51.496 --> 00:23:55.320\nBut, again, a lot of these are pretty\nstandard questions for the most part.\n\n402\n00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:01.124\nThese are really standard\nthings to get established.\n\n403\n00:24:01.124 --> 00:24:03.210\nThere's things you should\nbe asking yourself.\n\n404\n00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:04.070\nAre you doing?\n\n405\n00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.520\nI mean look at your own environment\nright now with that application or\n\n406\n00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.350\nthat situation or\nwhatever you're planning.\n\n407\n00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:14.610\nLook at it and say, what do you need\nto have, to not only make it run.\n\n408\n00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:19.580\nBut to make it so you feel comfortable\nin the long term that your requirements\n\n409\n00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:21.940\nare gonna be met and that you're\nnot gonna get sued or whatever.\n\n410\n00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:25.020\nMake sure you know those, and\nthen transition those over the cloud.\n\n411\n00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.790\n>> And that's probably\na little advantageous, too.\n\n412\n00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:29.250\nIf you've been running that\napplication in-house and\n\n413\n00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.750\nnow you're transitioning up to the cloud,\nyou got a pretty good idea already.\n\n414\n00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.180\nIf you've done your risk management,\n\n415\n00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.430\nthen you got a pretty good\nidea of what needs to be done,\n\n416\n00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:41.150\nwhat needs to be in place in the event\nof a failure or something like that.\n\n417\n00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:43.440\nSo, that might make that a little\nbit easier, that transition, and\n\n418\n00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.900\nmaybe you've already got an idea\nof what questions you need to ask.\n\n419\n00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:52.410\n>> Yeah, you should definitely have a good\nidea of what questions should to be asked,\n\n420\n00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.940\nbecause you already know that if\nyou're spinning a new solution up,\n\n421\n00:24:55.940 --> 00:25:01.180\nthen you should still be able to figure\nout what questions need to be asked.\n\n422\n00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.660\nNow, also we're saying when\nyou talk about your provider,\n\n423\n00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:09.130\nthere are some things that may\nnot necessarily be forseeable.\n\n424\n00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:11.840\nAnd you gotta figure how you\nmight have to deal with those.\n\n425\n00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:14.810\nOne of the ones that I think of and\nI've had to encounter with some of my\n\n426\n00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:19.530\nown personal stuff that\nI host Is what happens\n\n427\n00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:23.630\nif the person that's providing these\nservices gets acquired by someone else.\n\n428\n00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.490\nThat does happen and-\n>> Are the contracts still gonna\n\n429\n00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.170\nbe honored, do you have to go and\nresign those,\n\n430\n00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:34.120\nare they gonna provide\nthe same level of service?\n\n431\n00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.560\n>> Yeah, that comes into play.\n\n432\n00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.790\nI know for one of the services I work for\n\n433\n00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:45.160\nwith my own business,\nthey, I signed up for\n\n434\n00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:51.090\nthem years ago and\ngot really nice secure and safe email.\n\n435\n00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:54.510\nIt did all this really,\nyou know, cool stuff for me.\n\n436\n00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.300\nAnd they got acquired by Rack Space.\n\n437\n00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.360\nAnd Rack Space, you know,\nthey've been great.\n\n438\n00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.500\nYou know, they honored the contract\nwith them so that was awesome.\n\n439\n00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:09.280\nThey went ahead and they still provide\nme even better levels of service than\n\n440\n00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.910\nthe previous provider did.\n\n441\n00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.530\nI've been completely happy with it.\n\n442\n00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:19.604\nBut they still honor the contract even\nthough they are losing money on it.\n\n443\n00:26:19.604 --> 00:26:20.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They still honor the contract.\n\n444\n00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.780\nI pay like, $5 a month for super,\n\n445\n00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:28.680\nsuper secure email hosting really for\na bunch of accounts.\n\n446\n00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:33.050\nThere normal stuff for that now is like\n$100 bucks a month and so they're so\n\n447\n00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:37.830\nlike hey as long as you don't cancel\nit we're charging you $5 a month so.\n\n448\n00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:41.883\n>> But unfortunately not all service\nproviders are going to be that friendly\n\n449\n00:26:41.883 --> 00:26:42.740\nand that nice.\n\n450\n00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.274\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n>> Not all of them so let's hear it for\n\n451\n00:26:46.274 --> 00:26:47.610\nRack Space.\n\n452\n00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:53.370\n[LAUGH] Most of the time\nthe contracts will be honored,\n\n453\n00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.650\nat least to a certain point,\nat least to a certain point in time.\n\n454\n00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.790\nAt least to the expiration of\nthe contract, and they won't renew it.\n\n455\n00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:00.670\nThey'll say,\n\n456\n00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:04.100\nokay it's gonna go up to the new\nstandards of whatever they have in place.\n\n457\n00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:09.240\nOr they may just say okay,\nas long as you stay with them.\n\n458\n00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.640\nMy stuff did with Rack Space they said,\n\n459\n00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.180\nhey you know you have been with them for\na while.\n\n460\n00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.710\nWe're acquiring them.\n\n461\n00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.280\nHey you can keep that rate\nas long as you want it.\n\n462\n00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.230\nYou know so\n\n463\n00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:23.740\nyou can keep the services plus we are\ngoing to give you some more stuff with it.\n\n464\n00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.520\nFor as long as you want.\n\n465\n00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:30.480\n>> Well Sean, I tell you a lot of things\nto consider as we start either trying to\n\n466\n00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.510\nimplement a cloud solution, or\nmigrate to a cloud solution.\n\n467\n00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:36.740\nAnything else you want to\nthrow into this episode?\n\n468\n00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.080\n>> No, I think we kinda covered\nthe big issues at this point.\n\n469\n00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.771\nI think we've kinda beaten\nthat one to death, right?\n\n470\n00:27:42.771 --> 00:27:44.570\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, well ladies and\n\n471\n00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:48.000\ngentlemen I hope you enjoyed watching this\none, but for now we're gonna sign off for\n\n472\n00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.350\nITProTV.\n\n473\n00:27:49.350

00:00:16.933\nI'm your host Mike Robert and\nwithe me today is Shean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:20.531\nAnd Sean, in this one we\nare going to continue on and\n\n5\n00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:25.809\ntalk about risk management and how that\nchanges as we move our enterprise or\n\n6\n00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:28.601\nchoose to implement a cloud solution.\n\n7\n00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:32.570\nBecause it does change,\nrisk management is still risk management,\n\n8\n00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.030\nobviously, but, different considerations?\n\n9\n00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.010\n>> Yeah, there's plenty and plenty of\nconsiderations when you get down to it,\n\n10\n00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.380\nwhen you talk about risks.\n\n11\n00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.728\nReally the two that we kinda need to\nreally look at is, we talked about some\n\n12\n00:00:46.728 --> 00:00:52.440\nof the administrative side stuff in our\nprevious episode when we look at risk.\n\n13\n00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.623\nBut, there are other ones\nthat come into play, and\n\n14\n00:00:56.623 --> 00:01:00.152\nreally that's both technical and legal.\n\n15\n00:01:00.152 --> 00:01:05.620\nSo, first of all, let's break it down to,\nwhen we talk about risk in the cloud.\n\n16\n00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.290\nI think, it's kind of a good thing to look\nat what issues do you have to deal with\n\n17\n00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.240\nthat aren't part of the cloud, just so\nyou kind of can position those just a bit.\n\n18\n00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.640\nBe aware of that stuff like network\ntraffic and outages, stuff like that.\n\n19\n00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.210\nThat's not stuff that's\nspecific to the cloud,\n\n20\n00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.750\nthat's stuff that would\nbe outside of this.\n\n21\n00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.350\nSo if you have something like an ISP\nfailure, something like that,\n\n22\n00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.140\nthat's gonna be something\ncompletely outside the cloud.\n\n23\n00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.570\nSocial engineering stuff,\n\n24\n00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.620\nwhere people get access to information\nthat way, outside of the cloud.\n\n25\n00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.260\nIt's not something the cloud's\ngonna help you out with.\n\n26\n00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.090\nStuff like sniffing traffic,\nsession hijacking, breaking encryption.\n\n27\n00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.940\nStuff going back and\nforth outside the cloud.\n\n28\n00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.580\nSo those are traditional issues that\naren't specific to that environment.\n\n29\n00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.610\nSo the stuff that we need to worry about\nis stuff that the cloud does introduce.\n\n30\n00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.895\nSo we've got a few.\n\n31\n00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:09.615\nWe definitely have a few\nthat happened in there.\n\n32\n00:02:09.615 --> 00:02:14.283\nWe talked about ones like the technical\nside, we talked about resource exhaustion.\n\n33\n00:02:14.283 --> 00:02:19.165\nWhere you have, even though you have\nmore resources that you can bring\n\n34\n00:02:19.165 --> 00:02:23.945\nto bare in the cloud, the reality is\nit's still a finite amount of resources.\n\n35\n00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:26.545\nSo, there is a possibility that you could\n\n36\n00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:29.200\nreach a point where you\nhave resource exhaustion.\n\n37\n00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.620\nWhether it's a lack of storage space,\nprocessing power, memory, any of\n\n38\n00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.930\nthose things, you still could come into a\nplace where you have resource exhaustion.\n\n39\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:38.470\nOkay.\n\n40\n00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.310\nSo something I'd also by the way\nthrow in along the lines,\n\n41\n00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.570\njust to talk about the exhaustion\nof things, is something that fits\n\n42\n00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.460\nmore on the administrative side, that also\nis a question of exhausting resources,\n\n43\n00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.030\nis don't forget licensing\nis an issue in here too.\n\n44\n00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.080\nWe're talking about all this,\nremember, you're getting software,\n\n45\n00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.540\nthere's a certain amount\nof licenses you get.\n\n46\n00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.740\nYou can't exhaust licenses.\n\n47\n00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.110\nAnd who manages those licenses,\ncould come into a technical, legal, or\n\n48\n00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.220\nadministrative issue.\n\n49\n00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.600\nAll across the board on that one.\n\n50\n00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.800\n>> Now,\nwhen you talk about resource exhaustion,\n\n51\n00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.190\nare we talking about the cloud service\nprovider not having enough disk space,\n\n52\n00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.740\nor\n>> Us not being able to afford that\n\n53\n00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.330\nelasticity to jump up\nto extra gigs of RAM or\n\n54\n00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.555\nbandwidth when we need it, or both.\n\n55\n00:03:29.555 --> 00:03:36.220\n>> Nothing can fight the power\nof a bean counter, right.\n\n56\n00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.380\nSo.\n\n57\n00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.730\nIt's, that's a good point, actually.\n\n58\n00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.400\n>> Huh.\n>> Because that's something\n\n59\n00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.110\nthat's not traditionally thought\nof when you go for this.\n\n60\n00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.880\n>> Whew.\n>> You\n\n61\n00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.252\nreally brought up a new one in here.\n\n62\n00:03:47.252 --> 00:03:49.522\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So give you credit for that one.\n\n63\n00:03:49.522 --> 00:03:51.260\n>> Because I'm thinking to myself,\n\n64\n00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.680\nif I go with one of those\nsmaller cloud service providers.\n\n65\n00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.110\nThey're trying to grow their business.\n\n66\n00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.950\nThey're getting more and more customers.\n\n67\n00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.500\nThey themselves could run out\nof resources at the same time.\n\n68\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.270\nAnd then, you go to Amazon, and they\ngot this great elasticity, and they can\n\n69\n00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.240\njust spawn up new instances, as many as\nthey want, as quickly as they need to.\n\n70\n00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.115\nBut only if I pay for that service, right?\n\n71\n00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:16.200\n>> [LAUGH] So\neither way I guess we're out of resources.\n\n72\n00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.170\nDoesn't really matter which reason why.\n\n73\n00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.310\n>> Yeah, it could be that you're running\nout of resources for a number of reasons.\n\n74\n00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.560\nWe talked just the technical side though\nbecause that would be probably more of\n\n75\n00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.460\nan administrative thing with\nwhat you're talking about.\n\n76\n00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:37.030\nBut definitely a valid issue as you do\nhave to consider when we talk about\n\n77\n00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.470\nsize, or scale, and\ncapabilities of providers.\n\n78\n00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.670\nThe smaller ones just are gonna\n\n79\n00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.160\ntap out quicker than the larger ones,\nthat's just the way it's going to work.\n\n80\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.180\nSo, when we talk about resource\nexhaustion, we, from the technical side,\n\n81\n00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.170\nwe have, if you look at a cloud, a cloud\ncan be the amount of resources we have.\n\n82\n00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.280\nThat can be chopped up,\njust like slicing a cake,\n\n83\n00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.250\nif you want to look at it that way.\n\n84\n00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.930\nThe question is,\nwhen you talk about resource exhaustion.\n\n85\n00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.720\nIt could be a question of under or\nover provisioning.\n\n86\n00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.210\nYou could be under provisioned,\nwhat you need to get your job done.\n\n87\n00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.570\nBecause they could say,\nokay this is your slice of everything.\n\n88\n00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.830\nThat may be that you are,\n\n89\n00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.180\nhave not been given enough and you're\nbumping against that pretty quickly.\n\n90\n00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.900\nCould also be that they over\nprovision the cloud, too.\n\n91\n00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.070\nIf they over provision that cloud,\n\n92\n00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.160\nwhat if you're talking about\nsomething like this small provider.\n\n93\n00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.690\nThey want to grow so they're very\nquickly like, hey, you want a piece?\n\n94\n00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:45.720\nYou want a piece, you a piece.\n\n95\n00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.930\nThey keep handing it out and all of a\nsudden they're very quickly running out of\n\n96\n00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.270\nresources and they may try to squeeze\nanother one in, squeeze another one in.\n\n97\n00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.942\nIn which case, at some point, you have to\ngive, that they're going to start having\n\n98\n00:05:56.942 --> 00:05:59.853\nproblems, they don't have that\nelasticity that you mentioned.\n\n99\n00:05:59.853 --> 00:06:02.011\nSo yeah, that could be a problem, and\n\n100\n00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:06.200\nremember that also could be something\nthat could happen internally too.\n\n101\n00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.950\nThat's where, the kind of,\nexperience comes in.\n\n102\n00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.940\nDon't kid yourself.\n\n103\n00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.950\nYou have a private cloud,\nsome of these issues will still pop up.\n\n104\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.540\nIs that you could decide to set up\nthis private cloud and what happens,\n\n105\n00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.670\nyou start chopping it up.\n\n106\n00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.100\nWe've got a little bit more, got a little\nbit more, got a little bit more.\n\n107\n00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.648\nAnd bean counters aren't something that's\nexclusive to the public space either.\n\n108\n00:06:24.648 --> 00:06:26.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So they could also say,\n\n109\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.859\nyou're not getting any more space so\ndeal with it.\n\n110\n00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:36.820\nSo that would be one technical thing that\ncould happen in a more generic sense.\n\n111\n00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:42.140\nOther things we have, like I said,\nfrom a technical side,\n\n112\n00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.130\nremember the ideas of least privileged and\nseparation of duties?\n\n113\n00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.390\nYou're kinda relying,\nif you're going with a public provider,\n\n114\n00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:58.000\nyou're relying on them to make sure\nthat no one has been given too much and\n\n115\n00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.100\nthat these things are being audited.\n\n116\n00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.230\nSo you don't run into a situation\nwhere someone decides to,\n\n117\n00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.300\nat the CSP they decide\nto kinda throw a fit.\n\n118\n00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.710\nAnd all the sudden, they're locking you\nout of your stuff because of some dispute\n\n119\n00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.520\nat the place, or\nthat someone's doing something goofy.\n\n120\n00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.680\nThat has been known to happen, and\nnot necessarily with the cloud.\n\n121\n00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.530\nBut Happen in IT before, so nothing\nsaying it couldn't happen with the cloud.\n\n122\n00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.940\nSo do you think about that?\n\n123\n00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:34.460\nOther things I had put into place\nwith this, the management consoles.\n\n124\n00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.200\nA lot of these CSPs, if you're buying\na solution to them will have a management\n\n125\n00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.290\nconsole where you can manage your\nservices and stuff like that.\n\n126\n00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.730\nThink about how they're\nsecuring those things.\n\n127\n00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:45.330\nThat would be a big technical risk.\n\n128\n00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.371\nI probably don't have\nto remind a lot of you\n\n129\n00:07:48.371 --> 00:07:53.288\nbecause a lot of you were with us\nwhen we did our ethical hacking deal.\n\n130\n00:07:53.288 --> 00:07:57.924\nI showed you with a few google hacks\nhow easy it was to find these log in.\n\n131\n00:07:57.924 --> 00:08:02.983\nPortals and some of these hidden things\nthat people don't think you're gonna find,\n\n132\n00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:05.250\nhow easy it is to locate them.\n\n133\n00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.460\nYou know if I'm able to locate them\nthat easily through Google hacking,\n\n134\n00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.940\nsomeone else could be able to do it too,\n\n135\n00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.272\nand now they have something to focus\non and see if they can get in that way.\n\n136\n00:08:14.272 --> 00:08:16.800\nSo they really being able to, or\n\n137\n00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.040\nis the provider really protecting those\nsaying, to the best of their ability.\n\n138\n00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.520\nThey may be focusing on ease\nrather than security, and\n\n139\n00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.030\nwe know how that kind of plays out.\n\n140\n00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:34.998\nOther things I would put here, I've got\nin my notes a whole list of things here.\n\n141\n00:08:34.998 --> 00:08:37.588\nData leakage.\n\n142\n00:08:37.588 --> 00:08:39.000\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n143\n00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.115\n>> Is data getting out?\n\n144\n00:08:40.115 --> 00:08:45.200\nOr, is there any protections\nagainst data getting out and\n\n145\n00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.880\ngetting to places where it shouldn't be?\n\n146\n00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.530\nThat would be what data leakage would be.\n\n147\n00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:57.330\nAnd then another interesting part here,\ndeletion, a deletion and wiping of data.\n\n148\n00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.580\nThey're gonna be repurposing equipment,\nyou know, ask them what they do,\n\n149\n00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.850\nyou can ask the CSP what\nthey do to wipe data.\n\n150\n00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.180\nI don't know if I really ask them what\nthey do to dispose of stuff that might be\n\n151\n00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.010\nsomething that's unnecessary.\n\n152\n00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.680\nYou definitely can, but\nask them how when they\n\n153\n00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.850\nwipe free space on a drive, what they\ndo or what they use to do that so\n\n154\n00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.850\nyou can make sure that your stuff can't\nbe recovered through something else.\n\n155\n00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:29.290\nThat's a perfectly valid question to ask\nto make sure that those things are being\n\n156\n00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:30.352\nprotected.\n\n157\n00:09:30.352 --> 00:09:34.510\nI mean, when they get rid of an old drive,\nthat will also tell you, are they\n\n158\n00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:39.170\nwiping those things or what happens\nwith those when they get rid of them?\n\n159\n00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.400\nIn fact, if you get to a certain point,\nif you need to ask, hey,\n\n160\n00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.210\ndo your old drives get get melted down,\nor whatever.\n\n161\n00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:47.610\nIf you're getting to that level.\n\n162\n00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.440\nIt's a private cloud, come on.\n\n163\n00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.965\nJust stop asking questions.\n\n164\n00:09:51.965 --> 00:09:52.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n165\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.410\nyou need to kind of think,\nif they're gonna be doing that.\n\n166\n00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:03.750\nBut do remember, we've been through\nour forensics course already.\n\n167\n00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.900\nAnd if you've gone through and\nviewed that.\n\n168\n00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:10.190\nYou saw how we many different\nmethods we had to recover data that\n\n169\n00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.630\nwe would have thought was otherwise gone.\n\n170\n00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.850\nWe saw how easy it was\nto get that stuff back.\n\n171\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:22.770\nSo same thing you can easily apply\nin the cloud side of things.\n\n172\n00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.220\nSo, don't definitely do\nnot forget those ones.\n\n173\n00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.035\n>> And there's cloud specific\nthings we got to deal with.\n\n174\n00:10:30.035 --> 00:10:35.210\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> Yeah, a lot of these things would be\n\n175\n00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:40.870\nwe're kind of spinning it into the cloud,\na bit.\n\n176\n00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:47.900\nSo that wiping of data, it's something\nthat becomes more of an issue because when\n\n177\n00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.290\nyou look at the cloud, because we already\nknow about wiping data from other areas.\n\n178\n00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:55.700\nBut if you look at that and\nstart pushing it to the cloud situation,\n\n179\n00:10:55.700 --> 00:11:00.940\nyou can kinda see what's gonna happen\nis that when we are resizing stuff and\n\n180\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.250\nmoving stuff around and\nmore capacity is added and\n\n181\n00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:08.460\nstuff is provisioned differently, there's\na possibility that the space I was using\n\n182\n00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.970\nfor a long time could be\nused by someone else as\n\n183\n00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:17.710\nI maybe downsized my stuff or get\npushed off some place else or whatever.\n\n184\n00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.630\nIt could be used by someone else in\nwhich case there's a possibility,\n\n185\n00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.160\nhowever slight,\nthat they could be able to read that.\n\n186\n00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:30.650\nSo that would be how we would spin that\nin to the cloud environment, you know.\n\n187\n00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:35.610\nSo it would already be an issue when\nyou're getting rid of drives if you're\n\n188\n00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:38.010\njust talking a non-cloud environment.\n\n189\n00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.040\nBut now with that multi-tendency issue,\n\n190\n00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.920\nif you're going public, now it becomes It\nbecomes a whole different type of thing\n\n191\n00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.500\nthat could very easily fall into someone\nelse's hands under the right conditions.\n\n192\n00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.550\n>> So a lot of it just comes down to\ntaking our risk management that we do\n\n193\n00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:54.690\nalready and then kind of refocusing it and\nmaybe adjusting a few of\n\n194\n00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.520\nthe ways we look at some of\nthose risks to fit in the cloud.\n\n195\n00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.320\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n196\n00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:06.137\nAnd these are just some of the issues.\n\n197\n00:12:06.137 --> 00:12:08.431\nI mean,\nthere's a whole list of other ones.\n\n198\n00:12:08.431 --> 00:12:11.550\nThese would be the type of ones\nthat they would ask for your exam.\n\n199\n00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.290\nBut there's a whole bunch of other\nones that you could very well ask.\n\n200\n00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:19.330\nI mean, it could almost be an endless\nlist you just have to figure out the ones\n\n201\n00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.130\nthat are most important to you.\n\n202\n00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:25.390\nYou know, heck, there's ones that\naren't even directly on here yet\n\n203\n00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.800\nor that we haven't even talked\nabout which don't even directly\n\n204\n00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.960\ngive us any real serious guidance.\n\n205\n00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.760\nYou know one that I'd put in place when\nwe're talking about a technical issue\n\n206\n00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:41.530\nin the cloud and how the two come\ntogether is what are you gonna do\n\n207\n00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:46.460\nif you have a cloud provider\nthat you wanna go with?\n\n208\n00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:50.440\nYou have your solution over here,\nhow do you resolve\n\n209\n00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.620\nit if you have certain security standards\nhere for hardening your infrastructure and\n\n210\n00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:59.825\nyour applications that don't line up with\nwhat the provider wants to give you.\n\n211\n00:12:59.825 --> 00:13:00.630\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n212\n00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.260\n>> How are those two gonna come together?\n\n213\n00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.270\nAre you going to be able\nto work on a compromise, or\n\n214\n00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:11.280\nis the provider gonna say okay, we have a\nsolution where we can take care of that or\n\n215\n00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.550\nwe can kind of bring the two together.\n\n216\n00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.950\nOr you're just gonna say hey,\nwe can't work with you.\n\n217\n00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.780\nWe're gonna have to go\nto another provider, or\n\n218\n00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.690\nwe're just gonna have to say this is\ngonna be a completely private solution.\n\n219\n00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:28.440\nCuz that can be a big, big,\nbig problem because you may have security\n\n220\n00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.890\nstandards that exceed what they're\nwilling to provide, or can provide.\n\n221\n00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.340\n>> Right.\n\n222\n00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.310\nAnd then, of course,\n\n223\n00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:38.150\nwe can't talk about this without talking\nabout some of our legal requirements.\n\n224\n00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.820\n>> Yeah, let's just talk about a few\nbasic legal requirements in here.\n\n225\n00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.190\nI mean I don't wanna go\nad nauseam on this, and\n\n226\n00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.450\nI'm sure you don't want me to either.\n\n227\n00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:52.580\nThere's really four areas\nthat we can talk about here.\n\n228\n00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.380\nWhen we get to the first thing,\nas we mentioned, is subpoenas and\n\n229\n00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.640\nwhat they call ediscovery.\n\n230\n00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:04.500\nWhen we talk about those ones, we're\ntalking a situation is, how would you\n\n231\n00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:09.750\nrespond if certain information\nwas requested from you?\n\n232\n00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:15.670\nThere's a situation where the cloud\n\n233\n00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:20.379\nservice provider can get a subpoena and\nthey can just provide that.\n\n234\n00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:24.220\nCloud service providers,\ntypically want to stay out of that.\n\n235\n00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:28.730\nBecause they're kind of caught\nbetween a rock and a hard place there.\n\n236\n00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.510\nLike we were saying,\nthey've got to respond to a subpoena but\n\n237\n00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.620\nthey've also got responsibility\nto the customer.\n\n238\n00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.490\nAnd they in some cases are told,\nwell, this is confidential.\n\n239\n00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:42.767\nYou can't tell them, so they're put in\nan awful situation there where they're\n\n240\n00:14:42.767 --> 00:14:47.640\nnot part of the investigation, but\nthey are part of the investigation.\n\n241\n00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.400\nAnd they're trying to figure\nout which way to go on that, so\n\n242\n00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.240\nthat can be a tricky kind of one there.\n\n243\n00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.590\nSo if we take that out of the picture,\n\n244\n00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:00.420\nhow would you respond to\nsubpoenas in a timely fashion.\n\n245\n00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.610\nRemember, it's not something that oh,\nyeah, yeah, we'll get to it.\n\n246\n00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:08.300\nNo, no, there is a timely fashion\nI'll let the legal guys figure out,\n\n247\n00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.850\nabout getting extensions and\nstuff like that.\n\n248\n00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.540\nI don't care about those things,\nit's not my issue.\n\n249\n00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:19.896\nSo, you're figuring out how you respond\nto subpoenas in a timely manner.\n\n250\n00:15:19.896 --> 00:15:24.340\nAnd then e-discovery, e-discovery\nyou're getting right into forensics.\n\n251\n00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:26.750\nHow would you be able\nto take care of that.\n\n252\n00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:31.640\nSome situations when you do\ne-discovery there's a lot\n\n253\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.768\nof obligations that go with that and\nremember, since it is talking forensics,\n\n254\n00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:39.300\nthere is that whole matter, is it\nforensically sound when you gather it.\n\n255\n00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.807\nThey've been having some issues\nwith gathering information\n\n256\n00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:43.741\nfrom the cloud that\nthey're still resolving.\n\n257\n00:15:43.741 --> 00:15:49.448\nIf you're talking something like doing\ne-discovery on e-mails or different files\n\n258\n00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:55.010\nor stuff like that, that becomes an easier\nissue, but other things, not so easy.\n\n259\n00:15:55.010 --> 00:16:02.300\n>> So that's one of them.\n\n260\n00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.550\nOne of the ones we touched upon\nwas different jurisdictions.\n\n261\n00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.640\nWhen you moved across country and\ncounty lines.\n\n262\n00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.090\nThat causes a whole can of worms to open.\n\n263\n00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.030\nMay not apply to you, but\nyou do want to be aware.\n\n264\n00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.050\nIf you're in a regulated industry\nin any way, shape or form, ask.\n\n265\n00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.670\nJust ask.\n\n266\n00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.710\nWhere are you hosting this?\n\n267\n00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.610\nWhere are your hosting centers?\n\n268\n00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:23.970\nWhere's your stuff?\n\n269\n00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:27.640\nIf it's not entirely here in the US or\nyou can't give me a solution where\n\n270\n00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.700\nit's just restricted even though you have\nstuff overseas, that mine restricted,\n\n271\n00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.550\nmy data will never leave you assures,\n\n272\n00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.560\nthen you gotta walk away\nfrom that hosting provider.\n\n273\n00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.890\nYou can't do business with them.\n\n274\n00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.474\n>> And I think that's something that a lot\nof these providers are giving us that\n\n275\n00:16:40.474 --> 00:16:43.560\noption now because they realize\nthat things like that can arise.\n\n276\n00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.421\nAnd we might have regulations that say,\n\n277\n00:16:46.421 --> 00:16:51.650\nit has to be kept in the continental\nUnited States, or we can't put it in.\n\n278\n00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.190\nAnd they want our business, so they are\ngiving us those options now it seems like.\n\n279\n00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:58.245\n>> Yeah, it's becoming more of an option\nbecause they didn't realize that was\n\n280\n00:16:58.245 --> 00:16:59.720\ngoing to be a problem before.\n\n281\n00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:05.210\nNow, it's definitely becoming more of\nan issue that more people are aware of,\n\n282\n00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.950\nso they're saying yeah,\nwe need to be aware of that option.\n\n283\n00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:16.730\nSo you can sometimes just choose that\nright off the hosting provider's\n\n284\n00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:22.040\nconsole when you put their stuff in or\ncome up with some other solution.\n\n285\n00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:27.620\nSo, yeah, it is becoming more obvious and\nmore visible to do that.\n\n286\n00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:31.840\n>> And then I know we talked about\ninvestigative needs and things like that.\n\n287\n00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.880\nWe've got to worry about whether or\nnot the ISP is going to comply with\n\n288\n00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.500\nthose investigations or\nwhether they're going to not comply.\n\n289\n00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.940\nEither one could end up\ncausing us problems, I think.\n\n290\n00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:45.330\n>> Yeah,\nwhen we talk about investigations.\n\n291\n00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:48.360\nYou name it, I would actually\nput it in as investigation,\n\n292\n00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.030\nsince we mentioned forensics,\none thing I want to put in there.\n\n293\n00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.020\nThere's a whole idea of getting audited.\n\n294\n00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:58.530\nIf you get an audit,\nhow are you gonna respond to an audit?\n\n295\n00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.428\nHow, since you don't have the data\nnecessarily if it's a public cloud if\n\n296\n00:18:03.428 --> 00:18:06.590\nit's a private cloud, something different.\n\n297\n00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.459\nBut if it's a public cloud since\nit's not under your control,\n\n298\n00:18:10.459 --> 00:18:14.340\nhow would you respond to requests\nto audit what you're doing?\n\n299\n00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.050\nAnd how could you prove certain things?\n\n300\n00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:20.896\nThat there's not data leakage,\nthat there is a maintaining of isolation,\n\n301\n00:18:20.896 --> 00:18:22.890\nthat the patches are getting applied.\n\n302\n00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:29.545\nAnd, heck, I'd even factor into that whole\nthing, let's just say an audit's done and\n\n303\n00:18:29.545 --> 00:18:33.550\npatches weren't being\napplied in a timely fashion.\n\n304\n00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.050\nWhose head rolls over that?\n\n305\n00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:39.010\nAre you gonna be able to tell the CSP,\nhey.\n\n306\n00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.980\nIt says right here in the SLA that\nyou're the one responsible for that, and\n\n307\n00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.390\nyou clearly didn't do it.\n\n308\n00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.980\nI'm the one that got fined.\n\n309\n00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:50.580\nYou owe me whatever or I'm suing you or\nwhatever happens at that point.\n\n310\n00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.520\n>> So exactly, I was gonna say,\nfrantically search the SLA.\n\n311\n00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:58.446\n[LAUGH]\n>> So that pops in but a whole bunch of\n\n312\n00:18:58.446 --> 00:19:04.703\nthings coming up on that investigative\nsite, and from their forensic standpoint,\n\n313\n00:19:04.703 --> 00:19:10.040\nbut yeah, I would put in\nauditing with your checking that.\n\n314\n00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.910\nAnd to be fair on that when we're talking\nauditing and talking investigations I'd\n\n315\n00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.930\nalso mention since it's something\nthat we have talked in the past.\n\n316\n00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.315\nWhat about pen testing?\n\n317\n00:19:20.315 --> 00:19:24.720\nPIN testing does come in,\ndoes kind of fit somewhat under\n\n318\n00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:29.970\nthe investigation process,\nan auditing process for sure.\n\n319\n00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:34.680\nWhat are you going to do if you do if\nyou do have to, for compliance reasons,\n\n320\n00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.480\nhave to have a PIN test done.\n\n321\n00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.630\nYou cannot just bless somebody,\n\n322\n00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:42.760\neven though you're hosting, it's your\nstuff being hosted with a public provider.\n\n323\n00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.930\nYou cannot bless somebody.\n\n324\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:48.258\nYou can't tell me, well if I'm\ncoming in with a pen test for you,\n\n325\n00:19:48.258 --> 00:19:51.172\nhey, Sean, go attack Microsoft servers,\n\n326\n00:19:51.172 --> 00:19:55.060\nbecause I pay them this much a month,\nso go ahead and do it.\n\n327\n00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.358\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just make sure you only attack $100\n\n328\n00:19:57.358 --> 00:19:59.630\na month worth of their stuff,\nwhatever that equates to.\n\n329\n00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.963\n>> Their data center, figure out which\nmachines mine are being hosted on out\n\n330\n00:20:02.963 --> 00:20:06.507\nof the hundreds of thousands of racks they\nhave there, and just do a PIN test and\n\n331\n00:20:06.507 --> 00:20:09.430\nthe guys at the front door just\ntell them I sent you, it's okay.\n\n332\n00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.550\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, no problem, I'll give you a note?\n\n333\n00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.480\nJust put this on your shirt,\nand just go on in.\n\n334\n00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.710\nYeah, that's something that also\nbecomes a big issue, PIN testing.\n\n335\n00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.480\nYou're probably not gonna get permission\nfor that, you're not gonna get permission\n\n336\n00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.940\nfrom Microsoft for\nme to do a PIN test within reason.\n\n337\n00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.830\nThere's some stuff that will be allowed,\nbut\n\n338\n00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:32.090\nyou have to get it in writing as we know.\n\n339\n00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:34.730\nOther stuff will absolutely\nspecifically not be allowed,\n\n340\n00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.310\nthey just ain't gonna happen.\n\n341\n00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.270\nSo, you'll need to think about that.\n\n342\n00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.080\n>> Absolutely, cuz it could end up\naffecting other customers that don't want\n\n343\n00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.480\nor didn't ask for a PIN test or\nhave nothing to do with it.\n\n344\n00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.530\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n345\n00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.130\nThat could be a big nasty thing there,\n\n346\n00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:51.160\nthe hosting providers don't wanna\ntake on that liability issue.\n\n347\n00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:56.070\nSo, cuz as we say with pentesting,\n\n348\n00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.780\nthe methods I'm using no different\nthan a regular hacker would use.\n\n349\n00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.230\nI can knock stuff over and break stuff,\nso we need to be thinking about that.\n\n350\n00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:04.110\n>> And then one of the last things you\n\n351\n00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.930\nwant to talk about here is\nthe hosting considerations?\n\n352\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:10.150\n>> Yeah, the hosting considerations\nhere is when you're looking at all\n\n353\n00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.340\nof this stuff,\nlook at the legal issues and all of that.\n\n354\n00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:18.170\nWhat it's gonna come down to\nreally is public, private, hybrid.\n\n355\n00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:19.690\nI'm never gonna worry\nabout the community one.\n\n356\n00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.310\nIt's gonna be one of those things.\n\n357\n00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.700\nPublic and private is usually what\nit boils down to form most people.\n\n358\n00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.260\nPublic solution, private solution and\nonce they do that,\n\n359\n00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.310\nthen they figure out which\nones cost effective.\n\n360\n00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.530\nOn top of that they put all\nthe stuff in the bucket and\n\n361\n00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.860\nat the end of the day they\nfigure out which ones best.\n\n362\n00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:40.120\nRemember private sounds great on paper and\nit is good.\n\n363\n00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.510\nThe thing is is that you do have\na lot more money involved in that and\n\n364\n00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.410\na lot more work involved in it.\n\n365\n00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:48.560\nHowever, it's under your\ncontrol entirely so it's,\n\n366\n00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.180\nyou got everything under your lock and\nkey.\n\n367\n00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.340\nHowever, like I said that expense.\n\n368\n00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.650\nIf you go with public, you would offload\na lot of that stuff, it's cheaper.\n\n369\n00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:00.600\nYou can buy as needed,\nwhatever you want off the buffet,\n\n370\n00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.865\nyou can just add it in and however,\nnot entirely your control,\n\n371\n00:22:03.865 --> 00:22:08.295\nat someplace else and\nthat incurs other things that come in.\n\n372\n00:22:08.295 --> 00:22:11.795\nSo, if you remember,\ngoing back to a previous episode,\n\n373\n00:22:11.795 --> 00:22:16.042\nthat Jericho Cube, we looked at,\nthat's what that was talking about.\n\n374\n00:22:16.042 --> 00:22:18.512\nWhen you break everything down to it,\n\n375\n00:22:18.512 --> 00:22:23.232\nyou're moving from that light blue\ncube we had over to that purple cube.\n\n376\n00:22:23.232 --> 00:22:25.432\nIs how much can you do?\n\n377\n00:22:25.432 --> 00:22:27.642\nDo you wanna keep it internally?\n\n378\n00:22:27.642 --> 00:22:30.992\nDo you wanna insource it,\noutsource it, keep it internal?\n\n379\n00:22:30.992 --> 00:22:33.472\nYou wanna keep it inside your perimeter,\noutside your perimeter?\n\n380\n00:22:33.472 --> 00:22:34.780\nWhat's okay with you?\n\n381\n00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.890\nAnd that will determine, once you\nstart factoring in those three things,\n\n382\n00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:39.910\nwhere on that you're gonna be.\n\n383\n00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.190\nYou can start figuring out\nwhat type of hosting provider.\n\n384\n00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.360\nThat's how you use that tool.\n\n385\n00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.595\nThat's how you figure out,\nis I've got everything proprietary Terry,\n\n386\n00:22:48.595 --> 00:22:53.305\nin source, and it's an in house perimeter.\n\n387\n00:22:53.305 --> 00:22:57.085\nAnd how far can I move out of that\ncomfort zone and still be okay.\n\n388\n00:22:57.085 --> 00:23:01.935\nCan I keep it in turtle and in source it?\n\n389\n00:23:01.935 --> 00:23:05.555\nSo now it's in my perimeter and it's.\n\n390\n00:23:05.555 --> 00:23:09.848\nBut someone else is handling it for me or\ncan I move it further out and do open\n\n391\n00:23:09.848 --> 00:23:14.488\nsource outside my perimeter or can I go\nall the way out, go open source outside my\n\n392\n00:23:14.488 --> 00:23:18.905\nperimeter and completely outsource\nwhich would be going to public cloud.\n\n393\n00:23:18.905 --> 00:23:23.680\nSo unless you're in that light\nblue cube or that magenta cube,\n\n394\n00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.430\nif you go back to that one.\n\n395\n00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:28.896\nIf you're not within one of those two,\n\n396\n00:23:28.896 --> 00:23:32.052\nyou're going to be some\nsort of hybrid solution.\n\n397\n00:23:32.052 --> 00:23:34.750\n>> All right, well Shawn,\na lot of great information there talking\n\n398\n00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.922\nabout risk management as\nwe move out into the cloud.\n\n399\n00:23:36.922 --> 00:23:40.262\nAnything else we wanna throw in\nthis episode before we wrap it up?\n\n400\n00:23:40.262 --> 00:23:43.472\n>> I think we're doing pretty good so\nI think we can let it go.\n\n401\n00:23:43.472 --> 00:23:45.602\n>> Well, you heard it,\nladies and gentlemen.\n\n402\n00:23:45.602 --> 00:23:48.012\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n403\n00:23:48.012 --> 00:23:49.012\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n404\n00:23:49.012 --> 00:23:49.922\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n405\n00:23:49.922 --> 00:23:51.360\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.980\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.850\nAnd Sean, in this one we're gonna take\na look at some of these different cloud\n\n5\n00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.490\nproviders.\n\n6\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.190\nWe've talked a lot about trying to decide,\ndo we keep it in house, private, public,\n\n7\n00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.730\nand all this stuff.\n\n8\n00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.540\nQuestions we should ask when\nwe're trying to determine\n\n9\n00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.570\nwhat provider we should go with.\n\n10\n00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.270\nHow about we take a look and\nsee what providers are out there?\n\n11\n00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.570\n>> Yeah, that's what we're\nreally kind of building towards.\n\n12\n00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.210\nKind of the objective here\nis to give you an idea\n\n13\n00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.902\nof what different providers are out there.\n\n14\n00:00:42.902 --> 00:00:47.600\nI've chosen seven of the bigger\nones that are out here,\n\n15\n00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.160\nbut you know, by all means you should,\nif you're looking at purchasing one,\n\n16\n00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.530\nthis isn't meant to be\nan endorsement of any of these.\n\n17\n00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.590\nIt's just meant to kinda show you the way\nthat they present their services and\n\n18\n00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.280\nhow you might actually have to dig\nin to find the information you need,\n\n19\n00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.630\nif they even have that information for\nyou ready.\n\n20\n00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.920\nYou actually may have to call them and\n\n21\n00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.490\nsubmit request to get\nadditional information.\n\n22\n00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.740\nSome of them, you'll find they'll make\nit pretty easy to get that information,\n\n23\n00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.310\nother ones, not so much.\n\n24\n00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.600\nThey're not so\ngood in the helpful department.\n\n25\n00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.160\nOf course, if you're waving money around,\nthey'll give it to you a lot more easily.\n\n26\n00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.760\n>> Here's my credit card number,\noh, here, let me have it.\n\n27\n00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.519\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, all of a sudden we have it, look.\n\n28\n00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:31.972\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So but, what I've got here\n\n29\n00:01:31.972 --> 00:01:39.080\non my screen is I have\nselected some from online.\n\n30\n00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.040\nWhat I have here is for example,\nEMC, people that do VMware and\n\n31\n00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.890\nthat stuff, this is how they get you\nto the right cloud service provider.\n\n32\n00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:59.000\nThey don't actually do the cloud service\ndirectly, they don't provide that.\n\n33\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.285\nThey actually have a directory\nthat you can go to.\n\n34\n00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:05.850\nAnd you can go out there and\n\n35\n00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.400\nstart searching to see what\nprovider you want to go to.\n\n36\n00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.290\nMaybe start going to contact them and\nthen you can ask them the questions.\n\n37\n00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.210\nSo at least if you have an EMC based\nsolution, the benefit here's that\n\n38\n00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.000\nsince they're partners and\nthey're put right on this site,\n\n39\n00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.830\nyou're hoping that EMC has vetted them for\nthose solutions and\n\n40\n00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.210\nthat they're capable of handling\nwhatever EMC product you have.\n\n41\n00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.000\nSo that would be a big\nbenefit as far as that goes.\n\n42\n00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.230\nBut that's EMC.\n\n43\n00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.150\nOther ones we have, there is,\nDell has their own stuff.\n\n44\n00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.510\nYou find out that Dell's pretty big on\nthe shock and awe approach as I call it.\n\n45\n00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Where they just like going, hey,\n\n46\n00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.640\nthis is what type of stuff that we have.\n\n47\n00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.650\nThey talk all about their data center and\nhave videos and\n\n48\n00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.200\npictures of the president on there, so-\n>> I was gonna say,\n\n49\n00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.410\nthey're pulling all the stops there.\n\n50\n00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.520\nThey got photography where they got the\nlight streaming, they got the president.\n\n51\n00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.980\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's like, what just happened?\n\n52\n00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.837\nI think I just got visually mugged.\n\n53\n00:03:09.837 --> 00:03:15.850\n[LAUGH] Yeah, so\nthey've got all sorts of stuff here.\n\n54\n00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.880\nWe're talking about their cloud solution.\n\n55\n00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.830\nSo you can go in and\nstart reading about it.\n\n56\n00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.740\nI found on their site, at least, you gotta\ndo quite a bit of digging to get stuff.\n\n57\n00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.800\nThey do provide videos\non a lot of stuff and\n\n58\n00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.160\ninformation on different things\nthat may be helpful to you.\n\n59\n00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.190\nSo that's kind of a good thing but\nI think that to really get a deep\n\n60\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.580\ndive you may have to dig a little\nbit more to find white papers and\n\n61\n00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.220\nstuff like that that\ncould really be helpful.\n\n62\n00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.000\nSo that would be just what Dell is doing.\n\n63\n00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.800\nMicrosoft, of course, Microsoft is\na little bit better on what they present.\n\n64\n00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.702\nThey tell you about, hey,\nthis is the type of stuff that we have.\n\n65\n00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:07.550\nThey even tell you how to get\nup to be a partner if you want.\n\n66\n00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.160\n>> Hm.\n\n67\n00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.030\n>> Yeah.\nAnd just the thing about Microsoft is,\n\n68\n00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.340\nMicrosoft doesn't actually do\ntheir cloud hosting themselves.\n\n69\n00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.060\nThey actually do go through partners, so\n\n70\n00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.820\nyou would not be actually\nbuying from Microsoft.\n\n71\n00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.000\nMicrosoft has lent their\nname to these people.\n\n72\n00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.200\nAnd they checked them out and\ndo all this stuff, so\n\n73\n00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.090\nthey have this partner network forum.\n\n74\n00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.790\nSo kind of like EMC,\n\n75\n00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.280\nthey check to make sure that they're\ndoing what they're supposed to and\n\n76\n00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.220\nmeet certain standard levels and\nquality levels, and it goes from there.\n\n77\n00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.950\nSo they have some pretty big\nsolution providers behind them.\n\n78\n00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.289\nAnd since, due to the way they work,\nif you went with one provider,\n\n79\n00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.214\nthey should be able to easily, if one of\nthem goes out of business or something,\n\n80\n00:04:55.214 --> 00:04:57.867\nyou should be able easily to\nroll over to another one.\n\n81\n00:04:57.867 --> 00:05:02.922\nBecause, if they had it, there should\nbe a way for them to say, okay,\n\n82\n00:05:02.922 --> 00:05:08.000\nwell that was already a solution\nbased on Microsoft technologies.\n\n83\n00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.110\nWe're a partner in that\ndoes the exact same thing.\n\n84\n00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.180\nWe can take that stuff over here and\nput it over here and be ready to go.\n\n85\n00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.050\nSo that would be a big plus with going\nsomething like that through their partner\n\n86\n00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.990\nnetwork.\n\n87\n00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.025\nBut then here's AT&T.\n\n88\n00:05:23.025 --> 00:05:30.310\nAT&T, they provide a good amount of\ninformation on their site on stuff.\n\n89\n00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.490\nI mean, again, I found it here.\n\n90\n00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.690\nYou kinda gotta dig a bit more.\n\n91\n00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.770\nThey spend a lot of time explaining\nwhat the cloud is, and stuff like that.\n\n92\n00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.540\nThey're like, here's what clouds store,\nhere's some information on cloud storage.\n\n93\n00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.140\nAnd they provide all sorts of\nsolutions and stuff like that on you.\n\n94\n00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:53.110\nBut when you go through this,\nthere's Amazon providing their stuff,\n\n95\n00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.910\nGoogle's got their deal.\n\n96\n00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.830\nGoogle's actually pretty good at\nproviding you some information on stuff.\n\n97\n00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.270\nYou can click through any of these things\nto get the answers to questions that we\n\n98\n00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.910\nwere looking at.\n\n99\n00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:09.304\nIf you wanna look at stuff like\nthe different application hosting options\n\n100\n00:06:09.304 --> 00:06:15.390\nyou have, you can just click on it and\ntake a look at what that actually means.\n\n101\n00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.920\nSo this is something here,\n\n102\n00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.644\nthis is an example of a provider\nthat's really trying to tell you,\n\n103\n00:06:20.644 --> 00:06:25.250\nthis is what we can offer you and they're\nreally kind of laying all of it out there.\n\n104\n00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.556\nAnd they do have the technical details in\nhere if you dig in deep enough to any of\n\n105\n00:06:29.556 --> 00:06:33.210\nthese things, they do put\nthe technical details out there.\n\n106\n00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.700\nThey even have, here are some examples of\npeople that do host on their technology.\n\n107\n00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.254\nWhich I always like to see, because it\ngives me an idea of what their client base\n\n108\n00:06:42.254 --> 00:06:46.739\nlooks like, but also gives me an idea of\nsome of the challenges that they had to\n\n109\n00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:51.845\nface, and technologies they're using so I\ncan see what they're capable of handling.\n\n110\n00:06:51.845 --> 00:06:56.695\nBut the one, and again it's going to\nsound like I'm really going for it,\n\n111\n00:06:56.695 --> 00:07:01.701\nand oh by the way, here's something\njust to kind of, I think they've got,\n\n112\n00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:07.035\nwhen you look at pricing up here,\ndo they have the pricing list on here?\n\n113\n00:07:07.035 --> 00:07:10.065\nWell, they don't have\na pricing list on here.\n\n114\n00:07:10.065 --> 00:07:11.120\nImagine that.\n\n115\n00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.430\nBut-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n116\n00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.755\n>> I could do the TCO platform.\n\n117\n00:07:14.755 --> 00:07:19.650\nSo this one,\nlet's see if we can go up here.\n\n118\n00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.930\nI didn't really take a look at\nthe pricing for any of these things.\n\n119\n00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.120\nI wasn't really too concerned about that.\n\n120\n00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.716\nBut, oh,\nthere's some interesting costs there.\n\n121\n00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:32.058\n[LAUGH]\n>> They do break it down.\n\n122\n00:07:32.058 --> 00:07:34.480\nI would imagine it's hard for\na lot of these sites.\n\n123\n00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.040\n>> Yeah.\n\n124\n00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.440\n>> Because there's so\nmany different solutions they can provide,\n\n125\n00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.950\ncombinations of services and\ndepending on what you're getting,\n\n126\n00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.470\nthe price changes, and\nhow big you are versus how small you are.\n\n127\n00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.870\nSo you find that a lot of times these\nsites don't want to be pinned to a number.\n\n128\n00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.520\nRight?\nSo they don't put it on there.\n\n129\n00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.900\nYou gotta call and get an estimate\nthat's specific to your case.\n\n130\n00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:04.193\n>> Yeah, and you notice here that Google's\ndone a pretty good job over here.\n\n131\n00:08:04.193 --> 00:08:05.990\nYou can punch in your own numbers in here.\n\n132\n00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.633\nSo if you have that, if you've done that\nassessment like we were talking about and\n\n133\n00:08:10.633 --> 00:08:13.526\nwhat your needs are going to be for\nan application,\n\n134\n00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:16.646\nyou could have a pretty good\nidea of what you have here.\n\n135\n00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:20.930\nAnd you can also maybe look at how\nyou've grown over the last three, four,\n\n136\n00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.194\nfive years and see, okay,\nwell this is what I have now and\n\n137\n00:08:24.194 --> 00:08:28.690\nthree years out from now, okay,\nwell this is what it's gonna look like.\n\n138\n00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:32.937\nThe numbers that are calculated\non here right now,\n\n139\n00:08:32.937 --> 00:08:36.507\nthey've got stuff like a three year deal.\n\n140\n00:08:36.507 --> 00:08:39.320\nThey have the Google compared\nwith Amazon web services.\n\n141\n00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:45.860\nGoogle, they're saying it's $38,000 for\na year.\n\n142\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.779\nThey're saying Amazon, with their stuff,\n\n143\n00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:53.910\n63 anywhere to 93 for\nthe same type of deal.\n\n144\n00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.566\nBut that would be helpful for\nfiguring it out, but you're right,\n\n145\n00:08:56.566 --> 00:08:59.889\nthey don't want to get themselves, they\nshould put a little disclaimer on there,\n\n146\n00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:00.858\nyour mileage may vary.\n\n147\n00:09:00.858 --> 00:09:03.238\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but\n\n148\n00:09:03.238 --> 00:09:08.954\nthat's a helpful tool to help\nyou figure out where you stand.\n\n149\n00:09:08.954 --> 00:09:13.916\nBut getting to it,\nthe one that I was saying that\n\n150\n00:09:13.916 --> 00:09:18.270\nI think really does their job here is IBM.\n\n151\n00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.140\nIBM really puts their stuff out here.\n\n152\n00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.410\nThey provide, these are all different\npages and white papers down here\n\n153\n00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:30.780\ntelling you almost everything\nyou could possibly need in here.\n\n154\n00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.390\nTake a look, they've got infrastructure\nas a service, platform as a service,\n\n155\n00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:41.080\nclearly spelled out there,\ntelling you how they deal with it.\n\n156\n00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:46.180\nAnd just even offer, here's the private\ncloud services I was talking about.\n\n157\n00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.340\nRemember I said that they went on-site?\n\n158\n00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.590\nThey have that right there, they can build\na private cloud for you, and either do it\n\n159\n00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:56.410\non site or do it to their own facilities,\nbut lock it down just to your stuff.\n\n160\n00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:02.390\nSo they list that all out right there and\ntell you, hey, this is what we have for\n\n161\n00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:06.190\nyou, and you can go right on through and\ndo case studies and all that good stuff.\n\n162\n00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:11.020\nI mean, I found this is a pretty\nwell designed solution.\n\n163\n00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:16.252\nAnd you can even choose the type\nof services that you wanna\n\n164\n00:10:16.252 --> 00:10:21.750\nhave on here so\nyou can get a lot of questions answered.\n\n165\n00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:26.581\nSo [COUGH] the thing this comes down to\nis some providers are better at providing\n\n166\n00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:29.050\nthe information you need than others.\n\n167\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.770\nSome of them you can go through and\nyou can actually plan out your solution.\n\n168\n00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:37.580\nGoogle and IBM and Amazon tend to be\npretty good at that, that they will say,\n\n169\n00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.880\nthis is the type of stuff that we offer,\n\n170\n00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.520\nthis is how you can figure out\nwhat you wanna do with this.\n\n171\n00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.310\nThey will put that right out there and\nthen you can just say, okay,\n\n172\n00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.370\nwell I hadn't thought about that or this.\n\n173\n00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.298\nThat's why it's also good\nto read case studies too.\n\n174\n00:10:51.298 --> 00:10:53.580\nThe sites that provide case studies,\nyou can see, okay,\n\n175\n00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.850\nwell, let me see what they did.\n\n176\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.380\nI hadn't thought about this or that and\n\n177\n00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.650\nyou start factoring those things in,\nhelps you do your research.\n\n178\n00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.080\nAnd the fact that a company like IBM,\nGoogle, or Amazon,\n\n179\n00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.000\npeople like that are willing to\nprovide that information to you and\n\n180\n00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.690\nput it right out front can help you out\ntremendously in your planning process and\n\n181\n00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.343\ndeciding if they're the ones you\nwanna go to or someone else.\n\n182\n00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:19.353\nLike I said, they're not the only ones.\n\n183\n00:11:19.353 --> 00:11:23.552\nAnd other ways to determine what\nprovider might be good for you,\n\n184\n00:11:23.552 --> 00:11:28.528\nI have found on Amazon, amazingly enough,\nand not on Amazon web services,\n\n185\n00:11:28.528 --> 00:11:31.043\nbut just on Amazon.com themselves.\n\n186\n00:11:31.043 --> 00:11:34.385\nIf you have a Kindle or\ncan download the Kindle app,\n\n187\n00:11:34.385 --> 00:11:39.055\nthere's actually some people published\nwhite papers that have talked\n\n188\n00:11:39.055 --> 00:11:43.040\nabout how different companies\nhave gone to the cloud.\n\n189\n00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:48.280\nI found one for the DOD up there\nthat it said how they dealt with\n\n190\n00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:54.960\nsecurity in the cloud, talked about\nissues that they had to contend with.\n\n191\n00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.120\nSo you can kinda get an idea of maybe type\nof things you really need to be asking and\n\n192\n00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.790\nare facing, depending on what\nyour particular situation is.\n\n193\n00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.430\nSo that's kind of a neat thing so\nit's good for\n\n194\n00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.600\nyou to pull on all those resources.\n\n195\n00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.420\nAnd one other little thing\nto kinda factor into this.\n\n196\n00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:20.167\nI know Amazon does this, and\nI think Google might do it as well.\n\n197\n00:12:20.167 --> 00:12:22.300\nI know for sure Amazon does it.\n\n198\n00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:30.265\nAmazon in fact, on their stuff, they\nactually have this free tier situation.\n\n199\n00:12:30.265 --> 00:12:31.685\nI mean,\nthey're telling you it's free tier,\n\n200\n00:12:31.685 --> 00:12:37.495\nthat you can get hands-on with their\ncloud stuff for no charge for 12 months.\n\n201\n00:12:37.495 --> 00:12:40.045\n>> Right.\n>> So you sign up,\n\n202\n00:12:40.045 --> 00:12:43.295\nyou get 12 months of access.\n\n203\n00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:45.505\nNow there are some limits on it.\n\n204\n00:12:45.505 --> 00:12:48.805\nYou can see that they do put some,\ndepending on what you choose,\n\n205\n00:12:48.805 --> 00:12:50.525\nthey put limits on that.\n\n206\n00:12:50.525 --> 00:12:54.410\nBut that would be another good\ntest bed for you to say, okay,\n\n207\n00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:55.900\nwell I want to go in the cloud.\n\n208\n00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.970\nLet me see, based on what they have here,\n\n209\n00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.770\ncan I push my stuff into the cloud,\nat least on a small scale and\n\n210\n00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:07.580\ndo some testing, some poking around\nto see if it's really the best thing.\n\n211\n00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.930\nI have found out by working\nwith Amazon directly,\n\n212\n00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:13.000\nI actually have worked\nwith Amazon directly.\n\n213\n00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.496\nI actually wrote a couple white papers,\nstuff like that for them.\n\n214\n00:13:15.496 --> 00:13:18.830\nI found that people on their back end,\n\n215\n00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:21.840\nthey are willing to answer a lot\nof questions if you got it.\n\n216\n00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.750\nThey'll answer whatever they can.\n\n217\n00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:26.980\nAnything that wouldn't compromise\ntheir security, of course.\n\n218\n00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.250\nThey'll answer it,\nthey're pretty knowledgeable.\n\n219\n00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:31.033\nAnd that's what you're looking for\ntoo when you talk to them.\n\n220\n00:13:31.033 --> 00:13:36.960\nI had that experience with Amazon,\nI've had it with IBM as well.\n\n221\n00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.270\nMake sure you're talking to them.\n\n222\n00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:42.360\nIt's not just what they're saying, but\neveryone's gonna have situations where you\n\n223\n00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.630\nask them a question and be like,\nI'm not sure, let me look that up.\n\n224\n00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.080\nBut overall are they able to answer\nyour questions, are they responsive?\n\n225\n00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.701\nIf they have to go get an answer to it,\nare they going to back very quickly and\n\n226\n00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:55.032\nsay, okay, I've got it?\n\n227\n00:13:55.032 --> 00:13:57.985\nOr are they gonna say, hey, I need a\nlittle bit more time to research that but\n\n228\n00:13:57.985 --> 00:13:58.690\nI'm still on it?\n\n229\n00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.235\nThat's the type of stuff\nyou're looking for.\n\n230\n00:14:00.235 --> 00:14:04.310\nCuz remember, if you're outsourcing it\nto them, how fast they respond to your\n\n231\n00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:08.160\nquestions and how readily they respond\nto your questions is also a measure\n\n232\n00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:10.420\nof if you're going to have\ndecent support with them or not.\n\n233\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.510\n>> It's a good indicator, right?\n\n234\n00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.400\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n235\n00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.550\n>> All right, we got a lot of\ndifferent choice out there.\n\n236\n00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.170\nIt seems like the underlying theme\nthroughout most of the episodes we've\n\n237\n00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:21.620\ndone, planning, right?\n\n238\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:25.800\nI mean, getting everything laid out,\ndeciding what you need so\n\n239\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.210\nthat you can really make that effective\ndecision of, what I need to ask,\n\n240\n00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:34.220\nwhat questions I need to ask,\nwhat my options are when I get out there,\n\n241\n00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.420\nis really sitting down and\nlooking at what you're trying to do.\n\n242\n00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:42.585\nWhat the end result needs to be so that I\ncould make good decisions along the way.\n\n243\n00:14:42.585 --> 00:14:45.630\n>> Yeah, planning is absolutely essential.\n\n244\n00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:50.981\nIf you do not plan carefully,\nyou're basically planning for\n\n245\n00:14:50.981 --> 00:14:53.991\nfailure I guess is\nthe way to really put it.\n\n246\n00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:56.236\nWhether you directly do it or\nnot, you're planning for\n\n247\n00:14:56.236 --> 00:14:59.010\nfailure if you don't\nthink about it carefully.\n\n248\n00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:04.010\nMost of the issues I've seen,\nthe bigger issues I've seen\n\n249\n00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.790\nthat have happened with\nthe cloud is a lack of planning.\n\n250\n00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:10.590\nThey have not all been that way,\nand I would never say that, but\n\n251\n00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:14.341\na lot of them have come from\nthe fact that someone did not plan.\n\n252\n00:15:14.341 --> 00:15:18.360\nThey just jumped right in with both feet\nand didn't look what they were doing.\n\n253\n00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.155\nThey just, hey, let's just go for it.\n\n254\n00:15:21.155 --> 00:15:23.210\nCloud's nice and fun to play with.\n\n255\n00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:28.000\nIt's not a toy, it's something that can\nbe very, very useful to you and very,\n\n256\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.568\nvery powerful asset.\n\n257\n00:15:29.568 --> 00:15:34.230\nBut deployed incorrectly,\nit's gonna work against you.\n\n258\n00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.850\nIt'll be one of the most frustrating\nthings you've ever had to deal with.\n\n259\n00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.165\nI've seen people go\ndown that route too and\n\n260\n00:15:39.165 --> 00:15:42.714\ncurse the day they were born because\nof something with the cloud.\n\n261\n00:15:42.714 --> 00:15:45.630\nSo just plan.\n\n262\n00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:46.900\nThere's plenty of tools out there.\n\n263\n00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.020\nThat's what that cube is designed to do.\n\n264\n00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:53.610\nThat's what the CSA model is designed to\ndo, plus other ones that are out there.\n\n265\n00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.540\nThat's what these white papers and\ncalculators,\n\n266\n00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.940\nthere's a lot of stuff out there.\n\n267\n00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.660\nA lot of people have gone through and walk\ndown these paths that you are going to be\n\n268\n00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.690\nwalking down if you're going to be\ndeploying a secure cloud solution.\n\n269\n00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:09.080\nSo there's no reason you should just\nstumble in and be completely in the dark.\n\n270\n00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.020\nI mean, everyone's unique.\n\n271\n00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:16.840\nBut you should be able to eliminate a lot\nof those dead spots pretty quickly.\n\n272\n00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.530\n>> All right, well, Sean,\na lot of good information there.\n\n273\n00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:20.600\nThere's a lot of providers out\nthere that we have to choose from.\n\n274\n00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.640\nThat was by no means\nan all inclusive list.\n\n275\n00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.030\nAnything else we want to\ntoss in the picture here?\n\n276\n00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:31.080\n>> Nope, other than do your research and\nplan, that's it.\n\n277\n00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.180\n>> All right, well, ladies and gentleman,\nthat's gonna do it for this one,\n\n278\n00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.600\nwe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n279\n00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.790\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n280\n00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.630\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n281\n00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.450\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n282\n00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:44.939\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:16.200\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.800\nAnd today we're gonna be talking\nabout legal issues with the cloud.\n\n5\n00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.070\nAnd I'm almost scared, Sean,\nit's not gonna be fun.\n\n6\n00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.230\n>> Yeah, talking about the law\nis not the most exciting thing,\n\n7\n00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.910\nbut it is a necessary thing.\n\n8\n00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.340\nWhen you talk about anything like this,\n\n9\n00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.780\nand just setting up your own hosting\nenvironment for applications.\n\n10\n00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.570\nBecause while you may not\nwant to think about it,\n\n11\n00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.841\nthe law is thinking\nabout you it seems like.\n\n12\n00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:42.186\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n13\n00:00:42.186 --> 00:00:47.190\nAnd when I say not fun, I mean like I know\na lot of this stuff is in fluctuation.\n\n14\n00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.770\nWe haven't even figured out some of it,\nright?\n\n15\n00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.010\n>> Yeah.\nWe were still on process of gathering\n\n16\n00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.450\ninformation and considering the types\nof issues that we might have.\n\n17\n00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.750\nWe're making that move into the cloud but\nwe haven't fully got there.\n\n18\n00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.590\nAnd this is one of the things that you\ndon't necessarily think about right\n\n19\n00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.510\noff the bat.\n\n20\n00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.020\nIs you get this idea with companies\nthat we're just gonna take that\n\n21\n00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.310\nleap right over in the Cloud.\n\n22\n00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.510\nYou know how it is, you get a CIO or\nsomebody that's like, hey, look,\n\n23\n00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.076\nit's in PC World, it must be cool.\n\n24\n00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:20.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like no,\n\n25\n00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.540\nyou don't buy it and just shove it over\nthere and be like, hey, look what I did.\n\n26\n00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.190\nYou've got to consider,\n\n27\n00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.780\nhave a lot more considerations than that\nbecause that type of thinking of just,\n\n28\n00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.230\nhey, put it over there and it's cool,\nis gonna get you in trouble, it just will.\n\n29\n00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.310\nIt's not a if it will get you trouble,\n\n30\n00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.440\nit's a question of when it\nwill get you in trouble.\n\n31\n00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.820\nYou know, plain and simple.\n\n32\n00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.350\nSo we're trying to avoid that and\ndo things the right way.\n\n33\n00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.910\nAnd if you look at any sort of\nreally good deployment guide for\n\n34\n00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.650\nthe Cloud,\nit will include the legal side of things.\n\n35\n00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.940\nIt's gonna tell you things you need\nto consider or things you need to get\n\n36\n00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.130\nconsultation on with your legal\ndepartment or just a lawyer in general.\n\n37\n00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.980\nIt's gonna tell you those things, and\ndo not absolutely do not count on\n\n38\n00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.510\nyour Cloud service provider\ngiving you any guidance on this.\n\n39\n00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.780\nThey don't want anything to do with it.\n\n40\n00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.900\nAs far as they're concerned,\nthey're selling you the service and\n\n41\n00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.350\nthe products that go with it.\n\n42\n00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.470\nThey may tell you that they\nhave experience hosting with\n\n43\n00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.880\ncertain types of things.\n\n44\n00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.100\nFor example, HIPAA,\nthat they've dealt with that.\n\n45\n00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.710\nThat they say, oh, we're HIPPA compliant.\n\n46\n00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.840\nBut I'm sure in the legal print for\na lot of things they're like, hey,\n\n47\n00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.760\ncheck it yourself,\n\n48\n00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.500\nor something like that, you know, to make\nsure it's still going to come back to you.\n\n49\n00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.840\nAnd you know, heck, if you recall,\n\n50\n00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.710\nremember we were talking about this\nin our whole forensics course,\n\n51\n00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.930\nultimate responsibility for this, and\nthis comes across in a lot of security\n\n52\n00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.390\nrelated things Ultimately even\nif that provider says, yeah,\n\n53\n00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.310\nwe're 100% sure we're legally compliant\nand you're gonna be totally fine.\n\n54\n00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.430\nYou're the one that's ultimately the data\nowner, so it's coming down on you.\n\n55\n00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.790\nThey'll say so what.\n\n56\n00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.060\nDid you check it?\n\n57\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.300\nDid you make sure that that person wasn't,\nsmoking something or\n\n58\n00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.630\nknows what they're talking about.\n\n59\n00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.930\nTrust but verify.\n\n60\n00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.640\n>> It seems like that Cloud\nprovider be great if they do,\n\n61\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.170\nwe saw a couple in another episode where\nyou showed some of those providers and\n\n62\n00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.960\nright on his website it says we deal with\nHIPAA, we've had experience with that and\n\n63\n00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.790\nthat's great but it's still up to\nus to implement it properly, right?\n\n64\n00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.340\nThey're saying hey, our stuff, if set\nup properly, can be HIPAA compliant but\n\n65\n00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.680\nthey're not going to make sure we're in\ncompliance with our HIPAA regulations and\n\n66\n00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.170\nwhen HIPAA comes after it, it's not going\nto be them, it's going to be us, right?\n\n67\n00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.560\n>> Yeah, it's your neck on the line,\nit's not theirs, so do remember that.\n\n68\n00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.860\nThey'll give you all the nice case studies\nabout all the clients they have and\n\n69\n00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.960\nall the industries they work with.\n\n70\n00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.530\nThey're more than happy to\nprovide that sort of thing.\n\n71\n00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.000\n>> But they're not going\nto stick their neck out and\n\n72\n00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.480\nsay, we're the ones, we'll make\nsure that you're legally compliant.\n\n73\n00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.430\nEven if they did, they're not the ones on\nthe line, or with their necks on the line.\n\n74\n00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.820\nI can sit here and\ntell you hey guys, you can move on,\n\n75\n00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.940\nyou can move into the cloud all you want,\n100% compliant.\n\n76\n00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.470\nLet me know if you have any problems.\n\n77\n00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.724\nI'll pay your fines, everything.\n\n78\n00:04:12.724 --> 00:04:18.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, it just, it's a hollow statement.\n\n79\n00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.820\nIt never ends, and they're never going\nto go anywhere, you know off of that.\n\n80\n00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.100\nSo you need to make sure that you\ndefinitely consider the legal\n\n81\n00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.910\nside of things.\n\n82\n00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.240\nAnd so fortunately, there's plenty\nof guidance out there for it.\n\n83\n00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.120\nYou just gotta know where to look,\n\n84\n00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.790\nlike I said there's a lot\nof white papers out there.\n\n85\n00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.030\nThere's a lot of little, not just white\npapers, but stuff, like I said yesterday,\n\n86\n00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.200\nI found there were actually quite a few\nguides on Amazon that, do explain certain\n\n87\n00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.300\ndeployments and issues that people\nhave faced, which is very helpful.\n\n88\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.870\nYou can go to the different groups,\nindustry groups,\n\n89\n00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.450\nlike I showed HIPAA and\nstuff like that on our first day.\n\n90\n00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.320\nYou can go to those groups and\nthey can help you with that.\n\n91\n00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.020\nBut still, you're going to have to get\nyour own people to look at this and\n\n92\n00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.770\nmake sure that you are doing\neverything they way you're\n\n93\n00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.050\nsupposed to do because again,\nyou're next on the line.\n\n94\n00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.980\n>> Absolutely.\n\n95\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.470\nSo I guess the first thing we\nhave to really think about is,\n\n96\n00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.460\ncan we move to the Cloud?\n\n97\n00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.150\nBecause there might be some kind\nof like I think you mentioned\n\n98\n00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.490\nan example the other day, there are some\ntimes when we might want to but\n\n99\n00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.960\nlegally we can't, we're not allowed.\n\n100\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.910\n>> Yeah, the way I would actually\nlook at it is when you say,\n\n101\n00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.520\ncan you move to the Cloud?\n\n102\n00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.520\nWe could change it just,\nwe could change the statement just a bit.\n\n103\n00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.500\nYou could,\naside from the technical side of things.\n\n104\n00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.840\nThe technical side might say that you\njust can't move the Cloud at all.\n\n105\n00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.600\nBut, the legal side may very well say\nthat, yes you can go to the Cloud,\n\n106\n00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.590\nyou can always go to the Cloud from\nas far as a legal side is concerned.\n\n107\n00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.410\nThe question is, is your deployment\ngonna be in the public space,\n\n108\n00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.240\nor is it gonna be a privately owned Cloud.\n\n109\n00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.020\nThat's the way I would look at it.\n\n110\n00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.010\nAnd most people when they talk about,\nthey make a statement, you know,\n\n111\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.030\nsaying the Cloud, in any way,\n\n112\n00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.640\nshape, or form they're talking\nabout someone else doing it.\n\n113\n00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.250\nThey're not talking about\nhosting it themselves.\n\n114\n00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.510\nI would make that little distinction\nsaying that the law is going to dictate\n\n115\n00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.230\npretty much wether or not,\nwhich Cloud you're going to go with.\n\n116\n00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.120\nAre you going to go with the public one or\nthe private one or some variation.\n\n117\n00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.650\n>> Thinking back to that Jericho Queue.\n\n118\n00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.960\nWe might be stuck on that\nprivate side of things.\n\n119\n00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.480\n>> There you go.\n\n120\n00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.480\n>> Because of some legal issues.\n\n121\n00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.680\n>> Yeah, you were.\n\n122\n00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.400\nThat's absolutely, that would be what\nthat tool would be used for is that\n\n123\n00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.320\nyou can see where you're gonna align right\nin that whole framework of something.\n\n124\n00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.780\nBecause you can go the Cloud,\n\n125\n00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.080\nthe legal side's not gonna really talk too\nmuch towards technically if it's possible.\n\n126\n00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.340\nThey're just going to say well, these\nare the issues that you need to consider.\n\n127\n00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.350\nAnd with all the issues\nbeing put out there,\n\n128\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.920\nyou just can't put into public space.\n\n129\n00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.510\nThe only way to guarantee that you're\ngoing to be 100% compliant would be\n\n130\n00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.710\nreasonably free from legal\nharm would be to say, well,\n\n131\n00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.020\nwe're gonna make our own private Cloud.\n\n132\n00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:09.070\nI can refer back to those, to that client\nin California I was talking about.\n\n133\n00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.940\nThey could move to the Cloud.\n\n134\n00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.840\nThe technical issues and everything\nwere so they could move the Cloud.\n\n135\n00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.300\nThe legal issue said move\nthe Cloud all you want.\n\n136\n00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.630\nSo, they were more than happy\nto embrace that technology.\n\n137\n00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.640\nThe question was, what was that\nfinal solution gonna look like?\n\n138\n00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.890\nAnd the final solution said that\nyou're gonna be moving the Cloud,\n\n139\n00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.560\njust which one is it gonna be.\n\n140\n00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.670\nWell it turned out it\ncouldn't be a public Cloud.\n\n141\n00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.390\nThey had to build their own right on site.\n\n142\n00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.290\nSo the law dictated that this is what\nthe final form is gonna look like.\n\n143\n00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.770\nSo they had to build all that stuff up to\nmake sure that they were gonna meet HIPAA\n\n144\n00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:49.330\nguidelines, California, you know, health\ncare record guidelines and all of that.\n\n145\n00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.380\nSo, that's where this law\nwould actually come in.\n\n146\n00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.929\n>> It's important that we go find those\nkind of guidelines where ever it is, U.S.\n\n147\n00:07:55.929 --> 00:07:59.180\nor what state you're dealing with or\nwhat country you're dealing with.\n\n148\n00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.133\nSure there's some kind of guidelines that\nyou can find that are gonna Talk about\n\n149\n00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:06.791\nthings like that, about what you have\nto do to maintain that compliance,\n\n150\n00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:10.277\nif you choose to go to the cloud,\npublic, private, or what have you.\n\n151\n00:08:10.277 --> 00:08:10.985\n>> Yeah, and\n\n152\n00:08:10.985 --> 00:08:15.874\nthe tricky thing would be really just\nfinding out where that guidance is.\n\n153\n00:08:15.874 --> 00:08:20.856\nI would almost say,\nat this point, that the guidance\n\n154\n00:08:20.856 --> 00:08:25.740\nis out there, but\nthe difficult part is finding it.\n\n155\n00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.140\nBecause the cloud, even though\nit's been out there for a while,\n\n156\n00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.050\nthis isn't exactly a new thing.\n\n157\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:34.360\nAs much as it's treated like a new thing,\n\n158\n00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.660\nthe cloud's been around for,\nI want to say, what, four or five years?\n\n159\n00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.690\nWe've had it around, maybe a little longer\nthan that, maybe a little less, whatever.\n\n160\n00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.638\nBut it's not something that's brand new,\nso.\n\n161\n00:08:44.638 --> 00:08:49.318\nBut they're still developing\nin certain guidances for it,\n\n162\n00:08:49.318 --> 00:08:52.080\nand certain documentation for it.\n\n163\n00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.240\nA lot of it is out there, but\nyou just gotta go dig for it.\n\n164\n00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.610\nIt hasn't been brought into too much of a,\n\n165\n00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:02.820\ninto one place all that often,\nso you may do a lot of digging.\n\n166\n00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:07.250\nYou may recall that in one of the previous\nepisodes, I said that same client in\n\n167\n00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.860\nCalifornia, it took them a year\nto get that solution set up.\n\n168\n00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.570\nA lot of it was tracing down all these\nlittle guidelines they had to follow.\n\n169\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.730\nBecause they knew that HIPAA\nwas gonna be in there, but\n\n170\n00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.000\nthen there was other data hosting\nissues that came into play.\n\n171\n00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.830\nSo there was privacy guidelines\nthat came into play.\n\n172\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.320\nSo there was even, I think they even said\nthey had PCI guidelines coming in there.\n\n173\n00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.390\nThere was a lot of stuff\nthat was just coming all in.\n\n174\n00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.220\nAnd that was for the industry.\n\n175\n00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.850\nThen there was federal stuff,\nand there was state stuff.\n\n176\n00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.740\nThere was even local\nguidelines they had to follow.\n\n177\n00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.730\nAnd it was such a mess that all these\nthings, when they came together, they had\n\n178\n00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.290\na vision of them having this big pile\nof documentation sitting on their desk.\n\n179\n00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.310\nAnd they had to sort through it and\nsee, okay, well, all this stuff,\n\n180\n00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.210\nif you've ever read any\nlegal documentation.\n\n181\n00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's about as clear as mud.\n\n182\n00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.320\nSo they had to go through and\nfigure out what all this thing\n\n183\n00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.980\nactually boiled down to, and\nthen build out the solution.\n\n184\n00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.899\nThey were telling me, in this case,\nthat the technical solution,\n\n185\n00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:04.456\nall things considered, was the easy part.\n\n186\n00:10:04.456 --> 00:10:07.820\nBecause that was reasonably\nstraightforward that, hey,\n\n187\n00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.531\nwell you just put this here and\nthere and configure this this way.\n\n188\n00:10:11.531 --> 00:10:13.638\nSo they said that was pretty easy.\n\n189\n00:10:13.638 --> 00:10:18.976\nIt was what was all the guidelines gonna\nbe, because that's what could really hurt\n\n190\n00:10:18.976 --> 00:10:24.180\nthem, and could shut them down in some\ncases if they had a big, big glitch there.\n\n191\n00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.940\nSo you're gonna have to be prepared\nif you're going to do this.\n\n192\n00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.630\nBe prepared to have to,\n\n193\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:34.810\nif the law impacts you, be prepared to\nhave to really hunt this stuff down.\n\n194\n00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:41.600\nI mean, heck, go to, you can see how,\neven with this credential even.\n\n195\n00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.400\nProbably some of you watching this, you\nprobably looked at the study materials for\n\n196\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.320\nthis, the CCSP.\n\n197\n00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.910\nYeah, go Google the CCSP study materials\nand see how easy they are to find.\n\n198\n00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.460\nThere's not even really any\nbooks on Amazon for it.\n\n199\n00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.329\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There's very few things on it.\n\n200\n00:10:57.329 --> 00:11:01.194\nSo, you can see that just from that,\nfrom this one credential,\n\n201\n00:11:01.194 --> 00:11:04.285\nthat there's really little,\nnot a ton out there.\n\n202\n00:11:04.285 --> 00:11:06.513\nThis course here is one of\nthe few things that's on it.\n\n203\n00:11:06.513 --> 00:11:10.234\nYou can kinda look at how\nthe legal guidelines are gonna be.\n\n204\n00:11:10.234 --> 00:11:11.964\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n205\n00:11:11.964 --> 00:11:13.456\n>> And they always make those sites so\ngreat.\n\n206\n00:11:13.456 --> 00:11:17.161\nI know I spent a good 45 minutes on NIST,\nour National Institute of Standards and\n\n207\n00:11:17.161 --> 00:11:19.849\nTechnology, just diving through\nthese papers looking for\n\n208\n00:11:19.849 --> 00:11:22.341\nstuff that had to deal with cloud and\nthings like that.\n\n209\n00:11:22.341 --> 00:11:24.620\nAnd, not fun, not fun at all.\n\n210\n00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.060\n>> It's definitely not.\n\n211\n00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.790\nThere's gonna be a lot of stuff that\nyou're gonna be kind of wading through and\n\n212\n00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:37.100\nseeing what things are gonna impact you,\nwhat things are not.\n\n213\n00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:42.420\nAnd some providers will help you out\nthere, and they do have the stuff.\n\n214\n00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.530\nOne of the things I like about\nthe bigger providers is,\n\n215\n00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:51.470\nthe one I think of, and I know I keep\nusing them as an example on here,\n\n216\n00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.880\nI can think of someone like IBM.\n\n217\n00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.400\nIBM is one that, I know from having\nto deal with them in the past,\n\n218\n00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.460\nthat as a service provider,\nI could ask questions on things and\n\n219\n00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.760\nthey were more than willing to,\nback in the day, it was faxing me stuff.\n\n220\n00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:12.389\nNowadays, they'll just say, okay, we'll\njust start emailing you links to stuff,\n\n221\n00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:13.342\nwhat else do you need?\n\n222\n00:12:13.342 --> 00:12:16.035\nAnd they would sit there and take\nthe time to do this and say, okay, well,\n\n223\n00:12:16.035 --> 00:12:17.670\nwe have this, this, and this.\n\n224\n00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.610\nSo some providers\nare pretty good about that.\n\n225\n00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.060\nThey're not the only ones.\n\n226\n00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:26.770\nI only have experience really with IBM\nin depth asking those type of questions,\n\n227\n00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:31.230\nbut I remember sitting on the phone with\nthem one time for an hour, hour and half,\n\n228\n00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.140\njust asking, well, I need\ninformation on this, this, and this.\n\n229\n00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:37.470\nAnd then they were able to say well,\nwe have some documents relating to that.\n\n230\n00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.240\nBut that's a good idea,\ncan I get those, too?\n\n231\n00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.726\nAnd they gave me a ton of stuff\nto go through, but I had it.\n\n232\n00:12:43.726 --> 00:12:47.272\nAnd because they had used those services\nand had clients in those industries,\n\n233\n00:12:47.272 --> 00:12:49.170\nthey said, well, we wanna be prepared.\n\n234\n00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:50.350\nSo it makes it easier for\n\n235\n00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.420\nsomeone to get into our service,\nrather than go to someone else's.\n\n236\n00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:57.621\nSo that would be one of the benefits\nof going to one of those, big three,\n\n237\n00:12:57.621 --> 00:12:58.470\nI like to say.\n\n238\n00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.330\nOr big four, if you throw in\none of the other ones in there.\n\n239\n00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:03.922\n>> Just the advantage of the fact that\nthey've already done a lot of that\n\n240\n00:13:03.922 --> 00:13:05.740\nresearch, maybe for other clients, and\nthey can give you that pretty quick.\n\n241\n00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:14.960\n>> Yeah, and don't be afraid to also,\nif you look at their case studies, or\n\n242\n00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:20.290\nif you even ask them when you're putting\nyour big enterprise solution out there.\n\n243\n00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.440\nDon't be afraid to ask them,\ndo you have anybody else that does this?\n\n244\n00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.193\nAnd if so, do you have anybody over there\nthat I can talk to that I can kind of\n\n245\n00:13:28.193 --> 00:13:31.892\nwork out of my issues because\nI really wanna go over here.\n\n246\n00:13:31.892 --> 00:13:33.888\nIf there's enough money one the line-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n247\n00:13:33.888 --> 00:13:36.560\n>> and they really want your business, and\n\n248\n00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:41.130\nthey're aboveboard, they'll go ahead and\nbe willing to do that.\n\n249\n00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.947\nI know when I worked in different parts of\nthe industry, not necessarily the cloud,\n\n250\n00:13:44.947 --> 00:13:48.346\nbut other parts of the industry,\nsomeone asked me about a solution I had.\n\n251\n00:13:48.346 --> 00:13:50.480\nYeah, do you have another\nclient that does it?\n\n252\n00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.090\nYeah, you want their\nnumber to talk to them?\n\n253\n00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:54.640\nI had no qualms about doing that.\n\n254\n00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.395\nBecause that person,\nI knew I took care of them.\n\n255\n00:13:57.395 --> 00:13:58.693\nThey were gonna be happy.\n\n256\n00:13:58.693 --> 00:14:00.644\nThey were happy with the solution.\n\n257\n00:14:00.644 --> 00:14:02.770\nThey were gonna talk to\nthis other person and\n\n258\n00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.900\nbasically help me sell\nthe product to them.\n\n259\n00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.456\nSo, do keep that in mind.\n\n260\n00:14:07.456 --> 00:14:09.350\nThey shouldn't kind of hide behind that.\n\n261\n00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.590\nIf they're doing this type of stuff,\nif they do have those clients, and say oh,\n\n262\n00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.100\nyeah, yeah, we do that.\n\n263\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.905\nDo you have some references?\n\n264\n00:14:15.905 --> 00:14:17.625\nThat's a totally valid question.\n\n265\n00:14:17.625 --> 00:14:20.698\nThen you could start asking them, well,\nhow did you deal with this issue and\n\n266\n00:14:20.698 --> 00:14:21.239\nthis issue?\n\n267\n00:14:21.239 --> 00:14:23.055\nAnd so that can help you out too.\n\n268\n00:14:23.055 --> 00:14:27.945\n>> And then of course, we've hinted at\nthis already in a couple other episodes,\n\n269\n00:14:27.945 --> 00:14:32.045\nbut another big change when we start\nmoving our stuff into the cloud\n\n270\n00:14:32.045 --> 00:14:34.085\nis the whole forensic side of things, and\n\n271\n00:14:34.085 --> 00:14:39.570\nwhat we have to do to be prepared and to\ndeal with that if that situation arises.\n\n272\n00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.220\n>> Yeah, that's a biggie.\n\n273\n00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:46.050\nThe forensics side of things\ndoes change quite a bit.\n\n274\n00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:49.560\nAnd it really depends on what\nthat solution looks like.\n\n275\n00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:54.850\nNow if you've got a privately owned cloud,\nthat makes things a lot easier.\n\n276\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.630\nThat's one of the cool things about having\nthat, it does make things a lot easier.\n\n277\n00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.670\nIt's not as easy.\n\n278\n00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.490\nI know it's kind of funny saying this\nafter all the forensics stuff we did.\n\n279\n00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:06.810\nAnd we had all this stuff broken out and\neverything in here.\n\n280\n00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:08.740\nI know it's like, oh, it's easy.\n\n281\n00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.370\nIt's not as easy as\nthe stuff that we had here.\n\n282\n00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.550\nThere are changes.\n\n283\n00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.362\nGoing through virtual machines,\nfor example.\n\n284\n00:15:17.362 --> 00:15:19.520\nYou're gonna have to do some of that, and\n\n285\n00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.470\nthat has a whole bunch\nof things unto itself.\n\n286\n00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.740\nAs far as recovering, doing stuff\nlike file carving, stuff like that.\n\n287\n00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.650\nThat's going to be much more difficult,\ndepending on whether or\n\n288\n00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.370\nnot you go into a public and\nprivate cloud,\n\n289\n00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:36.860\nbecause space can get written over\npretty easily in these solutions.\n\n290\n00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:40.210\nSo you do have little\ndifferences in there.\n\n291\n00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:44.890\nBut the big thing is is that if\nyou're using a public cloud.\n\n292\n00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.493\nA public cloud, it's not as easy\nin a lot of cases to get in and\n\n293\n00:15:48.493 --> 00:15:51.050\ndo forensics in any way, shape, or form.\n\n294\n00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.050\nBecause what you're saying is that you're\ngonna go to that hosting environment.\n\n295\n00:15:55.050 --> 00:16:00.520\nAnd let a forensic tech go in there and\nstart poking around.\n\n296\n00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.690\nThat is, if it's not hosted\ninside of a virtual machine or\n\n297\n00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.510\nyou have something like a database where\nthey can do a forensic analysis on it.\n\n298\n00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:08.930\nIf it's not something\nthat they can download,\n\n299\n00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.230\nthat they need to physically access the\nhardware and we did see in a lot of cases,\n\n300\n00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:17.010\nyeah, physically accessing\nhardware was very important.\n\n301\n00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.770\nThat's pretty much not gonna\nhappen in a lot of cases.\n\n302\n00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:22.310\nThat's gonna be very tough to do and\nthink about it.\n\n303\n00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:27.070\nEven if a hosting provider says yeah,\nwe'll let you do that.\n\n304\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.920\nThere's gonna be paperwork in there.\n\n305\n00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.370\nThere's gonna be a lot of paperwork and\nprocedures they wanna follow to get that\n\n306\n00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.510\ndone, in which case you know, and think\nabout something that we have in forensics.\n\n307\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:40.240\nOne of the things we pretty much beat into\neveryone's skull, we did this over and\n\n308\n00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:45.090\nover again, was when you're dealing\nwith forensics, don't touch the stuff.\n\n309\n00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:47.240\nLeave it as you find it.\n\n310\n00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:50.280\nYeah, what are you going to do, tell\nthat claw, say, that cloud, hey, just,\n\n311\n00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.910\nyou know, put everything on pause for\na second while I get this all.\n\n312\n00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:54.820\nAnd still, there's other people using it.\n\n313\n00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.470\nSo what's in memory,\nwhat's on those disks and\n\n314\n00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:01.060\neverything is getting changed\nyou know by the second so\n\n315\n00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:06.570\nyou very much could lose the stuff by the\ntime you've responded to it, it's done.\n\n316\n00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:10.570\nThat pretty much same situation could\nhappen even on a private cloud because\n\n317\n00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:12.070\nyou have multiple people access it.\n\n318\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:13.910\nUnless you're willing to go through and\njust throw a switch and\n\n319\n00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:15.400\njust stop everything right there and\n\n320\n00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.220\neven then you're not stopping\neverything on a dime.\n\n321\n00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:22.160\nThere's still stuff happening,\nbecause remember, you do have pooled and\n\n322\n00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.270\nshared resources in there.\n\n323\n00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.630\nYou could get a lot of your\nclues could be overwritten.\n\n324\n00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.050\nSo it's something really to think about.\n\n325\n00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.880\nYour forensic picture does change\n\n326\n00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.160\ndramatically just to put\nit lightly in there.\n\n327\n00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.560\nIt's something that I would almost that\nyou're going to have to plan ahead\n\n328\n00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.830\nif there is a need to do forensics\nin any of the things you go through.\n\n329\n00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.630\nIf you're going through your\nlegal paperwork and guidelines,\n\n330\n00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.470\nif there's anywhere that say that they\nneed to be open to forensic analysis or\n\n331\n00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.980\npart of your incident response\nmight necessitate that.\n\n332\n00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.190\nYou're gonna have to plan ahead.\n\n333\n00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:00.800\nYou're just plain and\nsimple gonna have to plan ahead for it so\n\n334\n00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.670\nyou can try to cover as many\nof those bases as possible.\n\n335\n00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.480\nBecause if you don't plan ahead,\nyou're just not gonna get it.\n\n336\n00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.710\n>> Would logging, I know we log things,\nwe try to keep audit trails and\n\n337\n00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:12.390\nthings like that.\n\n338\n00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:17.610\nDoing that on a much higher scale, trying\nto track everything that's going on.\n\n339\n00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.790\nWhich we normally don't do inside,\nbecause we can do that forensics,\n\n340\n00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.440\nbut in a Cloud environment,\nwhere I'm not gonna have that capability,\n\n341\n00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.910\ndoes logging become more important then?\n\n342\n00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.210\n>> It does take on more significance.\n\n343\n00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.460\nI would say that's a fair\nstatement to make, and\n\n344\n00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.130\nthat's something that I plan ahead for,\nwhen you're doing it, see, is to make sure\n\n345\n00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.870\nwhen those logs are getting gathered,\nthey are forensically sound logs.\n\n346\n00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.860\nAnd that was something that we\nkind of hammered on when we\n\n347\n00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.800\nwere talking about doing our\nwhole forensic practitioner deal.\n\n348\n00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.310\nIs we're talking about logs\nhave to be forensically sound.\n\n349\n00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.510\nSo you're gonna want to place more\nemphasis on this to make sure that they\n\n350\n00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.780\nare in a format,\nthat if you do have to call on them,\n\n351\n00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.910\nit's not just a case of that they're\ngonna be treated like hear say.\n\n352\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.850\nThat they are actually workable evidence.\n\n353\n00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.440\nThat they are something that\nwill stand up in court or\n\n354\n00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.488\nany sort of legal scrutiny\nthat might come their way.\n\n355\n00:19:09.488 --> 00:19:11.216\n>> Uh-huh, okay.\n\n356\n00:19:11.216 --> 00:19:12.340\nAnd then, of course,\n\n357\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:16.470\nwe've gotta deal with jurisdictions\nbecause the, Cloud is everywhere.\n\n358\n00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.405\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n359\n00:19:17.405 --> 00:19:22.205\nyou can go to one hosting provider and\njust because they're located in Atlanta,\n\n360\n00:19:22.205 --> 00:19:24.345\nGeorgia, doesn't mean that\ntheir data center is.\n\n361\n00:19:24.345 --> 00:19:27.415\nRight?\nData could be stored miles or\n\n362\n00:19:27.415 --> 00:19:28.575\ncountries away.\n\n363\n00:19:28.575 --> 00:19:33.055\nYeah, that's the big thing with a cloud\nis a cloud is like I said, everywhere.\n\n364\n00:19:33.055 --> 00:19:38.990\nIt's, it could be here, it could be there,\nit could be everywhere.\n\n365\n00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:44.420\nAnd so, when you start having that\nthere's different issues that come in.\n\n366\n00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:49.600\nWe talked about, and this could also\ninvolve your subcontractors too.\n\n367\n00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.260\nIs companies will subcontract them out\nto people in different countries even,\n\n368\n00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.910\neven if it's not the same company.\n\n369\n00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:56.660\nI mean, we see that with Microsoft for\nexample.\n\n370\n00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.050\nMicrosoft, at the end of the day\nyesterday when we were looking,\n\n371\n00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:04.300\nin our final episode we were saying well,\nhere's Microsoft.\n\n372\n00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.380\nAnd I showed you their\npartner program page.\n\n373\n00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:10.120\nTheir partner program page,\nthey're saying, hey,\n\n374\n00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.380\nany of you if you have the money and want\nto make the investment, you can set up\n\n375\n00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:17.380\naccording to their guidelines set\nup your own cloud facility and\n\n376\n00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.430\nbecome a partner that's branded Microsoft.\n\n377\n00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:25.090\nSo you're representing\nthem as a subcontractor,\n\n378\n00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:30.159\npeople are coming to you to host\ntheir stuff, whatever it is.\n\n379\n00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.090\nYou can be anywhere to do that.\n\n380\n00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:38.380\nYou don't have to be here in the U.S., you\ncan be in Canada, you can be in Europe,\n\n381\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:44.790\nwherever, and so that means that you do\nhave different guidelines in those places.\n\n382\n00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:51.220\nMicrosoft is gonna do some stuff to rein\nthings in to keep it as fair as possible,\n\n383\n00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.980\nbut you're still going to\nhave different guidelines and\n\n384\n00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:58.530\nthen something else that comes into play,\naside from the cloud hosting,\n\n385\n00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:04.700\nis what happens when you start\nmoving across different,\n\n386\n00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.950\nwhen you as a company\nare hosting the cloud and\n\n387\n00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.070\nyou are moving your stuff\nacross different borders.\n\n388\n00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.590\nI don't think it has to be\nnational borders either.\n\n389\n00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.860\nYou know one of the ones that\nI could keep referring back,\n\n390\n00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:24.220\nwell I'll just keep referring back\nto that company in California again.\n\n391\n00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:28.050\nIn their situation they did\nhave offices in other states.\n\n392\n00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.570\nTurns out that California has\nsome of the most rigid laws or\n\n393\n00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:36.110\ndoes have the most rigid laws according\nto everyone involved with that project,\n\n394\n00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:37.780\nas far as compliance and all that.\n\n395\n00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.280\nIt wasn't just HIPAA, it was a bunch\nof other stuff going with it, so\n\n396\n00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.540\nin their case, their solution was,\nwe're just gonna make everything,\n\n397\n00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.270\neverybody compliant to\nCalifornia standards.\n\n398\n00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:51.660\nWe're gonna bring everything up to that so\nthat may seem level as maintained.\n\n399\n00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.130\nThat may not always be the case.\n\n400\n00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.380\nThat was a convenient solution to it.\n\n401\n00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.300\nJust to say whatever security measures\nwe put in place for California,\n\n402\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.940\nthat's going to be the minimum\nstandard across the board.\n\n403\n00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.870\nGreat, if you can do that.\n\n404\n00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.090\nHey, awesome.\nThere was nothing saying they couldn't do\n\n405\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.220\nthat in other locations.\n\n406\n00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:11.070\nWhatever they used in California, heck,\nthey could use in North Carolina or\n\n407\n00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:12.780\nSouth Dakota or whatever.\n\n408\n00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:17.210\nYou know so that's all well and good, but\nonce you start crossing national borders,\n\n409\n00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:20.030\nthat could be a little trickier\nbecause there are situations,\n\n410\n00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:24.600\nyou know where,\ngoogle has some of that situation where\n\n411\n00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:29.160\nthere's that law in Europe,\nthe right to be forgotten law.\n\n412\n00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.720\nGoogle's fighting that over there,\nI believe, right now.\n\n413\n00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.480\nThat they have that, they have a law\nover there saying, you can say,\n\n414\n00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.490\ndon't preserve my information.\n\n415\n00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:42.880\nYou have a right to be\nforgotten as the law says.\n\n416\n00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.280\nWell we don't have the same law here, so\n\n417\n00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.970\nnow you've got a situation where\nthe standards have to change.\n\n418\n00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:53.080\nFrom Google's standpoint they have to\nchange how they process data over there.\n\n419\n00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.550\nAt least they're trying to stop it.\n\n420\n00:22:55.550 --> 00:23:00.060\nBut the law in Europe says no\nthey have to comply with that so\n\n421\n00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.930\nthose type of things, you may not have to\ndeal with that specific law but you will\n\n422\n00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:08.400\nhave to deal with a different law so if\nyou are a big multi-national or something\n\n423\n00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:13.160\nlike that then be prepared for all sorts\nof messes to come out if the wood work.\n\n424\n00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.410\n>> And then you had mentioned sub con.\n\n425\n00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.800\nSubcontractors, that brings in\na whole other piece to the puzzle.\n\n426\n00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.050\nWe're typically dealing with, say, some\nentity that we're buying a service from.\n\n427\n00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.770\nWe might not be aware of subcontractors\nthat are working underneath them.\n\n428\n00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.420\n>> Yeah, that can get pretty messy.\n\n429\n00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.600\nIs that you can have a subcontractor\nthat has subcontractors\n\n430\n00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.490\nsitting underneath them doing whatever.\n\n431\n00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:38.000\nIt's entirely possible and\nlet's talk about how that might actually\n\n432\n00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.400\nplay out cuz that might sound kind of\na little bit nebulous when you say it.\n\n433\n00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.630\nIt's like someone's got someone\nelse working underneath them.\n\n434\n00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:49.254\nWhat say I go to a hosting provider and I\ncontract with them to host my services so\n\n435\n00:23:49.254 --> 00:23:51.090\nI'm subcontracting to them.\n\n436\n00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:53.090\nSo, I have them hosting my stuff.\n\n437\n00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:57.690\nWell, there could be sub contractors\nin the form of their employees.\n\n438\n00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:01.870\nTheir employees may not be\npeople that are on the clock or\n\n439\n00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:03.370\ngetting salary or anything like that.\n\n440\n00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:06.080\nThey could be sub contractors themselves.\n\n441\n00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.540\nSo that brings up another\nlevel of issues there.\n\n442\n00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:14.060\nThat can very well happen, and\ndoes happen, where you have employees, or\n\n443\n00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.320\nyou have people working for you that\naren't employees, they're just contracts.\n\n444\n00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.920\nAnd so what do you do then?\n\n445\n00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:26.080\nThere's nothing saying that can't happen,\nand like I said, it does happen.\n\n446\n00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.870\nSo what are you gonna do?\n\n447\n00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:33.960\nAnd in some cases or\nin a lot of cases whatever they do, and\n\n448\n00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.290\nlet's say you're hosting your information\nwith it and since you are legally\n\n449\n00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.670\nresponsible for information,\nlet's say it's private information,\n\n450\n00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:45.690\nfinancial information whatever,\nyou are held legally responsible for it.\n\n451\n00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:49.896\nIf that sub contractor, the person you\ncontract with hires a sub contractor and\n\n452\n00:24:49.896 --> 00:24:51.040\nsomething happens.\n\n453\n00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.390\nIt doesn't matter that they did it.\n\n454\n00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:55.160\nYou're still the one on the hook for it.\n\n455\n00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.350\nSo you're gonna want to know do\nthey subcontract this stuff out.\n\n456\n00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.270\nOr it may be an important issue to\nyou if they subcontract it out,\n\n457\n00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:04.090\nwhat can actually come into play there.\n\n458\n00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:05.480\nWho knows?\n\n459\n00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.440\nThey may decide to subcontract it\nout to someone that they just don't\n\n460\n00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.650\nthey don't vet properly.\n\n461\n00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:12.970\nDefinitely seen that happen.\n\n462\n00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:17.520\nI've seen that happen of all things in\npen testing where someone comes in and\n\n463\n00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:24.770\nsells a service to them, they say well\nwe can do all this pen testing for you.\n\n464\n00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.530\nThe person coming in knows\nsquat about pen testing.\n\n465\n00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:31.870\nThey know the jargon, but they don't\nknow how to do the actual pen test, so\n\n466\n00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.220\nwhat happens is that\nthey subcontract it out.\n\n467\n00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.640\nWho do they subcontract it out to?\n\n468\n00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.600\nThem actually subcontract\nout to black hats.\n\n469\n00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.840\nSo you've got a bunch of black hats\nrunning around your network, and\n\n470\n00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:46.260\nthey're saying yep, we've got all\nthese years experience doing this.\n\n471\n00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.660\nYou're like, no they don't,\nyou have experience signing contracts,\n\n472\n00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.610\nyou don't have experience\nactually doing it.\n\n473\n00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:53.120\nAnd you're just assuming\nthat they're checked out.\n\n474\n00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.120\nNo, they're saying yeah, we'll do it.\n\n475\n00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.330\n>> What's a few extra back\ndoors in your network?\n\n476\n00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:57.895\nI mean, you know.\n\n477\n00:25:57.895 --> 00:25:58.420\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n478\n00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:00.550\nIt does happen,\n\n479\n00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:03.870\nso sometimes it gets companies that\ncan be really shady with that.\n\n480\n00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:08.615\nThat's another reason, I'm not trying\nto step on the little guy here,\n\n481\n00:26:08.615 --> 00:26:13.880\nbut make sure that you know\nwho you're dealing with.\n\n482\n00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:18.713\nIt's nothing saying this couldn't happen\nwith the bigger cloud service providers,\n\n483\n00:26:18.713 --> 00:26:21.100\nbut hopefully it's a lot less likely.\n\n484\n00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:28.930\nIt should be a lot less likely as things\ngo, but be prepared to ask questions.\n\n485\n00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:32.927\nIf you can't answer those\nquestions directly or\n\n486\n00:26:32.927 --> 00:26:37.810\ncan't get yourself at least\nan answer that satisfies you.\n\n487\n00:26:37.810 --> 00:26:40.923\nThink about if it's someone you want to\nhost with because you're the one that's\n\n488\n00:26:40.923 --> 00:26:42.460\ngonna be on the hook.\n\n489\n00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.017\n>> Now my list of questions is\ngetting longer and longer by the day.\n\n490\n00:26:46.017 --> 00:26:47.452\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n491\n00:26:47.452 --> 00:26:50.130\n>> All right, then the other\nthing that we gotta talk about,\n\n492\n00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.560\nof course, is due diligence.\n\n493\n00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.817\nCuz we can't just go out there and\nassume everything's good and\n\n494\n00:26:54.817 --> 00:26:56.030\nput our data out there.\n\n495\n00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:57.760\nWe have some responsibility there.\n\n496\n00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.460\n>> Yeah, that's what the whole purpose of\ndue diligence is is to make sure that.\n\n497\n00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:09.300\nWhen you are doing your whole assessment\nof putting stuff out in the cloud and\n\n498\n00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:13.150\nchecking on legal issues, the technical\nissues and all that good stuff,\n\n499\n00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:19.270\nthat you are doing your best\nto make sure stuff is safe.\n\n500\n00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:21.700\nThat's really what it comes down to.\n\n501\n00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.670\nYou're doing what's reasonable.\n\n502\n00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:26.960\nSo when you check all these legal issues.\n\n503\n00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.160\nWere you really thorough?\n\n504\n00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:32.120\nDid you just go through and hey,\nI picked up some papers here,\n\n505\n00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.250\nand this is a white paper.\n\n506\n00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.260\nYeah, we're good.\n\n507\n00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:34.880\n>> It's white.\n\n508\n00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.862\n>> Yeah, it works.\n\n509\n00:27:35.862 --> 00:27:36.400\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n510\n00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.020\n>> Yeah, it's white.\n\n511\n00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:38.890\nYou know.\n\n512\n00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.205\n>> I read your webpage,\nI mean it looks pretty.\n\n513\n00:27:41.205 --> 00:27:43.290\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I did my decor to my extensive\n\n514\n00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.180\nlegal research.\n\n515\n00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.980\nThis is what they call a legal brief.\n\n516\n00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.970\nSo, it's like,\nyou can't just go into court and say yeah,\n\n517\n00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:52.690\nthis is all my research.\n\n518\n00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:56.650\nYeah, you're gonna get nailed on that,\nunless this is written really well.\n\n519\n00:27:56.650 --> 00:28:01.210\nAnd so you have the gods on your side.\n\n520\n00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.240\nYou're gonna be in big trouble.\n\n521\n00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.030\nSo you've gotta show that you\nhave done what's reasonable.\n\n522\n00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:13.050\nIn the case of this company,\nI keep using that year.\n\n523\n00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.000\nThey probably could have\nsaid a few months into it.\n\n524\n00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.380\nThey probably could have said,\nyeah, we've got what we want but.\n\n525\n00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.770\nThey weren't taking a chance,\nand who would blame them?\n\n526\n00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:27.040\nGo look at the cost of\na single HIPAA violation.\n\n527\n00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:34.210\nWhat's spending a little extra time on\nit knowing that every single violation\n\n528\n00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:38.850\nin some cases can cost you, I think is\nsome cases 100 grand per violation.\n\n529\n00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.950\nNow I'll spend a little extra time on it.\n\n530\n00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:44.170\nYeah, because you don't just get,\nhey, here's one record compromise.\n\n531\n00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.230\nIt's going to be probably\nmultiple records.\n\n532\n00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:49.520\nAnd that's gonna add up really quick.\n\n533\n00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.320\nSo do your due diligence.\n\n534\n00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.560\nExercise due care.\n\n535\n00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.650\nDo what's reasonable.\n\n536\n00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:01.200\nDue diligence you're continuing\nto do what's reasonable.\n\n537\n00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.750\nSo you're gonna want to have system audits\nin place to check to make sure you're\n\n538\n00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:05.880\nstill compliant.\n\n539\n00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.240\nYou're gonna have people\nchecking the legal guidelines so\n\n540\n00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.530\nif they change they can say,\n\n541\n00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:15.260\nyeah they changed we gotta make tweaks\nto make sure that we're still compliant.\n\n542\n00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:19.250\nThat's happened, I mean HIPAA's\nanother great example of that.\n\n543\n00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:23.750\nBecause HIPAA, it's been around\na lot longer than people realize.\n\n544\n00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.270\nI want to say,\nit's been around in some way, shape,\n\n545\n00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:29.910\nor form for about 20 years since\nit was originally passed to now.\n\n546\n00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:33.680\nSo it didn't all come in to\neffect all those years ago.\n\n547\n00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.280\nIt came into effect in phases.\n\n548\n00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.120\nSo if you were, let's just say, for\n\n549\n00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.940\nthe sake of this little thought\nexperiment we have going on here.\n\n550\n00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:48.510\nLet's just say that, you know, 20 years\nago we did have a cloud solution, and\n\n551\n00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:50.590\nHIPAA came into effect.\n\n552\n00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.430\nAs it came through and it got phased in,\n\n553\n00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:55.630\nwe could have brought it in at the very\nbeginning, HIPAA comes into effect and\n\n554\n00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.440\nsays, okay,\nwell you gotta do these things.\n\n555\n00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.851\nWe could flip those switches,\nthen it says by such and\n\n556\n00:29:59.851 --> 00:30:01.210\nsuch date, you gotta have these things.\n\n557\n00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.290\nSo, you're doing audits, and\nyou gotta make sure that, hey,\n\n558\n00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:06.960\nyou're making the changes to be compliant\nat that date, or that milestone.\n\n559\n00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.270\nAnd then just keep going on along the way.\n\n560\n00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.100\nAnd they usually always\ngive you lead time.\n\n561\n00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.590\nThey don't always say,\nhey it's gotta be done right now.\n\n562\n00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:17.350\nSometimes that does happen, but usually if\nthey say it needs to be done right now,\n\n563\n00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.735\nit's a major thing, or you've screwed up.\n\n564\n00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:22.150\n[LAUGH] You've really screwed up.\n\n565\n00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:26.850\nI've seen situations where there's been\ntechnical solutions in place where\n\n566\n00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:31.680\nan organization or a company got\nstopped from doing anything until they\n\n567\n00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:37.000\nwere brought into compliance and\nthat's because they didn't do it before.\n\n568\n00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.280\nI can think of a company that did,\nit wasn't a cloud solution but\n\n569\n00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.030\nit shows you the way that works.\n\n570\n00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:45.390\nThere was a company I know that did,\n\n571\n00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:50.460\nthat processes,\nit's not the Trusted Traveler Program, but\n\n572\n00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:55.340\nwhen you go through the airports here in\nthe States, they in their previous form,\n\n573\n00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.810\nnot the current owners, but\nthe previous form of the program.\n\n574\n00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:03.690\nThey were told by the TSA and\nthe FFA they were saying that,\n\n575\n00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:07.410\nhey, you've got to store this\ninformation in an encrypted format and\n\n576\n00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:09.030\nthey were saying, yeah okay we got it.\n\n577\n00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:11.148\nThey missed a few things and so or\n\n578\n00:31:11.148 --> 00:31:15.940\nit showed that they were probably\na little negligent when they did that.\n\n579\n00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.507\nAnd so what happened is that when they\nfound out that there was a security\n\n580\n00:31:19.507 --> 00:31:22.718\nbreach and then found out,\nhey you didn't encrypt this stuff,\n\n581\n00:31:22.718 --> 00:31:24.820\nthey told them you're dead in the water.\n\n582\n00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.730\nYou aren't doing squat until you fix that.\n\n583\n00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:31.450\nOkay, but, in that case, when they\nstopped him dead in the water, they were\n\n584\n00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.860\nwarned and told that they had to do this\nahead of time and they didn't do it.\n\n585\n00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.600\nSo most of the time you're\ngonna get a lead time in there\n\n586\n00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.510\nsaying you need to be compliant.\n\n587\n00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:43.502\nThat's great with something like a cloud\nsolution, because it's not necessarily\n\n588\n00:31:43.502 --> 00:31:47.560\nalways easy to change, especially when\nyou're talking a big enterprise solution.\n\n589\n00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.312\nSo you may need some time,\nyou may need six months or\n\n590\n00:31:50.312 --> 00:31:53.460\na year to do it, and\nyou can very well get that time to do it.\n\n591\n00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:55.838\n>> So it really sounds like we've\ngotta stay on top, of course,\n\n592\n00:31:55.838 --> 00:31:57.550\nof the regulations, cuz those can change.\n\n593\n00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:59.450\nAnd then also, I guess,\nour providers can change.\n\n594\n00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:03.691\nI remember you telling the story about how\nyou had some cloud services that actually\n\n595\n00:32:03.691 --> 00:32:05.278\nmoved to a different company.\n\n596\n00:32:05.278 --> 00:32:07.449\nAll of a sudden, you gotta do\nyour research all over again and\n\n597\n00:32:07.449 --> 00:32:08.611\nsee how these people do things.\n\n598\n00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:14.528\n>> Yep, be prepared, cuz these cloud\nproviders do, well any provider really.\n\n599\n00:32:14.528 --> 00:32:19.503\nAnd probably everybody in IT has some\nstory like that where they went with one\n\n600\n00:32:19.503 --> 00:32:23.777\nprovider and it got gobbled up by\nanother one, so what happened is\n\n601\n00:32:23.777 --> 00:32:28.621\nthat when it got gobbled up by another\ncompany, how does that impact you?\n\n602\n00:32:28.621 --> 00:32:32.456\nI mean, a lot of those companies when\nthey gobble up another one will say, hey,\n\n603\n00:32:32.456 --> 00:32:35.836\nyour servers won't change or\nanything, but that's usually just for\n\n604\n00:32:35.836 --> 00:32:37.286\na short kind of trial period.\n\n605\n00:32:37.286 --> 00:32:40.950\nOnce the honeymoon period is over,\nthey can start tweaking things and\n\n606\n00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:42.326\ndoing all sorts of stuff.\n\n607\n00:32:42.326 --> 00:32:46.080\nSo you do need to be kind of on\nthe ball when you hear that and\n\n608\n00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:51.011\nbe aware of things to make sure that,\nhey, if they're required by someone\n\n609\n00:32:51.011 --> 00:32:56.023\nelse that you're still gonna be able to\nmaintain the same level of service or\n\n610\n00:32:56.023 --> 00:32:59.825\nyou have enough time to start\nmigrating over to another.\n\n611\n00:32:59.825 --> 00:33:03.231\nYour hosting provider that can help\nyou out, cuz sometimes that happens,\n\n612\n00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:05.895\nthey say, well,\nwe're not gonna be doing that anymore.\n\n613\n00:33:05.895 --> 00:33:10.542\nThat was something that was a unique\napplication or a unique situation and so\n\n614\n00:33:10.542 --> 00:33:13.100\nwe're just not gonna be doing that.\n\n615\n00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.122\nBut we'll support you for\nthe next six months to a year,\n\n616\n00:33:16.122 --> 00:33:19.545\nthey usually don't just say,\nhey, cut the cord, bye-bye.\n\n617\n00:33:19.545 --> 00:33:21.357\nThey'll give you some time,\n\n618\n00:33:21.357 --> 00:33:26.070\nso you can start planning your migration\nover to go to a new host and provider.\n\n619\n00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:28.659\nAnd then be okay, but, yeah, you're right.\n\n620\n00:33:28.659 --> 00:33:33.560\nThese things can definitely change and\nfor a long time in the cloud\n\n621\n00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:39.097\nenvironment it still does happen is\nin the cloud environment you did see.\n\n622\n00:33:39.097 --> 00:33:43.718\nFor a long time, the big guys\ngobbling up some of the smaller guys.\n\n623\n00:33:43.718 --> 00:33:48.257\nIt's not happening at the same pace\nit was, but it still does happen.\n\n624\n00:33:48.257 --> 00:33:53.255\nIt used to be there was a lot of them out\nthere and they started getting gobbled up\n\n625\n00:33:53.255 --> 00:33:57.527\nand consolidating not so much, but\nI can see something like that.\n\n626\n00:33:57.527 --> 00:34:01.172\n>> I went with a small provider,\nall their datacenters are local and\n\n627\n00:34:01.172 --> 00:34:02.240\nwithin the state.\n\n628\n00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.347\nAnd all of a sudden, they get bought\nup by some bigger company and my data,\n\n629\n00:34:05.347 --> 00:34:07.569\nall of a sudden is being\nstored overseas somewhere.\n\n630\n00:34:07.569 --> 00:34:11.621\nAnd I didn't realize that until it\nwas too late, I did an audit and\n\n631\n00:34:11.621 --> 00:34:13.920\nwe see some nasty things happening.\n\n632\n00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.568\nSo due diligence is really stressed,\nwe've got to stay on top of that.\n\n633\n00:34:17.568 --> 00:34:19.646\nWe've got to pay attention\nto those changes.\n\n634\n00:34:19.646 --> 00:34:23.372\n>> Yeah, ignorance of the change\nis not gonna help throughout.\n\n635\n00:34:23.372 --> 00:34:25.091\n>> [LAUGH] Not gonna fly\nin front of the judge.\n\n636\n00:34:25.091 --> 00:34:27.947\n>> Yeah, that's plain and\nsimple due diligence.\n\n637\n00:34:27.947 --> 00:34:28.457\n>> Yeah.\n\n638\n00:34:28.457 --> 00:34:29.086\n>> It's like well I didn't know.\n\n639\n00:34:29.086 --> 00:34:33.009\nYeah, try saying that next time you\nget pulled over a speeding ticket.\n\n640\n00:34:33.009 --> 00:34:34.368\nI didn't know it was against the law.\n\n641\n00:34:34.368 --> 00:34:35.947\nI didn't know what the speed limit was.\n\n642\n00:34:35.947 --> 00:34:38.536\nWell, I'll write you a ticket for\nbeing stupid too.\n\n643\n00:34:38.536 --> 00:34:40.373\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like here you go.\n\n644\n00:34:40.373 --> 00:34:42.974\nIt's just not going to help you out.\n\n645\n00:34:42.974 --> 00:34:44.774\nSo due diligence.\n\n646\n00:34:44.774 --> 00:34:45.714\n>> Gotta stay on top it.\n\n647\n00:34:45.714 --> 00:34:47.595\nWell, Sean,\na lot of great information there.\n\n648\n00:34:47.595 --> 00:34:49.441\nActually, made the legal\nstuff pretty darn exciting.\n\n649\n00:34:49.441 --> 00:34:50.236\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n650\n00:34:50.236 --> 00:34:53.821\na lot of things you've gotta stay on top\nof when it comes to the legal aspects of\n\n651\n00:34:53.821 --> 00:34:56.928\nthinking about moving to the cloud,\nbe it public, be it private.\n\n652\n00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.753\nGotta stay on top of that.\n\n653\n00:34:58.753 --> 00:35:00.852\nAnything else we need to throw\nin here before we wrap it up?\n\n654\n00:35:00.852 --> 00:35:02.733\n>> No, I think we got it all.\n\n655\n00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:03.393\nI think we did.\n\n656\n00:35:03.393 --> 00:35:06.086\n>> Well, ladies and gentlemen,\nI hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n657\n00:35:06.086 -->

00:00:14.980\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.630\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.040\nAnd in this episode, Sean,\n\n6\n00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.980\nwe're going head into, we're going to\nstart dealing with the investigations.\n\n7\n00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.040\nWe've talked a little bit about some of\nthe legal aspects that we have to deal\n\n8\n00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.350\nwith when we consider\nmoving into the cloud.\n\n9\n00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.720\nI guess the next thing we really need to\ntalk about is dealing with investigations\n\n10\n00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.040\nwhen that unfortunate incident occurs and\nwe have to go through our procedures.\n\n11\n00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.860\nCuz they're not gonna be\nthe same as they are,\n\n12\n00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.555\nwhat we're used to dealing with, right?\n\n13\n00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:42.250\n>> [LAUGH] Definitely not at all.\n\n14\n00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.000\nEasiest way to avoid an investigation\nis to stop whatever it is you're\n\n15\n00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.090\ndoing illegal.\n\n16\n00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.340\nThat'd be step number one.\n\n17\n00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.905\n[LAUGH] So, you know who you are.\n\n18\n00:00:53.905 --> 00:00:57.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yeah we're\n\n19\n00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.320\ntalking about what happens when or\nwhat you need to be prepared for\n\n20\n00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.320\nI guess is another way to put\nit if an investigation happens.\n\n21\n00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.654\nI mean this does occur from time to time,\nand it doesn't always need to be just\n\n22\n00:01:10.654 --> 00:01:15.100\nbecause you broke the law or\nyou're suspected of breaking the law.\n\n23\n00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.380\nIt could be for other reasons.\n\n24\n00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.392\nCould be just for, could be in\nthe form of a compliance audit and\n\n25\n00:01:21.392 --> 00:01:26.030\nthey want to actually do a little\nmore probing to see what's happening.\n\n26\n00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.810\nOne investigative scenario I'm familiar\nwith was a company I worked for\n\n27\n00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.849\nin the past was acquiring another company.\n\n28\n00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.190\nAnd when they inquire, when they acquired\nthis other company because it was two big,\n\n29\n00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.900\nbig, big multi million.\n\n30\n00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.030\nWell, one multi billion and\none multi million dollar company.\n\n31\n00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.390\nSince you're talking\nsomething of that scale.\n\n32\n00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.450\nWhen those to came together, what\nhappened is that the FTC jumped in, which\n\n33\n00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.300\nyou would expect them to, it's something\nwith two people in the same industry.\n\n34\n00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.410\nWhen these two companies try to come\ntogether, FTC jumps in to see if there\n\n35\n00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.710\nis a loss of competition or anything or\nif there's any impact on the consumer.\n\n36\n00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.410\nAnd so what happened was there was\nan investigation being done and\n\n37\n00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.640\nit was pretty intense.\n\n38\n00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.930\nAnd it wasn't that anyone did anything\nillegal, it was just that they wanted to\n\n39\n00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.820\nmake sure that these things were,\nthat there were certain guidelines being\n\n40\n00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.050\nfollowed and there wasn't any undo impact\nor burden being put on the industry.\n\n41\n00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.760\nAnd so it did take the form,\n\n42\n00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.630\nalmost the exact same form as if\nsomeone had asked for an e-discovery.\n\n43\n00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.240\nAnd asked for all sorts of\nlitigation holds and all that.\n\n44\n00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.040\nWe actually had to preserve a lot of\ninformation for quite a long time.\n\n45\n00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.550\nUntil it was determined that yeah there\nwasn't any burden on the consumer.\n\n46\n00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.600\nAnd so it was an interesting thing but\nit's just to kinda show you, it doesn't\n\n47\n00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.500\nmean that investigation is automatically\nassuming that, hey, you've broken the law.\n\n48\n00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.810\nNo, you don't have to break the law.\n\n49\n00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.220\nIt can be just because something\nhappened that they need\n\n50\n00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.590\nto just take a closer look at things.\n\n51\n00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.560\nAnytime you see large companies\nputting their stuff together,\n\n52\n00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.800\nthere's investigations happening.\n\n53\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.350\nIt's just a matter of course.\n\n54\n00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.090\nI think of one of the larger\nacquisitions I've seen recently\n\n55\n00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.020\nwas U.S. Airways and American Airlines.\n\n56\n00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.000\nWhen those two came together, FTC was\ndoing a big investigation on that because\n\n57\n00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.520\nyou're talking two major air\ncarriers are coming together and\n\n58\n00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.470\nthey're both huge already as it is, and\nthey're making an even bigger entity, but\n\n59\n00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.150\nalso taking away some of\nthe competition that was out there.\n\n60\n00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.390\nAnd so, they were taking a long, long look\nat it, and I think that investigation like\n\n61\n00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.610\nmost of them, is you're talking at least\na year while they crawl through every.\n\n62\n00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.670\nSo if you're talking something like that,\n\n63\n00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.610\nand you're involved in\nan enterprise solution like that.\n\n64\n00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.119\nBe prepared that that could\nbe something that you're\n\n65\n00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:10.130\nasked to change your behavior for.\n\n66\n00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.274\n>> And I know here in the U.S. we've got\nthe federal government to deal with and\n\n67\n00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:18.060\nthey've got their rules and\nregulations that we have to comply with.\n\n68\n00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.720\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah don't they?\n\n69\n00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.350\n>> One or two.\n\n70\n00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.630\n>> [LAUGH] Really nothing\nthat significant.\n\n71\n00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.620\nBut yeah there's a lot of\nlaws at the federal level.\n\n72\n00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.370\nAnd we're, again, we're not gonna try to\nturn you into a lawyer in any of this.\n\n73\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.700\nBut we do need to mention it.\n\n74\n00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.315\nI know, that's a whole other course.\n\n75\n00:04:36.315 --> 00:04:38.425\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We've got a two day course here at\n\n76\n00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:40.160\nITProTV that you can take.\n\n77\n00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.610\nIt's about ten hours.\n\n78\n00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.426\nYou'll be a lawyer at\nlaw school like that.\n\n79\n00:04:43.426 --> 00:04:47.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But in any case, yeah.\n\n80\n00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.860\nWhat you have one of the laws we\nhave here is the body of laws,\n\n81\n00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.370\nthe federal rules of civil procedure.\n\n82\n00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.148\nIt's an old set of laws and\nit's been evolving and you can actually\n\n83\n00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:03.550\nif you really want to get into it,\nthere's a bunch of documentation online.\n\n84\n00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.960\nYou can find a Wikipedia article which is\njust go read some hieroglyphics online.\n\n85\n00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.090\nIt's about as understandable as that.\n\n86\n00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.078\nBut really what it does,\nit's laws that govern and\n\n87\n00:05:18.078 --> 00:05:22.345\nunify how they can request\ncertain things to be done and\n\n88\n00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:26.260\ncertain procedures that\nthe feds have to follow.\n\n89\n00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.520\nIt actually streamlines\nthe process to a certain degree.\n\n90\n00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.400\nOf them asking for a certain piece of\ninformation like how to ask for evidence,\n\n91\n00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.390\nhow to ask certain\ninformation to be provided.\n\n92\n00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.420\nThat's really what it governs without\ngetting in too deeply into it.\n\n93\n00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.085\nI know you guys really want\nmore information than that,\n\n94\n00:05:44.085 --> 00:05:45.339\nme really to get in depth.\n\n95\n00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:46.474\n>> Can we please, can we huh?\n\n96\n00:05:46.474 --> 00:05:48.476\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n97\n00:05:48.476 --> 00:05:50.970\nthere's this great resource called Google.\n\n98\n00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.100\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n99\n00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.144\n>> But it really just kinda governs on how\n\n100\n00:05:55.144 --> 00:05:57.720\nthey can request information.\n\n101\n00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.010\nCertain procedures they can\nfollow during an investigation.\n\n102\n00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.180\nThat's really about as much as we\nneed to get into it for right now.\n\n103\n00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.420\nWe don't need to get any deeper than that.\n\n104\n00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:15.050\nI've always searched for\na really easy way to crystallize that.\n\n105\n00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.650\nIt's either you go into it a little,\nor you just jump right in.\n\n106\n00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.700\nYou don't, you either dip your toe in or\n\n107\n00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.730\nyou're going to the diving board and\nright on in you know.\n\n108\n00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.620\nThat's it.\n\n109\n00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.000\n>> There's no two page\npaper that sums it all up.\n\n110\n00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.800\n>> Yeah, there isn't.\n\n111\n00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.860\nSo if any of you look at it,\nmore power to you.\n\n112\n00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:40.700\nBut the good thing is, you really don't\nneed to know a ton about it for the exam.\n\n113\n00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.990\nThey don't expect you to have that\nreally really in depth knowledge and\n\n114\n00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.350\nexpect you to know how it comes in.\n\n115\n00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.610\nBut that's not really,\n\n116\n00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.160\nthere not really expecting you to become\nsomeone that can just chatterbox it back.\n\n117\n00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.560\nYou know, for you it means, for\nyou as the person that's working with this\n\n118\n00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.720\ncloud solution, you need to be aware that\nthere are certain procedures in place.\n\n119\n00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.660\nCertain things have to be followed.\n\n120\n00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.410\nYou should not just be someone\nwhere someone could ask for\n\n121\n00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.530\na piece of information or\nwhatever and you just provide it.\n\n122\n00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:14.520\nThere's definitely a lot\nof things wrong with that.\n\n123\n00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.540\nIf you're just, oh,\nyou need a piece of information?\n\n124\n00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.720\nHere you go, here's a thumb drive.\n\n125\n00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.380\nThat's a bad idea.\n\n126\n00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.310\nThere's certain things that have\nto be followed to make sure things\n\n127\n00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.930\nare preserved the right way,\nthat they get into the right hands.\n\n128\n00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.670\nThat there's not any issues with\ndata leakage, anything like that.\n\n129\n00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.760\nThere's certain things\nthat have to be done.\n\n130\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.036\nI mean, heck, just the simple\nfact if you take a lot of these,\n\n131\n00:07:35.036 --> 00:07:39.194\na lot of that stuff off the table, if it\ncomes down to, well, someone asked for\n\n132\n00:07:39.194 --> 00:07:42.210\na piece of information\nduring an investigation.\n\n133\n00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:47.210\nAnd I just say, okay,\nwell no procedure's being followed.\n\n134\n00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.700\nJust like, okay yeah,\nI can get that for you,\n\n135\n00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.740\nput it on a thumb drive and\ngive it to you.\n\n136\n00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.991\nYou could cause a serious problem for\nyourself.\n\n137\n00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:56.996\nYou could be running afoul of\na whole bunch of laws, and heck,\n\n138\n00:07:56.996 --> 00:08:02.003\none of the things that you could really\ncause yourself a problem with is that,\n\n139\n00:08:02.003 --> 00:08:04.179\nremember when we did forensics.\n\n140\n00:08:04.179 --> 00:08:09.842\nOne of the things that we have to be\nprepared to do is when we are hired by\n\n141\n00:08:09.842 --> 00:08:16.400\none side, one client to process evidence\nor process a crime scene or whatever.\n\n142\n00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.110\nAnd take a look at it and\ngive our opinion on it.\n\n143\n00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:22.160\nWhatever our findings are,\n\n144\n00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.000\nhas to be readily available\nto the other side as well.\n\n145\n00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.330\nThey have to be able to scrutinize it.\n\n146\n00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.660\nJust like we're able to request it\nthe other way if they do the same.\n\n147\n00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:34.780\nThe thing is, is that if you just provide\nthat evidence to it, or something.\n\n148\n00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.510\nA piece of information to someone.\n\n149\n00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.200\nYou may be providing something that\ngives them something that the other side\n\n150\n00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:39.900\ndoesn't have.\n\n151\n00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.490\nIn some cases that's fine.\n\n152\n00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.750\nIn some cases it wouldn't be but\nyou're not the lawyer here.\n\n153\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.580\nYou're supposed to be going\nthrough procedures to make sure\n\n154\n00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.650\nthat's done the right way.\n\n155\n00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.130\nSo if someone's requesting it.\n\n156\n00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.900\nMake sure procedures are followed.\n\n157\n00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:57.920\nMake sure that especially if it's\na part of an investigation, someone's\n\n158\n00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.980\nasking to provide a piece of\ninformation or do something.\n\n159\n00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.570\nThen that should referred\nto legal department,\n\n160\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.940\nthere's a process that is followed.\n\n161\n00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:13.280\nNotice if you go to some providers, you\nmay have actually run into this yourself.\n\n162\n00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.400\nIf you ask certain providers or\ncertain tech companies that you work with,\n\n163\n00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.450\nif you ask them for a piece of information\nor ask them to do something for\n\n164\n00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:24.260\nyou, they may very well say,\nyou're gonna have to go through and\n\n165\n00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.750\nmake a special request and\nfill out some paperwork.\n\n166\n00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.840\nI've had that happen myself\nwhen I wanted to get something.\n\n167\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.860\nYou get background\ninformation on something.\n\n168\n00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:38.110\nSomething that I knew was just a matter\nof them going through their database and\n\n169\n00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.940\npulling even the metadata off\nthat file to get me what I want.\n\n170\n00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.610\nI knew technically,\n\n171\n00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:47.430\nit was an easy thing to do, but legally,\nthere's something that had to be done.\n\n172\n00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.360\nI had to go through the legal department,\n\n173\n00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.130\nwhich would give me paperwork\nthat I had to file.\n\n174\n00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.816\nAnd then in x number of days they get\nback to me and either approve it or\n\n175\n00:09:54.816 --> 00:09:56.890\ntell me that they need more information.\n\n176\n00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.370\nAnd just blah, blah, blah right on.\n\n177\n00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.520\nRight on through.\n\n178\n00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:06.697\nAnd sometimes, yes, it can be frustrating,\nbut it's just a necessary thing.\n\n179\n00:10:06.697 --> 00:10:11.220\nHeck I've had, believe it or\nnot, as an author,\n\n180\n00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:15.529\nI've had,\nI shouldn't say believe it or not,\n\n181\n00:10:15.529 --> 00:10:20.836\nbelieve it or I don't care,\nbut I've had, as an author.\n\n182\n00:10:20.836 --> 00:10:25.498\nI've seen, you know,\nsome of my books online on\n\n183\n00:10:25.498 --> 00:10:30.048\nsome of these sites that download for\nfree, and\n\n184\n00:10:30.048 --> 00:10:36.880\nthe thing is that I could go out there and\nsay, well, pull that down.\n\n185\n00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.150\nYou're not authorized to have it.\n\n186\n00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.950\nI wrote it.\n\n187\n00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:46.294\nYou can't just do that, you know,\nI'm owed something for licensing that.\n\n188\n00:10:46.294 --> 00:10:49.572\nEven a site that's doing that\nlegitimately, if I had a problem with it,\n\n189\n00:10:49.572 --> 00:10:51.420\nthere's gonna be procedure to follow.\n\n190\n00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:53.640\nThey'd be like, can you prove it?\n\n191\n00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.590\nHeck, to get Amazon to make\nit change on something\n\n192\n00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.080\nI had to go to a special procedure.\n\n193\n00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.640\nI'm like, that's kinda like my name,\n\n194\n00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:04.920\nI got a verified author account and\nall the stuff matches.\n\n195\n00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.260\nAre you sure that's you?\n\n196\n00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.200\nNo, there's a lot of\npeople named Sean Oriyano.\n\n197\n00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.431\n>> Will the real Sean Oriyano\nplease stand up?\n\n198\n00:11:11.431 --> 00:11:16.210\n>> Uh-huh, yeah, it could be a pain.\n\n199\n00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:21.280\nSo, that's why, heck, in my case,\nif I was gonna pursue something online\n\n200\n00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.440\nas an author I'm just gonna go to,\nthat goes to my publisher.\n\n201\n00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.520\nMy publisher handles it because\nI know I can directly go and\n\n202\n00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.550\nstart something there to see\nif I can get any traction.\n\n203\n00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.500\nBut first procedures-\n>> You get the team of lawyers and\n\n204\n00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.050\nthe people who have dealt with\nthis before and things like that.\n\n205\n00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.530\n>> Yeah.\nIf that has to occur and then I also,\n\n206\n00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.890\nsee Rick brings up\na good question in here.\n\n207\n00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:47.610\nThere's procedures.\n\n208\n00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:48.490\nSocial engineering.\n\n209\n00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.660\nIt's a very real issue.\n\n210\n00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:56.140\nSo someone to being asked to\nprovide a piece of information.\n\n211\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.060\nIt could be easy for someone just\nto walk up that they know, and\n\n212\n00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.590\nsay well, can you provide me this?\n\n213\n00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.750\nOr social engineer them to get that\npiece of information from them.\n\n214\n00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:09.010\nWell, if you tell that person that anyone,\nI don't care who it is,\n\n215\n00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.550\nI don't care if it's your mother\nthat comes and asks you for this.\n\n216\n00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.970\nWell, what you're gonna need to do is\nrefer that to the appropriate people.\n\n217\n00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:20.650\nThat's a very good point, it's done\nto safeguard against those things.\n\n218\n00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:25.090\nYou don't just see it here, actually,\nI know in a lot of cases you'll see that\n\n219\n00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:28.370\nthey put these procedures in place for\nthat exact same reason.\n\n220\n00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:29.640\nSo, nope.\n\n221\n00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.550\n>> And then you mentioned meta data.\n\n222\n00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:32.300\nThat's another thing.\n\n223\n00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.340\nNot only do you have to worry about\nthe documents and whether or not we\n\n224\n00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.420\nshould disclose them or if we're allowed\nto do that and the proper procedure,\n\n225\n00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.420\nwe got to worry about what all is included\nbecause it's not just the information.\n\n226\n00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:46.590\nWhen you look at a PDF or\na photo or something like that.\n\n227\n00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.070\nIt's not only that information\nyou're dealing with, right?\n\n228\n00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.010\n>> Absolutely not.\n\n229\n00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:55.320\nThere's a lot of stuff hiding\nunderneath the surface.\n\n230\n00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:02.360\nI don't know how many of you watched\nour whole CEH stuff that Mike and\n\n231\n00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:08.020\nI did but, one of the tools that was\nused in there was a tool called EcoSEC.\n\n232\n00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:12.710\nAnd, if you recall, a lot of people\nspent a lot of time, on that,\n\n233\n00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:15.065\nI'm probably responsible for\nthe huge spike in traffic.\n\n234\n00:13:15.065 --> 00:13:17.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Been there, but that site,\n\n235\n00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:21.920\nyou can go to Echosec.net\nif you haven't seen it.\n\n236\n00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:30.410\nIf you go to that site, then you can go\nto a place on the surface of the earth.\n\n237\n00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.760\nDraw a box around it and\nit will find all the tweets and\n\n238\n00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.560\nYouTube videos, Facebook postings,\nand a whole host of other stuff,\n\n239\n00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.210\nInstagram, stuff like that,\nthat has been posted from that location.\n\n240\n00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.440\nIt's doing that off of metadata.\n\n241\n00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.400\nYou know, that's what it is.\n\n242\n00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.690\nThat stuff is stored in a big database,\n\n243\n00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.310\nnow there's nothing without me\nknowing anything about their back end,\n\n244\n00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:57.190\nI'll just say that it's a cloud situation\nback there, that they're pulling\n\n245\n00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:01.380\nfrom all these different services and\npooling it out and that type of situation.\n\n246\n00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.310\nAnd it's not unreasonable to think that\nthey're using some sort of cloud-based\n\n247\n00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.850\nsituation back there.\n\n248\n00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:11.770\nWell, if they're pulling\nall that metadata off and\n\n249\n00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.820\ndisplaying it out there,\nthat's how their service works.\n\n250\n00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.610\nNow their service is used for\ntotally legitimate reasons.\n\n251\n00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.960\nBut you could see by the same token\n\n252\n00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.300\nthat if you have a service that you're\nproviding out there and you're not making\n\n253\n00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:30.730\nsure you're sanitizing the information\nthat's being put out there, eliminate it,\n\n254\n00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.385\nsomeone could easily go through and\nread that meta data and may be able to.\n\n255\n00:14:34.385 --> 00:14:38.245\nAble to do something that we call\ninference, that if you've gone through\n\n256\n00:14:39.665 --> 00:14:43.585\nthe certification or\nif you've gone through other areas,\n\n257\n00:14:43.585 --> 00:14:47.450\nyou've seen that database people are very,\nvery familiar with that.\n\n258\n00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:52.660\nWhere you don't necessarily see\nthe information you're looking for,\n\n259\n00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:55.710\nthere's a black hole here but\nthere's information around it that\n\n260\n00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.630\nyou can actually see what's\ninside that black hole.\n\n261\n00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.790\nSo that's something that metadata\ncould actually provide and\n\n262\n00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.320\nyou could leak information\nthat you shouldn't be leaking.\n\n263\n00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.010\n>> Right, so we gotta make sure\nwe're either scrubbing that or\n\n264\n00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.610\ngetting rid of that, I suppose?\n\n265\n00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.750\n>> Yeah.\nAnd there's a lot of procedures for\n\n266\n00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.470\nthat, for scrubbing that information.\n\n267\n00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:20.230\nOne of the things I'd look into is\nsomething called anti-forensic procedures,\n\n268\n00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.490\nand you do wanna be careful with that.\n\n269\n00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:26.130\nThere's a lot of anti-forensic\nprocedures they fall under,\n\n270\n00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:27.850\na lot of these things will\nfall underneath that.\n\n271\n00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.510\nThat can selectively strip out\nthis information for images.\n\n272\n00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.850\nThere's a whole bunch of stuff out\nthere that strips out xif data.\n\n273\n00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:40.640\nIt just goes there and takes out the,\ntakes off those attributes.\n\n274\n00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.398\nAnd because you have, you know you\nhave smart phones that when you take\n\n275\n00:15:44.398 --> 00:15:48.919\na picture with, they embed certain things\ninto the image and we can actually extract\n\n276\n00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:52.165\nthose things off of it and\nsee where you were when you took it,\n\n277\n00:15:52.165 --> 00:15:56.140\nwhat camera were you using, what time\nof day, all those things off of it.\n\n278\n00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.650\nYou know so\nyou can strip those things out.\n\n279\n00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.773\nSo there's procedures for\npretty much everything to get rid of it.\n\n280\n00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:04.977\nIt just depends how much you want to\nget rid of or even even want to block.\n\n281\n00:16:04.977 --> 00:16:05.501\n>> All right and\n\n282\n00:16:05.501 --> 00:16:08.414\nthen we've got another one we've\ngotta talk about is litigation hold.\n\n283\n00:16:08.414 --> 00:16:09.737\nThat sounds fun.\n\n284\n00:16:09.737 --> 00:16:11.472\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, doesn't it?\n\n285\n00:16:11.472 --> 00:16:13.180\n[LAUGH]\n>> Pretty much, what does that mean?\n\n286\n00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.800\nJust your data is on hold,\nyou can't touch it until we say you can?\n\n287\n00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:20.550\n>> Yeah it's essentially\nthat's what it is.\n\n288\n00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:26.130\nIt sounds pretty easy when you\nlook at it on the surface.\n\n289\n00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.800\nBut, there's more to it\nobviously than that.\n\n290\n00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.331\nNothing simple with the law, right.\n\n291\n00:16:31.331 --> 00:16:33.363\n[LAUGH]\n>> I got freezing access to all of my data\n\n292\n00:16:33.363 --> 00:16:35.581\nuntil the courts or\nthey finish their process.\n\n293\n00:16:35.581 --> 00:16:37.530\nThat sounds like a real challenge.\n\n294\n00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:44.470\n>> It could very well be that you\nhave to retain copies of data.\n\n295\n00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:49.220\nLet's say for\nexample you've got an email system.\n\n296\n00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:54.810\nA email system you could be flagging\ncertain types of information\n\n297\n00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:58.710\nfrom certain key people, you can look for\nkey words and certain key people.\n\n298\n00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.490\nAnd that information gets stored\nsome place cause that may need to be\n\n299\n00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.415\ninvestigated later on.\n\n300\n00:17:04.415 --> 00:17:08.370\nExchange has stuff like that,\nspecifically litigation hold so\n\n301\n00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:10.330\nyou can't delete certain things.\n\n302\n00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:14.180\nIt's gonna be there, and\nsomeone can retrieve that stuff out of it.\n\n303\n00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.940\nThey've got features specifically for\nthat, which most mail systems do.\n\n304\n00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:23.870\nOne, to use an example where\nlitigation holds can come in.\n\n305\n00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:27.290\nI was using,\nI go back to the company I worked for\n\n306\n00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:31.710\nyears ago, when we acquired another\ncompany we were told by legal department,\n\n307\n00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.340\ndon't delete anything or\nget rid of certain paperwork.\n\n308\n00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:39.770\nThere was a litigation hold put on that,\njust in case that the FTC came in and\n\n309\n00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:44.250\nsaid, we need to look at all the emails\npertaining to this, this, or this.\n\n310\n00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.880\nThey were there.\n\n311\n00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.010\nIf those messages or\nthat information was somehow destroyed or\n\n312\n00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:54.030\nlost then there would be a problem,\nthere would be a definite problem.\n\n313\n00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:59.860\nLitigation holds are something that,\nfirst of all, you should be prepared for.\n\n314\n00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:02.990\nJust in case be aware of what they are,\nfamiliarize yourself with it.\n\n315\n00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.540\nSo just in case the call comes down\nyour not caught flat-footed and\n\n316\n00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.090\ndon't know how to handle it.\n\n317\n00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.340\nThat would be the case if you have\na messaging system right now,\n\n318\n00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.560\nif someone told you, if I came to you and\nhanded you something saying,\n\n319\n00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:19.090\nyou have a litigation hold put on you\nI need you to retain this information.\n\n320\n00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.420\nYou better be aware of how to do that so\nsomeone isn't actively going out there and\n\n321\n00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:23.060\ndeleting this stuff.\n\n322\n00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:27.860\nYou just go in and go click, click,\nclick, click and have it preserved.\n\n323\n00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.140\nSo if it is requested, you have it.\n\n324\n00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.630\nThey're not gonna take as an excuse, it's\nlike well I had to look up how to do it.\n\n325\n00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.000\nAnd they're like,\nwell due diligence, hello.\n\n326\n00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.680\nShouldn't you know how to use\nthe stuff that you've put in place?\n\n327\n00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.260\nThat's definitely gonna be thrown\nright back in your face and\n\n328\n00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.650\nyou're gonna look stupid,\namongst other things.\n\n329\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:50.181\n>> Legally liable.\n\n330\n00:18:50.181 --> 00:18:51.410\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's what you're\n\n331\n00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:55.460\ngonna look like, you're gonna look\nlike a big target in the cross hair.\n\n332\n00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.990\nYou're gonna have a deer in\nthe headlight type of look.\n\n333\n00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.470\nSo, that's a litigation hold is,\nthat's what it's doing.\n\n334\n00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.060\nAs far as actually\ngetting one put in place.\n\n335\n00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:10.290\nGetting one put in place isn't as simple\nas me just walking up to you and saying,\n\n336\n00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:14.650\nwe've got a litigation hold and you\nneed to put that, preserve these things.\n\n337\n00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.670\nThere's a procedure that\nneeds to be followed for it.\n\n338\n00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:20.280\nWithin a company you can say we're\njust going to preserve stuff.\n\n339\n00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.980\nI mean and if you're planning ahead\nyou can make it so certain things are,\n\n340\n00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.410\ncertain emails and\nstuff like that are preserved.\n\n341\n00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:30.290\nI mean there's people that have systems in\nplace like that now, or companies rather,\n\n342\n00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:34.840\nthat have systems in place right now\nwhere if certain people send out emails,\n\n343\n00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.890\nyou gotta have copies of it or\nkept some place.\n\n344\n00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:41.970\nSo if there is an investigation, they've\ngot it, you know ready to rock and roll.\n\n345\n00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:44.910\nBut other people, you know like me,\n\n346\n00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.285\nif I'm at the bottom of the food chain,\nthey don't care.\n\n347\n00:19:47.285 --> 00:19:49.745\nThey're in, unless a certain\nkey word happens to pop up,\n\n348\n00:19:49.745 --> 00:19:54.445\nthen it might get actually sent\nover to be stored some place.\n\n349\n00:19:54.445 --> 00:19:57.785\n>> Teach Hilary Clinton a few of those\ntricks on how to preserve emails.\n\n350\n00:19:57.785 --> 00:20:01.060\n>> Oh, yeah, we went topical at ITPro,\nthat's right.\n\n351\n00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.570\nWe don't, we're not scared.\n\n352\n00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:04.725\nSo [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n353\n00:20:04.725 --> 00:20:05.480\n>> But yeah,\n\n354\n00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.720\nI actually saw something with it recently.\n\n355\n00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:12.810\nThey were saying,\nthey had Hillary Clinton's,\n\n356\n00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.845\nshe's finally turned over her\nemail server, they just the frame.\n\n357\n00:20:15.845 --> 00:20:17.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The box, it was hilarious.\n\n358\n00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.170\nI was like, that's pretty funny.\n\n359\n00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.790\nBut anyway, yeah, that's what\na litigation hold is going to be.\n\n360\n00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.460\nIt's going to say,\nyou need to preserve certain things.\n\n361\n00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.428\n>> When do we usually\nsee something like this?\n\n362\n00:20:29.428 --> 00:20:32.540\nIs this when there's an investigation\nthat is probably gonna happen?\n\n363\n00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.300\nAre they sure they're going to do an\ninvestigation, but they want to make sure?\n\n364\n00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:36.630\nThey're not ready to start yet and so\n\n365\n00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.130\nthey've gotta freeze\neverything the way it is?\n\n366\n00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:41.620\n>> It definitely could be that situation.\n\n367\n00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.400\nI know in the situation I was in,\nthat's what it was is that they\n\n368\n00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.470\nthought there might be\nan investigation coming down.\n\n369\n00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.428\nThat they might need to look at\ncertain things and so our legal\n\n370\n00:20:49.428 --> 00:20:53.510\ndepartment was just pro-active in saying\nhold on to these things just in case.\n\n371\n00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:57.710\nBut it also could be in a situation where\nthere are certain transactions going on,\n\n372\n00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:01.710\njust normal business, and\nthen the whoever the Justice Department or\n\n373\n00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.900\nwhatever comes and says, boom,\nyour on a hold right now.\n\n374\n00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.610\nAnd so they'll ask for\nall these things to be preserved, and\n\n375\n00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:11.510\nthat can happen with really\nany piece of information.\n\n376\n00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:17.760\nDoesn't have to be emails, could be really\nanything that they can choose to preserve.\n\n377\n00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.830\nIf you plan ahead you just look better,\nand\n\n378\n00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:24.260\nyou're able to, really,\nrespond a lot quicker.\n\n379\n00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:30.630\nI know places that do holds on\ncertain pieces of information and\n\n380\n00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.000\ncertain hardware even, just because.\n\n381\n00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.600\nThey're doing it just because if there\never is something called into question,\n\n382\n00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.890\nthey've got it.\n\n383\n00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:43.780\nOne place I can think of, in particular,\nit's not necessarily an example that's\n\n384\n00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.880\ncloud oriented but it shows you just the\npreparation that some people put into it.\n\n385\n00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:52.540\nI actually use this example in\nthe forensics course we did,\n\n386\n00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.760\nis I know a place that actually,\n\n387\n00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:01.350\nthe CEO of the place,\nplus the people in the C level.\n\n388\n00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:06.610\nThey actually, when any of those leave\nthe place, they take their laptop\n\n389\n00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:11.240\nimmediately and they image the drive and\nthey preserve that image.\n\n390\n00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.860\nAnd they take the notebook and all that,\nand the hard drive, and tag it, bag it,\n\n391\n00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:15.640\nand put it in the vault, and\n\n392\n00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.440\nonly three people in the whole\nplace have access to it.\n\n393\n00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:23.340\nAnd it's not because any of these\npeople did anything wrong necessarily,\n\n394\n00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.760\nit's because they just want to be\nprepared if anyone comes back and\n\n395\n00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.930\nasks later on that they have\nthat information on file.\n\n396\n00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:37.210\nWhat precipitated that is because they\ndid have a CEO at some point in the past,\n\n397\n00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:41.880\nit was several years in the past,\nthat had been\n\n398\n00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:46.010\nfound that he may have taken bribes or\nsomething like that, and\n\n399\n00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:48.940\nin which case they wanted to go back and\nlook at that information.\n\n400\n00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:53.250\nSo they had some of that\ninformation on file, but\n\n401\n00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.860\nthey said well let's be a little more\nprepared for in the future in case any of\n\n402\n00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:59.210\nthis happens to show they're being\ncompletely transparent and ready.\n\n403\n00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:03.250\nThey went ahead and started preserving\nanybody, that's across the board.\n\n404\n00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:05.610\nYou leave the company,\ngo to another place,\n\n405\n00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:09.920\nit's actually a state agency,\nif you leave to go to another agency,\n\n406\n00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.470\nyou leave that any way, shape, and form,\nyou could have kept your nose 100% clean,\n\n407\n00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.810\nyou know have been squeaky\nclean as you can get.\n\n408\n00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:20.780\nThey will grab that, take a hard\ndrive out, image it, tag it, bag it,\n\n409\n00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:21.440\ngoes into a vault.\n\n410\n00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:23.030\nThat's it, it's being preserved.\n\n411\n00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:24.890\nSo if it is asked, they've got it.\n\n412\n00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.300\nIt's kind of like a litigation hold.\n\n413\n00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.410\nThey haven't been asked to do it but\nit's been built into the procedure,\n\n414\n00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.260\nthe very fabric of the company.\n\n415\n00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:37.500\nNow, just because they've preserved it,\ndoesn't mean that, oh well heck,\n\n416\n00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.000\nyou've already preserved it, here let\nme grab that and take a look at it.\n\n417\n00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.191\nTo get access to that there is\na procedure that needs to be followed,\n\n418\n00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:46.618\nthere needs to be paperwork filed, and\n\n419\n00:23:46.618 --> 00:23:50.900\nall sorts of things done before that\ncan be pulled out and looked out.\n\n420\n00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.773\n>> Okay.\nAll right, well, Sean again,\n\n421\n00:23:52.773 --> 00:23:56.488\na lot of information we've got to deal\nwith when it comes to having our data out\n\n422\n00:23:56.488 --> 00:23:59.310\nthere in the cloud and\nthe investigations that can arise.\n\n423\n00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:02.150\nIt's a lot different from what\nwe're used to dealing with\n\n424\n00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.750\nwhen we kept it all on our\nserver ax here in house.\n\n425\n00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.100\nSo anything else we want\nto toss into this episode?\n\n426\n00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:12.860\n>> The thing I would just say,\nto give everyone a little reminder.\n\n427\n00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.720\nI mean, like I said, when we started\nthis whole thing out with the cloud,\n\n428\n00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.000\nwe said that we're going to\nbe repeating things over and\n\n429\n00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.700\nover again with a few of these things.\n\n430\n00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:24.660\nBut looking at it from different angles,\nyou'll see legal again.\n\n431\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.770\nWe're never gonna turn you into a lawyer\nat any point during this course,\n\n432\n00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:30.240\nit just ain't gonna happen.\n\n433\n00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.240\nBut the thing is, is that you do\nneed to be aware that there could be\n\n434\n00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.360\ncertain legal requirements\nthat do drive the cloud.\n\n435\n00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:40.760\nIf you have a situation, for example,\nin this last bit that you need do,\n\n436\n00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.880\nthat you may need to do a legal hold,\nthat means that you're gonna have to\n\n437\n00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.040\nplan your technology out in relation\nto the cloud to be able to do that.\n\n438\n00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.220\nIf it is a messaging system, and\n\n439\n00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.490\nyou are just outsourcing your\nmailboxes to a service provider,\n\n440\n00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:58.320\nwell can that service provider do\na litigation hold if you need to?\n\n441\n00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.390\nWhat's it gonna take for them to get that?\n\n442\n00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:03.900\nWhat procedures do they have to have\nbecause you've got one procedure if you\n\n443\n00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.000\nown that messaging system,\nbut you don't own it anymore.\n\n444\n00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.720\nYou've given it to someone\nelse as a third party.\n\n445\n00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.710\nYou need to familiarize yourself with\nhow you would do a litigation hold,\n\n446\n00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.760\nhow you would preserve\nevidence in that situation?\n\n447\n00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.060\nThat's where that builds towards.\n\n448\n00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.260\nSo you need to be prepared.\n\n449\n00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.666\nSo make sure,\nwith any of this legal stuff,\n\n450\n00:25:20.666 --> 00:25:24.270\nto know what the issues are,\nand be prepared.\n\n451\n00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.494\nAnd make sure you go through all\nthe stuff and ask those questions of your\n\n452\n00:25:27.494 --> 00:25:30.890\nprovider to make sure they can\nhelp you out if it does happen.\n\n453\n00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:31.510\nYou're good.\n\n454\n00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:32.443\n>> All right.\nWell ladies and\n\n455\n00:25:32.443 --> 00:25:35.210\ngentlemen that's gonna do it for\nthis one, hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n456\n00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:37.530\nSigning off for ITProTV I'm Mike

00:00:16.279\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.840\nAnd Sean, in this episode, we're gonna be\ntalking about compliance and audits and\n\n5\n00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.681\nhow that relates to moving\nall our data to the cloud.\n\n6\n00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:28.030\nSo we're familiar at this point\nwith managing servers in house and\n\n7\n00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.691\nhow we have to have auditing and\nbe in compliance with regulations, but\n\n8\n00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:35.971\nthat game changes when we\nmove it out to the cloud.\n\n9\n00:00:35.971 --> 00:00:36.999\n>> Yeah, most definitely.\n\n10\n00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.163\nThere's gonna be a big change\nwhen you go out to the cloud or\n\n11\n00:00:40.163 --> 00:00:42.371\nit could be potentially be a big change.\n\n12\n00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:46.095\nFirst of all, when we look at auditing,\nwe look at it in the traditional sense.\n\n13\n00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:52.146\nAnd compliance is part of that,\nit's a big part of a lot of industries.\n\n14\n00:00:52.146 --> 00:00:57.115\nCompliance, first of all, it means you've\ngot some sort of regulations or rules or\n\n15\n00:00:57.115 --> 00:01:01.105\nsomething like that put in place\nthat dictates how you do business or\n\n16\n00:01:01.105 --> 00:01:04.539\nhow you process information or\nwhatever it happens to be.\n\n17\n00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:09.668\nI mean, the cloud isn't restricted\nto being part of just the IT world.\n\n18\n00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:13.502\nIt could be something that's part\nof a solution for manufacturing and\n\n19\n00:01:13.502 --> 00:01:14.808\nother stuff, as well.\n\n20\n00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:17.661\nSo you could have a lot of\nthings happening around\n\n21\n00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:21.568\nthis cloud based solution or\naround your infrastructure period.\n\n22\n00:01:21.568 --> 00:01:25.028\nSo based on what the rules are in\nplace across the board for\n\n23\n00:01:25.028 --> 00:01:30.439\nyour particular business or the industries\nyou're working in or the other businesses,\n\n24\n00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.283\ncuz we could very well be\nintegrating with other business too.\n\n25\n00:01:34.283 --> 00:01:38.957\nThere could be a whole list of things\nthat you need to make sure that\n\n26\n00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:41.092\nyou're within the rules on.\n\n27\n00:01:41.092 --> 00:01:44.590\nLest you get in big, big,\nbig trouble and get fined and\n\n28\n00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.200\nmaybe a whole bunch of other stuff\ncould happen as a result of that.\n\n29\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.370\nSo compliance is a big deal.\n\n30\n00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.683\nNow what goes with a compliance is we\nneed to make sure that as the people\n\n31\n00:01:57.683 --> 00:02:03.176\nthat are putting faith in you, we need\nto be able to at any point come in and\n\n32\n00:02:03.176 --> 00:02:09.064\naudit what you're doing and that's\nbring another part to this whole thing.\n\n33\n00:02:09.064 --> 00:02:13.501\nIt's one thing to say, you've built\nstuff to comply with certain rules, but\n\n34\n00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:16.795\nthere has to be a mechanism in\nplace also to monitor that and\n\n35\n00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:19.755\nto verify that you're\nactually within the rules and\n\n36\n00:02:19.755 --> 00:02:23.748\nthat can actually be a pretty tricky\npart of things when you look at it.\n\n37\n00:02:23.748 --> 00:02:27.141\n>> Always saying, these organizations\nmight not be truthful in it.\n\n38\n00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:28.003\n>> Oh, I'm not saying that at all.\n\n39\n00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:28.743\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:02:28.743 --> 00:02:29.956\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it's true.\n\n41\n00:02:29.956 --> 00:02:31.622\nI mean,\nwe can say we're compliant all we want.\n\n42\n00:02:31.622 --> 00:02:33.687\nBut if we can't verify\nthat we're compliant,\n\n43\n00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:37.052\ndoesn't really do any good to those\nregulatory boards and things like that.\n\n44\n00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:43.334\n>> Yeah, it definitely doesn't and\nthat can get you in a lot of hot water.\n\n45\n00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:46.635\nIf it's not easily accessible,\nif they could not, I mean,\n\n46\n00:02:46.635 --> 00:02:51.064\nheck if it's not easily accessible for\nthem to check to see if you are compliant.\n\n47\n00:02:51.064 --> 00:02:52.214\nYou could end up in hot water,\n\n48\n00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:54.377\nbecause they could say well\nwhy didn't you plan ahead.\n\n49\n00:02:54.377 --> 00:02:59.372\nThis should be more easier to do how would\nyou work this, how do we know you're not\n\n50\n00:02:59.372 --> 00:03:03.645\naltering stuff that could be a whole\ncan of worms being opened there.\n\n51\n00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:07.595\nSo you wanna make this, so\nyou're not only compliant, but\n\n52\n00:03:07.595 --> 00:03:10.524\nit can also be easily\nchecked down the road.\n\n53\n00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:14.627\nAnd if any of those things\nare off just a little bit,\n\n54\n00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:17.882\nit could make your life more difficult.\n\n55\n00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:21.877\nYou wanna make your life easier, but\nit could make your life more difficult or\n\n56\n00:03:21.877 --> 00:03:22.987\neven quite painful.\n\n57\n00:03:22.987 --> 00:03:24.543\nAnd when you get down to it,\n\n58\n00:03:24.543 --> 00:03:28.893\nthere could be internal audits could\nbe external audits or it could be both.\n\n59\n00:03:28.893 --> 00:03:34.111\nAnd we're just talking at the get-go about\nactually checking to see what you have.\n\n60\n00:03:34.111 --> 00:03:36.157\nWe're not talking about the pen tests and\nstuff like that,.\n\n61\n00:03:36.157 --> 00:03:39.937\nWe're just talking about\nchecking how you process stuff,\n\n62\n00:03:39.937 --> 00:03:43.264\nchecking paperwork,\nchecking legal guidelines,\n\n63\n00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:47.132\nchecking to make sure stuff is\ndoing what it's supposed to.\n\n64\n00:03:47.132 --> 00:03:51.272\nAnd you have to plan ahead to be prepared\nto make this stuff as easy as not only\n\n65\n00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:54.250\ncompliant, but\nas easy as possible to get access to.\n\n66\n00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.534\n>> Yeah, I would think that not only\ndo I need to be able to prove it\n\n67\n00:03:57.534 --> 00:04:01.448\nto the regulatory commission or\nwhoever is in charge of that, but even for\n\n68\n00:04:01.448 --> 00:04:02.346\nmy own benefit.\n\n69\n00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:04.708\nIf I'm part of this company or\nthis is my job,\n\n70\n00:04:04.708 --> 00:04:07.206\nI need to make sure we're\nstill in compliance.\n\n71\n00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:11.352\nSo I need to be able to verify that\ninformation, as systems change,\n\n72\n00:04:11.352 --> 00:04:13.625\nas we add things, as we move things.\n\n73\n00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:16.931\nI need to know if we've changed our\ncompliance, so that I can fix it.\n\n74\n00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:21.379\nIt's not just being able to prove it\nto whomever needs to have that proof,\n\n75\n00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:23.185\nwe need to know it ourselves.\n\n76\n00:04:23.185 --> 00:04:24.424\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n77\n00:04:24.424 --> 00:04:26.124\nIn fact, we've got a name for that.\n\n78\n00:04:26.124 --> 00:04:28.554\nWe've got a term for that,\nit's called due diligence.\n\n79\n00:04:28.554 --> 00:04:30.418\nThat's exactly what that is,\n\n80\n00:04:30.418 --> 00:04:35.228\nis what Mike's talking about here is you\ndo need to be able to continue to check.\n\n81\n00:04:35.228 --> 00:04:38.190\nYou shouldn't be waiting just for an\naudit, that's not what you wanna find out.\n\n82\n00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.685\nYou wanna know when they come in for\nan audit.\n\n83\n00:04:39.685 --> 00:04:42.837\nYou wanna know what the answer's gonna\nbe with some degree of certainty.\n\n84\n00:04:42.837 --> 00:04:45.426\nIn fact, if you can get an absolute\ncertainty, that's great.\n\n85\n00:04:45.426 --> 00:04:47.487\nBut you wanna know when\nthe auditors come in.\n\n86\n00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:51.735\nThat they're gonna say, okay,\nyeah, you are compliant or\n\n87\n00:04:51.735 --> 00:04:56.734\nyou are at least within the rules\nenough that they are going to say we're\n\n88\n00:04:56.734 --> 00:05:01.256\ngood our works done here and\nthey'll move on to something else.\n\n89\n00:05:01.256 --> 00:05:06.205\nSo there's a lot that goes into\nactually facilitating that.\n\n90\n00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:09.895\nKeep in mind that when you\ndo these when audits occur,\n\n91\n00:05:09.895 --> 00:05:13.757\nthey can occur at all different\ntypes of intervals too.\n\n92\n00:05:13.757 --> 00:05:19.842\nSo you wanna be able to respond to these\nrequests pretty rapidly and efficiently,\n\n93\n00:05:19.842 --> 00:05:26.034\nso you don't get mired down in multiple\nrequests and then that doesn't look good.\n\n94\n00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:31.720\nI know I had a colleague that\nIt does work in healthcare.\n\n95\n00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.512\nIn my area, there's actually\na lot of health care companies.\n\n96\n00:05:33.512 --> 00:05:38.260\nSo I reference it a lot, but\nthe one that my colleague works for\n\n97\n00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.918\nthey had a situation where they\nhad an external audit done for\n\n98\n00:05:42.918 --> 00:05:47.393\nHIPAA compliance and\nthen they had two done in pretty rapid\n\n99\n00:05:47.393 --> 00:05:51.169\nsuccession on the exact\nsame stuff internally.\n\n100\n00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.620\nAnd they basically, it would look like\na situation where they just kind of rolled\n\n101\n00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.743\nthe dice and said, looks like it's time\nto do one, they did an internal and\n\n102\n00:05:59.743 --> 00:06:01.781\nthen they roll the dice again doing.\n\n103\n00:06:01.781 --> 00:06:05.202\nYeah, we just did one, three months ago,\nwe're doing another one now.\n\n104\n00:06:05.202 --> 00:06:10.803\nThey were doing these spot checks to make\nsure that stuff was staying in compliance.\n\n105\n00:06:10.803 --> 00:06:15.726\nAnd so that was just the internal side\nof things and you can bet that A company\n\n106\n00:06:15.726 --> 00:06:20.748\nthat this particular company's quite huge,\nit's actually nationwide.\n\n107\n00:06:20.748 --> 00:06:21.462\nThat situation,\n\n108\n00:06:21.462 --> 00:06:24.895\nthey've got a lot of stuff that they need\nto provide to make sure they're complying.\n\n109\n00:06:24.895 --> 00:06:26.613\nEven for a single region,\n\n110\n00:06:26.613 --> 00:06:31.541\nthey need to be able to make sure that\nthey provide a lot information for it.\n\n111\n00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:34.950\nSo saying that you're gonna do an audit\nat one point and then pretty much later\n\n112\n00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.738\nyou're doing another one, you better get\nthat one done before that one comes along.\n\n113\n00:06:38.738 --> 00:06:41.068\nThey're not going to want you saying,\nhey, we're still responding to it.\n\n114\n00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:42.435\nCan you postpone this event?\n\n115\n00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:43.549\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Ain't gonna fly.\n\n116\n00:06:43.549 --> 00:06:45.272\n>> Surprise audits are always fun.\n\n117\n00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:47.740\n[LAUGH] Your unprepared and\nyou get some people like,\n\n118\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.488\noh, we just had an audit last month.\n\n119\n00:06:49.488 --> 00:06:52.579\nThere's no way we're gonna\nget another audit this month.\n\n120\n00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.249\nSo we'll just put that off.\n\n121\n00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:55.420\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n122\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.942\n[LAUGH]\n>> Then you talk about the right to audit.\n\n123\n00:06:59.942 --> 00:07:04.636\nNow you're talking about who\nhas the right to audit or?\n\n124\n00:07:04.636 --> 00:07:09.652\n>> When you talk about right to audit,\nit could be something where,\n\n125\n00:07:09.652 --> 00:07:14.398\nit's typically a situation where\nthe client or whoever's in\n\n126\n00:07:14.398 --> 00:07:19.651\ncharge of insuring compliance externally,\n>> They can have it written in or\n\n127\n00:07:19.651 --> 00:07:22.081\nthey can have a legal right to come in and\n\n128\n00:07:22.081 --> 00:07:25.469\ncheck at any point in time to\ncheck that information and\n\n129\n00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:29.762\ncheck how you're doing things to\nmake sure it's on the up and above.\n\n130\n00:07:29.762 --> 00:07:33.207\nSo what's gonna happen is that\nthey can make a request saying,\n\n131\n00:07:33.207 --> 00:07:35.094\nwe wanna to come in and do an audit.\n\n132\n00:07:35.094 --> 00:07:39.405\nNow on your side of things, which is more\nlikely where you're gonna come in on this,\n\n133\n00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:43.735\nyou're not gonna be on the cloud provider\nside, you're gonna be on the other side.\n\n134\n00:07:43.735 --> 00:07:47.945\nWhat's gonna happen is that\nyou go to a cloud provider,\n\n135\n00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:50.281\nyou host your stuff with them.\n\n136\n00:07:50.281 --> 00:07:52.551\nYou may have it written\ninto your contract.\n\n137\n00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:57.190\nAnd in a lot of cases you can have a\ncertain number of audits you're allowed to\n\n138\n00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.390\ndo per year.\n\n139\n00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:02.570\nYou can request that I need to audit how\nyou're doing something from the back end.\n\n140\n00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.330\nHow often are you doing backups for\nus, are these backups being done?\n\n141\n00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.940\nThat could be a great example.\n\n142\n00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.970\nIt's like, I know you're supposed to\nbe doing backups on a regular interval.\n\n143\n00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.500\nOkay, well I want you to\ndo a restoration on this\n\n144\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.550\nto make sure that it's actually\nbeing done and it's gonna work.\n\n145\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:21.450\nDefinitely wanna find out ahead\nof time on things like that.\n\n146\n00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:23.990\n>> So here you're not really\ntalking about auditing our company,\n\n147\n00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.040\nyou're talking about auditing the cloud\nprovider that's hosting our information,\n\n148\n00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.290\n>> Yeah, in this particular case,\n\n149\n00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.240\nit's more than likely gonna be us going\nto the provider, us going on behalf\n\n150\n00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.930\nof our client to check the provider and\nthe services they provide.\n\n151\n00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:38.750\nBut, you know,\nwe could be subject to it too.\n\n152\n00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:44.330\nIf we have, if we are working ourselves\nwith an external client, you know, there\n\n153\n00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:48.370\nare companies I keep keep using health\ncare, so I'll just stick with that theme.\n\n154\n00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:54.420\nLet's say that we have a health care\nagency that's doing the billing and\n\n155\n00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.730\nprocessing of insurance information for\nother large corporations.\n\n156\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.800\nThat happens quite a bit.\n\n157\n00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.080\nYou have health providers that work with,\nyou know,\n\n158\n00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.850\nwell I had mentioned places like\nAmerican Airlines, earlier, like that.\n\n159\n00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.650\nThose companies may outsource the\ninsurance, and in a lot of cases they do.\n\n160\n00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.340\nThey'll say, okay, you can go to this.\n\n161\n00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.330\nWe have a contract with them.\n\n162\n00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.020\nAnd they do this.\n\n163\n00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:20.150\nSo those companies may in turn\nhave a right to come in and\n\n164\n00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.060\naudit what you're doing.\n\n165\n00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.660\nSo if you're a provider and\nsaying I'm a providing a service,\n\n166\n00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.130\nI'm providing heath insurance for your\ncompany, and the billing and all that.\n\n167\n00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.396\nThey may in turn, as part of their\ncontract, may have a right to come in and\n\n168\n00:09:31.396 --> 00:09:34.245\naudit you to make sure that their\ninformation is being processed\n\n169\n00:09:34.245 --> 00:09:35.220\nthe right way.\n\n170\n00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.970\nSo what side of it you come in on,\n\n171\n00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:44.150\ncould really depend on\nwhat the situation is.\n\n172\n00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.430\nThe basic concept is still there is that\nthere could be a thing where they have\n\n173\n00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.070\na legal right to come in and\ncheck to see what's going on.\n\n174\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:55.320\nAnd they may have a certain amount\nof times you're allowed to do it.\n\n175\n00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.340\nI know I have contracts it's not cloud\nstuff but to give you kinda of an idea,\n\n176\n00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.630\nI have contracts for\nstuff like for my books, for\n\n177\n00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:09.580\nexample, that I'm allowed to audit\nsome of the documentation for\n\n178\n00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.050\nit to see how many copies and\nall are being moved.\n\n179\n00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:16.580\nI can look at that but I'm only allowed to\ndo it a certain amount of times a year.\n\n180\n00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.850\nAfter that, it's gonna come out\nof my pocket to do those audits.\n\n181\n00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.680\nSo I'm guaranteed you\nknow a couple per year.\n\n182\n00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.690\nAfter that it's like,\n\n183\n00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:25.050\nyou want to do it, okay fine\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n184\n00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.590\n>> You pay someone to look at\n\n185\n00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.820\nthe paperwork because we're\nnot doing it for you anymore.\n\n186\n00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.140\n>> Okay very good.\n\n187\n00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:36.410\nAnd then we talk about compliance and\nhow that impacts our cloud contracts.\n\n188\n00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:41.200\n>> Yeah, how compliance can\nimpact your cloud contract is it\n\n189\n00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:46.430\ngoes back to a lot of\nstuff that we talked about\n\n190\n00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.960\non earlier episodes is that when\nyou're getting a contract with\n\n191\n00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.210\nyour cloud provider If you have\nthings like a right to audit.\n\n192\n00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:58.060\nIf you have a requirement to do\nthat on behalf of, let's say.\n\n193\n00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.700\nGoing back to my previous example,\nI'm that health insurance provider and\n\n194\n00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:08.080\nI'm contracting with a bunch of large\ncompanies to provide the services to them,\n\n195\n00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.620\nwell if I have a contract with them saying\nyou have a right to audit this information\n\n196\n00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.370\nwhenever you want,\n\n197\n00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:16.880\nI need to make sure that they have\nthe ability to do that on demand.\n\n198\n00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.850\nAnd they have the mechanism in place\nto provide that in an efficient and\n\n199\n00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:21.090\ntimely manner.\n\n200\n00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:25.190\nIf they don't, we need to figure out how\nwe're gonna get that on their side and\n\n201\n00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.280\non my side.\n\n202\n00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:30.180\nThat's gonna be a big big big issue.\n\n203\n00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.735\nThat could be a core\nrequirement that dictates\n\n204\n00:11:34.735 --> 00:11:36.630\nhow the contract's gonna be fulfilled.\n\n205\n00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.850\nSo you'll need to make sure when you're\nsigning this contract if you have any sort\n\n206\n00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.800\nof compliance issues, any sort of\nrequirements that your clients are putting\n\n207\n00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.200\non you, that you have on you, that you\nget that written into the contract.\n\n208\n00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.990\nThat could be part of a SLA even.\n\n209\n00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.460\nSaying that you have a right to,\n\n210\n00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:58.190\nthere's a certain agreement between you\ntwo that you do have certain things\n\n211\n00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:02.640\nthat need to be done and need to be\nhandled a certain way, and that's that.\n\n212\n00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.650\n>> And then we've got to deal with\nthe scope of the audit, right?\n\n213\n00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:11.450\nWe might have to limit where they're\nactually allowed to do these audits.\n\n214\n00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.220\n>> That can be a tricky one.\n\n215\n00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:20.820\nEspecially if you happen to be\nsomebody that is doing something\n\n216\n00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:25.510\nlike I just said where processing\ninformation for multiple clients.\n\n217\n00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:30.140\nIf you're doing that,\nyou're going to need to put limits\n\n218\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.040\non what they can audit,\nhow they can audit it, how often.\n\n219\n00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.640\nCould be something that fits in there,\nit's actually putting limitations on it.\n\n220\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:43.280\nSo they know what's reasonable\nto request and what they can and\n\n221\n00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.050\ncan't request, and\nlead time, stuff like that.\n\n222\n00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.510\nIt's just reasonable to do that.\n\n223\n00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:51.360\nYou don't want them to come to you,\nmaybe you do, I don't know.\n\n224\n00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.500\nYou don't want them to come to you and\n\n225\n00:12:53.500 --> 00:13:00.100\nsay I wanna see everything that\nwe've done for the past five years.\n\n226\n00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:01.880\nThat's a big request.\n\n227\n00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:04.570\nEvery transaction, everything we've done.\n\n228\n00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:09.150\nIf you are that company that's providing\nhealth services to a large company,\n\n229\n00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.380\nlike I said, let's say it's\nsomebody like an American Airlines,\n\n230\n00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.720\na huge company, you're talking something\nlike that and say, I wanna see every\n\n231\n00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.905\nhealth related transaction that we've\ngone through you for the past five years.\n\n232\n00:13:21.905 --> 00:13:22.780\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n233\n00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:24.120\n>> I don't even want to think about it.\n\n234\n00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.020\nEven if a fraction of\nthe people that worked for\n\n235\n00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:31.150\nthat company went to the doctor\na couple times a year.\n\n236\n00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.330\nThat's a huge number of\nrequests that you're servicing.\n\n237\n00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.390\nAnd you know that's not\neven just doctor visits.\n\n238\n00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.320\nThat's billing.\n\n239\n00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:41.050\nThat's all the payments that\ncome out of everyone's paycheck.\n\n240\n00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.730\nThat's a lot of stuff.\n\n241\n00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:46.180\nSo you may want to put\nlimitations on that.\n\n242\n00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:51.700\nNow I would also add in that\nthe client does have a right,\n\n243\n00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.530\nwhen they go to you, to kind of put their\nown ideas of what scope are on there.\n\n244\n00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.320\nAnd you're going to have\nnegotiate with that.\n\n245\n00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.310\nThen decide if that's for you, because\nsome of those things can be very, very,\n\n246\n00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.320\nvery tall orders.\n\n247\n00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.370\nI know for example contracts that,\n\n248\n00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:11.560\nwhen I worked in the defense industry\nyears ago, when the military came in,\n\n249\n00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.480\nin this case it was the Air Force,\nthe Air Force could come in and.\n\n250\n00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.450\nThe company I was working for\nwas actually doing the B2 project,\n\n251\n00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:20.480\nthe B2 Spirit at that point in time.\n\n252\n00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.530\nAnd, when they were doing that.\n\n253\n00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:28.970\nThe Air Force had the right to come in at\nany point in time and say we want such and\n\n254\n00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:32.710\nsuch from seven years ago at this time,\nand you had to be able to get it.\n\n255\n00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:34.862\nThat was written into their contract.\n\n256\n00:14:34.862 --> 00:14:38.940\nThey were Request any piece of information\nwithin the scope of their contract.\n\n257\n00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.110\nThey request anything\nwithin that time frame and\n\n258\n00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:45.510\nthey can say now it's within that\ntime frame you had to be able to\n\n259\n00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.840\nget it back to them within\na certain period of time.\n\n260\n00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.030\nSo they've got a lot of things\nthat are gotchas there.\n\n261\n00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:57.460\nSo if they put that into the contract,\nwhich they did, it meant that you had to,\n\n262\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.900\nif you're talking back to that point\nin time, you're talking something where\n\n263\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:07.860\nyou've got to really plan ahead of time\non how you're gonna fulfill that request.\n\n264\n00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.430\nThey put it in a contract,\n\n265\n00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.750\nit's gonna mean that you really need\nto think of a good backup system.\n\n266\n00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:17.750\nAnd not just a good backup system,\nbut how you can, in a timely manner,\n\n267\n00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.730\nretrieve that.\n\n268\n00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.230\nAnd they were talking at that point and\ntime,\n\n269\n00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.400\na industry that was working\nmainly on you know tapes.\n\n270\n00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.440\nThis was the early 90s,\n\n271\n00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.752\nyou're talking about someone who working\non tapes, that's a [LAUGH] you can do it.\n\n272\n00:15:28.752 --> 00:15:33.370\nThey put a requirement I think it\nwas at the time around ten minutes\n\n273\n00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.240\nis what they put on there.\n\n274\n00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.470\nThey said they wanted anything they\nasked for in the last seven years.\n\n275\n00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.570\nIf they gave you the exact criteria for\nit.\n\n276\n00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.550\nIt had to be less than ten minutes.\n\n277\n00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.810\nIt could be done.\n\n278\n00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.794\nThe guys I knew that were there were\nproud that they could do it in about\n\n279\n00:15:47.794 --> 00:15:48.472\nsix and a half.\n\n280\n00:15:48.472 --> 00:15:50.201\nThey go, we could do it in six and a half.\n\n281\n00:15:50.201 --> 00:15:53.575\nI'm like, well it's good you got those\nthree and a half minutes buffer there.\n\n282\n00:15:53.575 --> 00:15:58.485\n>> [LAUGH] But it was written\nspecifically in the contract\n\n283\n00:15:58.485 --> 00:16:03.623\nwhen it was created and\nthe whole partnership was done.\n\n284\n00:16:03.623 --> 00:16:06.529\nSo you know if that was\nwritten to your contract now,\n\n285\n00:16:06.529 --> 00:16:10.954\nthat's gonna tell you when you build\nyour Cloud solution and you're going to,\n\n286\n00:16:10.954 --> 00:16:13.900\nyou know, whoever your Cloud provider is.\n\n287\n00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.410\nWell you can talk to them, and\nsay this is what I need to do.\n\n288\n00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.600\nHow can we fulfill this?\n\n289\n00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.110\nYou can build your solution, their\nsolution together with that scope and\n\n290\n00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:27.070\nall that in mind, and meet your\ncontract requirements with your client.\n\n291\n00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:31.440\nYeah, it can be tricky, but it can be\ndone with a little bit of planning, or\n\n292\n00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.790\na lot of planning, as the case may be.\n\n293\n00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.270\nYou can make things happen.\n\n294\n00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.890\nIt was kind of interesting to see it.\n\n295\n00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:38.410\n>> Absolutely.\n\n296\n00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.780\n>> You know,\nat the time with that particular project,\n\n297\n00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.960\nthese guys were telling me, oh yeah,\nwe can do it in six and a half minutes.\n\n298\n00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.680\nWow, you're thinking putting,\npopping tapes and things, and\n\n299\n00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.130\na lot of you been down that road where\nyou popped a tape and, yeah, sure,\n\n300\n00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:53.610\nyeah, no way, it ain't happening here.\n\n301\n00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.260\nHow much?\nLet me get my checkbook out.\n\n302\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.710\nHow much you need?\n\n303\n00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.280\nThat's what you're expecting.\n\n304\n00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.690\nNo, it can be done.\n\n305\n00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.080\nIt just meant that head of\ntime they had to plan for it.\n\n306\n00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.840\nIt couldn't just wait till someone\nrequested it, and said oops, sorry,\n\n307\n00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:07.020\nwe got you next time.\n\n308\n00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:07.700\nCouldn't do that.\n\n309\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:08.550\n>> Not gonna fly.\n\n310\n00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:09.260\n>> Yeah.\n>> And then we've\n\n311\n00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:12.260\ngot our compliance scope as well, because\nsometimes we have to deal with these,\n\n312\n00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:14.400\nwe have to be in compliance\nwith these regulations.\n\n313\n00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.352\nBut maybe not everything we're\ndoing falls under that regulation?\n\n314\n00:17:18.352 --> 00:17:22.750\n>> Yeah, and in fact that's exactly right,\nin fact you could even say that\n\n315\n00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:27.460\nit's not gonna apply\nthe same way to everything.\n\n316\n00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.970\nYou look at something,\nYou like our beloved HIPAA.\n\n317\n00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:34.600\nHIPAA doesn't apply\nthe same way to everything.\n\n318\n00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.940\nThere's all sorts of variations\nin it that can dictate\n\n319\n00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.900\njust how far reaching it's gonna\nbe within your organization.\n\n320\n00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:43.390\nIt's really, really tricky.\n\n321\n00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:44.710\nIn fact, if you look at HIPAA,\n\n322\n00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.280\nthere's some things in there that\nthe average Joe may not even be aware of.\n\n323\n00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.010\nI mean one of the things\nthat you look at is,\n\n324\n00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:55.200\nyou know HIPPA with health care,\nI'm just kind of point out stuff.\n\n325\n00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.447\nThis doesn't necessarily apply\ndirectly with what we're doing, but\n\n326\n00:17:58.447 --> 00:18:01.180\nto show you kind of little\nthings that are hidden in there.\n\n327\n00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.310\nYou tend to think that, hey if we're\ntalking health care, well HIPAA.\n\n328\n00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.560\nAny type of information you have,\nHIPAA's gonna come into play, right?\n\n329\n00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:11.790\nThat's what we've been taught over\nthe last, you know several years.\n\n330\n00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.770\nIf someone's got your patient\ninformation in any way shape or\n\n331\n00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:18.930\nform, there's HIPAA guidelines that\nare gonna dictate how they can process and\n\n332\n00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.650\nhandle it and dispose of it and\nall those types of things.\n\n333\n00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:27.500\nWell Within the last time I checked and\nmaybe someone knows different on this,\n\n334\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:32.360\nbut I know there was a point of time where\nif your practice had ten patients or less,\n\n335\n00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.830\nHIPAA didn't apply to you.\n\n336\n00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.760\nIt was strictly for\npeople bigger than that.\n\n337\n00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.080\nThey may have adjusted that,\nthey may have closed that and\n\n338\n00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.960\nsaid okay there's something\nelse we're gonna do.\n\n339\n00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.950\nBut they figured,\nonce you were at that size or below, you\n\n340\n00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:53.030\nwere at a point where there was something\nelse that was gonna apply to you instead.\n\n341\n00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.690\nAnd so, and then HIPAA would be\ntoo burdensome for you to do.\n\n342\n00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:02.600\nSo you gotta figure someone got involved\nin the process saying hey, wait a minute,\n\n343\n00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.420\ndo you know how much that's gonna take?\n\n344\n00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:08.140\nSo most people wouldn't be aware of that,\nthat there are certain size restrictions.\n\n345\n00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.650\nYou just think across the board.\n\n346\n00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.540\nIf it has anything to do with\nsomeone's health in any way,\n\n347\n00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.670\nshape, or form, HIPAA comes into play.\n\n348\n00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:19.230\nWell no it doesn't, and so\nthat would definitely change it.\n\n349\n00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.320\nYou know so\n\n350\n00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.700\nthere are little things like that you've\ngot to be aware of that change compliance.\n\n351\n00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.150\nI know somebody,\n\n352\n00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:30.960\nyou know again speaking of healthcare that\nwas doing billing for doctors offices.\n\n353\n00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.650\nThat's all they did and\ntheir big concern was is that,\n\n354\n00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.170\nwhen they went over to something, I think\nin their case it was actually SharePoint,\n\n355\n00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.640\nthey were building a SharePoint solution\nwanted to take on more of that.\n\n356\n00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.560\nMore clients like that.\n\n357\n00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.000\nBut HIPAA was really starting to come in,\nenforce at that point and time and\n\n358\n00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.990\nthey were trying to figure\nout how it applied to them.\n\n359\n00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:58.659\nAnd you got to know that in the scope\nof things, in the big scheme of things,\n\n360\n00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:03.900\nthey're not the actual provider\nof health care services.\n\n361\n00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.900\nBut they are the ones that\nare storing billing information.\n\n362\n00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.770\nSo there still is stuff there so\n\n363\n00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:15.310\nthey were trying to figure out ,and the\nwhole scope and overall deal with HIPAA.\n\n364\n00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:20.150\nWhat portions of that actually apply to\nthem as being just the entity that build\n\n365\n00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:21.640\nand processed that.\n\n366\n00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.210\nThey didn't have access to\nthe medical records directly,\n\n367\n00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:28.030\nbut they were gonna be billing for\nthings like test results and visits and\n\n368\n00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:30.245\nstuff like that, so\nthey had some stuff on there.\n\n369\n00:20:30.245 --> 00:20:34.660\nAnd had things that were\ngonna be identifiable that\n\n370\n00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.230\nwould be controlled by that.\n\n371\n00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.640\n>> And then you're gonna hear we're\ntalking requirements like with\n\n372\n00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.819\ncompliance analysis.\n\n373\n00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.710\nWhere do we go with that?\n\n374\n00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:51.710\n>> That would mainly pertain to when\nthe information's being requested.\n\n375\n00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:56.290\nWhat format it has to be in and\nhow it's gonna be consumed.\n\n376\n00:20:56.290 --> 00:21:00.500\nThat could be something that you need\nto negotiate with your actual client.\n\n377\n00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.685\nThey may have specific format requests.\n\n378\n00:21:02.685 --> 00:21:05.600\nAnd ways they want to get that in so\nthey can look through it.\n\n379\n00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:12.660\nThey may even require certain reports,\nto be given to them in a certain way.\n\n380\n00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.600\nAgain, I think of stuff like,\nto use it again, stuff like health care,\n\n381\n00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.960\nthey may require that, hey you know\nthere's a report being generated.\n\n382\n00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.660\nYou may require,\n\n383\n00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.810\nhey you have a stack of paper like\nthis that's like here's the report.\n\n384\n00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:26.560\nBut there may be required to\nbe an executive summary and\n\n385\n00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.170\nstuff like on top,\nsaying what had happened overall on that.\n\n386\n00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:31.860\nThat's what they expect.\n\n387\n00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.320\nNow, keep in mind,\nthat this compliance information,\n\n388\n00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.230\nsomething that should be thrown in here\nis, when you're doing these checks,\n\n389\n00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.590\nthese checks may be just required for\nyou to do period.\n\n390\n00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:44.340\nThey may not ever request them.\n\n391\n00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.870\nThere's a possibility for that.\n\n392\n00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:52.950\nThe requirement may be that you do it, but\nand you provide it in a certain format,\n\n393\n00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:56.510\nbut they have the right to decide\nwhen they want to get that.\n\n394\n00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.720\nThere's plenty of industries where or\n\n395\n00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.430\nplenty of situations I've seen,\nisa better way to put it.\n\n396\n00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:08.780\nWhere the information is available,\nit's ready at any time for you to look at.\n\n397\n00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:11.870\nHowever, you just have to request it.\n\n398\n00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.430\nYou could go a couple years and\nsay, oh, well,\n\n399\n00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.480\ncan you give me from the time period\nfrom here to here, or from here to here?\n\n400\n00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.160\nYou could go ten years without requesting.\n\n401\n00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.900\nI wouldn't recommend you do that,\nbut it could conceivably go for\n\n402\n00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:26.860\nperiods like that where,\nthey don't request any information.\n\n403\n00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:30.670\nThey just wanna know that it's there\nin the event that they do need it.\n\n404\n00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.590\n>> And then auditors as well.\n\n405\n00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:37.260\nWe got certain requirements they\nhave to deal with with the auditors.\n\n406\n00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:39.050\n>> Yeah,\nthey may actually place additional,\n\n407\n00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.770\nthe entity that's doing the auditing,\n>> May put additional requirements on you\n\n408\n00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.990\nas well, and\nthose are kinda tough to quantify.\n\n409\n00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:52.180\nBut they usually spell them out ahead of\ntime on what they actually will need.\n\n410\n00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:58.850\nI know the case with my friend who worked\nwithin that health insurance company.\n\n411\n00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:03.635\nThe auditors would tell them ahead of\ntime, we're coming in, in a week or two.\n\n412\n00:23:03.635 --> 00:23:06.004\nThey've given them the time\nthat the audit was gonna start.\n\n413\n00:23:06.004 --> 00:23:09.064\nAnd that gave them time to start\nproviding the information,\n\n414\n00:23:09.064 --> 00:23:12.825\nbecause they would tell them this\nis what we're gonna be looking at.\n\n415\n00:23:12.825 --> 00:23:13.805\nThis is what we want.\n\n416\n00:23:13.805 --> 00:23:16.665\nSo we give them time to collect\nthe files and things like that,\n\n417\n00:23:16.665 --> 00:23:17.695\nthat they want to look at.\n\n418\n00:23:17.695 --> 00:23:20.645\nSo when they came in,\nit was prepped and ready.\n\n419\n00:23:20.645 --> 00:23:24.900\nSo there could be a range of things\nthat the auditors actually request.\n\n420\n00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.172\nit's just a matter of just being\nprepared so when they ask, you know,\n\n421\n00:23:28.172 --> 00:23:31.334\ndon't expect to have too many\nsituations where they just come in and\n\n422\n00:23:31.334 --> 00:23:35.065\njust [SOUND] kick open the door and like,\nokay we want to see this, this and this.\n\n423\n00:23:35.065 --> 00:23:38.454\nThey're usually gonna give you some\nsort of lead time and say yeah,\n\n424\n00:23:38.454 --> 00:23:42.810\nwe're scheduling audit this time and\nthis is what we're gonna be looking for.\n\n425\n00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:45.630\nAnd so you can prep for it.\n\n426\n00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:47.540\n>> That's good because,\nI mean they know they can't just walk.\n\n427\n00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:51.230\nWell I guess they know they can if\nthey want to, but if they want to be\n\n428\n00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:53.830\nefficient, they've gotta give you time to\nget everything together, get everything\n\n429\n00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.660\nready for them, a couple peaches and\nsodas as well to make them happy.\n\n430\n00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.680\nNo.\n>> Yeah, spike it.\n\n431\n00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:07.330\nYeah, they could just come right in,\nthat's not like that's never happened.\n\n432\n00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:11.830\n>> But typically, if they're coming in,\nthey don't call it an audit anymore,\n\n433\n00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:12.838\nthey call it a raid.\n\n434\n00:24:12.838 --> 00:24:14.154\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n435\n00:24:14.154 --> 00:24:16.245\n>> That's typically what that is.\n\n436\n00:24:16.245 --> 00:24:20.680\n[LAUGH] You know so there get the guys\nwith the jacket say FBI on the back.\n\n437\n00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.265\nThat's what happens there.\n\n438\n00:24:22.265 --> 00:24:23.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n439\n00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.390\nif they add that quickly\n>> Whole\n\n440\n00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:25.870\n>> Yeah that's a whole different category\n\n441\n00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:26.490\nthere\n>> Yeah.\n\n442\n00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.180\n>> That you don't ever want to see.\n\n443\n00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:30.740\nSo that's where that would fit in so.\n\n444\n00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:31.730\n>> Okay.\n\n445\n00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:32.870\n>> So just kind of give you an idea,\n\n446\n00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:36.240\nbut it's more than likely give\nyou some lead time on it.\n\n447\n00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.890\nOr if they make a request today, they're\ngonna say, we want this information.\n\n448\n00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.700\nYou're just gonna, they're either gonna\nhave in their SLA saying, how and\n\n449\n00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.640\nwhat time frame you gotta,\nor in their contract saying,\n\n450\n00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.690\nyou know how long you\nhave to respond to it.\n\n451\n00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:54.440\nOr you're gonna tell them, this is when\nwe're gonna have this ready for you.\n\n452\n00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.220\nThat'll be that.\n\n453\n00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.170\n>> All right, good.\n\n454\n00:24:58.170 --> 00:24:59.790\nAll right, Sean,\na lot of great information.\n\n455\n00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.130\nCompliance and audits.\n\n456\n00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.110\nAnything else we wanna throw in\nhere before we wrap this one up?\n\n457\n00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.330\n>> No, I think that pretty much covers it.\n\n458\n00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:07.210\n>> All good, all right.\n\n459\n00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:09.450\nWell ladies and gentlemen,\nhope you enjoyed watching.\n\n460\n00:25:09.450 -->

00:00:16.041\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick with\nyou today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:20.700\nAnd Sean, today we're gonna be talking\nabout Data security life cycle.\n\n5\n00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.840\nNow, our data's alive.\n\n6\n00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.250\nIt's got a life cycle it goes through.\n\n7\n00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.610\nIs that what we're talking about?\n\n8\n00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.562\n>> Yeah, there's too many moving parts.\n\n9\n00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:27.478\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can't deal with the creating life.\n\n10\n00:00:27.478 --> 00:00:29.490\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] But\n\n11\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.070\nour data definitely goes through different\nphases and each one of those phases,\n\n12\n00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.030\nit requires different things from us.\n\n13\n00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.990\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n14\n00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.790\nIt's like anything.\n\n15\n00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.690\nI mean I think a Probably anybody\nthat's been in IT long enough or\n\n16\n00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.880\nsoftware development anything like that,\nI mean heck, you could really say anything\n\n17\n00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.110\nperiod, that you'll notice that there is\na life cycle that everything goes through.\n\n18\n00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.990\nFor IT we've had plenty of\ndifferent life cycles for years.\n\n19\n00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.830\nEvery vendor seems to have their own, but\nthey all pretty much adhere to the same\n\n20\n00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.400\nthing that you have a place where\nyou kind of envision, design.\n\n21\n00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.780\nAnd create, and just move it all the way\nthrough to the end of its life cycle and\n\n22\n00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.860\njust keep kind of going right on through.\n\n23\n00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.100\nIt's the reason why they call it a cycle.\n\n24\n00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.360\nIt keeps going right on through and\nover and over and over again.\n\n25\n00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.860\nThey're designed to keep you\non a certain path to make\n\n26\n00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.200\nsure certain steps are being followed.\n\n27\n00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.510\nThe kind of compartmentalizing\nof things a bit so\n\n28\n00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.170\nthat you kind of keep\nfocused on where you are.\n\n29\n00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.420\nIt's a relatively common thing.\n\n30\n00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.580\nIf you go through,\nlike I said, really anything.\n\n31\n00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.140\nOne of the ones I think\nof right off the top\n\n32\n00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.890\nof my head is the change\nmanagement life cycle.\n\n33\n00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.870\nAbout how you envision a change,\npropose a change, engineer it,\n\n34\n00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.880\nroll it out, and All that stuff,\nyou've probably all seen that or\n\n35\n00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.380\nin fact many of the courses here at\nITPro talk about that actual life cycle,\n\n36\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.180\nI know that I've talked about it as well.\n\n37\n00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.510\n>> We talk about it when we talk about\nsoftware deployment or with group policy,\n\n38\n00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.370\nyou've got your creating your package,\ndeploying your package.\n\n39\n00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.220\nYou've got your up.\n\n40\n00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.850\ndate phase where the package\nmight go through an update or\n\n41\n00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.780\nan application update and\nthen eventually you retire the application\n\n42\n00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.515\nwhen it's no longer needed so\nit's just another type of life cycle.\n\n43\n00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:15.790\n<< Yeah, so\nconcept is really not foreign to us so\n\n44\n00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.580\nbeing the way life cycles the way they\nare and that they're a common thing,\n\n45\n00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.770\nwe shouldn't expect the cloud\nto be really any different.\n\n46\n00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.200\nThe cloud does have life\ncycles that are unique to it.\n\n47\n00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.830\nThe one we're gonna be looking at here is\nactually one that pertains specifically to\n\n48\n00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.130\ndata and hosting in the cloud and how you\nkeep that secure to make sure that you\n\n49\n00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.520\nare servicing your requests the right way,\ncarrying out the things the right way.\n\n50\n00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.330\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\n51\n00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.720\nKeep in mind this is the life cycle\nthat we're gonna talk about here is not\n\n52\n00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.400\nthe life cycle you're gonna see\n\n53\n00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.680\nin every case with every Cloud provider or\nevery Cloud solution or white paper.\n\n54\n00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.580\nOr book or what have you.\n\n55\n00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.080\nThere are variations on a theme, but\n\n56\n00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.670\nthere still is gonna some sort of\nlife cycle that you go through.\n\n57\n00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.580\nA reason why I emphasise that this\nisn't the only life cycle for\n\n58\n00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.360\ndoing stuff in the cloud is of course,\n\n59\n00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.300\nThis is something that should help\nyou get IFC certification on this.\n\n60\n00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.670\nSo this is one that they're endorsing.\n\n61\n00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.360\nIt's not necessarily the only one,\nthe only way you can do this.\n\n62\n00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.720\nThere's more than one\nway to carry this out.\n\n63\n00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.140\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n64\n00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.370\nIf you look at it and say,\nthat's a little too rigid, or\n\n65\n00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.270\nit just breaks stuff down too much or it\ndoesn't fit, you know my specific needs.\n\n66\n00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.130\nThat's fine.\nYou know, this is just the one for\n\n67\n00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.950\nthis that's used for this certification.\n\n68\n00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.785\n>> We're not saying you have to use it,\nbut you have to know it to pass the exam.\n\n69\n00:03:47.785 --> 00:03:50.220\n[LAUGH] and\nthen you can do whatever you want.\n\n70\n00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.050\n>> One of these days I'm gonna\nsay no you have to use this one.\n\n71\n00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.838\nI don't care what your opinion is,\nit doesn't matter to me.\n\n72\n00:03:56.838 --> 00:03:59.880\n[LAUGH] So, but you know like I said,\n\n73\n00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.960\nthis is just one you\nknow specific life cycle.\n\n74\n00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.090\nThere are variations of a theme,\n\n75\n00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.010\nso don't think that you have\nto stick with just this one.\n\n76\n00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.620\nAnd don't think that another\none's wrong or this one's wrong.\n\n77\n00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.600\nIt's just different,\na different way of doing things.\n\n78\n00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.130\nJust make sure if you are I\nshouldn't say if, but\n\n79\n00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.470\nwhen you have a lifecycle in place that\nis something that fits your needs and\n\n80\n00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.790\nthat you are sticking by that you\ndon't start breaking out of it,\n\n81\n00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.020\nthe whole purpose of this is to make sure\nthat you kind of have a process that\n\n82\n00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.740\nyou're following to do\nwhatever it is you're doing.\n\n83\n00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.000\nThat's it, the lifecycle that we have\nhere is going to have sis steps.\n\n84\n00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.060\nThose six steps are going to really\ntalk about the whole process\n\n85\n00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.800\nof getting of creating data,\nof getting it into the cloud,\n\n86\n00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.980\nof processing it, making sure people\ncan access it and just going right on\n\n87\n00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.090\nthroughout the whole thing so that's\nwhat this life cycle is designed to do.\n\n88\n00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.910\nThe things that you'll notice it is\nlacking is Stuff that pertains to\n\n89\n00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.840\nactually deploying the solution that is\nresponsible for processing that data.\n\n90\n00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.490\nThat's something else.\n\n91\n00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.530\nThat you can pretty much use application\ndevelopment life cycles for, and\n\n92\n00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.240\nother methodologies for that.\n\n93\n00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.160\nSo if you're deploying your solution and\n\n94\n00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.700\nmoving it over, over into the cloud you're\ngoing to go someplace else for that.\n\n95\n00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.260\nFor what we're talking about here\nthis pertains to just the data.\n\n96\n00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.180\nSo don't get kind of you\nknow crazy about that going,\n\n97\n00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.640\nthat doesn't seem to cover you\nknow moving my solution out there.\n\n98\n00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.460\nIsn't mean to, it's meant to just\ntalk about the data portion of it.\n\n99\n00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.629\nWhen you move a solution out to the cloud\nthere definitely be some similarities\n\n100\n00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:41.580\nbetween this and the other one,\nsimilarities between this and\n\n101\n00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.310\nthe software creation stuff.\n\n102\n00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.920\nThere will be stuff like\nenvisioning the solution,\n\n103\n00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.500\ntesting solution,\nthen designing implementation and\n\n104\n00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.200\nyou know all that type of stuff that will\nbe there, but it's not gonna fit this.\n\n105\n00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.030\nThis will come after you've\ngot that solution created or\n\n106\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.860\ndeployed and now you're talking about\ncreating the data and working with\n\n107\n00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.130\nthe data that that application is\ngonna be Is gonna be handling.\n\n108\n00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:14.050\n>> Alright so what is phase one, I guess\nthat would be a good place to start.\n\n109\n00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.711\n>> Phase one is a good place to start!\n\n110\n00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:19.360\n[LAUGH] SO, what I've got up on my screen\nhere just to kind of help you envision\n\n111\n00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.008\nthis: this is your six step program\nIt's not a 12 step program.\n\n112\n00:06:25.008 --> 00:06:26.500\n>> [LAUGH] I like it already.\n\n113\n00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.510\n>> Six steps, I ain't got time for\na step program so.\n\n114\n00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:40.660\nAnyway we've got here is it's gonna start\nwith that create phase right up top.\n\n115\n00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.970\nThat create phase, it pretty much is\ntelling you what's gonna happen there.\n\n116\n00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.650\nIt's creating that actual data, and in\nthe scheme of things when you create data,\n\n117\n00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.660\nit's gonna be whatever the application\nhappens to be responsible for\n\n118\n00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.880\ncreating that data.\n\n119\n00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.060\nIt's gonna be going through\nwhatever that takes to develop it,\n\n120\n00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.840\ncreate it, whatever to get it into that\nsystem and have it create the data on\n\n121\n00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.330\nthe backend whether it's a database,\nor a file, what have you.\n\n122\n00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.040\nThat's what's happening there.\n\n123\n00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.320\nWe're presuming that there's gonna be some\nprocess to actually get it into the System\n\n124\n00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:19.140\nand to get it into the format where\nit's usable later on down the road.\n\n125\n00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.350\nSo that's the create phase.\n\n126\n00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:23.880\nThe application will handle that.\n\n127\n00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.530\nAnd Once we got it created,\n\n128\n00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.140\nthen comes the next part is actually\nfiguring out how it's gonna be store.\n\n129\n00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.690\nYou know.\n\n130\n00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.690\nSo you're creating data now there\nhas to be a way to store it.\n\n131\n00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.370\nYou know.\nKeep it safe and secured.\n\n132\n00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.690\nDeciding format.\n\n133\n00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.100\nI mean, to go back to what\nwas in a previous episode,\n\n134\n00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.040\nremember the compliance stuff we talked\nabout, that could also be dictated\n\n135\n00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.760\nthere on the format that this\ninformation's gonna be stored in.\n\n136\n00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.980\nThey could very well be saying,\nthere's certain formats that we expect\n\n137\n00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.540\nthe data to be stored in, so\nyou're gonna have to do it there.\n\n138\n00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.642\nAnd you'll take care of that and\nenvision how that's gonna be done and\n\n139\n00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.388\nmake sure it's stored in that format.\n\n140\n00:07:58.388 --> 00:07:59.147\nAlso remember,\n\n141\n00:07:59.147 --> 00:08:02.458\nwhen you're You're talking about you\nknow what format you store it in.\n\n142\n00:08:02.458 --> 00:08:04.297\nAlso, definitely remember that or\n\n143\n00:08:04.297 --> 00:08:08.096\nkeep in mind that this is going to dictate\nhow you're going to back it up and\n\n144\n00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:11.531\nnot just compliance, but\nhow you're backing it up and storing for\n\n145\n00:08:11.531 --> 00:08:15.580\nlater stuff, and you can see that in\nthe later step that'd be archiving.\n\n146\n00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:19.120\nSo we're trying to kinda look ahead in\nthe life cycle and figure out okay we're\n\n147\n00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.500\nstoring them in a certain format, is that\nformat also gonna be easy to back up?\n\n148\n00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:27.020\nThere's some formats that look\ngreat from one angle, but\n\n149\n00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.980\nanother angle they're not so\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n150\n00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.710\n>> Great.\n\n151\n00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:34.960\nI remember some of these old image formats\nthat looked really great, you know,\n\n152\n00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.370\nno pun intended, on paper, but they were\njust horrible, you know, in real life and\n\n153\n00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:43.770\nthe ones I remember, were for given\nthe kind of example of data storage format\n\n154\n00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:48.150\nwas, remember the old old TIF format?\n\n155\n00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.150\nIt was like,\nit tried to be everything to everybody and\n\n156\n00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.660\nyou'd get an image that you'd scan in or\ndo something with any other format,\n\n157\n00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.170\nit would be some little file size.\n\n158\n00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:01.085\nA TIF would come in,\nbe like hey this is a 40 meg image.\n\n159\n00:09:01.085 --> 00:09:02.640\nWhat the hell?\n\n160\n00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.936\n[LAUGH] It had so much stuff.\n\n161\n00:09:05.936 --> 00:09:10.796\nAnd this is in the days of floppys and\nstuff like that when you had some TIF\n\n162\n00:09:10.796 --> 00:09:14.400\nfiles coming in that big,\nit was just too much.\n\n163\n00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.210\nSo, it looked good,\nit described it saying, oh a TIF file\n\n164\n00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:24.410\nstores all this information for all these\ndifferent applications to process it.\n\n165\n00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.180\nAnd it can do all this cool stuff.\n\n166\n00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.396\nYeah it could do all that cool stuff,\nbut when you're talking floppys and\n\n167\n00:09:30.396 --> 00:09:32.991\nyou're kinda like [NOISE]\nthat was horrible.\n\n168\n00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:34.795\nAnd that was just for a small image.\n\n169\n00:09:34.795 --> 00:09:37.600\nI would be talking about scanning\nsomething like just a little sheet of\n\n170\n00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.880\npaper like this.\n\n171\n00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.550\nYou were talking about\na 40 meg file at least.\n\n172\n00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.190\nSo it was just horrible.\n\n173\n00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.870\nBut something that,\njust kinda keep that in mind.\n\n174\n00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.510\nSome things may look\ngood from one angle but\n\n175\n00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.940\nlook down the road to see is it gonna\nbe something that's easy to archive,\n\n176\n00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.190\neasy to process, so on and so forth,\nin addition to being compliant.\n\n177\n00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.430\nIf that's needed.\n\n178\n00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.560\nSo that's the storage space.\n\n179\n00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.530\nSo we're figuring out a way it's gonna be\nstored, formats it's gonna be stored in.\n\n180\n00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:11.160\nIs it gonna be stored in\na format that's safe and sound?\n\n181\n00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.830\nAll that good stuff.\n\n182\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.460\nI'd also even put into this the format,\nwhen it's crated and\n\n183\n00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.830\nstored, think about long term stuff too.\n\n184\n00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:25.680\nBecause when you look at, it'll, when you\nlook at storing data over the long term,\n\n185\n00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.510\nremember don't just think about the way\nit's stored now, think about is that still\n\n186\n00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.240\ngonna be something that's accessible to\nyou, you know several years down the road,\n\n187\n00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.050\nbecause one of the core tenets of\nsecurity is that availability thing.\n\n188\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:42.180\nI sure as heck say that if you store\nsomething in a certain format, and\n\n189\n00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.510\nit's not accessible because\nthe application has outgrown it or gone to\n\n190\n00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:50.200\na different format some years down the\nroad, that's gonna be really bad for you.\n\n191\n00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.880\nI mean, that's happened.\n\n192\n00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:56.650\nPeople quote that about tapes all the time\nnow that we've been telling people for\n\n193\n00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.490\nyears, for several years,\ntelling them backup stuff to tape.\n\n194\n00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.820\nNot so much now, but\nit used to be always backup stuff to tape.\n\n195\n00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:09.150\nWell a lot of those tape\nformats were very proprietary.\n\n196\n00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:13.810\nSo you're storing stuff to tape but those\ntape readers aren't available anymore so\n\n197\n00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.270\nit kinda sucks to be you if you\nhave something in that format.\n\n198\n00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.770\n>> I would think even the file\nformat that you choose,\n\n199\n00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:24.270\nif it's a proprietary file format and that\nvendor goes under or is no longer around.\n\n200\n00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.500\nYou could have trouble\naccessing some of that stuff.\n\n201\n00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.900\n>> Oh, absolutely.\n\n202\n00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:32.700\nYou know,\nthe one that I think of is you know,\n\n203\n00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.170\nlooking at Auto CAD,\nI dealt with that industry a bit.\n\n204\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.480\nAuto CAD had the DWG format and\nit's a proprietary format.\n\n205\n00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.300\nNow there were other vendors that would\nsay their programs could actually\n\n206\n00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:44.010\nprocess that data.\n\n207\n00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.520\nBut they can never do it 100%.\n\n208\n00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.220\nWhen you really got down to it they'd\nsay oh yeah we can process it.\n\n209\n00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:52.040\nBut you can't process it because\neven though everyone else\n\n210\n00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.360\nwas saying we've created DWG format that\ncan read it, they reverse engineered it.\n\n211\n00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.960\nThat DWG was proprietary to\nAutodesk's Auto CAD format.\n\n212\n00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.640\nSo even though they could do it,\nthey weren't doing it 100%.\n\n213\n00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.340\nBut the thing is,\nis that you look at it like you just said,\n\n214\n00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.000\nyou kinda gotta measure that a bit.\n\n215\n00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.040\nBecause it could be, yeah,\nif it's a small company and\n\n216\n00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.780\nthey've created a proprietary format and\nthey go under, you're stuck.\n\n217\n00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.940\nNow hopefully you've done,\nif you've thought ahead and\n\n218\n00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.500\nto borrow some stuff from the for\nexample, you've done a code escrow deal.\n\n219\n00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:30.895\nWhere you've tried to set up something\nwhere that code is being held somewhere\n\n220\n00:12:30.895 --> 00:12:35.089\nelse so if they go under, you at least\ncan get access to that code and reverse\n\n221\n00:12:35.089 --> 00:12:40.180\nengineer it and all that if that happens,\nbut if you haven't, you're kind of stuck.\n\n222\n00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:45.390\nNow, in the case of somebody like\nAutodesk DWG format, it's a proprietary\n\n223\n00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:48.620\nformat to that company, but there's very\nlittle chance of Autodesk going under.\n\n224\n00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.950\nIt's such a large, large company and\n\n225\n00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:57.240\nthere's millions of DWG's\nout there across world.\n\n226\n00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.680\nIt's very little chance\nthat it's ever going to\n\n227\n00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.689\nbe stuck in that format permanently or\nthat it's going to go away.\n\n228\n00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.940\nSo anyway,\n\n229\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:15.010\nwe'll continuing through this process\nthen we have the use side of things.\n\n230\n00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.310\nWhen we talk about use\nhow are you storing it?\n\n231\n00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:24.008\nSomeone has to a program or\napplication user has in some way,\n\n232\n00:13:24.008 --> 00:13:26.950\nshape or form has to consume that data.\n\n233\n00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.980\nSo that's what we're talking about there.\n\n234\n00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.884\nHow usable is it you know.\n\n235\n00:13:30.884 --> 00:13:35.159\nHow are people gonna access it,\nthat's what I would put in there and\n\n236\n00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:39.134\neven transitions us into the next\nphase of sharing is that it's\n\n237\n00:13:39.134 --> 00:13:44.009\n[INAUDIBLE] to have in applications of\ngrabbing that and interacting with it,\n\n238\n00:13:44.009 --> 00:13:47.834\nbut then sharing with an audience\nis another big deal there,\n\n239\n00:13:47.834 --> 00:13:51.885\nis who are you gonna share it out to,\nhow you're gonna share it.\n\n240\n00:13:51.885 --> 00:13:56.890\nWhat the overall scope of\nit is when you look at.\n\n241\n00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.280\nWhen you talk about cloud solutions,\n\n242\n00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.710\npublic versus private cloud, that right\nthere, knowing what your cloud solution is\n\n243\n00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:06.460\nis definitely going to\ndictate how you share it out.\n\n244\n00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.820\nNow if you're talking a public cloud,\n\n245\n00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.740\nthe sharing issue becomes\nI'd say more complex.\n\n246\n00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:19.220\nIf you're a private cloud you have a small\naudience inside that organization,\n\n247\n00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.180\npresumably to deal with.\n\n248\n00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:25.560\nEven if you're a very large\ncompany it's a very finite number.\n\n249\n00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.480\nBut if you're talking about\njust the public at large, yeah,\n\n250\n00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.390\nthat's a finite number too but\nit's a very large finite number and\n\n251\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.980\nyou can't really quantify how many\npeople are gonna be accessing it.\n\n252\n00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:41.460\nSo, restricting it becomes a much more of\nan issue and a much more complex thing.\n\n253\n00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:45.120\nSolvable, but a much more complex thing so\nyou'll have to do additional\n\n254\n00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.900\nplanning there to make sure your\ninformation's kept safe and\n\n255\n00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.400\nsound as well as kept out of the hands\nof people that really shouldn't have it.\n\n256\n00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.430\nI mean, you do not want to end up\nbeing one of these companies that's\n\n257\n00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:01.410\nbeen around over the last few years or\nagencies, whatever you want to put it in,\n\n258\n00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.490\nbecause they've all been hit,\nthat have had their stuff accessed and\n\n259\n00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:09.430\njust spilled out there into\nthe ether of the Internet.\n\n260\n00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.830\nYou know, we've had plenty of those.\n\n261\n00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:15.390\nWe had stuff like here in the US we\nhave the Office of Personnel Management,\n\n262\n00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.090\nyou know had their stuff breached.\n\n263\n00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:20.540\nYou don't want to end up\nbeing in that situation.\n\n264\n00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:25.040\nHow I think of stuff\nlike it's not necessarily\n\n265\n00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.860\na cloud scenario, but you think of\nthe stuff like the Ashley Madison.\n\n266\n00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:34.040\nThat website that got,\nthey had their stuff accessed and\n\n267\n00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.640\nthat's become a huge embarrassment.\n\n268\n00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.598\nIt's resulted in a lot of lawsuits.\n\n269\n00:15:38.598 --> 00:15:43.092\nNow I, not talking about the content on\nthat site or what they're involved in or\n\n270\n00:15:43.092 --> 00:15:47.586\nanything like that, it's just the fact\nthat they had their data compromised,\n\n271\n00:15:47.586 --> 00:15:49.082\nit's been put out there.\n\n272\n00:15:49.082 --> 00:15:52.983\nThey weren't careful with how\nthey handled their information.\n\n273\n00:15:52.983 --> 00:15:56.889\nso you really kind of gotta think this\nthing through and be very careful and\n\n274\n00:15:56.889 --> 00:16:01.110\ntest it, audit it, all that stuff\nyou know before you go live with it.\n\n275\n00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.220\nSo we've got sharing\nthen we go to archiving.\n\n276\n00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.595\nArchiving of course covers that\ngood old Question of backups.\n\n277\n00:16:08.595 --> 00:16:12.335\nCome up with a backup solution\nthat's gonna be workable for you.\n\n278\n00:16:12.335 --> 00:16:13.895\nI mean, pick your backup right?\n\n279\n00:16:13.895 --> 00:16:15.325\nThere's so\nmany different forms of backup out there.\n\n280\n00:16:15.325 --> 00:16:18.745\n>> Of course you probably have to think\nabout what you're gonna use to back up,\n\n281\n00:16:18.745 --> 00:16:22.515\nwhat formats you want to put those backups\nin, what media you want to store it on,\n\n282\n00:16:22.515 --> 00:16:25.145\nhow long I've got to keep them for,\nthings like that?\n\n283\n00:16:25.145 --> 00:16:27.805\n>> Yeah that's actually a really\ngood point to bring up.\n\n284\n00:16:27.805 --> 00:16:31.270\nHow long and the media because\n\n285\n00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.540\nyou could be required to keep this for\na substantial period of time.\n\n286\n00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.740\nI mean, you look at something like,\n\n287\n00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:43.265\nagain the health care industry,\nthey mandate a seven year period.\n\n288\n00:16:43.265 --> 00:16:44.955\nFigured that this has to be kept.\n\n289\n00:16:44.955 --> 00:16:49.955\nAnd some medical facilities will keep them\nlonger just to give themselves a buffer\n\n290\n00:16:49.955 --> 00:16:51.565\non that for safety reasons.\n\n291\n00:16:51.565 --> 00:16:54.215\nThey may keep it up to ten years or\nlonger.\n\n292\n00:16:54.215 --> 00:16:57.810\nIt's up to them,\nthe law only, Says that, or\n\n293\n00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.870\nthe guidelines only say seven years,\nbut it could be longer.\n\n294\n00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:08.540\nI have my eye doctor keeps his files\nin the office for seven years.\n\n295\n00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.260\nAFter that seven years they\ndump it into a scanner.\n\n296\n00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:14.340\nThe whole thing's scanned and\nput on a media.\n\n297\n00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:18.150\nAnd then the actual physical file is\nstored for a bit and shredded, but\n\n298\n00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:23.460\nthey still have that digital media sitting\nout there that they can anytime refer to.\n\n299\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.090\nThey said they will never get rid of it.\n\n300\n00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:26.860\nIt's too easy to store it digitally.\n\n301\n00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:27.590\nRight.\n>> So,\n\n302\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.760\nthey just have gone through it that way.\n\n303\n00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.730\nSo, you need to be thinking about how\nlong you need to keep stuff around and\n\n304\n00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.580\nwhat's a good idea to keep it around.\n\n305\n00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:40.090\nI mean, there's always what the law\nsays and the guidelines say, and\n\n306\n00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:42.140\nthen there is what's a good idea for you.\n\n307\n00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.200\nYou gotta decide what that is.\n\n308\n00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.040\nAnd then you gotta decide,\nnot just how long, but.\n\n309\n00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.720\nIs that format going to be accessible too.\n\n310\n00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:55.220\nYou never know so think about\nsomething that's going to be durable,\n\n311\n00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.410\nyou know endure for\na long period of time, be around.\n\n312\n00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:05.560\nTapes are one that are notorious for\nkind of those formats going away or\n\n313\n00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:10.450\nbeing tough to read so\nyou gotta remember that.\n\n314\n00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:15.720\nI mean, heck, when I think about tapes\nI always think about is NASA themselves\n\n315\n00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.270\nactually says, if you can believe it or\nnot, they have stuff from the Apollo\n\n316\n00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:23.250\neleven missions that they can't,\nthey've got those tapes, but\n\n317\n00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:28.780\nthey can't read them anymore\nbecause the equipment is gone.\n\n318\n00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:33.175\nWell we know what's on the tapes,\nit's parts of the soundstage,\n\n319\n00:18:33.175 --> 00:18:34.670\n[INAUDIBLE] in here.\n\n320\n00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.943\nYeah, we filmed it here, right here, so.\n\n321\n00:18:36.943 --> 00:18:39.484\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right here on a green screen.\n\n322\n00:18:39.484 --> 00:18:41.050\n[LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n323\n00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.430\nit's right there next\nto the Bigfoot stuff.\n\n324\n00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.810\nSo, you need to think about that.\n\n325\n00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:50.220\nAnd then that takes us to\nthe last step number six here.\n\n326\n00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:58.000\nwhich is the destruction phase is, what do\nyou do when the information's no longer,\n\n327\n00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:03.720\nthere's no longer any requirement to keep\nit around for whatever the reason is,\n\n328\n00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.590\ni'll let whatever the situation\nis speak for itself.\n\n329\n00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:12.200\nYou know Case of HIPPA, you've reached\nthe seven year period, you decide I'm not\n\n330\n00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:16.660\ngoing to keep it anymore,\ngoes in to the round file so to speak.\n\n331\n00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:22.770\nSo how does that actually work when you\ndispose of it, What are you gonna do?\n\n332\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:28.180\nThat could be a big compliance thing\nright there too, by the way, because I'm\n\n333\n00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:33.150\njokingly saying with HIPAA, I take\nthat patient file and I throw it into\n\n334\n00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.230\nthe round file Of course I'm not actually\nphysically throwing it in there.\n\n335\n00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.830\nThere's actually something that would take\nplace that say this has to be shredded,\n\n336\n00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.710\nburned, whatever it is.\n\n337\n00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.880\nNeeds to make sure it's not\nretrievable by someone.\n\n338\n00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.810\nIt needs to be taken someplace offsite or\nwhatever and taken and\n\n339\n00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.470\ndestroyed a certain way.\n\n340\n00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:54.780\nYou need to make sure that you\nare in compliance on that.\n\n341\n00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.700\nOtherwise, there's going to be a problem.\n\n342\n00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.620\nThere needs to be paperwork and\ndocumentation on that and\n\n343\n00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:01.895\nthere should be on this whole process.\n\n344\n00:20:01.895 --> 00:20:05.225\nprocess if you have any sort of\ncompliance guidelines in place.\n\n345\n00:20:05.225 --> 00:20:09.075\nYou should have some documentation\nsaying what's happening up to and\n\n346\n00:20:09.075 --> 00:20:11.235\nincluding the destruction process.\n\n347\n00:20:11.235 --> 00:20:15.930\nHow can you assure me if I'm\nyour customer that you've\n\n348\n00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:21.170\nDestroy the stuff in a way that's\nthat I can that I'm okay with.\n\n349\n00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:26.340\nAnd if you really keep that in mind,\nif you're talking a cloud solution,\n\n350\n00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.280\nlet's say I'm talking to my provider.\n\n351\n00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.980\nWe'll there's a question there.\n\n352\n00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:38.170\nWhen I delete a file off there,\nwhat happens to it?\n\n353\n00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:43.040\nI can say with some degree of certainty,\nif I have a server inside my company\n\n354\n00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.230\nand I don't need it anymore or\nthe hardrive doesn't need it anymore,\n\n355\n00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:53.130\nlet's say I know I can take it and I can\nhave that hard drive shredded, melted,\n\n356\n00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:54.380\ndegaussed, you name it.\n\n357\n00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.900\nI can have it done to that storage device.\n\n358\n00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.500\nIf it's in a Cloud service provider,\nyou can't say well,\n\n359\n00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.300\nI need that hard drive to be destroyed.\n\n360\n00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.270\nYou may not be the only\none on that hard drive.\n\n361\n00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:10.440\nSo, it's just because of the way\nresources are handles there.\n\n362\n00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.280\nYou may not be the only one.\n\n363\n00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.870\nSo if that's the case, you're gonna\nneed to really think about things.\n\n364\n00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:21.880\nPeople have dealt with it by doing stuff\nlike Encryption, that's a very common one.\n\n365\n00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.480\nThey'll store all their stuff up there\nin the cloud in encrypted format so\n\n366\n00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.840\nif it is deleted, even though\nthe remnants might be left behind, and\n\n367\n00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.880\nthe remnants might be\nretrievable by someone else.\n\n368\n00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.390\nThe format's encrypted so\n\n369\n00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:40.060\nit's such a strong level encryption that\nit's essentially impossible to break.\n\n370\n00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.650\nSo you need to think about\nthose type of things.\n\n371\n00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:44.430\nYou just gotta plan ahead.\n\n372\n00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:48.930\nBut that's the six-step life cycle for\n\n373\n00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:51.380\ndata within the Cloud and\nyou could actually.\n\n374\n00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.440\nSay that this would apply to data\nanywhere if you get down to it,\n\n375\n00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.380\nbut this-\n>> Yeah, it doesn't really seem to be\n\n376\n00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:01.670\ncloud specific at any point,\nalthough the cloud could bring in\n\n377\n00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.250\ndifferent methodologies that we have\nto go through during those phases.\n\n378\n00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:06.620\n>> Yeah, it really does.\n\n379\n00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:11.110\nI mean, there would be some\ndifferences that you have to go\n\n380\n00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.490\nout of your way to point\nout to think about.\n\n381\n00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:18.630\nBut if I just gave anybody That diagram\nand said, here's the data life cycle,\n\n382\n00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.720\ndon't mention the cloud in there, it would\ndescribe really any sort of data, but\n\n383\n00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:28.720\nonce they start saying that\nI'm storing it up in the cloud\n\n384\n00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:34.360\non Using the platform as a service\ntype deal and putting it out there.\n\n385\n00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:38.070\nThen that starts changing the question\na bit anybody who understands the cloud is\n\n386\n00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.770\ngoing to say my thinking has\nbeen changed just a bit.\n\n387\n00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:46.600\nWhen they start talking about how it's\nbeing shared the public versus private,\n\n388\n00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.120\nthat starts to changed up soon as I\nmention the cloud as does the archiving,\n\n389\n00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.190\nbecause someone else\nhas the stuff I don't.\n\n390\n00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.890\nThat can change things as\nwell as destruction part,\n\n391\n00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:00.000\nwhen it's in the cloud it's not here,\nit's over there.\n\n392\n00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.180\nWell then that brings in\nsome additional concerns,\n\n393\n00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:07.210\njust on the surface if you talk about\nthose six phases, yeah, you're right, it\n\n394\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.530\ndoesn't look any different than anything\nyou expect to see anyplace else in IT.\n\n395\n00:23:10.530 --> 00:23:13.290\n>> All right,\nwe just got a lot of great information.\n\n396\n00:23:13.290 --> 00:23:14.160\nWe covered the.\n\n397\n00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:17.480\nSix different phases of\nour data life cycle.\n\n398\n00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.430\nSo anything else we want to throw\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n399\n00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:23.440\n>> No, I think we kind of got\nthings covered with that one.\n\n400\n00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:23.950\n>> Good deal.\n\n401\n00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.630\nAll right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nhope you enjoyed watching this one.\n\n402\n00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.840\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n403\n00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.700\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n404\n00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.710\n>> And

00:00:15.650\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oreano.\n\n4\n00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.750\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\nbe discussing storage locations.\n\n5\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.470\nSo what do we got for\nour storage locations, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.640\nWe got a few different\noptions we can choose from.\n\n7\n00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.750\n>> Yeah, there actually are quite a few\noptions available to us and the thing that\n\n8\n00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.390\nwe're actually really trying to really\nfocus on here is we're not trying to sit\n\n9\n00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.030\nhere and tell you specific ways and\noptions to store your data.\n\n10\n00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.970\nI mean that's really gonna be up to you\nto decide for your specific situation.\n\n11\n00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.950\nSo, we really don't care about\nthe actual data format, whether you're\n\n12\n00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.500\nstoring the database in a certain format\nlike Oracle, or let's say whatever.\n\n13\n00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.830\nWe don't care about that.\n\n14\n00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.760\nThat's entirely on you as the developer\nand person setting that up.\n\n15\n00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.220\nNow, what we're talking about is,\nyou know, kind of as families\n\n16\n00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.820\nof storage options that considerations\nthat you're gonna put in place.\n\n17\n00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.540\nYou know, typically one of\nthe things we're talking about with\n\n18\n00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.500\nregular solutions is something\nthat they call raw storage.\n\n19\n00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.320\nRaw storage just means in what\nwe're talking about here,\n\n20\n00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.640\nmeans you are storing it on\na hard drive of some sort.\n\n21\n00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.775\nWhether it's traditional,\nsolid state, or whatever, don't care.\n\n22\n00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:32.355\nIt's just that that's what\nwe would call raw storage.\n\n23\n00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:36.085\nNow, you may have that\noption available to you.\n\n24\n00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:39.145\nThat would typically be,\nwhen you talk raw storage,\n\n25\n00:01:39.145 --> 00:01:41.875\nyou're typically talking about\nyou have a private cloud.\n\n26\n00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:46.075\nAnd so you've got control of all\nthe infrastructure and everything.\n\n27\n00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:49.095\nSo you know where all the hard\ndrives are and all that stuff is,\n\n28\n00:01:49.095 --> 00:01:50.510\nall the storage space.\n\n29\n00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.990\nYou're just, happen to be group it inside\nthis big, you know, thing called a cloud.\n\n30\n00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.230\nAnd say, here you can access it, you know,\nso for all intents and purposes,\n\n31\n00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.570\nI know some people might go,\nno it's not the right way to describe it.\n\n32\n00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.020\nIt's almost like mapping\na drive at that point.\n\n33\n00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.720\nI mean,\nyou've almost got the same type of deal.\n\n34\n00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.180\nBut that's raw storage,\n\n35\n00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.260\nyou definitely have that as\nan option with a private cloud.\n\n36\n00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.100\nBut the question becomes,\n\n37\n00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.730\nif you're moving out of the environment\ninto a public cloud type situation.\n\n38\n00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.300\nYou can have a thing\ncalled volume storage,\n\n39\n00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.278\nwhich fits in the category of things like\nvirtual hard drives, and virtualization.\n\n40\n00:02:28.278 --> 00:02:36.120\nYou know so, if you really look at it, in\nthe case of the, just a cloud in general,\n\n41\n00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.070\nwithout including the virtualization\nas we typically think of it,\n\n42\n00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.200\nsomething like VMWare, Virtualbox stuff\nlike that, if we take that out of\n\n43\n00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.210\nthe picture and we just look at the way\nthe cloud is, we've got a cloud,\n\n44\n00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.080\nwe're storing stuff up there, putting\nour hosts and our application up there.\n\n45\n00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.290\nWe see space.\n\n46\n00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.740\nThat's what it is.\n\n47\n00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.350\nThat space can be quantified\nas a giant hard drive.\n\n48\n00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.380\nI've heard people explain it,\nI'm putting stuff up in the cloud.\n\n49\n00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.405\nIt's a giant hard drive sitting\nout there in the Internet.\n\n50\n00:03:07.405 --> 00:03:10.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not the most elegant description, but\n\n51\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.530\nsometimes you don't need the most elegant\ndescription to get the point across.\n\n52\n00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.580\nBut we know by looking at that and\nour journey through\n\n53\n00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.690\nthe cloud that that is not what's\nreally happening back there, that chunk\n\n54\n00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.910\nof space could be spread across multiple\nmachine, and multiple physical volumes.\n\n55\n00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.230\nIt's not just on one thing.\n\n56\n00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.120\nIt appears to us as one volume, but\n\n57\n00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.990\nit's not one volume, so that's just\none option that you might have.\n\n58\n00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.880\nNow you could have some issues\nwith that you need to address.\n\n59\n00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.220\nThere could be when you\nhave that volume storage,\n\n60\n00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.050\nyour data is not necessarily all\ngonna be residing in the same place.\n\n61\n00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.430\nSo they talk about the same drive,\n\n62\n00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.240\nit could be spread across\nactual different locations.\n\n63\n00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.610\nAnd that could cause concern for you.\n\n64\n00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.120\nI mean, especially if you're talking about\nissues of going across country lines,\n\n65\n00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.350\nstate lines, stuff like that.\n\n66\n00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.770\nThat could definitely be an issue for you.\n\n67\n00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.093\nIt also could be a question of how\nresilient you're gonna be able to be in\n\n68\n00:04:13.093 --> 00:04:15.340\nthe case of a disaster or something.\n\n69\n00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.574\nIf you have a volume that's spread\nacross multiple locations and\n\n70\n00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:21.686\none of them gets hit, how quickly\nwould you be able to restore or\n\n71\n00:04:21.686 --> 00:04:24.890\nget back that stuff that stuff\nthat was stored in that location.\n\n72\n00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.535\nThat would be something that\nwould actually pop up for\n\n73\n00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:32.510\nus which would be part of\nthe security equation.\n\n74\n00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.689\nSo you've got that.\n\n75\n00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.200\nOther things we have available to us.\n\n76\n00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.760\nWe have something called, and\nthis is something called object storage.\n\n77\n00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.100\nObject storage,\n\n78\n00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.330\nit's just a really kind of a fancy way\nof saying we're storing files, okay.\n\n79\n00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.400\nSomeone in the cloud decided, someone that\nwas developing cloud technologies like\n\n80\n00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.780\nstoring files up in the,\nyou can't call it that.\n\n81\n00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.820\nIt's new hotness, it's the cloud,\n\n82\n00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.842\nyou gotta call it object\ncuz that sounds awesome.\n\n83\n00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:04.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, if you wanna call it that.\n\n84\n00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.425\n[LAUGH] If you want to call it\nfiles outside of the certification,\n\n85\n00:05:09.425 --> 00:05:11.985\ngo right ahead, I'm not going to stop you.\n\n86\n00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:17.175\nHowever, objects when you're talking\nfiles inside of this credential and\n\n87\n00:05:17.175 --> 00:05:20.890\nyou're talking about the cloud\nthat could very easily,\n\n88\n00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.428\nit's a very easily\ntranslatable file object.\n\n89\n00:05:24.428 --> 00:05:31.260\nSo you can have stuff stored in that\nformat, instead of being stored\n\n90\n00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.640\nin an actual volume that's spread across\nplaces, you could have storage someplace,\n\n91\n00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.260\nwhere it's just in those\nindividual objects like that.\n\n92\n00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.020\nYou can do that.\n\n93\n00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.000\nThat's entirely possible.\n\n94\n00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.320\nSo that's just one potential option for\nyou.\n\n95\n00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.760\nI would think stuff like when we're\ntalking individual objects like that,\n\n96\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.730\nI always wanna go for better or\nfor worse, think about a database.\n\n97\n00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.480\nYou know cuz a database will qualify.\n\n98\n00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.900\nYou know as that, not necessarily\nwhen you think about a data base,\n\n99\n00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.705\nat the physical level, I'm not talking\nwithin the data base, when I think of\n\n100\n00:06:05.705 --> 00:06:10.585\na database, even though there might\nbe multiple transaction logs and\n\n101\n00:06:10.585 --> 00:06:14.735\nstuff associated with that database,\nI'm really thinking about those individual\n\n102\n00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:18.645\nfiles, or in this case, objects that\nare being stored out there on the cloud.\n\n103\n00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:22.025\nSo more or less can think about\nsomething like that, that you have\n\n104\n00:06:22.025 --> 00:06:26.535\nsome sort of databasing application\nthat's doing that sort of thing.\n\n105\n00:06:26.535 --> 00:06:29.289\nSo you'd have that.\n\n106\n00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.340\nSo those are some of the big\nones that deal with both,\n\n107\n00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.960\nwe're seeing both the logical side and\nthe virtual side.\n\n108\n00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.590\nAnd we also see the raw stuff,\nthe raw stuff looks physical and we see\n\n109\n00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:49.000\nthe volume and object, which is virtual\nstuff, it's getting in the virtual area.\n\n110\n00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.730\nThere are other things that\nyou can have in place.\n\n111\n00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:58.070\nJust keep in mind by the way terminology\nthat you may be using here, and\n\n112\n00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.890\nthis is the way they actually\nbreak it down the exam.\n\n113\n00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.880\nIf you're talking about infrastructure\nas a service, software as a service,\n\n114\n00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.630\nplatform as a service, they can throw\ndifferent terminology at you, you know?\n\n115\n00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.900\nJust in case it wasn't difficult\nenough for you as it is.\n\n116\n00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.810\nSo they also associate with infrastructure\nas a service which raw volume and\n\n117\n00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.850\nobject storage are all\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n118\n00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.190\nWe also have something they call\na content delivery network, and\n\n119\n00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:29.210\njust kind of to give you the quick\ndescription of the way they look at it.\n\n120\n00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.690\nIt's content stored in object storage, so\n\n121\n00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:40.240\nit's stored in the file, but\nthose files are in just one place.\n\n122\n00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.980\nThey're replicated out\nto multiple locations.\n\n123\n00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.660\nYou know, so that's actually not\n\n124\n00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.070\ntoo difficult to comprehend\nreally when you look at it.\n\n125\n00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.825\nIf you think of something like a bank,\n\n126\n00:07:51.825 --> 00:07:57.260\ncuz I know some banks do this, in fact\na lot of the the bigger banks do this.\n\n127\n00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:02.080\nYou think of something like, here in the\nUS, think of something like a Wells Fargo.\n\n128\n00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.020\nA Wells Fargo because they are a huge bank\nand have their hands in a lot of stuff and\n\n129\n00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.670\nhave a lot of customers, they need to make\nsure that their stuff is always available.\n\n130\n00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:17.770\nSo they could conceivably have\na cloud set up where that cloud\n\n131\n00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:22.440\nis distributed over different regions and\nthey have the data replicated so\n\n132\n00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.270\nthey have stuff, if they were talking\nabout just here in the US, they have\n\n133\n00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:30.430\na cloud setup where there's data being\nhosted on the west coast, the midwest,\n\n134\n00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.640\nand the east coast, so they've got it\ndistributed between those three locations.\n\n135\n00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.120\nIt's the same content and\nit's synchronized, but\n\n136\n00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.240\nit's being hosted across those things so\nthey have a content delivery situation.\n\n137\n00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.480\nSo it's geographically dispersed for\nsafety reasons and\n\n138\n00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.130\nredundancy you could definitely\ndo that with the cloud and\n\n139\n00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:53.080\nthat would actually both increase your\nability to recover from a disaster, so\n\n140\n00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.410\nyou have a higher availability factor and\nthen you also have,\n\n141\n00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:01.080\npotentially have better\nbandwidth in response of this.\n\n142\n00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.600\nIf you're here on the east coast and\nyou have to go all the way out to the west\n\n143\n00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.410\ncoast to access something,\nthat would work and\n\n144\n00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:16.140\nit would be fairly responsive depending\non what connectivity you had.\n\n145\n00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.960\nBut it would be better,\ntheoretically it'd be better of course,\n\n146\n00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.680\nif you had a data center here, with that\ndata replicator could go to that location\n\n147\n00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.120\ninstead and\ngive you better response of this.\n\n148\n00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:30.660\nSo that would be another way of doing it.\n\n149\n00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:35.000\nSo that's just infrastructure as\na service if you can believe it.\n\n150\n00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.750\nJust those areas,\nthat's how they break it out.\n\n151\n00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:43.190\nBut there are other ways, just to kind\nof put it out there as far as seeing\n\n152\n00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.415\nthe other logical and\nphysical storage options.\n\n153\n00:09:46.415 --> 00:09:49.780\nPlatform-as-service, if\nyou're talking that.\n\n154\n00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.680\nYou've got databases,\n\n155\n00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.910\nthat's where they really start talking\nabout databases pretty heavily.\n\n156\n00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.510\nThey're giving you a place to host that.\n\n157\n00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:03.030\nThey're giving you ways to store\nyour actual application itself.\n\n158\n00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.840\nInstead of just the actual data now\nwe're shoving the application up there.\n\n159\n00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.584\nAnd that's a different type of storage\nthat's specifically called the application\n\n160\n00:10:10.584 --> 00:10:13.500\nstorage, hey they actually use\na straightforward name for once.\n\n161\n00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.720\n>> Nice.\n\n162\n00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.660\n>> Go figure!\n\n163\n00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.530\nLook for that to change,\n\n164\n00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.920\nthey'll fix that in the next release\nto do something really crazy.\n\n165\n00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.070\nSo you've got that\nplatform as a service and\n\n166\n00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:27.330\nthen you can just keep going\nup on other things as well.\n\n167\n00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.220\nYou can have stuff like\ndata warehousing and\n\n168\n00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.790\nall that being brought in when we\nstart talking platform as a service.\n\n169\n00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.490\nAnd software as a service does\nhave some stuff that goes with it.\n\n170\n00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.950\nI look at some of the stuff\nthat they describe it as.\n\n171\n00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.390\nThey describe software as\na service as information and\n\n172\n00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:50.330\nstorage management in content and\nfile storage, they kind of look that as\n\n173\n00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:55.940\neverything else is thrown over there,\nso what does this mean to you?\n\n174\n00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:00.320\nWhat this means to you when you\nare planning your cloud solution,\n\n175\n00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.820\nyou need to really think about what\nformat you're going to be storing your\n\n176\n00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:11.020\ninformation and what's most economical to\nyou and what's most practical for you.\n\n177\n00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:16.710\nIf you're talking a database,\nwhat format's the database going in?\n\n178\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:18.850\nIs it going on an infrastructure solution?\n\n179\n00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.040\nIs it going on a platform solution?\n\n180\n00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.190\nAre you going to store it in a raw format?\n\n181\n00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.090\nNow in this case,\nstoring in a private cloud,\n\n182\n00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:32.130\nis it gonna be in a virtual format\nsomewhere sitting out in the public space?\n\n183\n00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:39.220\nDo you need to add that resiliency\nin the content distribution network?\n\n184\n00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.100\nYou could have that type\nof situation in place.\n\n185\n00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:48.669\nIn fact, if you're talking a large enough\ncloud, public or private, both situations\n\n186\n00:11:48.669 --> 00:11:54.550\nmight necessitate that you have some\nsort of geographic redundancy in there.\n\n187\n00:11:54.550 --> 00:12:01.437\nI used Wells Fargo as an example,\na bank like Wells Fargo,\n\n188\n00:12:01.437 --> 00:12:07.920\nif they've got a big enough,\nit's a private entity.\n\n189\n00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:13.140\nSo they've got their own data centers and\nstuff like that.\n\n190\n00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:18.590\nThey have a private cloud, but\nthat private cloud because they are so\n\n191\n00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:23.190\nlarge does have a situation where they\nhave, that they would need to have\n\n192\n00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:27.160\na cloud that's geographically dispersed,\neven though they're hosting it privately\n\n193\n00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.500\nthey have stuff set up in there so\nit's got that redundancy and\n\n194\n00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.610\nall that built into it by having\nstuff distributed certain ways.\n\n195\n00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.040\nBut, you can do it with the public too.\n\n196\n00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.590\nIf you're doing it with the public cloud,\nyou would need to\n\n197\n00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:43.000\nask more questions of your provider,\nbecause you don't have hands on in that.\n\n198\n00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.620\nYou're gonna need to put\na requirement in place saying,\n\n199\n00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:51.870\nthat I as the consumer of this\nis the client, I can not be, I\n\n200\n00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:57.550\ncan not afford any down time, I'm gonna be\nhosting a certain type of critical data.\n\n201\n00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:02.320\nSo, what I need you to offer me and\nprovide to me is the ability to say,\n\n202\n00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.060\nwell, I'm gonna host my data here,\nhere, and here.\n\n203\n00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:11.430\nAnd if this goes down, I can easily roll\npeople over to these guys, or vise versa.\n\n204\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.550\n>> And then I think sometimes\nthe physical location also,\n\n205\n00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:16.782\nwe have to think about where\nour customers are coming from.\n\n206\n00:13:16.782 --> 00:13:19.450\nLike we might want someday\nto store it here in the US,\n\n207\n00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.880\nsame data stored over in Europe gives\na little bit of fault tolerance, but\n\n208\n00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.940\nprimarily the reason we're doing it is\nbecause access times are gonna be better.\n\n209\n00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.330\n>> Yeah, that would be exactly one of\nthe reasons why you'd wanna do something\n\n210\n00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:30.870\nlike that.\n\n211\n00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.450\nIt wouldnt' be practical to say,\nyeah, if you were talking again,\n\n212\n00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:38.739\nlike a bank, like I was talking about.\n\n213\n00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.260\nYou look at them.\n\n214\n00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:43.850\nLet's just say for kicks.\n\n215\n00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:49.050\nI use a bank like Wells Fargo cuz I know\nexactly where their headquarters are.\n\n216\n00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.250\nIt's right in the Bay area\nthat's where they started.\n\n217\n00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:58.310\nSo being from the Bay area and living\nthere it's the one I normally default to.\n\n218\n00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:02.915\nBut you look at that situation,\nthink about the fact that if that bank was\n\n219\n00:14:02.915 --> 00:14:07.824\ngonna, had all their stuff centered\nright there, and they have customers,\n\n220\n00:14:07.824 --> 00:14:13.130\nthey do all sorts of investments, and\neverything else, and that gonna be global.\n\n221\n00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:16.649\nThey're going to have someone from Europe\nlike you said accessing stuff all the way\n\n222\n00:14:16.649 --> 00:14:17.910\nin San Francisco?\n\n223\n00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.720\nThat's just not practical,\nthat's not going to work.\n\n224\n00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.836\nSo they would want to have that cloud\ndistributed to make it more optimal\n\n225\n00:14:26.836 --> 00:14:31.530\nresponse times but think about\nthe complexities that go with that\n\n226\n00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:36.730\nbecause when you look at it, we,\nbecause you bring up a very interesting\n\n227\n00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:42.050\nscenario there because when you go\nto Europe it's response times, yes.\n\n228\n00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.224\nNow you have a situation where\nyou have the data that's\n\n229\n00:14:45.224 --> 00:14:46.880\nbeing hosted here in the US.\n\n230\n00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.321\nNow you gotta figure a way, even if\nit's just San Francisco at that point,\n\n231\n00:14:51.321 --> 00:14:54.353\nif you want to have it some\nplace in Germany, well,\n\n232\n00:14:54.353 --> 00:14:59.170\nyou gotta figure out a way within\nthat cloud to have that replicate.\n\n233\n00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:03.863\nSo that brings in something that you need\nto make sure your search providers capable\n\n234\n00:15:03.863 --> 00:15:05.250\nof doing for you.\n\n235\n00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:09.490\nAnd then there's an additional thing to\nit, which you know wasn't the original\n\n236\n00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:14.620\nintention on this, but\nit does bring it into this whole thing,\n\n237\n00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.240\nis that if you have stuff\nhere in the in the U.S.\n\n238\n00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:23.960\nand you have over in Germany, that may\nbe a question on what can be replicated.\n\n239\n00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.420\nSo now that brings another question\non what can be moved back and\n\n240\n00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.385\nforth and how it's maintained.\n\n241\n00:15:30.385 --> 00:15:33.158\nCuz there may be different\nstandards in place, and,\n\n242\n00:15:33.158 --> 00:15:35.510\nthat you actually need\nto take into account.\n\n243\n00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:39.572\nSo you can see when you're storing\ninformation, it's not just a matter of\n\n244\n00:15:39.572 --> 00:15:43.130\nshoving the information up there and\nhaving it hosted wherever.\n\n245\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:48.380\nIt's a question of well, there could be\nother little details that come into play,\n\n246\n00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:52.670\nwhat I replicate, how often I\nreplicate and just so on and so forth.\n\n247\n00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.743\n>> And\ncompliance probably comes into play,\n\n248\n00:15:54.743 --> 00:15:57.170\ndifferent regulations\nin different countries.\n\n249\n00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:03.120\n>> Absolutely, absolutely,\nit would add on other stuff onto that.\n\n250\n00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.510\nYou could keep adding on all\nsorts of factors to this,\n\n251\n00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:11.870\nit's a really good, it can be a really\ncomplex, really interesting and\n\n252\n00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.710\nI'm being nice about that,\nbe an interesting area to get into.\n\n253\n00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.660\n>> All right, very good.\n\n254\n00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.420\nWell, Sean, a lot of good information\nthere about our storage locations.\n\n255\n00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.189\nAnything else we need to talk\nabout before we wrap this one up?\n\n256\n00:16:24.366 --> 00:16:28.940\n>> I would, yeah to add on to this,\nI would just to emphasis,\n\n257\n00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:33.890\nremember when we talked in our\nearlier episodes, we talked about\n\n258\n00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:38.840\nplatform as a service, infrastructure\nas a service, software as a service,\n\n259\n00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:44.600\nremember it's not just raw volume,\nobject in content delivery and all.\n\n260\n00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.350\nIt's not the same terminology\nacross all of them.\n\n261\n00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.660\nEvery one of those things has their\nown terminology they go through.\n\n262\n00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:54.400\nThey didn't wanna make it simple on you,\nand they decided there's different things.\n\n263\n00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.695\nAnd realistically they couldn't make it\nthe same thing across all of them cuz one\n\n264\n00:16:57.695 --> 00:16:59.415\nof them just provides\nyou the ability to say,\n\n265\n00:16:59.415 --> 00:17:02.685\nokay, I'm taking this and\nputting it out there in the cloud.\n\n266\n00:17:02.685 --> 00:17:06.515\nAnother one's talking about an application\nworking with it, and consuming it.\n\n267\n00:17:06.515 --> 00:17:09.265\nAnd then even putting\nthe application hosted up there.\n\n268\n00:17:09.265 --> 00:17:12.795\nYou know so there's different\ncombinations hence different terms.\n\n269\n00:17:12.795 --> 00:17:16.367\nSo what you're gonna need to do if\nyou're going forward into the exam,\n\n270\n00:17:16.367 --> 00:17:20.545\nis make sure that you're familiar with\nthe terminology associated with each one.\n\n271\n00:17:20.545 --> 00:17:24.715\nI should be able to from here on out,\nbe able to say raw storage and\n\n272\n00:17:24.715 --> 00:17:29.349\nyou should be able to know which one\nof those services it associates with\n\n273\n00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:34.465\nbecause that's what they'll look for\nif you're gonna be sitting this exam.\n\n274\n00:17:34.465 --> 00:17:37.280\n>> Very good,\nall right well lots of good info Sean.\n\n275\n00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.970\nThat wraps up another episode\nhere though at ITProTV, so\n\n276\n00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.150\nI hope you guys enjoyed watching.\n\n277\n00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.850\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n278\n00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:44.650\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n279\n00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:45.840\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n280\n00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:52.344\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:13.809\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:15.892\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:21.270\nAnd in this episode we're gonna be talking\nabout data loss prevention, right, Sean?\n\n6\n00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.430\n>> Yeah, that's indeed what we are talking\nabout is data loss prevention or\n\n7\n00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.080\nDLP for short.\n\n8\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.400\nIt's a very common thing to concern\nyourself with in the IT industry.\n\n9\n00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.078\nYou never wanna lose data.\n\n10\n00:00:35.078 --> 00:00:36.382\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well I hope you don't.\n\n11\n00:00:36.382 --> 00:00:38.326\nIf you do you're in the wrong-\n>> There's some of that data I wouldn't\n\n12\n00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:39.688\nmind losing now and again, but-\n>> Yeah,\n\n13\n00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:42.154\nwe're not talking credit histories here.\n\n14\n00:00:42.154 --> 00:00:50.008\n[LAUGH] So we wanna avoid data being lost.\n\n15\n00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:56.003\nSo we wanna take measures to make\nsure that that data is not lost and\n\n16\n00:00:56.003 --> 00:00:58.623\nalso the data is available.\n\n17\n00:00:58.623 --> 00:01:02.360\nIt's not just a matter of it\nbeing destroyed and going away.\n\n18\n00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.230\nIt's also a matter of making sure\nthat it's there when you need it.\n\n19\n00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.890\nData can still exist out there.\n\n20\n00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.880\nBut if you don't have that\nconnectivity between it,\n\n21\n00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.110\nthen that becomes a problem as well.\n\n22\n00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.435\nSo, we're trying to make\nsure it doesn't get lost and\n\n23\n00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:20.710\nthat's also ready for us to consume and\nuse when the time comes.\n\n24\n00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.490\nSo DLP is concerned with all of that.\n\n25\n00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.490\nNow, we're just gonna get into\nsome of the low-end stuff or\n\n26\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.300\nI guess another way of looking at\nit is the high-level view of DLP,\n\n27\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.720\nbecause lots will be specific\nto platform or situation.\n\n28\n00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.310\nSo what we wanna do is we wanna talk\nabout different options we have here and\n\n29\n00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.830\nwhat impact that might make.\n\n30\n00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.880\nAnd that's also gonna bring some\ncompliance stuff into play as well.\n\n31\n00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.580\nSome of it you can\nprobably already guess but\n\n32\n00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.990\nwe'll go over it again just to\nmake sure we're all clear on that.\n\n33\n00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.190\nDLP, I mean, they don't\nnecessarily always call it that.\n\n34\n00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.660\nBut we see it probably pretty\nmuch in everything you see from\n\n35\n00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.800\nthe individual computer all the way on up,\nright?\n\n36\n00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.330\n>> Yeah,\nthat was kinda my next question was,\n\n37\n00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.450\nis there a big difference between\nworking with data loss prevention?\n\n38\n00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.490\nAnd what I would say,\nI don't wanna say a normal network,\n\n39\n00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.170\nbut a network that's contained in-house\nversus If I've moved out to the cloud,\n\n40\n00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.030\nthere's some big differences there?\n\n41\n00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.250\n>> There is gonna be some changes because\nthere could be an issue of the cloud\n\n42\n00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.312\nservice provider is doing the backup\nversus we're doing the backup.\n\n43\n00:02:29.312 --> 00:02:33.695\nYou wanna make sure that they're\ndoing there could be just\n\n44\n00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:36.300\na matter of who's handling that.\n\n45\n00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.700\nAnd don't just assume\nthat they're handling it.\n\n46\n00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.140\nYou should never, as the saying goes,\nnever assume this type of stuff.\n\n47\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.640\nThere's been cases where people have\nmoved their stuff out into the cloud and\n\n48\n00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.340\njust assumed that just like a website or\nanything else,\n\n49\n00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.720\nit's getting backed up as\na matter of due course.\n\n50\n00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.160\nIt's not a matter of due course\nthat's getting backed up.\n\n51\n00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.630\nThere are providers out there\nthat all they're responsible for\n\n52\n00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.590\nis just providing that basic stuff,\nthat shim as they call it.\n\n53\n00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.420\nAnything else above that is on you.\n\n54\n00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.183\nIf you remember from\nour previous episodes,\n\n55\n00:03:08.183 --> 00:03:12.220\nremember that we had that big [CROSSTALK]\n>> The same cloud model.\n\n56\n00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.240\n>> The reference model.\n\n57\n00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.450\nWhen we looked at that, you saw that\nas you go up higher and higher in that,\n\n58\n00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.890\ndepending on who you are,\nit's a question of who takes care of what.\n\n59\n00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.840\nIn some cases, when you look at it,\nthose extra services that the ISP says\n\n60\n00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.070\nit'll take care of, it's a matter of yeah,\nwe can take care of it but\n\n61\n00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.420\nyou have to ask us or\ntell us that you want us to do this stuff.\n\n62\n00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.320\nAnd we will add that on to the menu for\nyou so\n\n63\n00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.120\nit's something that we'll make\nsure we're handling for you.\n\n64\n00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.110\nIf you don't do that you can\nend up in a world of hurt.\n\n65\n00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.080\nAnd there's been people that\nhave ended up in that you.\n\n66\n00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.110\nYou don't wanna be in that position,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n67\n00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.959\n>> And I guess depending on the level of\nservice that we've chosen with this cloud\n\n68\n00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.632\nservice provider, it might be that\nwe're backing up the data itself, but\n\n69\n00:04:02.632 --> 00:04:05.277\nnot necessarily the server or\nthe operating system.\n\n70\n00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:07.314\nThat might be passed on to them.\n\n71\n00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:09.320\n>> Yeah,\nthat's actually a very good point.\n\n72\n00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:14.900\nYou do have to decide what needs\nto get backed up, and what\n\n73\n00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.040\ndoesn't get backed up, and what you need,\nwhat you don't need, stuff like that.\n\n74\n00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.930\nThat goes back to kind of our previous\nepisode, we're talking about different\n\n75\n00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.170\ntypes of storage,\nthe raw versus object, and all that.\n\n76\n00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.700\nThat's something that goes with that,\nis what's being stored in there.\n\n77\n00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.130\nAnd what they're gonna backup for you,\n\n78\n00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.930\nwhat you're you're gonna backup or vice\nversa, and different iterations of that.\n\n79\n00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.490\nYou need to decide, because yeah,\n\n80\n00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.270\nthey could very well backup the actual\nobjects, the actual files and\n\n81\n00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.270\nstuff like itself, but they may not back\nup anything to do with configuration or\n\n82\n00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.840\napplication because they're only\nresponsible for storing the actual data.\n\n83\n00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.970\nThey are not responsible for the\napplication cuz you didn't ask for that.\n\n84\n00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.800\nYou just asked for that one part of it.\n\n85\n00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.170\nSo if you store certain things on your end\nversus their end, then you may be stuck.\n\n86\n00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.410\nYou always wanna know ahead of\ntime what needs to be backed up.\n\n87\n00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.200\nBut that shouldn't be really\nany big surprise to anybody\n\n88\n00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.320\nthat's making that migration in the cloud.\n\n89\n00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.030\nBecause presuming if you're making that\nmigration in the cloud you do have\n\n90\n00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.570\nthat experience with IT and\nyou should be playing ahead to say oh,\n\n91\n00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.400\nthese things if I lose them, they're gonna\nhurt pretty bad for me to rebuild it.\n\n92\n00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.190\nSo I'm gonna make sure that\nthese are being backed up, so\n\n93\n00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.670\nI can restore them when and\nif the time comes.\n\n94\n00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.210\n>> All right, so what are our options\nwhen it comes to data loss prevention,\n\n95\n00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.680\nmaking sure we don't lose this.\n\n96\n00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.160\nWhat kinda options do we have?\n\n97\n00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.170\n>> Well, they're pretty much\nthe same types of options or\n\n98\n00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.820\ncategories of options that you\nhave in the traditional sense.\n\n99\n00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.860\nYou do have the straightforward,\nsimple backup where you just choose\n\n100\n00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.060\nyour backup mechanism and you put your\nstuff there in that backup media.\n\n101\n00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.850\nAnd you just have to\ndecide what the media is,\n\n102\n00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.480\nhow often it is, what's getting backed up,\nall that good stuff.\n\n103\n00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.400\nIt's something that is important for\nyou to decide ahead of time so\n\n104\n00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.030\nyou make sure that's getting up or\nbeing captured as part of those backups.\n\n105\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:15.320\nAnd now you can assign that to\nthe cloud service provider.\n\n106\n00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.220\nA lot of cloud service providers,\nit's not unheard of for\n\n107\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.260\nthem to do, give you the backup option.\n\n108\n00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.970\nBut if you need any customization outside\nof that, which may very well be the case\n\n109\n00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:29.020\nif you're building a custom solution,\nthen you're gonna have to tell them, well,\n\n110\n00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.770\nI need this additional stuff backed up,\ncan you do it?\n\n111\n00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.120\nAnd they'll tell you whether or\nnot they can.\n\n112\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.390\nYou may have to actually write\nthe scripts and everything for\n\n113\n00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.130\nit to make sure that stuff's getting\nbacked up and hand it off to them.\n\n114\n00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.268\nThere's all different variations\nthat can happen there.\n\n115\n00:06:42.268 --> 00:06:46.930\nWhat you wanna make sure is that if\nthere's any sort of compliance issues\n\n116\n00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.330\nbeing a part of this that\nyou're adhering to that.\n\n117\n00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:55.910\nThe other thing I'd factor into it\naside from media and frequency and\n\n118\n00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.580\nall that good stuff is\nthe retention period.\n\n119\n00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.950\nThat's another big, big, big part of it.\n\n120\n00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.480\nI need the stuff being retained for\nthis long.\n\n121\n00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.220\nKeep in mind, once again, if you're\nsigned into the cloud service provider,\n\n122\n00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.040\nthe question comes, well,\nI'm asking you to do this for me.\n\n123\n00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.540\nHow are you storing that stuff?\n\n124\n00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.810\nAre you storing?\n\n125\n00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.090\nAre you in the backup?\n\n126\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.840\nRemember, we talked about the term\nin a previous episode already\n\n127\n00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.830\nthat right to audit.\n\n128\n00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.640\nYou do have a right to audit to [LAUGH]\ncheck to see if they're doing this stuff.\n\n129\n00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.630\nThat very well comes under the category\nof this, to make sure this is happening.\n\n130\n00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:41.680\nBut you also wanna make sure that\nthe retention's being kept long enough.\n\n131\n00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.250\nAlso ask how long it's gonna\ntake to restore it, too.\n\n132\n00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:49.129\nSo and then another thing that's gonna\nbe part of this is what do they do\n\n133\n00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:53.512\nif those backups are going in\na separate media, or something,\n\n134\n00:07:53.512 --> 00:07:58.888\nHow are they getting rid of that when\nthe time comes, when they destroy that is\n\n135\n00:07:58.888 --> 00:08:05.380\nit a case of that if they're backing up to\ntape let's say, are they burning the tape?\n\n136\n00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.970\nI'll just throw that out randomly,\nthey're going to burn the tape.\n\n137\n00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:11.090\nIs that what's happening?\n\n138\n00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.352\nDo you have proof of that, are they gonna\nsend you certified paperwork or something?\n\n139\n00:08:14.352 --> 00:08:16.528\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Saying, yeah, we burned it,\n\n140\n00:08:16.528 --> 00:08:18.505\nshow you a picture of it on fire?\n\n141\n00:08:18.505 --> 00:08:22.659\n[LAUGH] It's gonna be a YouTube video of\nthem like, \"Hey,\" you know, doing that.\n\n142\n00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:30.200\nSo that's something that you need to\nconsider especially if you are in turn\n\n143\n00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:36.730\na company that is using the cloud as part\nof your solution, your solution as a whole\n\n144\n00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.990\nis providing something else\nto clients on your side Well,\n\n145\n00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:45.930\nyou're gonna need to take into account\nany type of compliance issues they have,\n\n146\n00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.260\nhowever long they want to keep\ndata around, what have you.\n\n147\n00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.530\nThere could be a lot of stuff\nbuilt into this whole thing that\n\n148\n00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.660\ncould really make a lot of complexities.\n\n149\n00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:59.690\nBut, for the most part,\nI would say it's reasonably fair to take\n\n150\n00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:06.100\nwhat you know about backups from\nIT already, excluding the cloud.\n\n151\n00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.670\nYou pretty much can carry\nthat stuff over to the cloud.\n\n152\n00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.930\nYeah, there are some variations,\n\n153\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:17.150\njust due to the fact that if you ask the\nCSP to do this for you, they're the ones\n\n154\n00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:20.620\nthat could very well be in control of\nthose backups, since you don't have them,\n\n155\n00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.780\nunless you're asking them to ship them\nto you or something, which is possible.\n\n156\n00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:25.800\nI mean, anything's possible.\n\n157\n00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.040\nThey could be doing that.\n\n158\n00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.680\nBut if they're hosting\nthe stuff someplace there for\n\n159\n00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:35.180\nyou, chances are they've got it someplace\nin on-site or off-site storage.\n\n160\n00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.600\nAnd you just wanna make sure\nthat's safe and sound and\n\n161\n00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.730\naccessible to you when the time comes.\n\n162\n00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.550\n>> All right, so\nwe're gonna have backup as one option.\n\n163\n00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.090\nWhat's our next option?\n\n164\n00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.980\n>> Another option,\nto be fair, is replication.\n\n165\n00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:54.370\nReplication is something that we kind of\ntalked about in the previous episode,\n\n166\n00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:58.160\nbut we didn't really use that\nterm really heavily there,\n\n167\n00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.130\nwas replication just means that\nYou're not backing stuff up\n\n168\n00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:07.940\nin the sense that you're putting it\nin our previous option with backups.\n\n169\n00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:12.550\nYou're not storing it someplace and\nkeeping your working copy live, and\n\n170\n00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.180\nkeeping something offline as your backup.\n\n171\n00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.870\nWhat you're doing is you're taking data\nthat's online and you're Replicating out.\n\n172\n00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.740\nTypically what is to be done or\ngood example where this be done rather,\n\n173\n00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.740\nwould be in that content\ndelivery mechanism.\n\n174\n00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.410\nWhere we have different geographic points,\n\n175\n00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:32.980\nwhere we are replicating data out to make\nsure their are in different locations.\n\n176\n00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.410\nSo there is that redundancy in that end.\n\n177\n00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:40.570\nSo we're very resilient in the event that\nthere is a disaster that we can say okay,\n\n178\n00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:44.720\nthis one's odd This data center or\nwhatever's offline.\n\n179\n00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.490\nWe can roll it over to wherever, and\n\n180\n00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:50.448\nthat way we direct everybody to one\nthat's still up, and you're still going.\n\n181\n00:10:50.448 --> 00:10:51.190\n>> Absolutely.\n\n182\n00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.370\nIn fact,\nthat would be the beauty with the cloud,\n\n183\n00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.930\nis that if it's set up the right way and\nyou do it,\n\n184\n00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:01.390\nthey are getting redirected, but\nit should be completely trans.\n\n185\n00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.270\nParent.\n\n186\n00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:06.990\nThey might see minor delays here and\nthere, but it should\n\n187\n00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.190\nbe completely transparent, because\nyou've got multiple locations out there.\n\n188\n00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.630\nIt says, okay, it's not here,\nit's over there.\n\n189\n00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.840\nYou just have.\nHave to figure out if yourself,\n\n190\n00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.560\nwhat's a reasonable frequency\nto replicate that stuff.\n\n191\n00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.670\nAnd how many times you need to replicate,\nor how many locations rather,\n\n192\n00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.520\nyou need to replicate it to.\n\n193\n00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.570\nIs it just something that you have it, one\nthe like, for example, on the west coast\n\n194\n00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.640\nand the east coast, or is it something\nthat you need more than that.\n\n195\n00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.770\nYou need a Midwest distribution center, or\na European distribution, or a Canadian,\n\n196\n00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.830\nwherever.\n\n197\n00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:41.690\nYou can choose to see how many places\nyou need to put that in to give you\n\n198\n00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:48.100\nthe greatest amount of uptime for the best\ncost and best overall performance.\n\n199\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:51.560\nSo that's what replication will,\nyou know, would do for you.\n\n200\n00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.780\nYou are gonna have to do\nsome good planning there\n\n201\n00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.600\nto figure out what your\ntolerable downtime is,\n\n202\n00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.340\nif you do have an amount of tolerable\ndowntime, which to me always funny.\n\n203\n00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.780\nIt's like,\nhow much downtime can you afford?\n\n204\n00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.180\nHow about none.\n\n205\n00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:08.015\n>> How about zero?\n\n206\n00:12:08.015 --> 00:12:09.700\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's always weird to say that.\n\n207\n00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.728\n>> You know, I'd really like it if\n>> Give me an hour of downtime a month\n\n208\n00:12:12.728 --> 00:12:13.431\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n209\n00:12:13.431 --> 00:12:14.225\n>> Preferably a week, but\n\n210\n00:12:14.225 --> 00:12:15.705\nif you can only give me\nan hour that's fine.\n\n211\n00:12:15.705 --> 00:12:19.082\n>> [LAUGH] And\nyou take more vacation time, so\n\n212\n00:12:19.082 --> 00:12:22.950\nlet's just say that\neverything catches fire.\n\n213\n00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.370\nSo that would be a.\n\n214\n00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.650\nIt's almost like saying,\nHow much pain can you take?\n\n215\n00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.756\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH] How much pain do you want?\n\n216\n00:12:29.756 --> 00:12:30.662\n>> [INAUDIBLE] say that.\n\n217\n00:12:30.662 --> 00:12:33.540\n[LAUGH] All right, so we got back up,\nwe got replication and\n\n218\n00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.320\nour third option would be?\n\n219\n00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.180\n>> That would be our off-site option.\n\n220\n00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:39.230\nAnd our off-site.\n\n221\n00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:42.400\nTo be fair it may not be\na stand alone option.\n\n222\n00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.390\nIt's probably something that's\ngonna be used in conjunction\n\n223\n00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.540\nwith our regular backups.\n\n224\n00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.820\nProbably everyone's familiar with\nthis that's watching this or\n\n225\n00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.320\nlistening to this as the case may be.\n\n226\n00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.670\nThey're familiar with doing off-site\nstorage because what do we do?\n\n227\n00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:06.070\nWe do our backups but we have them stored\nin one location, then we have copies\n\n228\n00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.920\nof them stored someplace else in the event\nthat this first location gets smoked for\n\n229\n00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.060\nwhatever reason, we've got another\nplace where they're being Store.\n\n230\n00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.570\nNow, they may not be as readily\naccessible in that other location,\n\n231\n00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:21.430\nbut they are in another location so\nthey are safe and sound.\n\n232\n00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.900\nAnd keep in mind there could be some\ninteresting strategies with this.\n\n233\n00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.480\nOne of the things we have with.\n\n234\n00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.670\nWith traditional deployments is\nthat when you do an offsite backup,\n\n235\n00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:34.510\nthere's gonna be some delay why those\noffsite backups are retrieved and\n\n236\n00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.860\nbrought back to wherever and restored,\n\n237\n00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.720\nbecause they have to be retrieved\nfrom wherever that happens to be.\n\n238\n00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.890\nAnd depending on how far away it is,\nand whatever processes are in place,\n\n239\n00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:51.100\nThat could take some time, and there's\nalso that idea that there's usually\n\n240\n00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:56.600\nsome sort of delay between the on-site\nbackups and off-site backups, and\n\n241\n00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:02.840\nhow frequently they're done, so those may\njust be a little bit older in some cases.\n\n242\n00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.800\nWell if you go with a big\nenough provider one\n\n243\n00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.820\nof the cool thing is they may be backing\nthem up into different locations.\n\n244\n00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.780\nSo if you get a big enough provider they\ncould have locations all over the country\n\n245\n00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:17.750\nand they could actually be replicating\nthose backups to another location So\n\n246\n00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.490\nif you have one that gets taken out and\nknocked over, well,\n\n247\n00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.720\nthey can just roll your services over\nhere, restore the backup to there, and\n\n248\n00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:29.660\nthey're back up and running in much\nquicker time, and it would still qualify.\n\n249\n00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:34.170\nAs an off site back up, because it's not\nwhere it's not in the location it was\n\n250\n00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.470\nbefore it's in some place else.\n\n251\n00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.250\nAnd so,\nyou get a much more speedy recovery.\n\n252\n00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:41.540\nWhich is pretty cool.\n\n253\n00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.940\nThat's one of the benefits of having\nsomething like this like the cloud.\n\n254\n00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:46.720\n>> All right.\nWe get\n\n255\n00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.470\nour different methodologies we can use.\n\n256\n00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:55.290\nWe do need some kind of Process, I guess,\nthat we need to develop for our data loss.\n\n257\n00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.480\n>> Yes.\n>> [LAUGH] Prevention, I should say.\n\n258\n00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.388\nWe're not developing\na process to lose data.\n\n259\n00:14:59.388 --> 00:15:01.630\n[LAUGH]\n>> Oh, I can do data loss right now.\n\n260\n00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:02.943\nI could do it all day.\n\n261\n00:15:02.943 --> 00:15:06.360\n[LAUGH]\n>> But we want to develop a process for\n\n262\n00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.880\ndata loss prevention.\n\n263\n00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.360\nYes you want to devote you want\nto have something in place.\n\n264\n00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:17.100\nNow you know we could you know really\nnitpick on this and go through\n\n265\n00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:22.960\na bunch of little details but you know\nlet me kind of give you the quick and\n\n266\n00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:27.510\neasy on that instead of digging through\neverything and you can fine tune it.\n\n267\n00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:30.350\nAs you see fit for\nyour specific deployment.\n\n268\n00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:33.480\nWhat we're really looking at is,\nwhen you talk about having a process for\n\n269\n00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:38.370\ndata loss prevention, is you need to think\nabout the overall the role that's gonna\n\n270\n00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.540\nplay, and\nkeeping your data safe and sound.\n\n271\n00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.340\nAnd what that's gonna be dictated\nby is your specific needs.\n\n272\n00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.825\nWhat I'm thinking here is,\n\n273\n00:15:47.825 --> 00:15:53.220\nI am thinking different regulations and\ncompliance issues.\n\n274\n00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.880\nBecause if you're talking about\nany one of these industries.\n\n275\n00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:02.460\nYou're talking about things like\nutilities, defense, and transportation.\n\n276\n00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.270\nAnything like that,\nthat has data that needs to be controlled,\n\n277\n00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:13.150\nneeds to be available is gonna\nhave something placed on it\n\n278\n00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:18.130\nthat says how often it needs to be backed\nup, for how long, all that good stuff.\n\n279\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:23.150\nYou're gonna need to develop a program\nthat dictates how often that's being done,\n\n280\n00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:27.670\nwhen audits are performed,\njust right across the board.\n\n281\n00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.900\nIf you think about it,\nif you just exclude the cloud,\n\n282\n00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:33.850\na lot of this process is gonna be\nthe same to what you already do.\n\n283\n00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:38.997\nIf you think about, I think of\nstuff like the grandfather-son or\n\n284\n00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:41.438\ngrandfather, father-son.\n\n285\n00:16:41.438 --> 00:16:42.285\n>> Grandfather-son, yeah.\n\n286\n00:16:42.285 --> 00:16:43.005\n>> Yeah, whatever.\n\n287\n00:16:43.005 --> 00:16:44.363\nClose enough.\n\n288\n00:16:44.363 --> 00:16:46.128\n>> The family tree, man.\n\n289\n00:16:46.128 --> 00:16:48.333\n>> Yeah, it's with family.\n\n290\n00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:49.594\nWhatever, I don't care.\n\n291\n00:16:49.594 --> 00:16:52.557\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you've got different methods that\n\n292\n00:16:52.557 --> 00:16:56.384\nyou probably already use,\nor hopefully already use.\n\n293\n00:16:56.384 --> 00:16:59.059\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In your companies now,\n\n294\n00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:03.368\nyou can pretty much migrate\na lot of those things over,\n\n295\n00:17:03.368 --> 00:17:09.680\nthe overall high level process,\ninstead of worrying about the mechanics.\n\n296\n00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.490\nYou can migrate a lot of those processes\nover in the cloud, the same way.\n\n297\n00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.850\nYou can just say okay, well I know\nhow important this stuff is and\n\n298\n00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:20.910\nhow often it needs to be backed up,\nand so on and so forth.\n\n299\n00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.170\nI just need to figure out how to do\nthat in the cloud environment to make\n\n300\n00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.145\nsure I'm getting the most bang for the\nbuck and the stuff is being taken care of.\n\n301\n00:17:27.145 --> 00:17:31.544\nCuz that's really what it comes down to,\nif you are one of those companies that's\n\n302\n00:17:31.544 --> 00:17:36.265\ndeciding, I'm building a cloud solution,\nit means you're building a cloud solution\n\n303\n00:17:36.265 --> 00:17:38.791\nand you're gonna move\nyour stuff over there.\n\n304\n00:17:38.791 --> 00:17:43.760\nYou should already know what those\nrequirements are, and just adapt to it.\n\n305\n00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.010\nI think of companies that do stuff like,\n\n306\n00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:48.602\nare moving their messaging\nover to the cloud.\n\n307\n00:17:48.602 --> 00:17:53.128\nOne of the ones I was talking\nabout with state agencies,\n\n308\n00:17:53.128 --> 00:17:58.650\nback in California we're not\nthe only ones that are doing this.\n\n309\n00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.400\nIf they are outsourcing, you know,\n\n310\n00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:04.660\nto somebody like Microsoft to say okay\nwe're not gonna host Exchange anymore.\n\n311\n00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.680\nWe're gonna let you do it and we're just\ngonna pay you to do the mailboxes for us.\n\n312\n00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:12.864\nIf that's the case, well,\nyou already had backup procedures and\n\n313\n00:18:12.864 --> 00:18:17.587\nretention procedures already developed for\nExchange when you hosted it.\n\n314\n00:18:17.587 --> 00:18:21.253\nIt's just a question of going to\nthe actual cloud service provider\n\n315\n00:18:21.253 --> 00:18:24.594\nthat's providing that software\nas a service in this case and\n\n316\n00:18:24.594 --> 00:18:27.730\nsaying this is how often\nwe need to have this done.\n\n317\n00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:33.270\nAnd they'll set that up for you or as the\ncase may be you may have in your console,\n\n318\n00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.050\njust configure it that way and it's done.\n\n319\n00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.860\nIt's just a question of\nwhere those backups go and\n\n320\n00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.340\nyou'll know that from\nyour specific situation.\n\n321\n00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.040\nSo, that's kind of the cool thing,\n\n322\n00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.949\nis that you don't have to reinvent\nthe wheel as far as the process goes.\n\n323\n00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.620\nCuz you already know what role it's\ngonna play to keep your stuff safe,\n\n324\n00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:57.850\nyou know how important it is and\nyou just have to look at that process.\n\n325\n00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:00.870\nThink about some of\nthe stuff we talked about.\n\n326\n00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:06.518\nWe talk about stuff like if you recall,\nwhen I was talking about this one agency\n\n327\n00:19:06.518 --> 00:19:12.095\nthat their CEOs and all that, when they\nleft they grabbed their hard drives.\n\n328\n00:19:12.095 --> 00:19:14.770\nThey also kept their emails too.\n\n329\n00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:19.200\nThey made sure those things were preserved\nand when they left they would just\n\n330\n00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.820\nshut down the account and\ntake an archive of all those things and\n\n331\n00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:27.430\nthat got kept too, for\na pseudo litigation hold, so tospeak.\n\n332\n00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.850\nJust in case they did have an e-discover,\nor request or something come in.\n\n333\n00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:34.730\nSo, you're getting those things preserved.\n\n334\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:37.340\nYou can do the same thing in the cloud\nwith those messaging services.\n\n335\n00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.880\nYou can set up filters to look for\ncertain people and certain keywords and\n\n336\n00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.100\nhave those things backed up.\n\n337\n00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.190\nYou already know that, just configure\nit in the cloud environment for\n\n338\n00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.250\nthat specific situation and\n\n339\n00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:53.040\njust make sure those are being captured\njust in case an audit does come or\n\n340\n00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:58.590\na litigation hold does really come down\nthe line, you have the stuff on hand.\n\n341\n00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:02.740\nDecide what the compliance\nsituation is and\n\n342\n00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.450\nthen also decide what\nyou wanna do to be safe.\n\n343\n00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:11.510\nCompanies typically will not, and to be\nfair not all of them will do it this way,\n\n344\n00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.910\nbut you don't wanna do just the bare\nminimum if you can avoid it.\n\n345\n00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.690\nYou wanna go above that,\ngive yourself some buffer there.\n\n346\n00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:22.600\nSo typically you'll say this is\nwhat the losses we have to do.\n\n347\n00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.494\nWe're just gonna build\na little more on top of that,\n\n348\n00:20:24.494 --> 00:20:26.963\njust to make sure we have some\nbreathing room and a buffer to be safe.\n\n349\n00:20:26.963 --> 00:20:28.640\n>> Nice, nice.\n\n350\n00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.690\nSo it really sounds like this\nis one of the areas where\n\n351\n00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.420\nthere's not a big difference\nbetween cloud and\n\n352\n00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:39.480\nwhat we're doing everyday, other than\nwhere the data currently resides.\n\n353\n00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.010\nAnd the fact that maybe backup a little\nless if we're doing software as a service\n\n354\n00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.740\nor something like that, we're not worried\nabout the underlying operating system,\n\n355\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:48.700\nwe don't even have to back that up.\n\n356\n00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.110\nSo we might even lighten\nour load a little bit.\n\n357\n00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.088\n>> Yeah, it definitely can\nmake it a little easier for\n\n358\n00:20:54.088 --> 00:20:57.493\nyou cuz you are offloading this and\nit does change it a bit.\n\n359\n00:20:57.493 --> 00:21:01.813\nAnd I would say probably one of\nthe the biggest takeaways from this, and\n\n360\n00:21:01.813 --> 00:21:06.925\nI've seen and heard people get caught in\nthis all the time with cloud environments,\n\n361\n00:21:06.925 --> 00:21:10.381\nis you don't ask your provider\nanything about backups,\n\n362\n00:21:10.381 --> 00:21:13.430\nyou just kind of assume\nthat it's getting done.\n\n363\n00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.250\nDon't ever assume that.\n\n364\n00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.020\nYou have to ask these questions.\n\n365\n00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.510\n>> That's what I see in\nall the commercials, Sean.\n\n366\n00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:20.690\nIf I put my data in the cloud, it's safe.\n\n367\n00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:21.620\n>> Yeah, it's safe-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n368\n00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.942\n>> It just disappears in the cloud,\n\n369\n00:21:22.942 --> 00:21:24.605\nthen it's all nice and safe and all that.\n\n370\n00:21:24.605 --> 00:21:26.519\n>> It's not always there.\n\n371\n00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:27.530\n>> You don't just wanna-\n\n372\n00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:28.399\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n373\n00:21:28.399 --> 00:21:29.154\nAnd computers never fail either.\n\n374\n00:21:29.154 --> 00:21:29.699\n>> That's right.\n\n375\n00:21:29.699 --> 00:21:34.424\n[LAUGH]\n>> Don't just think that it's being done\n\n376\n00:21:34.424 --> 00:21:39.640\nand just take it as it's\na matter of fact it's being done.\n\n377\n00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.656\nIt may very well not be getting done or\n\n378\n00:21:41.656 --> 00:21:44.142\nnot being done the way\nyou would expect it to.\n\n379\n00:21:44.142 --> 00:21:49.065\nSo definitely make sure that you trust but\nverify in this case that\n\n380\n00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:54.090\nit's being done the way you want it to,\nif it's being done at all.\n\n381\n00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.390\nThat's something that's come up again and\nagain and again.\n\n382\n00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:02.360\nYou have to ask yourself,\nhow much are they responsible for.\n\n383\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.077\nYou're doing your planning according\nto models and stuff like that,\n\n384\n00:22:05.077 --> 00:22:06.007\nthen you already know.\n\n385\n00:22:06.007 --> 00:22:10.042\nYou should already be aware of\nwhat they're responsible for and\n\n386\n00:22:10.042 --> 00:22:13.496\nwhat I'm responsible for,\nand adjust accordingly.\n\n387\n00:22:13.496 --> 00:22:18.212\n>> Yeah, it's something that I've\nalways stressed in a lot of my classes\n\n388\n00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:20.581\nI've taught is the cloud is great.\n\n389\n00:22:20.581 --> 00:22:24.663\nWe get that redundancy, we get that\nelasticity, it can bounce servers around,\n\n390\n00:22:24.663 --> 00:22:29.070\nthey can bounce storage devices around,\nthey can go from location to location.\n\n391\n00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:33.951\nThat great, we get that redundancy, but\ncorrupt data is still corrupt data, right?\n\n392\n00:22:33.951 --> 00:22:35.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Whether they're moving it from\n\n393\n00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.950\none physical machine to another or\nwhere they're hosting it.\n\n394\n00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:39.820\nIt's still corrupt data.\n\n395\n00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.760\nDeleted files are still deleted files,\nyou know?\n\n396\n00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.399\nSo, the backups don't go away, you have\nto do your backups, even in the cloud.\n\n397\n00:22:46.399 --> 00:22:50.520\n>> Yeah, you know,\nI like the fact that you bring that up,\n\n398\n00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:56.190\nbecause we talked about backup\nreplication and then off-site backups.\n\n399\n00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.790\nWe talked about all those ones.\n\n400\n00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.837\nAnd we talk about them in the context\nof them all being data loss prevention.\n\n401\n00:23:00.837 --> 00:23:03.888\nAnd when you tier back up, and\nthen you go to replication,\n\n402\n00:23:03.888 --> 00:23:08.710\nthen you hear offsite backups, it's like\nokay, well, backup, backup, replication.\n\n403\n00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.240\nWell, this must be a backup method too.\n\n404\n00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.590\nDon't jump into that trap and\nassume that that's just another backup.\n\n405\n00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:20.355\nLike you said-\n>> It's replicating corrupted data, right?\n\n406\n00:23:20.355 --> 00:23:22.210\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, if you're replicating crap,\n\n407\n00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.080\nyou gotta mirror of crap over there.\n\n408\n00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:30.300\nThat's just the way it works,\nit's like a mean joke.\n\n409\n00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:34.704\nIt's kind of a mean joke, but it's one\nthat my friends use to joke around about\n\n410\n00:23:34.704 --> 00:23:39.471\nas saying it's like going up to a set of\ntwins and going, hey, your sister's ugly.\n\n411\n00:23:39.471 --> 00:23:43.190\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] It's not cool.\n\n412\n00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.930\nIt's the same thing.\n\n413\n00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:47.930\nI make that joke.\n\n414\n00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.370\nIt's a little mean.\n\n415\n00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.438\nBut I tell you what, you'll never\nforget the value of replication and\n\n416\n00:23:52.438 --> 00:23:55.194\nwhy you don't do it because that\nwill stick in your head going,\n\n417\n00:23:55.194 --> 00:23:56.960\nwell that was mean but-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n418\n00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.144\n>> I do remember,\n\n419\n00:23:58.144 --> 00:24:02.840\n[LAUGH] why replication's not\na valid backup procedure.\n\n420\n00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.326\n>> If somebody modifies a file\nunintentionally or mischievously, or\n\n421\n00:24:07.326 --> 00:24:11.741\nas a hacker, that modified file\nreplicates right along, right?\n\n422\n00:24:11.741 --> 00:24:12.290\n>> Yep.\n>> So\n\n423\n00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.010\nthat's why those backups\nstill have to be there.\n\n424\n00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.660\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n425\n00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:18.120\n>> All right Sean, well, a lot of good\ninformation about data loss prevention.\n\n426\n00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.270\nAnything else we need to talk\nabout before we wrap this one up?\n\n427\n00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.910\n>> Just remember people,\nyou've gotta plan this out.\n\n428\n00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:28.660\nAs Mike said, it's not something\nthat's really all that different,\n\n429\n00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.670\nwe're just talking about location and\nstuff like that.\n\n430\n00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.550\nIt's not that different than\nwhat you've already done, but\n\n431\n00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.600\nit doesn't make it any less important.\n\n432\n00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:41.190\nYou have to think about how this\nis gonna be done, how often,\n\n433\n00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:44.720\nall that good stuff, and make sure it's\ngetting done, so you're all safe and\n\n434\n00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.620\nsound and don't get caught flat-footed.\n\n435\n00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:50.010\nYou do not wanna get into\na situation where oops,\n\n436\n00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:52.800\nI need a backup, and it's not there.\n\n437\n00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.470\nThat's the worst possible situation.\n\n438\n00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:59.960\nMake sure it's getting done, audit it,\nand everyone should be happy.\n\n439\n00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.485\n>> And test those backups right?\n\n440\n00:25:01.485 --> 00:25:02.960\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> That's it,\n\n441\n00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:06.460\nthat should absolutely be\npart of your audit process.\n\n442\n00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.230\n>> All right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nI hope you enjoyed watching this one.\n\n443\n00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:11.510\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n444\n00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.153\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano,

00:00:16.180\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.100\nIn this episode, we're gonna be\ntalking about protecting our data\n\n5\n00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.470\nthat we've moved out in the cloud.\n\n6\n00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.910\nAnd Sean, now we gotta go about it\na little bit differently once we move that\n\n7\n00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.650\ndata out there in the cloud, right?\n\n8\n00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.490\n>> Absolutely,\nwhen you move data to the cloud,\n\n9\n00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.890\nwe're gonna be talking about\na whole new set of issues.\n\n10\n00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.450\nSome of which we've already talked about\nfor our DLP in our previous episode, that\n\n11\n00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.480\ndata loss prevention, you know backups,\nand off-site stuff, and replication.\n\n12\n00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.270\nWe've been through that already, but\nwe have to look at something else which\n\n13\n00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.930\nis not just the availability,\nwhich is DLP deals with, but\n\n14\n00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.500\nit's also the confidentiality\nintegrity of information.\n\n15\n00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.162\nWhich in this case is gonna\nbe talking about just,\n\n16\n00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:04.240\nnot only moving it to the cloud, but also\nhow do you protect it once it gets there.\n\n17\n00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.350\nMainly, we're talking\nthe second half of that.\n\n18\n00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.460\nWe're talking about encryption,\nand keeping that safe.\n\n19\n00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.050\nEncryption sounds like, in fact I\nshouldn't even have to say it, but\n\n20\n00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.930\nencryption sounds like, hey,\nit's a straight-forward issue.\n\n21\n00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.820\nIf you do think it sounds like\na straight-forward issue.\n\n22\n00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.535\nThen you needed to mark\nyourself down a few points.\n\n23\n00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:22.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And, so-\n\n24\n00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.258\n>> They need to read your book.\n\n25\n00:01:23.258 --> 00:01:24.980\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, yeah, read my book,\n\n26\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.000\navailable at fine book stores everywhere.\n\n27\n00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.490\nSo, anyway, so what we have,\nthe first thing,\n\n28\n00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.701\ntalking about migrating data to the cloud.\n\n29\n00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:41.870\nThis should be a fairly\n\n30\n00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.040\nsimple process, and I'm not trying to\ndiscount it any, it should be a fairly\n\n31\n00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.220\nsimple process of moving stuff\ninto the cloud, for the most part.\n\n32\n00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.040\nIf you're just talking simply the data,\nit's a question of figuring out\n\n33\n00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.840\nhow that data's gonna go from your current\nenvironment over to the cloud environment.\n\n34\n00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.430\nIt was gonna entail stuff like you know,\nseeing first of all, you have it.\n\n35\n00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.370\nIf you have data you're migrating over,\nit's a question of,\n\n36\n00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.090\nfirst of all making sure you got a good\nbackup of it and got that all captured.\n\n37\n00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.640\nAnd then, planning how you're\ngonna start moving that over.\n\n38\n00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.730\nChunk by chunk or\nwholesale or what have you,\n\n39\n00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.290\nyou're gonna have to figure\nout what that process is.\n\n40\n00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.090\nNow that process,\ndepending on the application and\n\n41\n00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.150\nthe situation that you're in,\ncould be wildly different.\n\n42\n00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.310\nIt could be just a case of that you're\ncopying files over, as simple as that, and\n\n43\n00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.030\ndumping them up in the cloud.\n\n44\n00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.620\nIt could be a question of you're putting\nsomething like your database up in\n\n45\n00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.630\nthe cloud, but now you have your\nmiddleware stuff to contend with.\n\n46\n00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.630\nAnd now, you have to reconfigure that\nto tell it where that stuff is, so\n\n47\n00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.730\nthere's an additional step\nthat needs to take place.\n\n48\n00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.990\nSo you will need to account for that,\n\n49\n00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.000\nso that could go from very\nsimple to a very big and\n\n50\n00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.960\nkind of complex deal depending on\nhow lucky you are and other factors.\n\n51\n00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.890\nBut it still should be for\nthe most part, kind of like a normal\n\n52\n00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.330\nplanning of moving stuff from here to\nthere and taking all the proper steps, and\n\n53\n00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.460\nthe testing and all that,\nthat goes with it.\n\n54\n00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.170\nThe other side of it would be\nis when you're putting data in\n\n55\n00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.350\nthe cloud would be if you're\ncreating it brand new over there.\n\n56\n00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.870\nCuz that could be very\nwell be a situation.\n\n57\n00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.980\nCould be setting up an entirely\nnew application over there and\n\n58\n00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.530\nnow you gotta figure out well how we're\ngoing to build new data sets over there.\n\n59\n00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.350\nAnd then all the stuff\nthat goes with that.\n\n60\n00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.870\nThe backing up and restoring and\nthe replication, all that's gonna happen.\n\n61\n00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.210\nAnd the replication as a matter of fact\ncould happen with either situation,\n\n62\n00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.030\nbecause once you get it over there, maybe\nyou want to leverage that as a feature, so\n\n63\n00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.630\nnow that's gonna come into play.\n\n64\n00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.790\nSo there could be a wide range of\nissues once you get it over there and\n\n65\n00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.230\nthat's just being kind of at\na high level what's gonna happen.\n\n66\n00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.180\nOnce dig into it a little deeper,\ndepending on whether\n\n67\n00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.830\nyou're choosing infrastructure as\na service, platform as a service,\n\n68\n00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.260\nsoftware as a service,\nthat could also add complications to it.\n\n69\n00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.545\nIf we just focus on one of those,\nwhich is software as a service,\n\n70\n00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:27.430\nthink about what it\nwould entail if you had,\n\n71\n00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.320\nyou know I keep using messaging systems.\n\n72\n00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.505\nWhat if you had a situation where you were\nhosting Exchange locally and the powers\n\n73\n00:04:37.505 --> 00:04:43.635\nthat be decided you're gonna move your\nwhole messaging system out into the cloud.\n\n74\n00:04:43.635 --> 00:04:46.735\nNow if that's what's gonna be done and\nyou're moving, for example,\n\n75\n00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:51.940\nto a Microsoft based solution\nthat is a little easier\n\n76\n00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.260\nbecause you can move your, and easier, so\n\n77\n00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.840\nto speak, you have your current solution,\nyou have another Microsoft solution.\n\n78\n00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.730\nYou can pretty much bet that\nMicrosoft's got something in\n\n79\n00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.220\nplace already to get your\nmailboxes moved over in some\n\n80\n00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.630\nreasonably comfortable manner,\nI'm being nice.\n\n81\n00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.540\nSo we hope you can assume\nthat they're gonna move\n\n82\n00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.870\nit over in a reasonably\ncomfortable manner.\n\n83\n00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.940\nAnd who knows, you're mileage may vary,\nbut we're hoping that's that way.\n\n84\n00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.170\nBut then what happens if they're\ntrying to, if you run into a situation\n\n85\n00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:39.060\nwhere you're moving from an Exchange\ndeployment over to, let's say, Gmail.\n\n86\n00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.020\nThat could be a little trickier.\n\n87\n00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.670\nYeah, Google may have tools to help\nyou move the stuff from your current\n\n88\n00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.670\nsystem over into their Gmail system.\n\n89\n00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.530\nThey may have those tools.\n\n90\n00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.850\nThey may not have something that\nfits what your situation is exactly.\n\n91\n00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.080\nI mean who knows?\n\n92\n00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.030\nYou may be going from an old\ndeployment of Exchange\n\n93\n00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.180\nover to a newer version\nof Exchange in the cloud.\n\n94\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.856\nThe question is are the tools available\nto take you from that old version over to\n\n95\n00:06:08.856 --> 00:06:10.120\nthe new version?\n\n96\n00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.890\nI mean, heck,\nI hate to think about this situation,\n\n97\n00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.410\nbut there still are people out there\nrunning, believe it or not, Exchange 5.5.\n\n98\n00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.780\nThat shouldn't be happening,\nbut it does happen.\n\n99\n00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:25.964\nThe people I know that are running it,\nthey have a custom built solution,\n\n100\n00:06:25.964 --> 00:06:27.990\nand they can't, they just can't.\n\n101\n00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.152\nI mean, they cannot replicate\nit the same way in the current,\n\n102\n00:06:31.152 --> 00:06:36.350\nit's a secure messaging system, so\nthey don't have the same type of\n\n103\n00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.670\ncapabilities, as far as they're concerned,\nin the new versions.\n\n104\n00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.190\nThey are moving over, or\nthey maybe have moved over, at this point,\n\n105\n00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.000\nbut [LAUGH] they were still\nstuck there for awhile.\n\n106\n00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.490\nBut you're not always necessarily gonna be\nin that situation, but it could happen.\n\n107\n00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.450\nI would say if you're going from\nExchange to an old version to Exchange\n\n108\n00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.800\nto a new version of Exchange you\nprobably could find something,\n\n109\n00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.760\nbut if you start going across platforms or\nacross messaging systems,\n\n110\n00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.010\nit might become a little more complicated,\nwho knows.\n\n111\n00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:13.250\nThat could definitely start\nmuddying the waters a bit.\n\n112\n00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.645\nI don't know cc mail anybody?\n\n113\n00:07:15.645 --> 00:07:20.295\n>> [LAUGH] So a lot of planning then\nis gonna be involved in any type of\n\n114\n00:07:20.295 --> 00:07:21.995\nmigration that we do.\n\n115\n00:07:21.995 --> 00:07:23.225\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n116\n00:07:23.225 --> 00:07:27.670\nAnd just to factor in some other stuff\nthere, to kind of give a real world\n\n117\n00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:32.873\nsituation here, you've got old version of\nExchange to a new version of Exchange.\n\n118\n00:07:32.873 --> 00:07:38.212\nOkay, that aside, let's say that you\nhave something that's reasonably new,\n\n119\n00:07:38.212 --> 00:07:42.857\nor the current version, and\nyou're moving that over into the cloud.\n\n120\n00:07:42.857 --> 00:07:46.732\nWell, now you've got\nan enterprise organization\n\n121\n00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:51.518\nthat's moving a thousand plus\nmailboxes over into the cloud.\n\n122\n00:07:51.518 --> 00:07:55.810\nThat's not just simple,\nhey take this and move it over there and\n\n123\n00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.492\nI'll see you tomorrow.\n\n124\n00:07:57.492 --> 00:08:01.966\nNo, that's definitely gonna be some\nsort of phased approach happening there,\n\n125\n00:08:01.966 --> 00:08:05.056\nwhere you migrate the things in blocks,\ntest them, and\n\n126\n00:08:05.056 --> 00:08:08.381\nthen go on to the next one, or\nthe next one, or the next one.\n\n127\n00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:12.097\nBut also be prepared for rollbacks, too,\nbecause you know no matter how many times\n\n128\n00:08:12.097 --> 00:08:15.601\nyou test these things in the lab, and\nthen test each group of these mailboxes,\n\n129\n00:08:15.601 --> 00:08:19.030\nthere's gonna be something in there\nthat's gonna say op I'm not doing it.\n\n130\n00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:21.150\nAnd then you're gonna have\nto figure that one out.\n\n131\n00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:25.500\nIt happens all the time you know nothing\nreally works a 100% of the time.\n\n132\n00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.550\nSo you've gotta be prepared for that.\n\n133\n00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:29.885\nYeah if it works 100% of the time\nyou're probably not doing it right.\n\n134\n00:08:29.885 --> 00:08:30.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah so.\n\n135\n00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:34.190\nYeah it's kind of what we it's kind\nof what we have going on there.\n\n136\n00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:35.660\n>> Right.\n>> You guys know what I'm saying.\n\n137\n00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.536\n>> All right, and then how does\nencryption tie into all this then?\n\n138\n00:08:39.536 --> 00:08:41.080\nI guess we can do it at different levels?\n\n139\n00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.350\nDoes it matter where we do it, or?\n\n140\n00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:48.075\n>> You know, that brings up a lot\nof interesting things here.\n\n141\n00:08:48.075 --> 00:08:51.960\nCuz when we talk about encryption,\nencryption is going to apply to\n\n142\n00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.340\nany of our service models,\nour infrastructure, software or platform.\n\n143\n00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.850\nIt's gonna apply to any of those.\n\n144\n00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.570\nThe question we have is how\nis that gonna apply to us?\n\n145\n00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:06.890\nAnd there's a lot of things that\nare gonna merge potentially out\n\n146\n00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:13.860\nof the woodwork that you need to be\naware of to address them properly.\n\n147\n00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:19.020\nFirst of all, encryption as\nwe've said here numerous times,\n\n148\n00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.470\ntwo places that you have to worry\nabout protecting information.\n\n149\n00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:25.985\nIt's wherever it happens to be sitting and\nwherever, and when it's moving.\n\n150\n00:09:25.985 --> 00:09:29.155\nSo there's two points that you\nneed to think about, okay?\n\n151\n00:09:29.155 --> 00:09:30.265\nWe can take care of that.\n\n152\n00:09:30.265 --> 00:09:33.555\nWe have technologies now\nthat can take care of that.\n\n153\n00:09:33.555 --> 00:09:36.285\nThere's all sorts of drive\nencryption technologies,\n\n154\n00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:40.682\nthere's all sorts of VPN and IP/SEC, and\nall the encryption that goes with that.\n\n155\n00:09:40.682 --> 00:09:45.272\nWe know that, that's been done for\na long time, no question there.\n\n156\n00:09:45.272 --> 00:09:48.942\nBut where the difficulty\nstarts coming in is,\n\n157\n00:09:48.942 --> 00:09:51.942\nhow strong the encryption is going to be,\nfirst of all.\n\n158\n00:09:51.942 --> 00:09:56.362\nWhen you start looking at it,\nyou talk about compliance issues.\n\n159\n00:09:56.362 --> 00:09:59.890\nAny one of the things that we've\nmentioned in here, healthcare, finance,\n\n160\n00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:02.850\ndefense, even specific customer needs.\n\n161\n00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:07.149\nThey could all require a certain\nlevel of encryption to be in place.\n\n162\n00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:10.274\nSo that's gonna mean a type of encryption,\n\n163\n00:10:10.274 --> 00:10:14.083\nas well as certain key lengths\nare gonna be required.\n\n164\n00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:15.670\nSo you're gonna need to think about that.\n\n165\n00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.210\nYou're gonna need to think\nabout are they looking\n\n166\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.050\nat just a confidentiality information?\n\n167\n00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.870\nOr are they trying to do\nintegrity of information?\n\n168\n00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.090\nAre they trying to authentication,\nnon repudiation, what are they doing?\n\n169\n00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:29.130\nAll those things are gonna factor directly\nin to what your solution's gonna look like\n\n170\n00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.130\nand how you carry it out.\n\n171\n00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:35.700\nYou know so that's already some big\nquestions that you've got to answer.\n\n172\n00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.320\nBut then we can even step\nit up a bit even more and\n\n173\n00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.640\nsay what are some of the other things\nthat are gonna pop up for encryption?\n\n174\n00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.810\nWell, you're protecting it where it lives,\n\n175\n00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.670\nyou're protecting it when\nit moves between points.\n\n176\n00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:52.250\nSomething else that's\ngonna come into play is\n\n177\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.980\nwhat happens if you're that\nmulti-national company?\n\n178\n00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.210\nThat's becomes a really interesting\nquestion to answer because when you're\n\n179\n00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:06.970\na multi-national company, what if you're\nin a country that, this shouldn't happen,\n\n180\n00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.870\nbut it potentially could be an issue,\nwhat if you're in a country that you can't\n\n181\n00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:15.170\nuse certain types of encryption or\nit's just barred from being used there?\n\n182\n00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.670\nI would say for the most part,\ncountries that you would have a problem\n\n183\n00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.020\nwith certain levels of\nencryption outside the US.\n\n184\n00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.422\nYou probably can't do\nbusiness with them anyway.\n\n185\n00:11:25.422 --> 00:11:27.055\nIf that becomes a question for you,\n\n186\n00:11:27.055 --> 00:11:29.948\nState Department's probably\nalready asking you questions.\n\n187\n00:11:29.948 --> 00:11:33.249\nThey're probably already like,\n[SOUND] we got some questions for you.\n\n188\n00:11:33.249 --> 00:11:34.437\nWe need to talk to you.\n\n189\n00:11:34.437 --> 00:11:39.578\nBut, so that would already\ntypically be a problem for\n\n190\n00:11:39.578 --> 00:11:43.710\nyou before you even get to encryption.\n\n191\n00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:48.870\nBut there are still some situations where\ndifferent laws may come into play in\n\n192\n00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.330\nindividual countries that dictate certain\nlevels of encryption that need take place.\n\n193\n00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.240\nIt may not be illegal\nto use certain types.\n\n194\n00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:58.320\nBut you may need to use stronger or\ndiffering types of encryption there, and\n\n195\n00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.230\nthey mandate that.\n\n196\n00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:04.005\nIn which case, you'll have to be aware\nof what those are and adapt accordingly.\n\n197\n00:12:04.005 --> 00:12:05.621\nSo it's an interesting,\n\n198\n00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:09.962\nit's some very interesting points\nthat could emerge as part of this.\n\n199\n00:12:09.962 --> 00:12:17.154\nSo that's where knowing your encryption\nand how it ticks is a big deal.\n\n200\n00:12:17.154 --> 00:12:23.577\nWe did, what, a whole week on encryption\nin here in one of our ITPro courses.\n\n201\n00:12:23.577 --> 00:12:27.850\nIf you are confused about encryption or\nanything then that would be a very\n\n202\n00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:32.753\ngood resource for you to start to give you\nthe overview of how encryption works, and\n\n203\n00:12:32.753 --> 00:12:38.485\nthe different styles of it, and then, you\ncan answer these questions appropriately.\n\n204\n00:12:38.485 --> 00:12:45.197\nSo you can make sure you're using what\nyou need to in any given situation.\n\n205\n00:12:45.197 --> 00:12:47.850\n>> It seems like we've\ntalked about encryption.\n\n206\n00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:53.470\nWe know encryption gives us that\nconfidentiality, that C part of our\n\n207\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.990\nCIA triad, and originally we were talking\nabout encryption, we were talking about\n\n208\n00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.170\nkeeping it from the bad guys,\nkeeping it from unauthorized users.\n\n209\n00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:07.620\nHere, same idea, but now we're talking\nabout the classware providers themselves.\n\n210\n00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.543\nOther tenants that might be\nin a multi-tenant scenario.\n\n211\n00:13:10.543 --> 00:13:12.740\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So, still doing confidentiality but\n\n212\n00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.550\nmaybe a different person\nwe're trying to protect from,\n\n213\n00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.500\nor entity we're trying to protect from?\n\n214\n00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.735\n>> Yeah.\nOnce you start putting a face on it,\n\n215\n00:13:19.735 --> 00:13:21.264\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n216\n00:13:21.264 --> 00:13:24.613\nWe can very quickly say, and\neasily say, well, confidentiality,\n\n217\n00:13:24.613 --> 00:13:27.400\nkeeping it out of the wrong hands,\nunauthorized hands.\n\n218\n00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.180\nOkay.\nThat's the textbook answer and\n\n219\n00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.150\nthat's correct to say it that way.\n\n220\n00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.660\nBut, you're right.\n\n221\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.310\nIt's not just, it's not just as easy,\nit's not as easy as that.\n\n222\n00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.920\nYou've got to think of the other\nparties that are involved.\n\n223\n00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.932\nIt could be, and\nhopefully there's isolation between you or\n\n224\n00:13:44.932 --> 00:13:48.261\ngood isolation between you and\nthe other tenants.\n\n225\n00:13:48.261 --> 00:13:52.523\nThat's the way it's supposed to be,\nis that they provision out the cloud,\n\n226\n00:13:52.523 --> 00:13:56.649\nI should be able to have my stuff here and\nthey have their stuff over here and\n\n227\n00:13:56.649 --> 00:13:58.132\nnever shall the two meet.\n\n228\n00:13:58.132 --> 00:14:01.586\nSo that's the way it should be but\nit's always good to have\n\n229\n00:14:01.586 --> 00:14:06.970\na little bit of safeguards there, so you\ndo the appropriate level of encryption.\n\n230\n00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:11.816\nBut there's something else that comes in\nhere and with what you mentioned Mike,\n\n231\n00:14:11.816 --> 00:14:16.676\nis that when you look at this you've got\nthe cloud service provider themselves.\n\n232\n00:14:16.676 --> 00:14:19.785\nInteresting thing, because we have\nmentioned this issue in here,\n\n233\n00:14:19.785 --> 00:14:22.400\nis that not only do you have to\nworry about who they have and\n\n234\n00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.108\nwhat they might be looking at, but what\nabout something that we mentioned before\n\n235\n00:14:26.108 --> 00:14:28.091\non the legal side in\nthe case of subpoenas.\n\n236\n00:14:28.091 --> 00:14:34.070\nAnd if you are worried about ever\nlosing control of your information,\n\n237\n00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:40.149\nyou may wanna look for a company that\neither makes you hold onto the key,\n\n238\n00:14:40.149 --> 00:14:45.670\nor gives you an option of key\nescrow outside of their hands.\n\n239\n00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:49.590\nSo if they're ever served a subpoena,\nyour cloud service provider.\n\n240\n00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.370\nIf they're ever served a subpoena,\n\n241\n00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.610\nthey just can't be put in\na situation where they're told, hey,\n\n242\n00:14:55.610 --> 00:15:01.970\nwe're going an investigation on\nthis individual or this company.\n\n243\n00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.660\nWell, we wanna make sure that\nthey don't know about it.\n\n244\n00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.420\nSo you give us the information and\nyou're not allowed to tell them about it.\n\n245\n00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:13.700\nAnd so the ISP is put in a situation where\nthey have to give the key to whomever.\n\n246\n00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.360\nHave to unlock the data and their done.\n\n247\n00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.040\nThey can't tell you but\nthey're compelled to do this other stuff.\n\n248\n00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.640\nSo what you can do is say, well, there's a\nthird party out there that holds the key.\n\n249\n00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:27.940\nOr even better yet, you hold the key and\nkeep it safe and sound.\n\n250\n00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.220\nThat way, if the ISPs approach,\nthey can't compromise your data.\n\n251\n00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:36.460\nThey can give whomever\na copy of your information.\n\n252\n00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.598\nBut we know how encryption works.\n\n253\n00:15:37.598 --> 00:15:41.089\nAny encryption,\nsave really one type, can be broken,\n\n254\n00:15:41.089 --> 00:15:45.190\nit's just a question of if it's broken,\nhow long would it take?\n\n255\n00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:50.266\nSo if you use strong enough encryption,\nlike AES-256 or something like that,\n\n256\n00:15:50.266 --> 00:15:54.919\nit's gonna take really anybody a good\namount of time to crunch on and break.\n\n257\n00:15:54.919 --> 00:15:58.260\nAnd you're talking people with super\ncomputers, gonna take a long time for\n\n258\n00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.052\nthem to break it.\n\n259\n00:15:59.052 --> 00:16:05.043\nSo if you keep the encryption key,\nwhat's their only recourse?\n\n260\n00:16:05.043 --> 00:16:10.680\nIt's to come to you and say, subpoena you,\nand say, hey, we need the key.\n\n261\n00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:14.310\nIn which case you still have to\ngive them the key at that point, or\n\n262\n00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.262\nyour lawyer's gonna argue whether or\nnot that will happen.\n\n263\n00:16:16.262 --> 00:16:18.029\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's something else.\n\n264\n00:16:18.029 --> 00:16:20.590\nBut, you're still gonna have notification.\n\n265\n00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:25.130\nOn if that data's being accessed\nby someone other than yourself,\n\n266\n00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:28.060\nwhich is ultimately what\nyou're looking for.\n\n267\n00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.270\nIf someone's accessing your information,\n\n268\n00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:34.770\nyou wanna make sure that they're either\nauthorized or you have knowledge of it.\n\n269\n00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:39.550\nI don't wanna be in a situation\nwhere my Clients are saying, well,\n\n270\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.200\nare you the only one\nwith access to my data?\n\n271\n00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.710\nAnd I'm kinda like,\nyeah, as far as I know.\n\n272\n00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:44.908\nNot a good answer.\n\n273\n00:16:44.908 --> 00:16:48.040\n>> [LAUGH] All right, and\nthen we've talked a couple times here,\n\n274\n00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.500\nwe move databases up there in the cloud,\n\n275\n00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.070\nand that brings up some other points\nthat we gotta pay attention to.\n\n276\n00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:58.410\n>> Yes, that kinda circles back\naround to the auditing and\n\n277\n00:16:58.410 --> 00:16:59.740\nmonitoring side of things.\n\n278\n00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:04.000\nIs that now your systems\nmay have to change to see\n\n279\n00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.775\nhow the transactions are going\non between you and whomever.\n\n280\n00:17:07.775 --> 00:17:08.800\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n281\n00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.770\n>> You know, so\nif there is a compliance auditor check or\n\n282\n00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:16.560\nyou just need to make sure that\nstopping access by anyone else,\n\n283\n00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.410\ncertain transactions are sticking, you\nhave the appropriate monitoring going on.\n\n284\n00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.980\nThat can be a case of you\nhaving solutions on your side,\n\n285\n00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:28.160\nplus their side,\nstuff at the application level.\n\n286\n00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.020\nYou can have all those things in place.\n\n287\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.770\nThe thing is, what you're trying to do is,\nyou're trying to make sure you have\n\n288\n00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:37.040\na record of who's accessing your database,\nand that application.\n\n289\n00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.020\nAnd keep in mind it's not just\nthe databases in their applications,\n\n290\n00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.510\nit even includes stuff in\nthe file system level, too.\n\n291\n00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:49.190\nBecause, we could be storing just\nto borrow our term from earlier,\n\n292\n00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:53.690\nwe could be storing just a bunch of\nobjects up there without any application.\n\n293\n00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:56.060\nIt's just a big virtual storage platform.\n\n294\n00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.950\nWe're storing a bunch of objects.\n\n295\n00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:02.370\nThen if that's the case, well, what\nhappens is we wanna make sure that, hey,\n\n296\n00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.620\nif these things are getting changed or\naccessed in any way,\n\n297\n00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.690\nshape or form, we know who's doing that.\n\n298\n00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.330\n>> So we've got the ability\nto do that database activity,\n\n299\n00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:12.630\nmonitoring that, file activity monitoring.\n\n300\n00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.269\nNow is this something that we're\ngoing to have to come up with\n\n301\n00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:18.650\na solution on our own, cloud service\nproviders give this kind of thing to us?\n\n302\n00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:19.985\n>> It could be a mix.\n\n303\n00:18:19.985 --> 00:18:26.705\nIt actually could be,\nif you're just using the basic there and\n\n304\n00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:30.670\nputting your application up there,\nthen it goes to you.\n\n305\n00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:35.430\nIf you are doing a platform\nas a service type scenario or\n\n306\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:39.940\nrather software as a service scenario\nwhere they are providing that and\n\n307\n00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:45.280\nyou're just configuring it and everything,\nthen it would be more on their side.\n\n308\n00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.780\nYou're just configuring it and\nthe monitoring's going on on that side.\n\n309\n00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.850\nAnd then there could be\nadditional stuff up beyond that.\n\n310\n00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:57.130\nAnd so you kinda gotta ask yourself,\nhow is the solution kinda being built out?\n\n311\n00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.420\nIs it something that\nyou're custom building?\n\n312\n00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:02.670\nIn which case you're back to\nthat CSA reference model again.\n\n313\n00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.930\nAnd saying I'm responsible for\nthis, really the whole thing.\n\n314\n00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.750\nExcept that bottom piece.\n\n315\n00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.840\nIf I'm responsible for\nthat whole thing, then well\n\n316\n00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.130\nI'm the one obviously am responsible and\nthey have no knowledge of that for\n\n317\n00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.210\nthe most part I've been responsible for\nall the monitoring.\n\n318\n00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:23.030\nThere's still gonna be system access stuff\nthat they can give me information on,\n\n319\n00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:27.620\nbut if they have control that application\nthe database and I'm just Using it.\n\n320\n00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.340\nWell then that becomes a different\nstory because they actually host\n\n321\n00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:31.970\nthe application.\n\n322\n00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.510\nThey're responsible for\n\n323\n00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:38.540\nmore of that again it's basic security\nthat accountability side of it.\n\n324\n00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.930\nThere they're gonna have\nmore responsibility.\n\n325\n00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:44.450\nThere it's just a question of us\nconfiguring that, and that being stored.\n\n326\n00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.500\n>> There you go.\nAll right well Sean tell you what a lot\n\n327\n00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:49.540\nof things to think about you know keeping\nour data safe that cloud is not this\n\n328\n00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:54.318\nperfect safe storage solution\nthat some people try to imply.\n\n329\n00:19:54.318 --> 00:19:55.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We knew better than that anyway.\n\n330\n00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:58.290\nBut now we've Sean here to try\nto make sure we understand.\n\n331\n00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:03.350\nSo anything else in here we need to throw\nin here before we wrap this one up?\n\n332\n00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:07.020\n>> Yeah, the big thing to really\nremember here is first of all,\n\n333\n00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.400\nmake sure you understand your encryption.\n\n334\n00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.300\nBecause when you go to your providers,\nif they're offering\n\n335\n00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.810\nsomething like software as a service and\nEncryption's a part of that.\n\n336\n00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.490\nThey're just gonna tell you\nwhat options are available.\n\n337\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:24.320\nThey're gonna say,\nthese are what we have in our toolbox,\n\n338\n00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.200\nyou get to choose which one\nis most appropriate for you.\n\n339\n00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.000\nSo that requires you to understand what\nis the significance of encryption,\n\n340\n00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.320\nthe legal ramifications, and\nknow how to choose the right one.\n\n341\n00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.350\nCuz they're not gonna help you.\n\n342\n00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.950\nThey're gonna say, we offer AES,\nwe offer triple DES,\n\n343\n00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.282\nand we offer so on and so\nforth, this many key lengths.\n\n344\n00:20:43.282 --> 00:20:45.530\nYou know, it's just the way it works.\n\n345\n00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:50.030\nIt's kinda like if you look at\nMicrosoft Certificate Services, you know,\n\n346\n00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.010\nany one of you that set that up.\n\n347\n00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:54.920\nYou'll know that any platform like that,\n\n348\n00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.810\neven wireless networks,\nwould be an example.\n\n349\n00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:02.520\nMost of these systems that when they offer\nencryption, they just offer a dropdown.\n\n350\n00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.700\nYou go through and say,\nchoose it off the list and\n\n351\n00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.730\nchoose a key length off of here and\nsee you later.\n\n352\n00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:11.950\nAnd it's really kind of up to you\nto choose which one's the best.\n\n353\n00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:16.110\nYou don't always choose the strongest\nbecause that may be prohibitively\n\n354\n00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.100\nexpensive in terms of computation time.\n\n355\n00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.250\nSo you kinda gotta choose\na trade-off there.\n\n356\n00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.210\nBut you also have the legal side\ntelling you which one's the best.\n\n357\n00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.210\nSo the software will tell you,\nI've got this available.\n\n358\n00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:32.430\nJust like the service provider will\ntell you, I have these available.\n\n359\n00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:33.890\nYou have to have knowledge of that.\n\n360\n00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.410\nSo make sure that you understand\nhow encryption works,\n\n361\n00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.190\nand the significance of it to make\nsure you're choosing the right one.\n\n362\n00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:44.590\nAnd then do your research on the legal\nside to make sure everything\n\n363\n00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:49.140\nis in compliance and all the governance\nand everything else is all matching up.\n\n364\n00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:52.670\nSo that's the big important thing.\n\n365\n00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:56.310\nCloud source provider, just gonna\nmake the tools available to you.\n\n366\n00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:01.060\nIn most cases, it's up to you and even\nif their hosting software has a service,\n\n367\n00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:04.550\nit's up to you to tell them this is\nthe level of encryption I want or at least\n\n368\n00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:07.430\nconfigure that level of encryption\non the software they provide you.\n\n369\n00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.440\nJust a little safety issue there.\n\n370\n00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.210\nAs far as the data\nmigration part of it goes,\n\n371\n00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:20.170\nthat's just regular IT stuff for\nthe most part.\n\n372\n00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:23.390\nYou know, so that's kind of it.\n\n373\n00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:24.470\n>> All right, well very good Sean.\n\n374\n00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.460\nA lot of great information,\nanother great episode.\n\n375\n00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.540\nHope you guys out there enjoyed

00:00:16.467\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick,\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:20.580\nAnd today we're gonna be talking about\ngood old data storage within the cloud.\n\n5\n00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.130\nI know we've already covered a few\ndifferent topics that had to deal with\n\n6\n00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.190\nstoring data in the cloud,\nhow we needed to protect it,\n\n7\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.070\nhow we needed to back it up.\n\n8\n00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.570\nNow we got some other points we need\nto bring in or some considerations\n\n9\n00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.800\nwhen it comes to putting our data\nout there in the cloud, right Sean?\n\n10\n00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.865\nYeah this really brings\nin an interesting point,\n\n11\n00:00:37.865 --> 00:00:44.349\nwe're kinda gonna focus this episode on\none really big issue within the cloud,\n\n12\n00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:50.180\nwhich goes by the name of data\nfragmentation and/or data dispersion.\n\n13\n00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.500\nThey can use both of those terms and\n\n14\n00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.581\nthey're kind of [LAUGH]\nthey're interchangeable.\n\n15\n00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.450\nNow, just to kinda put it in context,\n\n16\n00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.710\nmost of you already know\nwhat data fragmentation is.\n\n17\n00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.741\nIf you've worked with computers for\nany length of time,\n\n18\n00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:11.210\nyou already know about the idea\nof a fragmented hard drive.\n\n19\n00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.772\nData gets broken up and\nstored wherever and back.\n\n20\n00:01:15.772 --> 00:01:19.430\nAnd then sometimes you gotta put\nthe blocks back in the right order, or\n\n21\n00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.780\nin a better order to make it\noperate in optimal fashion.\n\n22\n00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.737\nNow we translate that\nconcept over to the cloud.\n\n23\n00:01:27.737 --> 00:01:34.287\nThere's performance issues involved, but\nthere's other issues that come into play,\n\n24\n00:01:34.287 --> 00:01:38.530\nwhich can be fairly interesting\nwhen you get down to it.\n\n25\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.810\nFirst of all,\nthey don't always call it fragmentation.\n\n26\n00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.903\nThey sometimes do, like I said,\ndo call it dispersion, but\n\n27\n00:01:44.903 --> 00:01:48.710\nthere is another term that comes out,\nand they call it sharding.\n\n28\n00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.620\nSometimes you'll hear that term being\nused, they break the data into shards.\n\n29\n00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.260\nWhy, I don't know why they chose that.\n\n30\n00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.130\nSomeone just decided that sounds\nlike a good thing, whatever.\n\n31\n00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.133\n>> So is this an intentional\nthing that we're doing then?\n\n32\n00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:02.490\n>> To call it sharding?\n\n33\n00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.130\n>> No, I mean the fragmentation or\ndispersion.\n\n34\n00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.840\n>> It can be actually, it can be.\n\n35\n00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.300\nIt depends on how it's implemented.\n\n36\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.836\nAt the one level,\nwhen we talk about data fragmentation, and\n\n37\n00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:20.583\nakin to what we've had in the past\nwith traditional hard drives.\n\n38\n00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:24.872\nJust like it would with traditional\nhard drives, when data fragments,\n\n39\n00:02:24.872 --> 00:02:27.740\nit's just a natural thing that happens.\n\n40\n00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.530\nThat will occur in the cloud just\nlike it would any place else.\n\n41\n00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.250\nBecause the underlying physical stuff\nis still pretty much the same stuff.\n\n42\n00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.110\nIt's just the stuff from there\non up that is different.\n\n43\n00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.600\nSo we do get that, and\nthat would be completely unintentional.\n\n44\n00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.350\nWhat would change it is how you can\nactually break up that data into\n\n45\n00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.550\nthose fragments or shards.\n\n46\n00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.420\nShards, using that term,\nmakes it sound likes\n\n47\n00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.620\nit's a little more intentional\nthat they broke it up.\n\n48\n00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.900\nFragment, we're used to saying,\nfragmenting a hard drive sounds bad so one\n\n49\n00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.170\nof the reasons why they started using a\nterm like shard sounds a little different,\n\n50\n00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.640\nit's not a bad thing.\n\n51\n00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.820\nThey could decide to break it up like that\nin a way that makes performance better.\n\n52\n00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.639\nIf you break up your data sets into\nchunks and start handing them out, for\n\n53\n00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.985\nexample by region.\n\n54\n00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:22.997\nYour data set's broken out so one\nregion gets this, one region gets that,\n\n55\n00:03:22.997 --> 00:03:24.462\none region gets another and\n\n56\n00:03:24.462 --> 00:03:27.856\nthey get the one that's most\nrelevant to their specific area.\n\n57\n00:03:27.856 --> 00:03:30.921\nPerformance is gonna be better because\nthey don't have to go all the way out to\n\n58\n00:03:30.921 --> 00:03:32.630\nanother part of the cloud to get it.\n\n59\n00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.710\nThey're gonna access the shard\nthat's closest to them.\n\n60\n00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.450\nAnd therefore, if that shard has\na data set that's relevant to them,\n\n61\n00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.680\nit's nearby, it's gonna be\nperformance is gonna be better.\n\n62\n00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:49.950\nAnd that's what we want so that's a great\nthing that it can be entirely intentional.\n\n63\n00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.750\nHowever, you can break up data sets and\n\n64\n00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.600\ndo that sharding in a completely\nunintentional fashion.\n\n65\n00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.890\nThat could be something that you just\nreplicate it in a totally funky way,\n\n66\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.470\nyou don't think about sharding and\nbreaking it up in a practical way and\n\n67\n00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.630\nit actually starts impacting performance.\n\n68\n00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.110\nThose things can definitely happen.\n\n69\n00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.720\nSo there definitely is\na performance impact with this.\n\n70\n00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.040\nHopefully if you break it up into\nthe shards appropriately, you get\n\n71\n00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.110\ndecent performance, or better performance\nthan you would if you didn't do it.\n\n72\n00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.170\nSo that would be the first thing that\ncomes in when we talk about sharding data.\n\n73\n00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.520\nNow, that's not the only thing that comes\nwith breaking data sets up like that.\n\n74\n00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.120\nAnother thing that's gonna come\nin when you start breaking up\n\n75\n00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.560\ndata like that into shards is gonna be how\ndo you secure it when it starts breaking\n\n76\n00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.555\ninto those individual chunks and getting\ndispersed across wherever and back.\n\n77\n00:04:50.555 --> 00:04:53.670\nWell, once that happens,\ndifferent servers,\n\n78\n00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.610\ndifferent data centers,\nis the security still the same?\n\n79\n00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.720\nIs it being isolated\nthe proper way that you want?\n\n80\n00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.860\nIs that stuff being maintained?\n\n81\n00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.910\nThat's great if it is,\nhow do you verify it?\n\n82\n00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.680\nHow do you verify when those data\nsets are getting moved around and\n\n83\n00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.530\nbroken up like that,\nthat they're being replicated in a way\n\n84\n00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.218\nthat when it transits between\nthose points, that it's secure.\n\n85\n00:05:15.218 --> 00:05:19.855\nI mean, cuz there could be a lot of\nissues actually coming into play here\n\n86\n00:05:19.855 --> 00:05:21.804\nwhen this stuff is broken up.\n\n87\n00:05:21.804 --> 00:05:26.090\nSo yeah, it can be completely intentional.\n\n88\n00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.610\nAt one level can be completely intentional\nand one level it's out of your hands.\n\n89\n00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:37.750\nFor the most part, you have an option\nto do it manually or automatically.\n\n90\n00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.500\nIf it's automatic you don't get\nany choice, it just happens.\n\n91\n00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.862\nSo if it wants to fragment it and\n\n92\n00:05:43.862 --> 00:05:48.510\nif the system known the optimum weight to\nsplit stuff into blocks and distribute it.\n\n93\n00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.835\nIf it knows what the optimal\nway to do it is cuz it has\n\n94\n00:05:51.835 --> 00:05:53.515\nan algorithm that decides that.\n\n95\n00:05:53.515 --> 00:05:54.475\nIt's gonna go ahead and do it.\n\n96\n00:05:54.475 --> 00:05:56.515\nYou don't get any input, it just happens.\n\n97\n00:05:56.515 --> 00:06:02.415\nIf you think you know better than\nthe cloud system knows then,\n\n98\n00:06:02.415 --> 00:06:07.160\nif it's available, you can do a manual\ntype system where you break it up.\n\n99\n00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.560\nAnd you see examples of that.\n\n100\n00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.223\nMost of the time the cloud is gonna do\nit for you in the best way possible.\n\n101\n00:06:14.223 --> 00:06:16.647\nBecause they've kind of\ndone this before and\n\n102\n00:06:16.647 --> 00:06:19.340\nthey understand the most\noptimal ways to do this.\n\n103\n00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.168\nSo they have already\nwritten these algorithms.\n\n104\n00:06:21.168 --> 00:06:25.973\nPeople usually much smarter than us have\ngone through and thought about this and\n\n105\n00:06:25.973 --> 00:06:26.914\ntested it out.\n\n106\n00:06:26.914 --> 00:06:30.000\nBut there are those people\nthat do know better,\n\n107\n00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.820\nand you can choose to take\nmatters into your own hands.\n\n108\n00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.530\nI think of stuff just to kind of maybe\nrelate it back to something that we may\n\n109\n00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.880\nhave worked with here,\na lot of you may have worked with,\n\n110\n00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.950\nwould be something like\nreplication in Active Directory.\n\n111\n00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.680\nI would kinda liken it to that.\n\n112\n00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.050\nIf you look at just, and\n\n113\n00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.480\nI'll talk just the intrasite\nreplication in Active Directory.\n\n114\n00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.990\nIf you want, you can adjust that.\n\n115\n00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.250\nYou can monkey with that all you want.\n\n116\n00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.950\nBut you typically don't have to.\n\n117\n00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.700\nMicrosoft has taken care of that and\noptimized all the algorithms for\n\n118\n00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.810\nthat to do it in the best\npossible fashion.\n\n119\n00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.932\nBut if you decide that you really want\nto adjust what replicates to what and\n\n120\n00:07:10.932 --> 00:07:12.675\nall that stuff, you can do it.\n\n121\n00:07:12.675 --> 00:07:17.235\nBut there's very few people that I\nknow of myself that really get in and\n\n122\n00:07:17.235 --> 00:07:19.950\nstart rolling up their sleeves and do it.\n\n123\n00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.520\nI can say there's probably,\nin the last maybe eight years, I know of,\n\n124\n00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.665\nmaybe eight, ten years,\nI know of one person that did it and\n\n125\n00:07:27.665 --> 00:07:31.275\nthey were kind of, hm,\nit didn't really have to.\n\n126\n00:07:31.275 --> 00:07:33.625\nSo that'd be the same case with the cloud.\n\n127\n00:07:33.625 --> 00:07:39.325\nThe cloud typically,\nif you are hosting software up there,\n\n128\n00:07:40.405 --> 00:07:44.545\nor buying software as a service from them\nrather, they've got that taken care of.\n\n129\n00:07:44.545 --> 00:07:48.370\nYou don't even have to worry about it for\nthe most part, if at all.\n\n130\n00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.330\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n131\n00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:53.340\n>> If you are doing your\nown custom application and\n\n132\n00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.120\nyou are worried about the application\nlevel stuff, and when it shards it up like\n\n133\n00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.820\nthat instead of the fragmentation\nat the actual physical level.\n\n134\n00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.833\nIf you're worried about that sharding\nthere or it needs to be done a certain\n\n135\n00:08:05.833 --> 00:08:09.910\nway, then you are gonna need to roll\nyour sleeves up, get your hands dirty,\n\n136\n00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.013\nand make it happen.\n\n137\n00:08:11.013 --> 00:08:16.623\nBecause that platform isn't gonna know\nabout it cuz it's your application,\n\n138\n00:08:16.623 --> 00:08:19.760\nyour situation, your environment.\n\n139\n00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.240\nYou need to make that happen\nthe way you want to have it happen.\n\n140\n00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.910\n>> And then I guess a private cloud,\nif you're hosting it yourself,\n\n141\n00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:29.900\nkinda the same idea cuz there's\nnobody doing it for you.\n\n142\n00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.350\n>> Yeah, no one's gonna do it for you.\n\n143\n00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:35.230\nIt's you and you alone so\nyou're the one that gets to try it out.\n\n144\n00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.930\nAnd that can actually be one\nof the tricky parts of it.\n\n145\n00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:43.230\nBecause if you have a complex enough cloud\nsolution that you've built privately,\n\n146\n00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.355\nthen you're gonna have to come up with\nsome of these algorithms yourself.\n\n147\n00:08:46.355 --> 00:08:49.610\nPotentially gonna have to come\nup some of them yourself.\n\n148\n00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:50.925\nIt's not unheard of for\n\n149\n00:08:50.925 --> 00:08:55.001\nsome of the software that you would get\nto set up your own cloud privately,\n\n150\n00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:58.847\ndoes have those things already built\nin for you that can optimize it.\n\n151\n00:08:58.847 --> 00:09:03.693\nAnd on top of it there is already\nguidance out there generically to\n\n152\n00:09:03.693 --> 00:09:08.448\nhelp you get you down the right\npath towards setting that up if you\n\n153\n00:09:08.448 --> 00:09:13.400\nneed to get better performance out\nof whatever your situation is.\n\n154\n00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:19.340\n>> Okay, so we've got data dispersion,\ndata fragmentation and data sharding.\n\n155\n00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.800\nWe've got new terms there.\n\n156\n00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.828\nWhat else do we need to talk\nabout with our data storage?\n\n157\n00:09:23.828 --> 00:09:29.908\n>> Well, like I said it's just\nwhen you talk about data storage\n\n158\n00:09:29.908 --> 00:09:37.546\nthis is probably the big ticket item here\nkind of to wrap this whole thing up.\n\n159\n00:09:37.546 --> 00:09:40.780\nIt's performance but\nit's also security related.\n\n160\n00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.960\nSo when you talk about those two,\nperformance is one aspect of it, so\n\n161\n00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.130\nthe security part would be yet\nanother part of it.\n\n162\n00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.860\nNow you could say they do kind of relate\ncuz availability does fit more in\n\n163\n00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.730\nthe performance side of things.\n\n164\n00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:58.520\nBut it also is definitely\na core tenet of security.\n\n165\n00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.420\nSo, when you're setting those\nthings up you kinda need to\n\n166\n00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.850\nreally put a lot of\nthought into this process.\n\n167\n00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.350\nIt can be really, really tricky.\n\n168\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.520\nIf you start looking at\nfragmenting data and\n\n169\n00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.040\ndata dispersion within the Cloud,\nyou will find lots of white papers and\n\n170\n00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.170\ntechnical data written on it with\nall the issues that come into play.\n\n171\n00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.760\nYou probably wouldn't believe the amount\nof stuff that can come into play\n\n172\n00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:26.160\nwith dispersing data into\nshards across the Cloud.\n\n173\n00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.867\nI mean there's issues, for example,\nwhen you break up data into these\n\n174\n00:10:30.867 --> 00:10:35.574\nindividual shards, there can be how\nmuch information you store within\n\n175\n00:10:35.574 --> 00:10:40.203\nan individual shard that would be able\nto allow someone to look at it and\n\n176\n00:10:40.203 --> 00:10:44.773\nsay okay, I can ascertain the rest\nof the data set that's not there.\n\n177\n00:10:44.773 --> 00:10:49.193\nYou may not want to allow that, you may\nwant to have a shard set up where people\n\n178\n00:10:49.193 --> 00:10:51.404\naccess that individual data set, but\n\n179\n00:10:51.404 --> 00:10:56.330\nthey can't ascertain off of that anything\nelse because there's not enough there.\n\n180\n00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.590\nThere's enough for them to get their\njob done, but there's not enough for\n\n181\n00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:03.010\nthem to get whatever\nelse is in that data set.\n\n182\n00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:07.840\nThat adds a whole new layer on top of\neverything we've just talked about.\n\n183\n00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.241\nIt is part of security, but\nthat's something else that's like, wow,\n\n184\n00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:14.340\nI hadn't thought about that,\nthat's now inference.\n\n185\n00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:19.640\nSo yeah, I'm securing it, making sure\nonly certain people get access to it and\n\n186\n00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.200\nit's getting the best performance and\nall that good stuff.\n\n187\n00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.120\nBut I'm putting that out there so\nthat data set's close to whoever needs it.\n\n188\n00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:31.480\nHowever, I don't want them to know what's\nover here and over here and over here.\n\n189\n00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:36.160\nThat's something that's completely\nout of their responsibility and\n\n190\n00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.116\ntheir authorization level.\n\n191\n00:11:38.116 --> 00:11:43.511\nSo how do I give them enough, but\nnot too much to give them all this stuff?\n\n192\n00:11:43.511 --> 00:11:47.800\nI mean it can start messing\nwith you pretty quickly.\n\n193\n00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.670\n>> Sounds really complex.\n\n194\n00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.150\n>> Yeah it can be, it definitely can be.\n\n195\n00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.710\nIt requires a lot of thought and\na lot of trial and\n\n196\n00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.738\nerror potentially and a lot of testing.\n\n197\n00:11:59.738 --> 00:12:06.870\nAnd there's other issues we've\ntalked about in other areas.\n\n198\n00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.960\nOne of the things I would throw into\nit would be even the legal side,\n\n199\n00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.750\nthe legal does come into this as well.\n\n200\n00:12:14.242 --> 00:12:16.380\nSharding and data dispersion and\nfragmentation,\n\n201\n00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.530\nthose are all technical stuff\nthat you're gonna take care of.\n\n202\n00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.813\nWhere the legal side comes in is,\n\n203\n00:12:21.813 --> 00:12:26.868\nwhat happens if you're breaking this\nthing into fragments, or shards,\n\n204\n00:12:26.868 --> 00:12:31.609\nwhat happens if one of those shards\ngets seized for whatever reason?\n\n205\n00:12:31.609 --> 00:12:35.611\nSo it gets taken,\nit gets seized, now what?\n\n206\n00:12:35.611 --> 00:12:42.443\n[LAUGH] You've basically got a hole in\nyour data, one of your shards is gone.\n\n207\n00:12:42.443 --> 00:12:45.957\nWhenever I say shards I think\nof either World of Warcraft or\n\n208\n00:12:45.957 --> 00:12:48.550\nthe Dark Crystal movie, one of those two.\n\n209\n00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.430\nSo [LAUGH].\n\n210\n00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.572\n>> You gotta collect all the shards so\nyou can put your data back together.\n\n211\n00:12:51.572 --> 00:12:55.109\n>> [LAUGH] Ya broke the data.\n\n212\n00:12:55.109 --> 00:13:00.780\n[LAUGH] But that's really kind of,\nin [LAUGH] in a nutshell,\n\n213\n00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:05.874\nthat's kind of the whole\nissue of data dispersion,\n\n214\n00:13:05.874 -->

00:13:16.850\n>> When's the last time you\nheard the word sharding?\n\n217\n00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:17.877\nCome on, or shards?\n\n218\n00:13:17.877 --> 00:13:20.165\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\nwell Sean, I guess that's,\n\n219\n00:13:20.165 --> 00:13:23.430\nanything else we wanna throw in\nthis one before we wrap it up?\n\n220\n00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.035\n>> I think it's interesting\nenough as it is.\n\n221\n00:13:25.035 --> 00:13:26.898\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well ladies and\n\n222\n00:13:26.898 --> 00:13:29.590\ngentleman, we hope you\nenjoyed watching this one.\n\n223\n00:13:29.590

00:00:14.610\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.480\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.521\nAnd Sean in this episode we're gonna\nbe talking about portability and\n\n6\n00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.760\ninteroperability.\n\n7\n00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.390\nCouple of big fancy words lots of i's,\nlots of t's in there, but [LAUGH].\n\n8\n00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.085\n>> Yeah.\nWe got a lot going on.\n\n9\n00:00:29.085 --> 00:00:29.960\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n10\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.520\nwe're gonna talk about portability and\ninteroperability,\n\n11\n00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.200\nwe're talking about being able to move,\nwhat, data back and forth between\n\n12\n00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.830\nour enterprise and our cloud, or\nmachines themselves, or both, or?\n\n13\n00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.910\n>> That's really all the stuff you said,\nthat's really what this deals with is\n\n14\n00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.010\ngetting information, being able to move\nit between, in this case cloud providers.\n\n15\n00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.570\nAnd being able to move it out of our\ncurrent environment, over into the cloud.\n\n16\n00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.230\nThe more portable the format it is,\nthe better it is for\n\n17\n00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.890\nus because it makes that whole\nprocess just a little easier,\n\n18\n00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.100\nof us moving it from where it\nis to where it's going to be.\n\n19\n00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.710\nBut the portability issue also addresses\nthe fact that, well, you don't ever wanna\n\n20\n00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.330\nget locked in, which is an issue that\nwe're gonna talk about later on.\n\n21\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.540\nYou don't ever wanna get locked\ninto any one service provider.\n\n22\n00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.738\nYou wanna be able to have your\nstuff in a portable format so\n\n23\n00:01:21.738 --> 00:01:24.810\nyou can move it across providers easily.\n\n24\n00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.463\nYou really, really do not want to be\nstuck in any particular situation where\n\n25\n00:01:29.463 --> 00:01:32.090\nit's kind of hard to back yourself out of.\n\n26\n00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.107\nWe first encountered it really when we\ntalked about that Jericho cloud model,\n\n27\n00:01:39.107 --> 00:01:44.010\nyou saw right on there the label,\nbeing proprietary.\n\n28\n00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.849\nThe more you shift towards being\nproprietary, the more difficult it\n\n29\n00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:52.100\ngets to get out of that format and even\nmove stuff around and adapt to change.\n\n30\n00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.347\nSo we're trying to keep it\ntowards being a more open or\n\n31\n00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:59.460\nat least a more portable format where\nwe can move back and forth and so\n\n32\n00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.634\nfortunately with the market\nthe way things are, and\n\n33\n00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:08.460\ntechnology being the way it is, is that\nit's easier to attain this portability.\n\n34\n00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.921\n>> Yeah I know most of our virtualizations\nand support they want you to use theirs or\n\n35\n00:02:12.921 --> 00:02:17.050\nthey've got converters you can get to\nmigrate a machine from one format to\n\n36\n00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.260\nthe other,\nsometimes with better success than others.\n\n37\n00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.630\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, your mileage may vary.\n\n38\n00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.060\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n39\n00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.285\n>> And I think that when you went to\nvirtualization is a really good example,\n\n40\n00:02:28.285 --> 00:02:33.427\nbecause I may be mistaken, but I think,\nyeah, there are converters but\n\n41\n00:02:33.427 --> 00:02:37.750\nthere's even a lot of them will\njust say what format is it in?\n\n42\n00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.260\nI know Virtual Boxes is like that.\n\n43\n00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.620\nYou tell it what format your drive is in,\nif you're attaching a new one, and\n\n44\n00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.470\nit will just go ahead and use it.\n\n45\n00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.440\nSo you can bring a Microsoft one in,\nor that VHD, VHDX, VDIs,\n\n46\n00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.530\nand then there's the VMware formats,\nyou can take them all\n\n47\n00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.860\nover there without even having to convert\nthem which says a lot towards portability.\n\n48\n00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.172\nI hate to say it but I can't recall\nif HyperV does that for example or\n\n49\n00:03:05.172 --> 00:03:07.260\nVMware does the same thing.\n\n50\n00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.335\n>> I haven't checked the latest version,\n\n51\n00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:15.760\nI know before you had to convert it if\nyou had one that was set up with say,\n\n52\n00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.300\nVMWare, you could convert it\nover into a HyperV based one.\n\n53\n00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.173\nAnd they've got their physical\nto virtual that you can do but\n\n54\n00:03:23.173 --> 00:03:26.850\nthey were still pretty particular but\nthey might be adding support for that.\n\n55\n00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.260\n>> So you had to convert over to their\nformat, you couldn't leave it as it is.\n\n56\n00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.800\n>> Correct.\n\n57\n00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.983\n>> Okay, well still, well at least\nthere's a way to move it back and\n\n58\n00:03:34.983 --> 00:03:40.120\nforth which still moves towards that\nportability that we're looking for.\n\n59\n00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.844\nWe don't want to get it into a format and\nbe stuck there in any way, shape, or form.\n\n60\n00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:49.660\nOr you don't want to be stuck in a format\nwhere we're going to have any sort of\n\n61\n00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.610\nsubstantial loss of\nfunctionality when we move from\n\n62\n00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.830\none situation to another\ncuz that happens a lot to.\n\n63\n00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.080\n>> Is that something we get to choose\nlike if go to a provider are we picking\n\n64\n00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.800\nwhich format we want to use, or they're\ntelling us what format that they used, and\n\n65\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.720\nwe pick our provider based\non what they're using?\n\n66\n00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.050\n>> You know, that's a really,\nreally good question.\n\n67\n00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.175\nIt's really a loaded question\nwhether you know it or not.\n\n68\n00:04:15.175 --> 00:04:16.935\nIt's a loaded question, so\nyou set me up on that one.\n\n69\n00:04:16.935 --> 00:04:18.095\n>> Uh-oh.\n[LAUGH]\n\n70\n00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:18.975\n>> Yeah so it's-\n\n71\n00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:19.774\n>> We'll be right back\n\n72\n00:04:19.774 --> 00:04:20.715\nafter these messages.\n\n73\n00:04:20.715 --> 00:04:21.697\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah\n\n74\n00:04:21.697 --> 00:04:23.145\nwe're gonna have a little discussion here.\n\n75\n00:04:23.145 --> 00:04:24.495\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n76\n00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:30.154\nit's a great question because\nit kinda somewhat goes back to,\n\n77\n00:04:30.154 --> 00:04:35.490\nor we can liken it to,\nthe CSA reference model when we talked\n\n78\n00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.747\nabout how much responsibility\ngoes to them versus us.\n\n79\n00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:43.817\nIt would be the same type of thing here,\nbecause we've talked as platform as\n\n80\n00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:46.597\na service, software as a service,\ninfrastructure as a service.\n\n81\n00:04:46.597 --> 00:04:49.270\nDepending on which one of\nthose models you go towards\n\n82\n00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.190\nis gonna dictate who is gonna\nhave the say so in that matter.\n\n83\n00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.240\nIf they're just providing\nthat basic functionality,\n\n84\n00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.840\nthat shim as they like to say,\nwell, then it's you.\n\n85\n00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.710\nIt's you doing that.\n\n86\n00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.900\nYou're hosting your stuff up there.\n\n87\n00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.670\nYou're given the ability to host it.\n\n88\n00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.274\nHowever, if you're doing\nsoftware as a service, or\n\n89\n00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:12.317\nthat infrastructure as a service port,\nwell then they have a more of a say so\n\n90\n00:05:12.317 --> 00:05:17.060\nincreasingly amounts of say so\non what formats you can and can't use.\n\n91\n00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.993\nThat's what I meant by it being a loaded\nquestion because it's not a simple answer\n\n92\n00:05:20.993 --> 00:05:24.590\nto that one, of course, you'd be\ndisappointed if it was a simple answer.\n\n93\n00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.060\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n94\n00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.775\n>> It's definitely not a simple answer to\n\n95\n00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:30.930\nthat question.\n\n96\n00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.948\nWhat you try to do to make\nthings easier is you try to,\n\n97\n00:05:33.948 --> 00:05:38.407\nwhen you go to hosting providers,\nif they're making more of that decision or\n\n98\n00:05:38.407 --> 00:05:42.181\ndriving that decision on the stuff\nthat they're providing you,\n\n99\n00:05:42.181 --> 00:05:46.778\nwhat you're looking for is them to be\nproviding some sort of service or platform\n\n100\n00:05:46.778 --> 00:05:51.373\nthat stays away from using any sort of\nproprietary formats as much as possible or\n\n101\n00:05:51.373 --> 00:05:55.610\nanything that's really really\ngonna lock you into their stuff.\n\n102\n00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.508\nI may not have an issue doing tweaks here\nand there to adjust from moving from\n\n103\n00:06:00.508 --> 00:06:05.340\none location to another but, I want\nto minimize that as much as possible.\n\n104\n00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.026\nI mean heck, if you're hosting virtual\nmachines up there in the cloud, and\n\n105\n00:06:10.026 --> 00:06:14.787\nyou have a situation like we talked about\nwhere you can move those formats, or\n\n106\n00:06:14.787 --> 00:06:19.130\nconvert quite easily between them,\nwell then, heck that's great.\n\n107\n00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.050\nCuz I can easily just tell that cloud\nprovider if I wanted, hit the road,\n\n108\n00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.583\ngo to another one, pull him from here and\nstick him over here, and\n\n109\n00:06:26.583 --> 00:06:29.460\nwe're ready to go with\nvery little downtime.\n\n110\n00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.190\nCuz, think about that too,\n\n111\n00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.540\nis that if you're moving from one\ncloud provider to another, or\n\n112\n00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.690\none hosting environment to another, you're\nchanging in some way shape or form and\n\n113\n00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.490\nyou do have to move this data back and\nforth to maintain that portability.\n\n114\n00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.570\nYou wanna have it so\nit's as easy as possible.\n\n115\n00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.850\nI mean,\nI hope you want it as easy as possible,\n\n116\n00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.000\nbecause you don't wanna have a lot of\nlittle hiccups and bumps in the road pop\n\n117\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.660\nup which are gonna slow that movement\nfrom one location to another.\n\n118\n00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.970\nSo, having something like those virtual\nmachines, having something that's\n\n119\n00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.490\nuniversally supported or you have\na really reliable way of converting,\n\n120\n00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.840\nI mean that's great if we have a tried and\ntrue tested way of doing it.\n\n121\n00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.998\nThe VMware one you were saying\nthey had that converter for it.\n\n122\n00:07:15.998 --> 00:07:20.880\nWell, I mean, heck, even though\na converter like that is saying they want\n\n123\n00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.720\nme to get into their format, well, still,\neven though they want me to get into their\n\n124\n00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.825\nformat, they have a converter\nthat the company has created,\n\n125\n00:07:28.825 --> 00:07:31.835\nhas been used countless times,\nbeen tested.\n\n126\n00:07:31.835 --> 00:07:34.685\nWe understand its reliability,\nit's documented.\n\n127\n00:07:34.685 --> 00:07:38.496\nThat makes it a lot easier than us having\nto go through and create scripts and\n\n128\n00:07:38.496 --> 00:07:40.385\ndo exports and all this crazy stuff.\n\n129\n00:07:40.385 --> 00:07:43.635\nWe've got a way of just shooting\nit right over and we're there.\n\n130\n00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:47.382\nMuch shorter migration,\nmuch easier migration.\n\n131\n00:07:47.382 --> 00:07:51.097\nSo those are things you consider\nwhen you're being portable.\n\n132\n00:07:51.097 --> 00:07:55.893\nYou try to use formats that are going\nto make that as easy as possible and\n\n133\n00:07:55.893 --> 00:08:00.060\ntry to make considerations and,\nThat's kind of really it.\n\n134\n00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.940\nYour not going be able\nto avoid it entirely.\n\n135\n00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.611\nBut you try to do as much as possible.\n\n136\n00:08:04.611 --> 00:08:07.228\nHeck, even with virtual machines.\n\n137\n00:08:07.228 --> 00:08:10.970\nVirtual machines even here just\nmoving the virtual hard drive over,\n\n138\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.090\nin whatever format it is.\n\n139\n00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.070\nMost cases you still have to,\nin fact, I can't think of\n\n140\n00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.620\nany case off the top of my head so\nit doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\n\n141\n00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:26.040\nI can't think of any situation\nwhere you can move a virtual\n\n142\n00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:31.460\ndrive from one system to another without\nhaving to create the configuration\n\n143\n00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.640\nsettings over there with the memory and\nand processors and network and all that.\n\n144\n00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.990\nI think every virtualization\nplatform you do,\n\n145\n00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.140\nyou still have to set that up even if you\nbring the hard drive from someplace else\n\n146\n00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.270\nyou have to set up those configuration\nsettings on that system itself.\n\n147\n00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.030\nSo you can't bring that over.\n\n148\n00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:46.660\nMaybe wrong.\n\n149\n00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:48.700\nI don't know if you've\nheard anything different.\n\n150\n00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.460\n>> Not as far as I know, if you bring\na drive over you're gonna create a new\n\n151\n00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:55.690\nmachine which is where you configuration\nstuff comes in and all of that.\n\n152\n00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.470\nAnd you just point it to\nan existing hard drive.\n\n153\n00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.550\nAnd I was just double checking for\nus there,\n\n154\n00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:05.270\nas still as far as System Center 2012 SP1,\nthey've got the converters.\n\n155\n00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:09.908\nThey've got the ability to do\nV to V conversions from ESX,\n\n156\n00:09:09.908 --> 00:09:14.262\nESX 4.0, 4.1, 5.1, as well as doing some,\n\n157\n00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:18.544\ndoesn't support converting\nfrom VM workstations.\n\n158\n00:09:18.544 --> 00:09:22.360\nSo it needs to be ESX, it looks like.\n\n159\n00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.340\nBut yeah, still have to convert it over\nto something that Hyper-V can manage.\n\n160\n00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.320\nAlthough, you can manage ESX services,\n\n161\n00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.700\nif I'm not mistaken, through system\ncenter if you didn't want to convert.\n\n162\n00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.497\nBut, that's another story,\nanother episode,\n\n163\n00:09:34.497 --> 00:09:36.860\nwe'll get back to what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n164\n00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.040\nSo again, it sounds like more\nquestions that I need to ask,\n\n165\n00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.360\nwe just keep adding to all that research\nthat we need to do when we're deciding to\n\n166\n00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.880\ngo to the cloud, this is another one that\nwe got to think about, if we're gonna do\n\n167\n00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.280\ninfrastructure as a service and we want to\nbuild our own virtual machines rather than\n\n168\n00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.270\njust do software where they provide\nthe machine and everything.\n\n169\n00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.100\nWe probably need to ask them what\nvirtualization they're using.\n\n170\n00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:04.235\n>> Yeah, absolutely and, in fact, so\nwe have the portability issue, but you\n\n171\n00:10:04.235 --> 00:10:08.895\nactually handed me a great opening to go\nto the other half, the interoperability.\n\n172\n00:10:08.895 --> 00:10:12.855\nFrom what you're saying,\nwe've got Hyper-V.\n\n173\n00:10:12.855 --> 00:10:18.285\nYou believe it can manage the VMware\nstuff through it, if I heard you right.\n\n174\n00:10:18.285 --> 00:10:22.025\nThat means that Interoperability.\n\n175\n00:10:22.025 --> 00:10:29.190\nThat speaks towards that situation, so\nnow if we have a hosting provider and\n\n176\n00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.430\nwe're using Hyper-V and\nthen we want to do VMware and\n\n177\n00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.190\nmaybe integrate those solutions\non a cross provider's.\n\n178\n00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.240\nNothing says you have to be in\na single cloud environment.\n\n179\n00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.082\nYou can have a lot of clouds,\nyou can have a cloudy day.\n\n180\n00:10:44.082 --> 00:10:46.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, just like we're having here.\n\n181\n00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.500\nSo you can have different\nclouds working together.\n\n182\n00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.970\nAnd because one provider may not\ngive you everything you need.\n\n183\n00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:53.970\nThat's the platform,\n\n184\n00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.500\nthis is infrastructure,\nyou're going to different services.\n\n185\n00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.540\nSo you may need interoperability.\n\n186\n00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:04.510\nSo in the case of something like\nvirtualization, heck we like it because it\n\n187\n00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.590\ngives us that portability, it gives us\nall the other benefits of virtualization.\n\n188\n00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:13.270\nBut now we have something where we\ncan simplify our management of it\n\n189\n00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:18.230\nbecause we have a tool that allows\nus to manage across platforms.\n\n190\n00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:22.560\nSo that interoperability is a big, big\nthing and actually simplifies things for\n\n191\n00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.810\nus a lot more.\n\n192\n00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.534\nSo something else that you definitely\nwanna consider in your planning is you\n\n193\n00:11:27.534 --> 00:11:30.050\nhave all these different things.\n\n194\n00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.290\nYou see if there's some way you can\n\n195\n00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:37.100\nunify them into a more consolidated\nmanagement environment.\n\n196\n00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.330\nAnd there's plenty of options for that.\n\n197\n00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.610\nIt really all depends on\nthe specific application or\n\n198\n00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.060\ndeployment your talking about.\n\n199\n00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.590\nThis is just virtualization\nwe're talking here.\n\n200\n00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.579\nIt's not the only situation where you\ncan have something that works cross\n\n201\n00:11:49.579 --> 00:11:53.305\nvendor like that, or has a control\npanel or something, or console,\n\n202\n00:11:53.305 --> 00:11:57.483\nthat you can go through and manage these\nthings in one spot instead of having to\n\n203\n00:11:57.483 --> 00:12:01.148\nopen up consoles all over the place,\nand getting all confused, and\n\n204\n00:12:01.148 --> 00:12:04.195\nhaving to navigate through\nall that nonsense.\n\n205\n00:12:04.195 --> 00:12:08.505\nSo that's really a big\nissue is inoperability, but\n\n206\n00:12:08.505 --> 00:12:11.530\nthat's at the low end inoperability.\n\n207\n00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.200\nReally when you get down to it, I know\nit's probably not what you guys wanna\n\n208\n00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.820\nhear, but\nthat's at the low end of interoperability.\n\n209\n00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:17.890\nThis is a great thing.\n\n210\n00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.700\nIf I was doing virtualization and\nI was choosing a virtualization solution,\n\n211\n00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.030\nand I was gonna integrate the cloud and\ndo all this stuff\n\n212\n00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:31.195\nI know about the portability part, but\nthen hearing what Mike just said about\n\n213\n00:12:31.195 --> 00:12:35.950\nHyper-V can manage my VMware stuff\nas well through the same console.\n\n214\n00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.130\nI'm like, that's something that's gonna-\n>> Yeah just to make sure we clarify that,\n\n215\n00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:41.940\nthe Virtual Machine Manager,\npart of the System Center Suite.\n\n216\n00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.490\n>> Okay.\n\n217\n00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.420\nI've made a mistake.\n\n218\n00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.130\n>> So if I've got a Hyper-V host and\nif I've got an ESX host,\n\n219\n00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:50.160\nor if I've got even a XenCenter,\nor XenServer from Citrix.\n\n220\n00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.480\nIf I've already got virtualization\ngoing on in those different platforms,\n\n221\n00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.905\nI can manage all those\nvirtualization servers through VMM.\n\n222\n00:12:56.905 --> 00:12:58.555\n>> Okay.\n>> Which is definitely cool.\n\n223\n00:12:58.555 --> 00:12:59.755\nIt gives us that, like you said,\n\n224\n00:12:59.755 --> 00:13:04.695\nthat interoperability where I'm not stuck\nwith using just one particular product.\n\n225\n00:13:04.695 --> 00:13:08.215\n>> Okay so yeah, so\nI had the wrong name on it, but\n\n226\n00:13:08.215 --> 00:13:13.710\nsame point on it is that you've got a\nsolution in place that's available to you,\n\n227\n00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:19.590\nit's made by a major vendor, it's a tried\nand tested solution, why not use it?\n\n228\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:24.080\nYou don't have to worry as much about\nhaving all these different management\n\n229\n00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.020\ninterfaces.\n\n230\n00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:29.470\nYou've got one there that you can\nuse to make it a lot easier for you.\n\n231\n00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.840\nSo great solution to have.\n\n232\n00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.100\n>> Now do you see companies using\nmore than one cloud provider.\n\n233\n00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.970\nLike would that be a fall tolerance thing?\n\n234\n00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.870\nAm I worried about the CSP\ngoing out completely?\n\n235\n00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:43.780\nAnd I've got another mirror on another CSP\nor is it more about like you said maybe\n\n236\n00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:47.660\nthis guy handles this region, and this\nguy handles this region type of thing.\n\n237\n00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:52.760\nI see it as you're providing different\nservices really because if you\n\n238\n00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.920\nget down to it I mean we have antivirus\nsystems that are in the cloud.\n\n239\n00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:59.810\nYou have mail servers\nthat are in the cloud.\n\n240\n00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.860\nYou've got SharePoint in the cloud.\n\n241\n00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.560\n>> And they might not all\nbe from the same provider.\n\n242\n00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:11.040\n>> Exactly, so you may be kind of getting\nall these different jigsaw puzzle pieces\n\n243\n00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.570\nand putting them together to make your own\nsolution, to mold it the way you need to.\n\n244\n00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.550\nSo that's the way I see it.\n\n245\n00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:22.290\nWhat we should be in the cloud to\ntalk about the fault tolerance and\n\n246\n00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:27.660\nstuff like that, if you're going with\na major provider I would think and\n\n247\n00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.590\nby our definition here we should\nhave a situation where the cloud\n\n248\n00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:34.080\nproviders prepare for\nfault tolerance situations.\n\n249\n00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.860\nThe fault tolerance situation that we'd be\nconcerned about is our connectivity out to\n\n250\n00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.580\nwherever, and you don't even have to worry\nabout looking at specific cloud stuff at\n\n251\n00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.690\nthat point, that goes back to your\nold network level technologies.\n\n252\n00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.810\nYou know getting your conductivity\nfrom two different vendors and\n\n253\n00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:52.600\nhaving back ups and all that.\n\n254\n00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:56.390\nThat's what would speak to that situation.\n\n255\n00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.019\nOkay and I know you got down\nhere one of my favorites.\n\n256\n00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.335\nLet me think about this.\n\n257\n00:15:02.335 --> 00:15:07.825\n[LAUGH] XAML, I've seen that name before,\nnot really sure what it means.\n\n258\n00:15:07.825 --> 00:15:10.433\n[LAUGH]\n>> That makes two of us.\n\n259\n00:15:10.433 --> 00:15:14.120\n[LAUGH] What XAML talks about here is,\n\n260\n00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.910\nit's associated with something\ncalled Federated Services.\n\n261\n00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:25.360\nIf you don't know what that is what's\nthe course number they can go to for that?\n\n262\n00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.100\n>> Google.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n263\n00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.010\n>> Security search and market like is but\n\n264\n00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:32.475\nfederation service I want to say is\ncovered in 412 so I think towards the end\n\n265\n00:15:32.475 --> 00:15:37.700\nof the mcsa and possibly in the mcse\nwe do talk about federation services.\n\n266\n00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:42.011\nAnd it is the underlying language that\nFederation Services uses when it's passing\n\n267\n00:15:42.011 --> 00:15:43.561\nthose claims back and forth.\n\n268\n00:15:43.561 --> 00:15:44.916\nAgain, if you missed that,\n\n269\n00:15:44.916 --> 00:15:47.578\nit was the security assertion\nmarkup language or SAML.\n\n270\n00:15:47.578 --> 00:15:50.457\nAnd that's about what I know about it.\n\n271\n00:15:50.457 --> 00:15:52.033\nI work with Federation Services, but\n\n272\n00:15:52.033 --> 00:15:55.194\nI don't get into the stuff that's going\non in the background a lot of times.\n\n273\n00:15:55.194 --> 00:16:00.139\nI can do this, and [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n274\n00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:04.718\n>> Well, it's like what Mike was talking\n\n275\n00:16:04.718 --> 00:16:11.588\nabout, here you got SAML as the way\n>> It's used to describe that connection.\n\n276\n00:16:11.588 --> 00:16:17.760\nIt's an XML-based format so\n\n277\n00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.420\nif you've seen XML or heck you've even\nseen HTML you've kind of got the idea\n\n278\n00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:26.970\nwith what's happening there,\nbut that's something that\n\n279\n00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.850\nITPro has a course on that already\nout there for federated service.\n\n280\n00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:35.140\nSo if you want more information on that,\nyou've got a resource for that.\n\n281\n00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:38.800\nWe can all talk about all\nthe details of it here.\n\n282\n00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.323\nGot out of that one.\n\n283\n00:16:41.323 --> 00:16:45.940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But what we're looking at here is\n\n284\n00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.730\nfederated services just to give\nyou the overview of it, is it just\n\n285\n00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:55.230\nacts as the glue that can bring\ntogether multiple services and\n\n286\n00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.490\nhave them cross authenticate\nwith one another.\n\n287\n00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:02.555\nSo if you have something like active\ndirectory, in federated services,\n\n288\n00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:04.835\nthey have active directory\nfederate services.\n\n289\n00:17:04.835 --> 00:17:08.575\nYou using active directory is\nthe core authentication mechanism.\n\n290\n00:17:08.575 --> 00:17:13.130\nThen, it can use these claims\nwith other applications and\n\n291\n00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.630\nwhat have you to you\nknow cross authenticate.\n\n292\n00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:20.060\nSo you can leverage SSO and\naccess all these other things out there.\n\n293\n00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.760\nWhich is great because it\nsimplifies things dramatically, and\n\n294\n00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.830\nyou don't have to take all those things\nthat whatever format they're in and\n\n295\n00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.360\nconsolidate them into one platform.\n\n296\n00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:34.640\nThat may not be something that's\ndesirable or heck, even feasible to do.\n\n297\n00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.970\nYou may have something that's an older\nformat or it could be something that\n\n298\n00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:44.510\nthe formats currently in, where it's\na modern format but that format and\n\n299\n00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:49.060\nplatform it's on does everything you need,\nand\n\n300\n00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:52.930\nif you take it out of that, nothing else\non the market can do the same thing.\n\n301\n00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.930\nSo you don't want to lose\nthat functionality, so\n\n302\n00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.780\nwhat you do is you leave it where it is,\nand\n\n303\n00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.830\nthen use Federate Services as that glue\nthat can join all these things together,\n\n304\n00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.350\nso you can login into Active Directory and\n\n305\n00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:12.310\nget access to whatever it is that\nyou should have access to anyway.\n\n306\n00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:15.590\nSo it's a really,\nreally powerful technology.\n\n307\n00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:18.519\nYeah it does take some doing to set up.\n\n308\n00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:20.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's why Mike and\n\n309\n00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.300\nI are sitting here going, yeah well.\n\n310\n00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.010\nIt takes a lot of effort and\na lot of know-how to set up.\n\n311\n00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:30.590\nI mean, you can know Active Directory and\nyou can know all the little details of it,\n\n312\n00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.450\nbut Federate Services does take\nrolling your sleeves up and\n\n313\n00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:35.430\nreally getting your hands dirty.\n\n314\n00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:36.670\nYou gotta know your stuff and\n\n315\n00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.840\ngotta be basically a developer\nreally to leverage that.\n\n316\n00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:45.230\n>> It's challenging to set up, but it is\na lot of fun too if you're a geek like me.\n\n317\n00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.830\nYou know one of the cool things\nis I know Microsoft provides\n\n318\n00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.840\nfederation services out there,\nso we don't actually have to.\n\n319\n00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.510\nNormally if we're talking about between\ntwo organizations, the problem is,\n\n320\n00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:58.750\nI authenticate with my domain controllers,\nbut that authentication isn't\n\n321\n00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:03.750\ntrusted by that other organization's,\nsay web app that they're running.\n\n322\n00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.095\nI hand out my token and they're like, I\ndon't know who that is that authenticated\n\n323\n00:19:07.095 --> 00:19:10.350\nyou, my domain didn't authenticate you so\nI'm not going to trust it.\n\n324\n00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.730\nSo the federation says, hey,\n\n325\n00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.540\nwe're going to trust this other\norganisation's authentication process.\n\n326\n00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:19.720\nSo when I take my token and\nI do my sign on, and I take my token and\n\n327\n00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:23.890\nI try to access their web application,\ntheir machine can pass that back and go,\n\n328\n00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.750\noh yeah, that's a company that we trust.\n\n329\n00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.350\nWe trust that their domain\ncontroller did the right thing,\n\n330\n00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.190\nverified their password and\nwe'll go ahead and\n\n331\n00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.750\naccept it rather than me having to have a\nsecond set of credentials with this other\n\n332\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.730\norganization that they have to manage and\nmaintain and things like that and\n\n333\n00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.650\nthen Microsoft provides that federation\nservices out there in the cloud for us.\n\n334\n00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.170\nSo if we're setting up,\nif our cloud is not part of our domain,\n\n335\n00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.500\nwhich, a lot of times it might be\na [COUGH] excuse me, a separate domain.\n\n336\n00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.850\nWe've got our internal\ndomain here in house and\n\n337\n00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:54.810\nthen maybe our cloud information or\nservices\n\n338\n00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:59.190\nare part of a separate domain in the same\nforest or possibly even a separate forest.\n\n339\n00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.510\nAnd If it's a separate forest, then we\ndon't have that automatic trust, and\n\n340\n00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.580\nthat's where federation can come in.\n\n341\n00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.290\nAnd we can create partners with other\nbusinesses through Microsoft where\n\n342\n00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:12.090\nwe give Microsoft our info, there's other\ncompanies giving their info to Microsoft.\n\n343\n00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:14.600\nAnd they maintain the federation services\nfor us so we don't have to deal with it,\n\n344\n00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.870\nwhich is really nice.\n\n345\n00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:20.830\nSo just another cloud technology\nthat we can take advantage of.\n\n346\n00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.560\n>> Exactly.\n\n347\n00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.520\nIt just adds so\nmuch benefit to what you're doing.\n\n348\n00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:29.390\nAnd keep in mind we're doing this\njust to give you an example with\n\n349\n00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:34.070\nFederation Services,\none of the things that Microsoft offers is\n\n350\n00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:39.330\nthe ability to host your active directory,\nyour infrastructure, out in the cloud.\n\n351\n00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.200\nThey do offer that now.\n\n352\n00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.350\nAnd so you essentially have just\nto kinda to give you the really,\n\n353\n00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:49.970\nreally high level overview of that, you\nhost just basically what I want to call\n\n354\n00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:55.250\na stub of Active Directory locally, and\nthen you push everything off to them,\n\n355\n00:20:55.250 --> 00:21:00.010\nand they take care of all the stuff that\nwe talked about, doing the maintenance.\n\n356\n00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:02.320\nThe care and feeding and\nall that type of stuff.\n\n357\n00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.810\nThe way they have a linkage between\nwhat they do and what you do,\n\n358\n00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:09.210\nthose two active directories is\nbasically what Mike is saying here.\n\n359\n00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.490\nIs that we have almost\nlike a two-four situation\n\n360\n00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.170\nwhere their using federation\nservices to link the two.\n\n361\n00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:20.080\nSo that's one situation where you\ncan go and look right now and\n\n362\n00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.360\nsee the technical data that Microsoft has\npublished online and the set requirements.\n\n363\n00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:30.840\nAnd you can see that in action, and\nget an idea of what's involved with it.\n\n364\n00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.590\nI mean, it's not gonna give you all\nthe details of Federated Services.\n\n365\n00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:38.260\nBut you can see there's a place\nright now without us saying oh well,\n\n366\n00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.310\nhere's how it works in an abstract manner.\n\n367\n00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:44.250\nYou can actually see that they have\nwith their cloud hosting platform and\n\n368\n00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:45.660\nputting Active Directory.\n\n369\n00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.110\nThey have that ability to say hey,\nhere's Federate Services and\n\n370\n00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:53.360\nyou can just plug this stub right into our\nactive directory that we're hosting for\n\n371\n00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.580\nyou and rock and roll.\n\n372\n00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.270\n>> Yeah absolutely.\n\n373\n00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.170\nI've got their Microsoft Azure\nservices that you can sign up for.\n\n374\n00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.580\nIn fact I want to say\nthey've got a free trial\n\n375\n00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.090\nthat you can play around\nwith that as well.\n\n376\n00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.170\nYeah, so, that's actually a great point.\n\n377\n00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:12.120\nIf they have something like that, a free\ntrial out there then heck, it's a nice way\n\n378\n00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:17.947\nfor you to get your hands dirty on it or\nbe cursing life, one of the two.\n\n379\n00:22:17.947 --> 00:22:19.040\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, when it comes down to it,\n\n380\n00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:24.360\nI think most of like, I know Azure,\nI wanna say they give you $200 credit,\n\n381\n00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.060\nbasically, and then if you go beyond that\n$200 they're gonna start charging you.\n\n382\n00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.150\nSo do be careful with that one.\n\n383\n00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:35.030\nIt's not sneaky Microsoft, but\nit's close to being sneaky, because you\n\n384\n00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:39.490\ncould run up some charges really quick and\ngo through your $200 credit really fast.\n\n385\n00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:43.480\nAnd then all of a sudden you get this\nbill for anything you went over $200 for.\n\n386\n00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:48.730\nI know Amazon has that free tier that you\ncan do for 12 months and it's free free.\n\n387\n00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.450\nNo hidden charges there which is nice.\n\n388\n00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:55.040\nSo they all have some way that you can do\nsome testing and some practice with it.\n\n389\n00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.030\n>> So if you're gonna test\ndrive Microsoft stuff,\n\n390\n00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:02.955\ngo on the dark web, get some credit\ncard numbers, plug them in, no problem.\n\n391\n00:23:02.955 --> 00:23:05.460\n[LAUGH]\n>> We got another show for\n\n392\n00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.724\nthat one there, yeah.\n\n393\n00:23:06.724 --> 00:23:09.200\n[LAUGH]\n>> We gotta work on that disclaimer being\n\n394\n00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.290\nflashed at the bottom.\n\n395\n00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:11.802\nOpinion said by Sean do not reflect.\n\n396\n00:23:11.802 --> 00:23:12.740\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's right.\n\n397\n00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:15.175\nWe don't support anything\nhe's saying at this point.\n\n398\n00:23:15.175 --> 00:23:17.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Alright, Sean, so\n\n399\n00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:18.230\na lot of good info there.\n\n400\n00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.890\nWhat else do we need to know about\nportability and interoperability?\n\n401\n00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:27.040\n>> Well, there's one other thing\nthat sits out here, is web services.\n\n402\n00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.470\nWeb services could potentially,\nwell, I shouldn't say potentially.\n\n403\n00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:36.730\nIt's not going to take too much for\nyou to step right into having web\n\n404\n00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:40.170\nservices somewhere in your infrastructure\nif they are not there already.\n\n405\n00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:45.775\nIf that's the case, web services\nalso have something called soap and\n\n406\n00:23:45.775 --> 00:23:47.965\nthat's developer stuff.\n\n407\n00:23:47.965 --> 00:23:50.635\nNot even gonna happen here.\n\n408\n00:23:50.635 --> 00:23:52.144\nWe're not getting into that.\n\n409\n00:23:52.144 --> 00:23:56.463\nBut there is a language\nthat they call soap.\n\n410\n00:23:56.463 --> 00:24:01.888\nThat's used to actually talk\nbetween different web services and\n\n411\n00:24:01.888 --> 00:24:05.438\nit's a whole developer oriented stuff and\n\n412\n00:24:05.438 --> 00:24:11.369\nit's another way of glueing together\nservices from various vendors.\n\n413\n00:24:11.369 --> 00:24:15.343\nSo if you have a web service\nyou've created internally and\n\n414\n00:24:15.343 --> 00:24:20.859\nit's built to embrace the SOAP standard or\nif you have Microsoft technologies or\n\n415\n00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:25.505\nanother vendor's technologies,\ncuz it's not vendor specific.\n\n416\n00:24:25.505 --> 00:24:29.679\nIf you have any of their stuff locally\nthat adheres to the SOAP specification,\n\n417\n00:24:29.679 --> 00:24:32.778\nmost vendors out there that\nare doing stuff in the cloud and\n\n418\n00:24:32.778 --> 00:24:36.530\nare making web services available,\nthey support SOAP as well.\n\n419\n00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:41.510\nSo that means that by supporting that,\nyou can\n\n420\n00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:46.290\nwrite something pretty much like you XML,\nbeing that standardized XML format, you\n\n421\n00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:51.170\ncan glue these things together and make\nthem talk to one another quite seamlessly.\n\n422\n00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:55.280\nThey use SOAP all the time\nwith web services already.\n\n423\n00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.040\nYou're using it and\nit's completely transparent.\n\n424\n00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.170\nIf you're using stuff on your smart\nphones, your tablets, you know,\n\n425\n00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.070\nanything like that.\n\n426\n00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:08.000\nI mean heck, set top boxes that\nyou're using to DVR stuff.\n\n427\n00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.140\nYour cable boxes, all that, they're using\nthat to actually talk between the web,\n\n428\n00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:17.130\nthe application in that box and\nthe web application on the back end,\n\n429\n00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:21.490\nso it's pretty prolific which\nis a great thing for you\n\n430\n00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.110\nbecause you know it's not something that\nyou're using bleeding edge technology.\n\n431\n00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:27.510\nIt's something out there that's\nwell documented, it's robust,\n\n432\n00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:31.100\nit's everywhere, and very well supported.\n\n433\n00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.760\nSo you can plug into it and\nmake these things talk and\n\n434\n00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:38.440\nmake a seamless application or\nenvironment across vendors.\n\n435\n00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.110\nEverything's highly interoperable.\n\n436\n00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:45.047\nThat's just a big plus but you need to\nconsider how these issues going in because\n\n437\n00:25:45.047 --> 00:25:49.045\nwhat you don't want to have is that\nsituation, where you've created something\n\n438\n00:25:49.045 --> 00:25:53.158\nin house and you're like, let's move to\nthe cloud and oh let's integrate this and\n\n439\n00:25:53.158 --> 00:25:56.860\nthis, you know, oh there's a identity\nmanagement solution over here and\n\n440\n00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:59.015\nthere's something over her I want to use.\n\n441\n00:25:59.015 --> 00:26:03.610\nAnd you want to plug these things together\nand you find out that yours doesn't\n\n442\n00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:08.870\nsupport for example the SOAP protocol,\nand another one supports something else.\n\n443\n00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:12.330\nYou may be able to get them to work, but\nthat's going to be a lot of hoops for\n\n444\n00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:16.600\nyou to jump through if it works\nat all at the end of things.\n\n445\n00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.930\nSo you can make this\ninteroperable if you think ahead.\n\n446\n00:26:20.972 --> 00:26:24.130\n>> All right well again a lot\nof great information there.\n\n447\n00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:26.910\nAnything else we need to toss\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n448\n00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:29.030\n>> My head hurts talking\nabout fed rate services.\n\n449\n00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:29.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It does.\n\n450\n00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.854\nSo no.\n\n451\n00:26:30.854 --> 00:26:32.879\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right then ladies and gentlemen,\n\n452\n00:26:32.879 --> 00:26:34.054\nthat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n453\n00:26:34.054 --> 00:26:35.436\nI hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n454\n00:26:35.436

00:00:14.310\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.085\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.085 --> 00:00:20.211\nAnd in this episode, we're gonna be\ntalking about our good old cloud service\n\n6\n00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:24.337\nproviders, or CSPs, and data security\nwhen it comes to our cloud security,\n\n7\n00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:27.532\ncloud service providers,\nI'll just say CSP from now one.\n\n8\n00:00:27.532 --> 00:00:31.434\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How we handle doing security with them\n\n9\n00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:36.921\nand also we're going to talk about\nour data size cuz size matters and.\n\n10\n00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:37.702\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We can\n\n11\n00:00:37.702 --> 00:00:41.900\nend up with pretty large amounts of data\nthat we got stored out there in the cloud.\n\n12\n00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.740\n>> Yeah absolutely when you get to a cloud\nenvironment you can pretty much assume if\n\n13\n00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.490\nyou're starting to put data in\napplications out there they've reached\n\n14\n00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.020\na reasonable size or a reasonable amount\nof requests they're gonna mediate.\n\n15\n00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.360\nThere's some measure of\nscale that's gotten out of\n\n16\n00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.220\nthe capabilities of what you currently\ncan handle in a lot of cases\n\n17\n00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.560\nwhere you just have to push it\nout to someone else to handle it.\n\n18\n00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.220\nThat's actually a big motivator for\na lot of people.\n\n19\n00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.572\nIt's not always that way, but it's a lot\nof times, it does fall under that.\n\n20\n00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:16.490\n>> Like a business starts out small,\nthey got a little web server,\n\n21\n00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.720\nthey can handle their traffic but all of a\nsudden they get, on the Internet somebody\n\n22\n00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.580\nstarts talking about them, word of mouth\nwhatever, business explodes, and I can't\n\n23\n00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.510\nput out new service fast enough to keep up\nwith it, going to the cloud can help me\n\n24\n00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.085\nwith that because of all the elasticity\noptions we have, things like that?\n\n25\n00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:38.025\n>> Yeah absolutely, so a big motivator for\na lot of companies is that they reach\n\n26\n00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:42.785\nthat point where their infrastructure and\ntheir requirements are getting so\n\n27\n00:01:42.785 --> 00:01:47.805\nbig that it's a choice between\nthe traditional model which is\n\n28\n00:01:47.805 --> 00:01:51.775\njust build it yourself and invest all\nthis money in start up and training and\n\n29\n00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:53.440\nall that stuff that goes with it.\n\n30\n00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.350\nOr just say well,\nthere's someone else that can do this,\n\n31\n00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.630\nwe'll just outsource this to the cloud,\nand\n\n32\n00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.120\nthen we can leverage all those benefits\nthat you just talked about Mike,\n\n33\n00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.820\nbeing able to have the elasticity,\nbeing able to setup stuff very quickly.\n\n34\n00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.720\nBut while we're able to realize all those\nbenefits at the same time, we're not\n\n35\n00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.870\nhaving them take care of all the little\ndetails underneath the hood, so a plus.\n\n36\n00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.680\n>> It can save a company a lot of\nmoney too because if I have to plan,\n\n37\n00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.180\nif I look at my usage.\n\n38\n00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.200\nI have to see,\nif I'm doing physical hardware and\n\n39\n00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.970\neven if I'm doing some virtualization\ndepending on how I've gone,\n\n40\n00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.570\nI've got to have a enough resources for\nmy peak times, right?\n\n41\n00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.500\nBut I don't have a 24/7 peak time so\n\n42\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.500\nthere's a lot of down times\nwhen I don't need that.\n\n43\n00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.070\nWell, I still have the physical server\nsitting there, I've still paid for them,\n\n44\n00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.070\nI'm still paying for\nthe power on them, things like that.\n\n45\n00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.030\nI go to the cloud, and\nI get some these service providers where\n\n46\n00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.380\nwe can spin up new instances during that\npeak time, and that's what I'm paying for,\n\n47\n00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.840\nand then during my slower periods,\nwe get rid of those instances and\n\n48\n00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.970\nthen I don't pay as much.\n\n49\n00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.930\nSo it really can save you some money.\n\n50\n00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.920\n>> Yeah, absolutely, it can be a lot\nmore cost effective for many companies,\n\n51\n00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.190\nmedium and large sizes.\n\n52\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.110\nIt's usually the small companies\nit's kind of a question on that.\n\n53\n00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.000\nDoesn't mean they can't\nrealize the benefits.\n\n54\n00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.310\nIt's probably a question of you know\na case by case basis but the medium and\n\n55\n00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.830\nlarge size businesses they can\nusually realize some benefits just for\n\n56\n00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.650\nthe reason we're talking about.\n\n57\n00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.550\nSo there are a lot of things, but\n\n58\n00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.570\nwhen you're moving large amounts of\ndata out there, both accessing and\n\n59\n00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.418\nstorage, that does bring\nup some interesting issues.\n\n60\n00:03:35.418 --> 00:03:40.490\nOne of them, just to kinda to go back to\nsomething we talked about in a previous\n\n61\n00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:45.860\nepisode, was the stuff we talked\nabout with data dispersion and\n\n62\n00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.060\nfragmentation, or\nwe also referred to as sharding.\n\n63\n00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.800\nOnce data set gets very large,\n\n64\n00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.030\nthere's a pont where you've got to do\nsomething to more effectively manage that.\n\n65\n00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.260\nAnd you just can't throw a big chunk\nof data up there and say, oh look,\n\n66\n00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.470\nit's in the cloud.\n\n67\n00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.950\nIt's you're, yeah, you're gonna get some\nbenefit out of that, potentially you\n\n68\n00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.040\ngonna get benefit out of just pushing\nit up there, most times you will.\n\n69\n00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.140\nBut the reality is that you may not\nbe realizing all the benefits and\n\n70\n00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.600\ngetting all the bang for\nyour buck by just taking this and\n\n71\n00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.006\nputting it up there, so\nyou wanna take more stuff into account.\n\n72\n00:04:22.006 --> 00:04:26.990\nThat's where coming up with stuff\nlike sharding data and saying,\n\n73\n00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.420\nwell we're gonna have to take that\nlarge data set and break it out so\n\n74\n00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.360\nit not only performs a lot better, but\n\n75\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.950\nthe people at the data actually can\nbe closer to where it's needed,\n\n76\n00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.060\ninstead of having it just\nall one big space out there.\n\n77\n00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.388\nSo it can play a big big role, and\n\n78\n00:04:46.388 --> 00:04:51.010\nthis isn't an uncommon thing\nreally when you get down to it.\n\n79\n00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.540\nDatabases use this type of thing\nwhere instead of just putting\n\n80\n00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.390\nstuff in one big bubble or\nwhatever, they break it out.\n\n81\n00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.270\nI mean, I wanna think of it,\nit's not the entire reason why it does it.\n\n82\n00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.560\nI wanna think of Active Directory\nas a partitioning scheme.\n\n83\n00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.750\nI mean, they could have made\nit one big database and\n\n84\n00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.880\njust had it go everywhere, all, and\ndo whatever, but it was more efficient,\n\n85\n00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.880\nand there was other benefits of it\nto break it in the partitions so\n\n86\n00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.580\nreplication can be handled\njust much more efficiently.\n\n87\n00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.320\nSo it's kind of the same type of thing\nwe're talking about in the cloud.\n\n88\n00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.470\nWe're taking what would otherwise\nbe a large data set and\n\n89\n00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:31.770\nmaybe be unwieldy and\nbe a bear to deal with.\n\n90\n00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.430\nWe're breaking it out a bit more.\n\n91\n00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.920\nSo it's just more efficient.\n\n92\n00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.067\n>> All right.\nAnd then we've gotta deal with,\n\n93\n00:05:38.067 --> 00:05:42.572\ndepending on what we're doing, if we're\ndoing infrastructure as a service or\n\n94\n00:05:42.572 --> 00:05:46.690\nsoftware or platform as a service,\nthat can affect our choices as well?\n\n95\n00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.030\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n96\n00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.180\nAgain it goes back to that tool\nwe mentioned way early on was\n\n97\n00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.510\nthat reference model.\n\n98\n00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.330\nWe can keep using that, is which one of\nthose you have is gonna dictate just how\n\n99\n00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.950\nmuch of that is in your\nhands versus their hands and\n\n100\n00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.990\nit's gonna dictate how much responsibility\nyou have, how much responsibility they're\n\n101\n00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.840\ngonna have to break that data up and\ncome up with better management techniques.\n\n102\n00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:15.940\nSometimes it's done completely behind\nthe scenes, or underneath the hood, and\n\n103\n00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.670\nyou don't need to see that, you just need\nto get in the car and drive basically.\n\n104\n00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.930\nSo you take a large, you put your data up\nin the cloud, and they may be doing stuff\n\n105\n00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.010\nunderneath everything to do the\nfragmentation and dispersion for example.\n\n106\n00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.130\nThey could be taking your data and\nunderneath everything,\n\n107\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.940\nputting into sizes that are more\neasily managed, more efficient for\n\n108\n00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.830\nthe cloud and\nyou don't have to do anything to get that.\n\n109\n00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.570\nYou reap the benefits of that but\n\n110\n00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.990\nif you just start breaking it up and\ndoing that sharding deal like we said,\n\n111\n00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.680\nit's kind of they're all talking\nkind of the same type of thing.\n\n112\n00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.620\nBut fragmentation typically is\ngonna be lower on the scale more\n\n113\n00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.300\ntowards that physical side.\n\n114\n00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.580\nSharding's gonna be more of\na logical organization of data.\n\n115\n00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.980\nSo if you're talking just the\nfragmentation part well then heck you know\n\n116\n00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.050\nthat's something that is probably\ndone right underneath the hood for\n\n117\n00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.380\nyou, you dont have to do\nanything to reap that.\n\n118\n00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.430\nBut if you're talking doing that sharding\nsize and depending on which one of those\n\n119\n00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.180\nyou select, that's going to be something\nmore and more that I need to handle.\n\n120\n00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.150\nIf I'm just doing the platform or\nthe infrastructure side of things and\n\n121\n00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:25.770\nnot doing the software side of it, there's\ngoing to be potentially a substantial\n\n122\n00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.060\namount of that that's going\nto fall right into my lap.\n\n123\n00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.954\nWhich means probably getting application\ndevelopers involved and network\n\n124\n00:07:32.954 --> 00:07:38.167\nengineers involved, and really looking at\nwhat the best way to break that up is.\n\n125\n00:07:38.167 --> 00:07:38.732\n>> Right.\n\n126\n00:07:38.732 --> 00:07:43.103\nAll right, and then hardware compatibility\nissues that we have to deal with?\n\n127\n00:07:43.103 --> 00:07:48.991\n>> Yeah there are some things\nthat could come into play there,\n\n128\n00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:53.830\none of the things I pretend\nto put in here is well.\n\n129\n00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.569\nWhen you are deciding you want\nto move your infrastructure or\n\n130\n00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:01.840\nany of your stuff into the cloud,\nwhat if it's on a physical device?\n\n131\n00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:06.322\nAnd I mean, we kinda talked\nabout it in a previous episode,\n\n132\n00:08:06.322 --> 00:08:10.697\nabout the fact that you can run some\nof these things for virtualization that\n\n133\n00:08:10.697 --> 00:08:15.302\ncan take a physical machine and bundle it\nup and make it into a virtual machine.\n\n134\n00:08:15.302 --> 00:08:16.726\nThen you can just screw it in like a light\n\n135\n00:08:16.726 --> 00:08:19.140\nbulb into one of these\nvirtualization solutions.\n\n136\n00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.690\nSounds great to be able to do that.\n\n137\n00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.575\nNot everything is gonna work that way.\n\n138\n00:08:23.575 --> 00:08:26.058\n[LAUGH] Not everything's\ngonna be that easy.\n\n139\n00:08:26.058 --> 00:08:30.980\nYou can P2V on a lot of stuff, but\nthe reality is, while you can do\n\n140\n00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.590\nit on a lot of stuff, not everything is\ngonna work in a virtualized environment.\n\n141\n00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.570\nProbably everybody here has\nencountered something that just\n\n142\n00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.580\ndidn't play well with virtualization.\n\n143\n00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.290\nIn the security side of things,\nI know for pen testing,\n\n144\n00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.140\nI do have a number of tools that just\ndo not play well in virtualization.\n\n145\n00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:52.607\nThey will kick and scream and not work\nright or give me erroneous results.\n\n146\n00:08:52.607 --> 00:08:56.316\nIn which case I just have to\nuse a physical machine for\n\n147\n00:08:56.316 --> 00:09:01.370\nthat, I have a machine specifically\nset up to do stuff like wireless.\n\n148\n00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:06.360\nWireless doesn't really play well with\nvirtualization as far as pen testing goes.\n\n149\n00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.840\nYou can make it work in some situations,\n\n150\n00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.010\nbut it's not 100% and\nusually it's not worth the headache.\n\n151\n00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:18.360\nJust go ahead and just Install your\nKali or whatever on a physical machine.\n\n152\n00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.775\nWell, you may not be moving Kali from\nyour local environment to the cloud, but\n\n153\n00:09:22.775 --> 00:09:25.710\nyou may have something that's\nusing specialized hardware,\n\n154\n00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.420\nhas some special requirements,\nand it just may not go.\n\n155\n00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:35.520\nOr you may have to find some interesting\nsolution to it, o make it go.\n\n156\n00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.020\n>> And sometimes when we try to do that,\n\n157\n00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.470\nwe don't get the best results or\nit kinda limps along.\n\n158\n00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.090\nIt might do what we want it to do sort of,\nbut not fully.\n\n159\n00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:47.310\n>> Yeah, that's kind of it and\nyou see some creative solutions.\n\n160\n00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:52.300\nYou see stuff like if they have\nsome specialized hardware,\n\n161\n00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:56.600\nyou'll hear people say well,\nI could do software emulation of that.\n\n162\n00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.662\nWell, software emulation of\nsome stuff works pretty well,\n\n163\n00:09:59.662 --> 00:10:03.158\nother stuff it just plain sucks,\nwould be the technical term for it.\n\n164\n00:10:03.158 --> 00:10:07.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It just isn't gonna work properly.\n\n165\n00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:13.580\nI mean, some stuff, I've heard people\nsay over the years the virtualization,\n\n166\n00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.726\nlike hey, virtualize something and\nput it in VMware or\n\n167\n00:10:18.726 --> 00:10:23.020\nVirtualBox or whatever on your system and\nit will work beautifully.\n\n168\n00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.649\nThe reality is,\nis that some of the adapters and\n\n169\n00:10:25.649 --> 00:10:29.855\nstuff like that I might plug into my\nsystem, while you can do a pass through or\n\n170\n00:10:29.855 --> 00:10:33.363\nsomething to it,\nthey're just not recognized the right way.\n\n171\n00:10:33.363 --> 00:10:34.803\nAnd there's no way to emulate that,\n\n172\n00:10:34.803 --> 00:10:37.410\neven though people online will say\nyou can do this, this and this.\n\n173\n00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.296\nIt's like, yeah,\nit'll make it talk to that device, but\n\n174\n00:10:41.296 --> 00:10:45.586\nit talks to that device in a way\nother than the way I need it to work.\n\n175\n00:10:45.586 --> 00:10:49.350\nSo it's really useless to me\nto go through that process.\n\n176\n00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:54.630\nSo not everything's gonna\ngo into the cloud 100%, and\n\n177\n00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.880\nsome of those things that go in,\nyou may need to jump through a few hoops.\n\n178\n00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.650\nAlso consider the fact that when you jump\ninto the cloud with some of these things,\n\n179\n00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:08.080\nwatch the type of solutions\nthat you're using on the vendor\n\n180\n00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.460\nside of it when you push it\nin that cloud environment.\n\n181\n00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:16.030\nBe careful that you don't run into\na situation that we call lock-in.\n\n182\n00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:21.820\nWhich is, you can kind of infer what's\nhappened here when we talk lock-in.\n\n183\n00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.046\nIs that means that we're pushing\nsomething into the cloud,\n\n184\n00:11:25.046 --> 00:11:27.649\nwe put it into that\nhosting provider's format.\n\n185\n00:11:27.649 --> 00:11:32.364\nAnd whatever we're using,\ninfrastructure as a service,\n\n186\n00:11:32.364 --> 00:11:36.419\nplatform, software,\nwe get into their format and\n\n187\n00:11:36.419 --> 00:11:42.130\nit becomes very difficult to pull\nit out of that whole environment.\n\n188\n00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.460\nIt's the exact opposite of portability.\n\n189\n00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:48.400\nPortability says that we can move\nit from place to place to place.\n\n190\n00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:52.670\nWe don't want it there,\nwe basically unscrew the light bulb and\n\n191\n00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:57.580\njust put it into another one and\nwe're up and running again.\n\n192\n00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.920\nBut it doesn't always work that way.\n\n193\n00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:03.932\nThere are situations where you\nmight get into that format and\n\n194\n00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:09.210\nit becomes a one-way trip or it,\nin essence, becomes a one-way trip.\n\n195\n00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:13.910\nThere's plenty of situations where,\nin the software and IT world,\n\n196\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:19.980\nthat we've had over the years, where you\nwill import something into a specific,\n\n197\n00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.460\nimport or create something\nin a specific application.\n\n198\n00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.075\nAnd what happens is once it gets there,\nit's there.\n\n199\n00:12:27.075 --> 00:12:29.047\nBecause you get the data in there, and\n\n200\n00:12:29.047 --> 00:12:32.867\nthen you start attaching intelligence\nto it and all this other stuff, and\n\n201\n00:12:32.867 --> 00:12:36.775\nthat intelligence is all part of\nthat file format, or that system.\n\n202\n00:12:36.775 --> 00:12:40.075\nSo if you pull it out of there,\nyou lose that.\n\n203\n00:12:40.075 --> 00:12:44.045\nSo, in essence, you are locked in,\nyou're stuck with that format,\n\n204\n00:12:44.045 --> 00:12:45.375\nthat's the way it is.\n\n205\n00:12:45.375 --> 00:12:48.605\nAnd it's kinda an unpleasant\nsituation to be in.\n\n206\n00:12:48.605 --> 00:12:52.783\nThat's why you really kinda wanna do your\ntesting to make sure you're not locked\n\n207\n00:12:52.783 --> 00:12:53.407\ninto that.\n\n208\n00:12:53.407 --> 00:12:58.957\nNot always a bad thing, I mean, if you get\nyourself locked into at least a format,\n\n209\n00:12:58.957 --> 00:13:03.190\nwell then,\nthat's not necessarily always a problem.\n\n210\n00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.152\nI was talking about,\nI'm not picking on anybody but,\n\n211\n00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:11.460\nI was mentioning with the AutoCAD format,\nthe DWG format.\n\n212\n00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:16.976\nYou bring stuff into that format,\nyou do, in essence, get locked\n\n213\n00:13:16.976 --> 00:13:23.786\ninto that format because AutoCAD attaches\nall this special stuff to that format.\n\n214\n00:13:23.786 --> 00:13:25.006\nYou could export it out.\n\n215\n00:13:25.006 --> 00:13:28.819\nThey actually have a format called DXF\nthat you can, it's called this drawing\n\n216\n00:13:28.819 --> 00:13:33.200\nexchange format, or data exchange format,\ndepending on where you came in.\n\n217\n00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.910\nWell, you can bring it out in that but\nit strips out all the database stuff,\n\n218\n00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.590\nthe stuff that AutoCAD attaches to it.\n\n219\n00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:39.630\nIt basically strips all that out and\n\n220\n00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:44.080\nsays, here's all the vectors\nthat describe your model.\n\n221\n00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.500\nAnd so when you bring it into something\nelse, you get a wireframe model, or\n\n222\n00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.660\njust simple stuff, and\nyou've gotta recreate a lot of things.\n\n223\n00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:56.050\nSo that can be, I mean, even your\nunits of measurements can be lost.\n\n224\n00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:01.168\nSo you're able to get some of\nthe data out, but not everything.\n\n225\n00:14:01.168 --> 00:14:03.555\nSo while yes, you can get it out,\n\n226\n00:14:03.555 --> 00:14:07.830\nyou still have a point where\nyou really are kinda locked in.\n\n227\n00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.338\nYou want to retain everything, but\n\n228\n00:14:09.338 --> 00:14:12.361\nthere's not an effective way to really\nkind of extract it out of there.\n\n229\n00:14:12.361 --> 00:14:16.663\nAnd yeah, I know that there's probably\npeople out here who've used AutoCAD and\n\n230\n00:14:16.663 --> 00:14:21.070\ncan say, well, there's ways to do this,\nthis and that, they're not easy.\n\n231\n00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.460\nThis is someone that worked with that, and\nstill does work with it all the time so\n\n232\n00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.438\ntrust me.\n\n233\n00:14:25.438 --> 00:14:28.396\n>> [LAUGH] All right, Sean, what's next,\n\n234\n00:14:28.396 --> 00:14:32.321\nI'm trying to think of where\nwe're going next here.\n\n235\n00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:38.170\n>> Well, where we're going as we talked\nabout the data formats with lock-in.\n\n236\n00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:41.439\nAlso make sure that\nwhatever set up you create,\n\n237\n00:14:41.439 --> 00:14:46.423\nit's something that is, first of all,\nmake sure whatever you set up and\n\n238\n00:14:46.423 --> 00:14:50.620\ntest and decide upon,\nthat that is well documented.\n\n239\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.850\nMake sure that you get\nthat documented design.\n\n240\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.170\nAfter you've done your testing,\n\n241\n00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.250\ndecide that's what it's gonna be,\nmake sure it's well documented.\n\n242\n00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:02.290\nAlso make sure it's something\nthat is reproducible,\n\n243\n00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:06.610\nboth from the standpoint that you can take\nwhatever you set up and can move it over\n\n244\n00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:13.030\nto another provider and replicate it, as\nwell as make sure it's easy to replicate.\n\n245\n00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.710\nI can think of numerous\nthings over the years that,\n\n246\n00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:25.170\nit looked good on paper and\nsounded good at the time, but\n\n247\n00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:30.090\nonce you go to the new stuff,\nit's just, it's horrible.\n\n248\n00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:33.350\nIt really is, you're like,\nwho thought of doing this?\n\n249\n00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.490\nWho thought this was a good idea?\n\n250\n00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.081\nI mean heck, I'm thinking of\nthe discussion we had over here.\n\n251\n00:15:37.081 --> 00:15:41.839\nImmediate came to mind is the discussion\nover here you were having offline\n\n252\n00:15:41.839 --> 00:15:45.457\nabout the NT domains and\nthe Active Directory domains.\n\n253\n00:15:45.457 --> 00:15:48.842\nI mean,\nthose that didn't hear that discussion,\n\n254\n00:15:48.842 --> 00:15:52.935\nIf you were around the NT4 days and\nhad to deal with domains and\n\n255\n00:15:52.935 --> 00:15:56.100\nstuff like that in there,\nthat was a disaster.\n\n256\n00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:00.720\nSome of the situations you came in to, cuz\npeople would, as somebody out there said,\n\n257\n00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.042\nset up domains just because hey,\nlet's see if we can set one up.\n\n258\n00:16:04.042 --> 00:16:06.135\nThey set it for no reason.\n\n259\n00:16:06.135 --> 00:16:11.575\nAnd so you got the situation where you had\ndomains set up, all these trusts set up,\n\n260\n00:16:11.575 --> 00:16:14.811\nand it looked kind of like a map\nof the New York subway system.\n\n261\n00:16:14.811 --> 00:16:17.268\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That kind of deal, it was a big,\n\n262\n00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:18.102\nbig mess.\n\n263\n00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:19.732\nWhereas you go to Active Directory,\n\n264\n00:16:19.732 --> 00:16:25.172\nyou have this nice, usually it's\na pretty nice and elegant looking thing.\n\n265\n00:16:25.172 --> 00:16:27.670\nYou can see that there's\nsome sanity behind it.\n\n266\n00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:28.822\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I guess that's just a good\n\n267\n00:16:28.822 --> 00:16:29.374\nway to put it.\n\n268\n00:16:29.374 --> 00:16:33.630\nSo you have those two things.\n\n269\n00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:39.065\nWell, ask anybody that\never had to take an NT4\n\n270\n00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:43.410\nsetup, that looked like that mess,\nand move it over to Active Directory.\n\n271\n00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.140\nAsk them how easy it was.\n\n272\n00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:47.250\nAsk them how many nerves they have left.\n\n273\n00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.404\nAre they just down to the last one,\nor do they still have a few left?\n\n274\n00:16:50.404 --> 00:16:53.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was a big pain,\n\n275\n00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.570\nI remember hearing people do that.\n\n276\n00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:04.162\nI was fortunately, happened to be out of\nthe country at the time, so to speak.\n\n277\n00:17:04.162 --> 00:17:06.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I was able to skip most of that.\n\n278\n00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.710\nIt was consulting, I was like yeah,\nokay, yeah, you're good.\n\n279\n00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.840\nSo I didn't have to go\nthrough the grunt work on it.\n\n280\n00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.890\nBut anyone who had to go through the real\ngrunt work on it knows that that was\n\n281\n00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:20.460\nnot pretty and caused a lot of sleepless\nnights, a lot of pain and suffering, and\n\n282\n00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:21.070\neverything else.\n\n283\n00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:23.550\nIt was not easy, but\nyou could get through it.\n\n284\n00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.540\nWhat you don't want to have is that\nsame situation in the Cloud format.\n\n285\n00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.100\nYou can do it and you can get out of it,\n\n286\n00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:32.960\njust like we could get out of it with\nthe NT4 to 2000, whatever migration.\n\n287\n00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.680\nIt's just something that\nshouldn't be necessary to do.\n\n288\n00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.930\nEspecially since hey, we've been there,\ndone that, we should know better now.\n\n289\n00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.060\nThere's also situations where\nyou wanna avoid a setup\n\n290\n00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.450\nwhere you are kind of putting\ntogether multiple services.\n\n291\n00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:52.070\nAnd you put them together in such\na way that's not reproducible.\n\n292\n00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.170\nMaybe it's because it comes\nfrom my paranoid streak or\n\n293\n00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:00.220\nsomething like that,\nI always like to think about,\n\n294\n00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:05.690\nwhat if you decide to skip out on me and\nyou're not there?\n\n295\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:09.890\nI wanna be able to, at any time, just be\nable to, done, move it some place else for\n\n296\n00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:10.690\nwhatever reason.\n\n297\n00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.570\nI just don't like your face,\nI'm moving some place else.\n\n298\n00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.820\nIt could be something like that,\nit doesn't matter.\n\n299\n00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.720\nWhatever the reason is, I want to be able\njust to pack up and move some place.\n\n300\n00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.380\nI don't want to be in a situation where\nI am locked into a certain format and\n\n301\n00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:30.410\ncertain environment, and can't get out\nof it easily or replicate it at all.\n\n302\n00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.500\nSo that's something that you try to avoid.\n\n303\n00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.390\nGranted, it's not always\ngonna be that way.\n\n304\n00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:41.400\nI mean, you can be hyper paranoid and try\nto do everything you can to avoid that.\n\n305\n00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.340\nBut don't put yourself in such\na situation where you're gonna lose\n\n306\n00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.360\nsight of whatever your solution is.\n\n307\n00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.220\nThat's the other side of it.\n\n308\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.310\nI may be paranoid about stuff and say,\n\n309\n00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:54.290\nwell, I want to try to avoid getting\nlocked in as much as possible.\n\n310\n00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:58.820\nBut I'm gonna also avoid doing it at\n\n311\n00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.280\nsuch a cost that I'm losing\nfunctionality just for the idea that,\n\n312\n00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:07.300\nhey, I can put stuff in my bag and\nmove without any problem.\n\n313\n00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.700\nSo you kinda gotta figure\nout a balance there.\n\n314\n00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.062\nAnd hopefully, you can figure out\na balance where you get a good level of\n\n315\n00:19:13.062 --> 00:19:15.915\nfeatures and capability that\njustifies moving to the Cloud.\n\n316\n00:19:15.915 --> 00:19:20.780\nBut you can also, if you need to, be able\nto move and with some degree, maybe not\n\n317\n00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:27.060\na huge level, and don't need huge teams\ncoming in, you can get the thing over.\n\n318\n00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.560\nSome companies have had to, when they've\nhad solutions that they've got and\n\n319\n00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.185\nmesses that they've got\nthemselves into in the past,\n\n320\n00:19:33.185 --> 00:19:37.760\nhave had to bring in huge\nteams to get them out of it.\n\n321\n00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.690\nI've seen it, and\nI'm sure you've seen or heard of it,\n\n322\n00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:44.330\nwhere they have to contract some huge\nteam that just works on that project.\n\n323\n00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:47.920\nSo they got a bunch of people that have\nto learn the system and dissect stuff.\n\n324\n00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.480\nThey may have to call in some guy that\nretired ten years ago and pay him 3, $400\n\n325\n00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:57.890\nan hour, to go through and figure out what\nwas going on, just to get out of that.\n\n326\n00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.350\nYou wanna avoid all that.\n\n327\n00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.950\nYou wanna do it with the least disruption,\n\n328\n00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:06.560\nas quickly as possible,\nwith as little effort as possible.\n\n329\n00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.580\nYou wanna avoid those things.\n\n330\n00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.025\n>> And we talk about,\nagain, doing our research,\n\n331\n00:20:12.025 --> 00:20:17.500\nasking the right questions up front,\nplanning thoroughly, it seems like.\n\n332\n00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:23.134\n>> Yeah, and think about it, if we\njust borrow our NT4 discussion again.\n\n333\n00:20:23.134 --> 00:20:28.520\nWhen NT4 was around, I mean,\nit was a good product.\n\n334\n00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.800\nI mean, compared to what we have today,\nit leaves a lot to be desired.\n\n335\n00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:39.230\nBut for the time, and day and\nage, it was a good product.\n\n336\n00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.530\nThe domain stuff and everything was\nactually, worked pretty well too, for\n\n337\n00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:43.045\nthe most part.\n\n338\n00:20:43.045 --> 00:20:44.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'm not gonna look over there and\n\n339\n00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.650\nsee what people are saying.\n\n340\n00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:48.120\nFor the most part, it worked pretty well.\n\n341\n00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.240\nBut they also did have\nguidances out there.\n\n342\n00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:54.470\nSo they told you you could set up\nall these domains and trusts and\n\n343\n00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:55.359\nthey told you how to do it.\n\n344\n00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.790\nThey also did have\nguidance out there saying,\n\n345\n00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:02.810\nyou shouldn't just be going out and\ncreating this stuff just because.\n\n346\n00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:05.840\nYou should really kind of plan stuff out.\n\n347\n00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.310\nIt didn't always happen that way.\n\n348\n00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:10.939\nIt may have started out, and\nthen started getting to be where, okay,\n\n349\n00:21:10.939 --> 00:21:12.428\nthey started building out.\n\n350\n00:21:12.428 --> 00:21:15.219\nAnd then, oh, let's do this,\nand this, and this.\n\n351\n00:21:15.219 --> 00:21:17.860\nIt happened just as\na matter of due course.\n\n352\n00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:23.006\nJust like I noticed Microsoft with\ntheir Active Directory courses,\n\n353\n00:21:23.006 --> 00:21:24.710\nwhen those came out.\n\n354\n00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.530\nThe first ones with 2000, remember how\nthey would draw that big forest diagram?\n\n355\n00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.910\nWhere it was this big thing\nwith all these pyramids, and\n\n356\n00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.990\neverything going on all over the place.\n\n357\n00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:35.550\nAnd then they started saying okay,\nwell, we're describing the forest.\n\n358\n00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:39.010\nThey started squeezing it down,\njust put a simple diagram with\n\n359\n00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.910\na bubble with a single triangle,\nor two or three in it.\n\n360\n00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:43.270\nThey didn't do that big forest.\n\n361\n00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:47.980\nBecause from the way I saw it,\npeople would go into training or\n\n362\n00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:50.970\ngo into those MS Press books,\nand see that big deal.\n\n363\n00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:53.160\nAnd they're going,\noh yeah, we're doing that.\n\n364\n00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.651\nThat's exactly what we're doing.\n\n365\n00:21:54.651 --> 00:21:56.345\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They have that NT4 mentality.\n\n366\n00:21:56.345 --> 00:22:01.003\nAnd they're trying to say, okay,\nsimplest model, one forced, one domain.\n\n367\n00:22:01.003 --> 00:22:03.851\nAnd you should get as\nclose to that as feasible.\n\n368\n00:22:03.851 --> 00:22:08.787\nYou don't necessarily have to keep it\nthat simple, but try to aim for that.\n\n369\n00:22:08.787 --> 00:22:10.840\nAnd if you have to expand it a bit,\ngo for it.\n\n370\n00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.632\nBut don't go, oh, I'm gonna do this,\nand then just make everything fit.\n\n371\n00:22:13.632 --> 00:22:17.700\nSo if there was guidance out there,\nit would be the same thing,\n\n372\n00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:18.640\nplan ahead on this.\n\n373\n00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.710\nAnd get the same type of\nguidance on this too,\n\n374\n00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:23.520\nis that try to keep things\nas simple as possible.\n\n375\n00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.530\nReally think things through.\n\n376\n00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:28.320\nAnd think about the fact that, what if you\nhad to move, what if you had to do this?\n\n377\n00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:32.880\nAnd you should be able yourself\nout of a lot of trouble.\n\n378\n00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.590\nSo don't start doing the whole thing where\nyou're like a kid in the candy store.\n\n379\n00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.115\nIt's like, oh yeah, let's do this,\nlet's rock and roll.\n\n380\n00:22:41.115 --> 00:22:43.460\nNo, KISS principle definitely works here.\n\n381\n00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.810\nKeep it as simple as possible.\n\n382\n00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.040\n>> Absolutely, all right.\n\n383\n00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.280\nWell, Sean, a lot of good information.\n\n384\n00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:51.450\nAnything we want to toss in\nbefore we wrap this one up?\n\n385\n00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.920\n>> I think we got it.\n\n386\n00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.795\nI think we got the NT references in there,\nso I'm happy.\n\n387\n00:22:55.795 --> 00:22:58.812\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, that's all for this one.\n\n388\n00:22:58.812 --> 00:23:00.090\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n389\n00:23:00.090 -->

00:00:14.570\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.530\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.540\nAnd in this episode, Sean, we're gonna\ntalking about incident handling and\n\n6\n00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.250\nall the fun stuff that\ngoes along with that.\n\n7\n00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.345\n>> Yeah, absolutely, a lot of fun and\ngames to be had here.\n\n8\n00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:27.718\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n9\n00:00:27.718 --> 00:00:30.342\nI tried to say that with as\nlittle sarcasm as possible.\n\n10\n00:00:30.342 --> 00:00:34.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So what we're talking about here is,\n\n11\n00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.940\nlike we said, incident handling.\n\n12\n00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.480\nWe have moved into the Cloud environment.\n\n13\n00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.594\nSo what we're looking at is how do\nyou handle any type of incident\n\n14\n00:00:46.594 --> 00:00:51.628\nthat may happen,\nnow that you've changed your environment?\n\n15\n00:00:51.628 --> 00:00:57.140\nAnd I say this kinda lightly, it's kind of\neasy to handle it in a traditional sense.\n\n16\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.740\nIf you have stuff out in your current\nenvironment without the Cloud,\n\n17\n00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.710\nI mean there's established incident\nhandling procedures for that,\n\n18\n00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.620\nthat you can even refer to, that have been\nestablished and developed over years,\n\n19\n00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.900\nand years, and years of experience and\ntesting, and what have you.\n\n20\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.580\nBut when you move over in the Cloud,\nthat obviously does change things,\n\n21\n00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.390\neven depending on whether or not you\nhave a public versus private Cloud.\n\n22\n00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.370\nAnd then the regulations start coming in.\n\n23\n00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.970\nThere's a lot of things that can\nreally muddy the waters here.\n\n24\n00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.410\nSo we need to kinda clear that up.\n\n25\n00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.440\nOne of the things right off the bat is\nthat whole idea of perimeter security.\n\n26\n00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.872\nThe perimeter security as it stands now,\nwhen you look at it without\n\n27\n00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:52.730\nthe cloud environment, is well,\nyou have your servers on site.\n\n28\n00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.430\nWell, what do you do?\n\n29\n00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.120\nYou lock them up in a room someplace and\nput cameras and all that stuff on it,\n\n30\n00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.010\npresumably.\n\n31\n00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.920\nOr at the very least,\nyou're locking them up someplace and\n\n32\n00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.720\nonly certain people get the key.\n\n33\n00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.880\nThat's the simplest and\neasiest way to do it.\n\n34\n00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.460\nAnd it has been done that way for\nquite a long time.\n\n35\n00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.920\nBut now we're talking about,\n\n36\n00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.680\nat least on the public side, I'm talking\nabout pushing that off to someone else.\n\n37\n00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.480\nWell, what are they doing to protect\n\n38\n00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.380\nmy information, my services,\nmy whatever that's being put out there?\n\n39\n00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.630\nThat's my business, my revenue stream,\nmy responsibility ultimately.\n\n40\n00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.460\nEven though it's been outsourced,\nthat's all on my shoulders.\n\n41\n00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.930\nSo what do you do, or what types of things\ndo you need to start really think about?\n\n42\n00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.800\nWell, you can invoke a right\nto audit type situation there.\n\n43\n00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.480\nWhere before you host stuff over there,\nyou say, well,\n\n44\n00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.690\ncan you give me information on this and\nhow you handle certain types of events?\n\n45\n00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.450\nTo make sure incidents don't happen, you\nwanna be kind of on that proactive side.\n\n46\n00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.970\nSo when you're talking about\nperimeter security is things like,\n\n47\n00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.430\nare they taking steps to make sure that\nthat perimeter they have around the place,\n\n48\n00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.520\nthe facility, the building,\nthe security measures, the physical side,\n\n49\n00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.150\nwhat are they doing to really\nassess that regularly?\n\n50\n00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.590\nDo they know that's working?\n\n51\n00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.030\nOr do they just throw up some cameras, and\n\n52\n00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.370\nsome smart card readers and\nthe like, and just that's it?\n\n53\n00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.230\nAre they making sure that those things\nare still In good working order?\n\n54\n00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.520\nAre they doing their job?\n\n55\n00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.150\nAre there any upgrades that are needed?\n\n56\n00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.550\nThose type of things would fit in there.\n\n57\n00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.390\nAre they doing things to\ncheck their employees,\n\n58\n00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.965\nto make sure their employees\nare all on the up and above?\n\n59\n00:03:47.965 --> 00:03:52.880\nSo are they having background checks done?\n\n60\n00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.599\nAre they being issued cards,\nwhat's the escort procedures?\n\n61\n00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.043\nThat's something that comes into play.\n\n62\n00:03:59.043 --> 00:04:03.988\nI mean, how many times have you been\nin a business situation where you've\n\n63\n00:04:03.988 --> 00:04:08.790\nseen someone, oh well, hey,\nthis is a more tightly controlled area.\n\n64\n00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.980\nI won't say, a classified or any type\nthat area, that's a little extreme.\n\n65\n00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.489\nBut you've got an area that's\na little more sensitive.\n\n66\n00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.786\nAnd hey, you know what,\nI'll bring the wife or\n\n67\n00:04:17.786 --> 00:04:20.550\nthe kid in because I just\ngotta pick something up.\n\n68\n00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.030\nIt's like, I don't care if it's family or\n\n69\n00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.880\nwhoever it is, they can't come in here,\nthat's the rules.\n\n70\n00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.200\nOr is there an escort procedure, that they\nare allowed to do that, or what have you?\n\n71\n00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.750\nSee what those are,\nbecause ultimately, even though it's\n\n72\n00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.490\nnot something that's onsite with you,\nit is your information that\n\n73\n00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.230\nthose people are actually interacting\nwith and have stuff there.\n\n74\n00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.300\nSo you're the one that's gonna get in\ntrouble, it's your responsibility.\n\n75\n00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.850\nSo it could be things like that, and\nyou could keep going on, and on, and on.\n\n76\n00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.154\nEven deliveries when they\nbring in packages, and\n\n77\n00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:04.876\nstuff is mailed out of there,\nhow is that controlled?\n\n78\n00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:08.650\nWhen vendors come in,\nhow are vendors checked?\n\n79\n00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.900\nHow are they ID'ed?\n\n80\n00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:10.950\nI mean, you can keep going.\n\n81\n00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.746\nLike I said, you can keep doing a lot, and\na lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of stuff there.\n\n82\n00:05:14.746 --> 00:05:20.462\nSo you gotta decide what's\nan acceptable level of security.\n\n83\n00:05:20.462 --> 00:05:24.275\nYou have to get the expertise to\naudit that and check that, and\n\n84\n00:05:24.275 --> 00:05:27.655\nthen decide if that's\ngonna be adequate for you.\n\n85\n00:05:27.655 --> 00:05:30.575\n>> Is it stuff that they're willing\nto share with us if we ask them?\n\n86\n00:05:30.575 --> 00:05:33.955\nI mean, if I'm sitting here in\nGainesville, Florida but their data center\n\n87\n00:05:33.955 --> 00:05:40.385\nis out in the Midwest or somewhere else,\nI can't very well just walk up and look.\n\n88\n00:05:40.385 --> 00:05:42.605\nSo is it something I can ask them?\n\n89\n00:05:42.605 --> 00:05:45.705\n>> See,\nthis would be the type of thing where\n\n90\n00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.390\nif you're here in Gainesville and\nyou do have, let's say,\n\n91\n00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.795\nsomething in the Midwest,\nI would say that first of all,\n\n92\n00:05:56.795 --> 00:06:01.880\nthey should be willing to at least\nshare something with you of that.\n\n93\n00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.680\nThey should be willing to let\nyou come to their facility.\n\n94\n00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.750\nA lot of places will say that.\n\n95\n00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.600\nWell, if you wanna come out here and\nlook at the data center,\n\n96\n00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.212\nwe can arrange something.\n\n97\n00:06:09.212 --> 00:06:14.310\nAnd I would say as far as your situation\n\n98\n00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.965\nfrom your side if you're like, okay, the\ndata-center is out there, it's not local.\n\n99\n00:06:17.965 --> 00:06:23.179\nMaybe it's not easy for\nyou to go out there.\n\n100\n00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.849\nOkay, you can chose not to go out there or\nyou can go out there.\n\n101\n00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.712\n>> [CROSSTALK] I take it,\nyou'd go out there then?\n\n102\n00:06:28.712 --> 00:06:30.860\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's up to you,\n\n103\n00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.130\nyou're the one that ultimately has\nthe responsible in the eyes of the law.\n\n104\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.414\nSo if you're hosting data that needs to\nbe kept private, it's regulated data,\n\n105\n00:06:40.414 --> 00:06:45.308\nif you don't wanna pay the few hundred\nbucks to go out there for a day or two,\n\n106\n00:06:45.308 --> 00:06:47.351\nor overnight, and look at it?\n\n107\n00:06:47.351 --> 00:06:48.703\nThat's on you.\n\n108\n00:06:48.703 --> 00:06:50.102\n>> Your data must not be\nworth a lot to you, right?\n\n109\n00:06:50.102 --> 00:06:52.750\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, it's like okay,\n\n110\n00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.238\nI guess you got good lawyers.\n\n111\n00:06:55.238 --> 00:06:59.160\nOr you just don't care about it enough.\n\n112\n00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.650\nI would say it's worth that.\n\n113\n00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.220\nMost places I have found will say yeah,\n\n114\n00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.720\nif you want to go to our facility,\nI'm sure we can arrange something.\n\n115\n00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.920\nIt's not necessarily a common request, but\n\n116\n00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.690\nit is something that most of\nthem are willing to accommodate.\n\n117\n00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.466\nThey'll say okay, well, we don't really\nhave a lot of customers come in,\n\n118\n00:07:16.466 --> 00:07:17.653\nwon't want to do that.\n\n119\n00:07:17.653 --> 00:07:21.706\nBut, yeah, we could see about\narranging a tour or whatever.\n\n120\n00:07:21.706 --> 00:07:26.740\nAnd you can ask your questions and\ndo whatever with it.\n\n121\n00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.200\nI've seen many companies that do that.\n\n122\n00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.940\nAnd heck, a lot of companies,\nthey figure they're proud to do it.\n\n123\n00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.640\nThe IT people there and\nthe site manager, whatever,\n\n124\n00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.910\nis really proud to show this\nstuff off to a customer.\n\n125\n00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.344\nAnd hopefully, they're not so\n\n126\n00:07:41.344 --> 00:07:44.381\nproud they're giving you\nthe information on every little detail.\n\n127\n00:07:44.381 --> 00:07:46.989\nIt's like, well,\nhere's the password for that.\n\n128\n00:07:46.989 --> 00:07:49.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I hope they're not doing stuff\n\n129\n00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.240\nlike that.\n\n130\n00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.640\nBut they're willing to show\nyou what they've done.\n\n131\n00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.541\nAnd that gives me an ideal opportunity.\n\n132\n00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:04.471\nIf I'm going out someplace to look\nat that Cloud hosting facility,\n\n133\n00:08:04.471 --> 00:08:09.058\nI would say, Go out there,\ntake a tour of the place.\n\n134\n00:08:09.058 --> 00:08:12.994\nSee if you can take a couple of people\nthere even to lunch of something and\n\n135\n00:08:12.994 --> 00:08:16.813\ntalk with them, and get to know who\nyou're hosting your stuff with.\n\n136\n00:08:16.813 --> 00:08:21.753\nIt may seem like that's kind of\nridiculous, take the out to lunch,\n\n137\n00:08:21.753 --> 00:08:25.651\nhey, it let's me kind of get\na feel of who's there and\n\n138\n00:08:25.651 --> 00:08:31.307\nkind of ask some more questions and\nsee if I'm comfortable with everything.\n\n139\n00:08:31.307 --> 00:08:34.409\nSo it's definitely worth your while,\nand like I said,\n\n140\n00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:38.770\nmost places are willing to do it, and they\nhave all sorts of stuff set up for it.\n\n141\n00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.756\nHeck, I know of a place down, or\n\n142\n00:08:41.756 --> 00:08:46.580\ntwo places at least, right off the top of\nmy head, down in the Silicon Valley area.\n\n143\n00:08:47.635 --> 00:08:51.020\nThey're you ask them,\ncome on in any time you want.\n\n144\n00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.400\nYou can come and take a look at it.\n\n145\n00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.590\nOne place has got it if your a customer or\n\n146\n00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:03.840\na perspective customer, you can go in\nthere and they have their data center.\n\n147\n00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.869\nInside the building its got a big\nglass wall on the side of it and\n\n148\n00:09:06.869 --> 00:09:10.366\nyou can see the control center there,\nthe people that are monitoring,\n\n149\n00:09:10.366 --> 00:09:12.183\ntaking care of it, you can see that.\n\n150\n00:09:12.183 --> 00:09:17.045\nAnd you can say hey, my bits are stored\nsomewhere in there, I don't know where but\n\n151\n00:09:17.045 --> 00:09:19.319\nthey're stored somewhere in there.\n\n152\n00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:24.172\nYou know, they're more than\nwilling to say hey, come on in and\n\n153\n00:09:24.172 --> 00:09:27.469\nyou can talk to these people if you want,\nor\n\n154\n00:09:27.469 --> 00:09:31.150\na salesperson will tell you,\nhey, whatever.\n\n155\n00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.410\nSo it's a valid question to ask, a valid\n\n156\n00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:42.420\nquestion to be asking them to respond to.\n\n157\n00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.260\nAnd then, yeah, if I'm putting stuff\non the line I'm going out there.\n\n158\n00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.624\nI don't care where it is.\n\n159\n00:09:48.624 --> 00:09:50.918\n>> [LAUGH] All right and\nthen you mentioned the four Ds and\n\n160\n00:09:50.918 --> 00:09:53.223\nthen we started talking\nabout perimeter security.\n\n161\n00:09:53.223 --> 00:09:55.464\nYou mentioned the four Ds\nof perimeter security.\n\n162\n00:09:55.464 --> 00:10:02.650\n>> Yeah, they kind of change that\njust a bit with the four Ds.\n\n163\n00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:05.300\nLet me kind of change that\na bit instead of the four Ds,\n\n164\n00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.540\nthat could be a little messy.\n\n165\n00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.300\nIt's really, we're talking\nabout the perimeter security.\n\n166\n00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.540\nRemember when you're looking at it, let's\ngo back to something that we've learned in\n\n167\n00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.710\nother places, the technical administrative\nand physical side of things.\n\n168\n00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.100\nThat's the way I look at it, is that what\nyour parameter has to consist of is you're\n\n169\n00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:26.200\ngonna have technical measures, so\nthat's your firewalls or routers and\n\n170\n00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.790\nall that good stuff that goes with it,\nyour administrative is your rules and\n\n171\n00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:35.900\npolicies, so\nI talked about escort procedures, so\n\n172\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.660\nthere's a rule for\nif someone can bring someone in\n\n173\n00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.750\nescorted or they have to be signed in or\nwhat have you.\n\n174\n00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.700\nThere's a policy for\nhow vendors can deliver stuff and\n\n175\n00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.700\nwho's allowed, vendor wise,\nto go in there, hours that are allowed for\n\n176\n00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.710\nphysical access, all that good stuff.\n\n177\n00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.490\nAnd then you've got the physical,\nwhich would be things like your cameras,\n\n178\n00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.470\nyour card readers, your fences,\nall sorts of things.\n\n179\n00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:07.158\nAnd you really kinda wanna be\naware of all those things,\n\n180\n00:11:07.158 --> 00:11:12.262\ncuz all those things need to be\nlooked at kind of thoroughly.\n\n181\n00:11:12.262 --> 00:11:18.152\nReally it's, some of that stuff, I've seen\ndata centers or seen some hosting places,\n\n182\n00:11:18.152 --> 00:11:22.942\nthis was a little bit ago,\nit wasn't necessarily a cloud environment,\n\n183\n00:11:22.942 --> 00:11:27.912\nbut I've heard that you can get the same\nthing with the cloud environment.\n\n184\n00:11:27.912 --> 00:11:31.073\nIf you're outsourcing your\ncloud to someone, but\n\n185\n00:11:31.073 --> 00:11:34.601\nthey're basically doing\nan outsourced private cloud so\n\n186\n00:11:34.601 --> 00:11:39.920\nthey're not doing it internally you're\noutsourcing it to another location.\n\n187\n00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.630\nBut it's still essentially\na private cloud.\n\n188\n00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:47.590\nThere are some vendors that will say\nwell you can outsource your private\n\n189\n00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.690\ncloud to us, we'll take care of everything\nfor you but it's only your cloud.\n\n190\n00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:55.130\nWell, they'll allow you\nto access that stuff and\n\n191\n00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:58.960\nwhat happens is that some of those places\nthey just have a security guard or\n\n192\n00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.850\ntwo there, and they have,\nonce you go in the building,\n\n193\n00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:08.470\nyou walk past the security guard and\nthere's a reader\n\n194\n00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:13.220\nwhere you put your hand on it,\nyou swipe your card and the door unlocks.\n\n195\n00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.690\nYou can go in and access your section of\nit and they have you all on camera and\n\n196\n00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.680\neverything as being\nthe person that's in there.\n\n197\n00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:20.970\nYou're checked in and everything.\n\n198\n00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.880\nSo there are some places like that.\n\n199\n00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.910\nYou're gonna wanna see if\nthat's actually in place and\n\n200\n00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.960\nhow robust the security measures are.\n\n201\n00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:32.180\nYou're gonna wanna see if\nthose security guards can be.\n\n202\n00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.560\nThe security guards,\nhow diligent are they?\n\n203\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:35.448\nThose type of things.\n\n204\n00:12:35.448 --> 00:12:39.150\nI remember hearing one case years ago,\n\n205\n00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:45.790\nwhere someone was able to just with kinda\nof a somewhat realistic looking ID badge,\n\n206\n00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.890\njust walk right past security guards, and\nright in the data facility no problem.\n\n207\n00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.050\nYou know they're just\ngonna figure oh well.\n\n208\n00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:53.394\nYeah I remember you.\n\n209\n00:12:53.394 --> 00:12:57.070\nWell, it happened in this case\nthe person's ID had been revoked and\n\n210\n00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.350\nso it had been taken.\n\n211\n00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.180\nWell they just had one that looked,\n\n212\n00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:06.420\nhappened to stick it in the little\nplastic sleeve and flash it really quick,\n\n213\n00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.190\nor had it on their belt or something,\nand just walked right by and\n\n214\n00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:13.560\nsince the person recognized the face and\nsaw the ID, what they thought was an ID,\n\n215\n00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.158\nthey just walked right on past, so\nit's a little social engineering there.\n\n216\n00:13:18.158 --> 00:13:24.510\nYou kind of gotta make sure that what\ntype of procedures they have in place and\n\n217\n00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.460\nmechanisms they have in place to protect\nthat perimeter and make things safe so\n\n218\n00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.168\nyou don't have an incident.\n\n219\n00:13:29.168 --> 00:13:31.940\nThat's really what we're trying to\navoid is make sure there's a nice,\n\n220\n00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:35.290\nthere's several layers around\nthat defense in depth model,\n\n221\n00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:37.540\nmaking sure everything's nice,\nsafe and sound, and protected.\n\n222\n00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:42.190\nBut just make sure that those\nthings are adequate for you.\n\n223\n00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:45.740\n>> And I think we're gonna\ntalk about cloud back up and\n\n224\n00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.620\nsome kind of disaster\nrecovery services as well.\n\n225\n00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:53.430\n>> Yeah, that would be the next\nstep in our security is that we\n\n226\n00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:57.510\nknow that those layers,\nthat no matter how well we do our job,\n\n227\n00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.660\nthere's no such thing as 100% so we gotta\nbe prepared for the other side of things.\n\n228\n00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:04.630\nNow, we did talk about backups\nin a previous episode.\n\n229\n00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:07.750\nWe talked about onsite,\noffsite replication.\n\n230\n00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.930\nAnd all that good stuff, and\nso that stuff still applies.\n\n231\n00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:17.790\nWhat we're looking at here is not just\nhaving those, that media, whatever it is.\n\n232\n00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:22.185\nRemember, it's one thing to have a stack\nof, we'll just say a stack of tapes\n\n233\n00:14:22.185 --> 00:14:24.910\nsitting here, there's one thing to\nhave a stack of tapes sitting here and\n\n234\n00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.320\nquite another to say okay,\nif something just goes through and\n\n235\n00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:31.150\nblows all the stuff away and\nit's gone, how do\n\n236\n00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:35.760\nyou go from having the stack of tapes to\nhaving everything back the way it was.\n\n237\n00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.250\nThat's the thing that\na lot of people neglect.\n\n238\n00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:42.540\nOr neglected at one point was,\nhey, we backed everything up here.\n\n239\n00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.770\nWell, that's good you know,\nhey, I'm a smart person.\n\n240\n00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:52.060\nWell, there's something to\nget from here to there.\n\n241\n00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.268\nYou don't have a plan, you know?\n\n242\n00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:55.960\n[LAUGH] So that's what you want.\n\n243\n00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.710\nYou wanna make sure that there's\na process in place that you're aware of,\n\n244\n00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.060\nthat you're comfortable with,\n\n245\n00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.220\nthat maybe is something that even\nincorporates what your requirements are.\n\n246\n00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.540\nIt really should incorporate\nyour requirements for,\n\n247\n00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.160\njust as a matter of fact.\n\n248\n00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.560\nYou should be as the client be able\nto say, well I need this amount,\n\n249\n00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.380\nI need this turn around time,\nI need this type of responsiveness, these\n\n250\n00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.830\nare the responsible parties that you're\ngonna talk to in the event of a disaster.\n\n251\n00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:23.620\nWho do I call?\n\n252\n00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:28.047\nMake sure all those avenues of\ncommunication are open ahead of time so\n\n253\n00:15:28.047 --> 00:15:31.633\nif a disaster does happen or\nan incidence does happens,\n\n254\n00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:36.060\nwhatever it that happens to be\nthat people know who to talk to.\n\n255\n00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.460\nThat's one of the things we said,\n\n256\n00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.690\nheck, we said it in our forensic\nside of things, and it applies here.\n\n257\n00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.003\nWe were talking about forensics,\n\n258\n00:15:43.003 --> 00:15:48.105\none of the things we said about setting\nup a lab and setting up the whole deal,\n\n259\n00:15:48.105 --> 00:15:52.968\nwe said that in addition to having all\nthe equipment and the knowledge and\n\n260\n00:15:52.968 --> 00:15:56.901\nall that either built into the company or\nsomeplace else.\n\n261\n00:15:56.901 --> 00:16:02.239\nIf you need law enforcement, or\nsomebody like the local law enforcement,\n\n262\n00:16:02.239 --> 00:16:04.706\nFBI, whoever that happens to be.\n\n263\n00:16:04.706 --> 00:16:06.900\nFind out who those\nare before anything happens.\n\n264\n00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:11.162\nGet to, make sure you know who those\ncontacts are so if you have a cyber crime\n\n265\n00:16:11.162 --> 00:16:14.490\nor something committed,\nyou know exactly who to talk to.\n\n266\n00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:18.160\nYou're not fishing around for\nthese contact information.\n\n267\n00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.440\nAnd even if you do have\nthat contact information,\n\n268\n00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.390\nyou don't want to be in a situation where\nthat person is like, well, who are you?\n\n269\n00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.620\nWhy are you calling me?\n\n270\n00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.220\nThey may not have talked to you in awhile,\nbut if you've made prior\n\n271\n00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.880\ncontact with them they're like, okay,\nyeah, we haven't talked in awhile.\n\n272\n00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.380\nWhat can I help you with?\n\n273\n00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:41.180\nSo there's that familiarity there and\nit speeds responsiveness and\n\n274\n00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.180\nthe effectiveness of your\ndisaster recovery process up.\n\n275\n00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.830\nSo make sure all those things are set up.\n\n276\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:50.220\nAnd since you are talking an outside\nvendor now, potentially talking an outside\n\n277\n00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.650\nvendor, you have those avenues\nof communication set up.\n\n278\n00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.670\nYou've got established procedures.\n\n279\n00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.280\nBut don't forget, when you talk about\nestablished procedures there's also\n\n280\n00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.420\nthe question of audits and even testing\nto make sure those procedures work.\n\n281\n00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.710\nI don't just want to have a stack\nof paper up there and say, hey,\n\n282\n00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.560\nwe got a stack of paper here and\neverything looks like it's in order.\n\n283\n00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.210\nThat's really good and it's all numbered.\n\n284\n00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.290\nIt looks pretty.\n\n285\n00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:12.510\nWe're in good shape.\n\n286\n00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.750\nNo, test those things out.\n\n287\n00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.810\nDrill.\nMake sure those things are going\n\n288\n00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.720\nto be up to snuff if\nthey're ever called upon.\n\n289\n00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.420\nAnd the reality is\nthe longer things go on,\n\n290\n00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.910\nthe more likely it's gonna be that\nyou're gonna have an incident.\n\n291\n00:17:25.910 --> 00:17:27.390\nThat's just the way it works.\n\n292\n00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.910\nIt's like a pull the slot\nmachine in Vegas.\n\n293\n00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.620\nYou stay there long enough\nit will eventually hit.\n\n294\n00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.562\nIt's just the question of when,\nnot a question of if.\n\n295\n00:17:37.562 --> 00:17:41.960\nSo that's, you wanna make sure\nthose procedures are in place and\n\n296\n00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.580\nindeed, if you are in a regulated\nindustry, you cannot get away.\n\n297\n00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:50.810\nWe just saying you have a procedure there,\nthey're like, have those ever been tested?\n\n298\n00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:52.500\nThey will say that in some cases.\n\n299\n00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.200\nHave those ever been tested?\n\n300\n00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.620\nDo you know that they work?\n\n301\n00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.200\nWhy are you putting all your confidence\nin a stack of paperwork there?\n\n302\n00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.420\nSo make sure that you have a process\nin place, you have responsible parties,\n\n303\n00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.830\npoints of contact.\n\n304\n00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:07.954\nYou have all the different\nlevels in place.\n\n305\n00:18:07.954 --> 00:18:12.230\nWe don't necessarily need to get into\nevery detail of disaster recovery.\n\n306\n00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.080\nAnd business continuity planning\nright at this very moment\n\n307\n00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.300\nwhere we are gonna talk about\nsome more of it going forward.\n\n308\n00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.760\nBut you do need to have established\nprocedures and have them in there,\n\n309\n00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.130\nand have them in place and\nbe familiar with them and how, and\n\n310\n00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:30.460\nbe aware of that there's also gonna be\nsome lags in there and stuff like that.\n\n311\n00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.161\nSo it could be kind of\ninteresting proposition but\n\n312\n00:18:34.161 --> 00:18:38.540\nhopefully not so\ninteresting that you are losing stuff.\n\n313\n00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.015\nI don't mean that sense.\n\n314\n00:18:41.015 --> 00:18:41.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There you go.\n\n315\n00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:47.760\n>> And then we've got to do\nour due diligence, right?\n\n316\n00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.100\n>> Yeah and yeah, the due diligence\nwould be a big portion of this.\n\n317\n00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:57.010\nDue diligence just is going back\nto what I was just speaking about,\n\n318\n00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:03.410\nis due diligence is,\nare you making sure that they're there?\n\n319\n00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.390\nAre they valid?\n\n320\n00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:05.820\nAre they compliant?\n\n321\n00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:10.542\nYeah, make sure all those\nthings are present before\n\n322\n00:19:10.542 --> 00:19:15.492\nyou start saying, okay,\nwell, hey, my job is done.\n\n323\n00:19:15.492 --> 00:19:21.397\nOne of the things, since this is an ISC\ncredential we're prepping you for,\n\n324\n00:19:21.397 --> 00:19:26.470\nif you go back to the stuff with\nthe CISSP, there's a whole domain\n\n325\n00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:31.289\nthat deals with disaster recovery and\ncontinuity planning.\n\n326\n00:19:31.289 --> 00:19:36.289\nAnd we learn in there that it's\nthere's a whole development process\n\n327\n00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:41.632\nto be CPNGRP that goes on a place that\ntells us when they're gonna kick in,\n\n328\n00:19:41.632 --> 00:19:43.975\nwhen, what should be in place.\n\n329\n00:19:43.975 --> 00:19:45.790\nWhat's need to be consider?\n\n330\n00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:50.748\nBut that does cover, even though they\ndon't necessarily, in that domain,\n\n331\n00:19:50.748 --> 00:19:53.036\nsmack you right in the face with it,\n\n332\n00:19:53.036 --> 00:19:58.250\nthey do include provisions to make sure\nthat you are doing sanity checks on this.\n\n333\n00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:02.645\nTo make sure things are covered,\nto make sure it's modeled correctly, so\n\n334\n00:20:02.645 --> 00:20:06.691\nin the event that something happens,\nyou have a procedure in place or\n\n335\n00:20:06.691 --> 00:20:09.910\nyou at least have someone\nthat can take charge.\n\n336\n00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:14.610\nAnd when that unknown or unexpected event\noccurs, I shouldn't say unexpected,\n\n337\n00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.320\nthey're all unexpected [LAUGH] I guess.\n\n338\n00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.180\nIf you expected them it'd\nbe a whole different thing.\n\n339\n00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.120\nBut the unaccounted for ones,\ncuz you can account for\n\n340\n00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.782\nthings like,\ndepending on the area you're in, fire,\n\n341\n00:20:26.782 --> 00:20:31.860\nflood, mud slide, earthquakes,\nwhatever you pick.\n\n342\n00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:36.340\nYou can account for those things and\nright procedures for them.\n\n343\n00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.020\nBut then there's other things that,\n\n344\n00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.440\nwife just happen to throw a curve ball at\nyou all of sudden you gotta deal with it.\n\n345\n00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.770\nSo what you want to do is you want\nto have other procedures that say or\n\n346\n00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.740\nanother procedure that says,\nhey here's the ranking person that\n\n347\n00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.050\nshould be contacted and\nhere's the whole food chain.\n\n348\n00:20:55.050 --> 00:21:00.050\nThat's the person that can make\na decision in that specific situation and\n\n349\n00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.320\nwe can decide what we wanna do from there.\n\n350\n00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.090\nThat's your due diligence, making\nsure your butt's covered in the event\n\n351\n00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.690\nthat something or anything happens,\nyou can account for it.\n\n352\n00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:13.830\nYou don't wanna be caught flat footed and\nrunning around with your hair on fire.\n\n353\n00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.660\nWell, not literally.\n\n354\n00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:15.449\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n355\n00:21:15.449 --> 00:21:19.100\ntrying to figure out what\nthe solution's gonna be.\n\n356\n00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.980\nThey're not gonna look at that,\n\n357\n00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.830\nlook if you have a regulatory\ncommission or a history in place.\n\n358\n00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:29.260\nThey're not gonna look at that kindly if\nyou happen to mess that up or flub it.\n\n359\n00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.860\nThey're not gonna like that.\n\n360\n00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.740\nThey're gonna look at why did it\ntake you so long to respond to it.\n\n361\n00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.120\nI think of situations where\nthat relate to due diligence,\n\n362\n00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.230\nwhich company should\nhave been prepared for.\n\n363\n00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.800\nI think stuff like,\ncuz we have numerous over last few years.\n\n364\n00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.410\nWe have privacy breaches,\nthink of the privacy breaches we've had,\n\n365\n00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:52.780\nwhere you heard that several\nmonths down the road, or\n\n366\n00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.690\nsometime down the road,\nit was reported that it happened.\n\n367\n00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.630\nMost of those companies got in hot water,\neven if they didn't get fined.\n\n368\n00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:05.130\nThey got in trouble for that,\nespecially if they were regulated saying,\n\n369\n00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.330\nyou're supposed to report that within\n24 hours, or as soon as it happens.\n\n370\n00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:13.060\nYou're not supposed to tell us two,\nthree weeks down the road, guess what,\n\n371\n00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.870\nbreak out the checkbook,\nwe're gonna fine you for that.\n\n372\n00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:20.610\nThey can very readily do that and\nthere's been numerous cases where even if\n\n373\n00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.380\nthe regulatory commission hasn't\ncome out and said anything.\n\n374\n00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.140\nThe consumers have come out.\n\n375\n00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.110\nYou look at places like,\nit's not necessarily a cloud solution, but\n\n376\n00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:34.020\nyou look at an incident handling\nprocess like Target had.\n\n377\n00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.540\nTarget, they had that\nbreach a couple years ago.\n\n378\n00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.380\nWhen they had that breach,\n\n379\n00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:45.200\nthey were a little slow at informing\npeople that there had been a breach.\n\n380\n00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.910\nThey're getting sued for that.\n\n381\n00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:50.250\nSome of suits are coming\nabout saying we should've\n\n382\n00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.700\nknown earlier on this was happening.\n\n383\n00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.390\nSo, we didn't get our identity stolen or\nwe could have shut accounts down or\n\n384\n00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:00.290\nwhatever to make sure that\nwe didn't become a victim.\n\n385\n00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:04.610\nAnd so, because you told us a week after\nthe fact, or two weeks after the fact,\n\n386\n00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:10.030\nsomeone had all that time between exposure\nand when you told us and we could\n\n387\n00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:15.530\nshut the stuff down, to kind of go on\na spending spree or whatever, on our dime.\n\n388\n00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.190\nAnd even though we're not responsible for\nit,\n\n389\n00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.940\nwe're the one that has to deal\nwith the mess to clean up.\n\n390\n00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.378\nSo you have to do your due diligence and\nmake sure these things work.\n\n391\n00:23:23.378 --> 00:23:26.440\nThat's where the testing comes in.\n\n392\n00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.610\nThat's where the familiarity comes in,\nestablishing those communication\n\n393\n00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:33.380\nchannels early and\nmaking sure you know what the rules are.\n\n394\n00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.786\nAnd all that comes in.\n\n395\n00:23:35.786 --> 00:23:39.608\nI mean, heck, I'd even, as part of\nthis one things we talked about for\n\n396\n00:23:39.608 --> 00:23:43.330\nsecurities having a separate\nteam that deals with security.\n\n397\n00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:46.090\nAnd not always something\nthat's gonna be done, but\n\n398\n00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.750\nif you really want to play by the rules,\nyou have a separate team that's secure\n\n399\n00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:54.010\nthat's accountable to, no one in the food\nchain except the person at the top.\n\n400\n00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.780\nAnd one of the reasons for that is,\nif security team is doing this and\n\n401\n00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:02.550\nan incident happens, they're the ones that\nare gonna say, we're reporting directly to\n\n402\n00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:06.230\nthe CEO on this one with them, cuz\nthey're the ones ultimately responsible.\n\n403\n00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:11.330\nLet them decide what it is because if\nthat security team is embedded with IT or\n\n404\n00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.260\nany place else,\nthey got that food chain to go up and\n\n405\n00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.740\nsomeone's going to decide, woah,\nI don't want to lose my job over this.\n\n406\n00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.720\nAnd that can very well happen or\nit has to kind of\n\n407\n00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.620\nwork its way up the whole thing until it\nfinally gets the CEO and by that time,\n\n408\n00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.110\npeople kinda deciding do we really\nwant to do something about this?\n\n409\n00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.280\nIs there a way to fix it,\nwhat do we do, they're freaking out.\n\n410\n00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.730\nThere could be a lag there.\n\n411\n00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.557\nAnd by the time it does get reported,\nit's too late and\n\n412\n00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:39.300\nyou're still end up with a lawsuit or\na bad reputation or something like that.\n\n413\n00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.490\nYou really kinda gotta do your due\ndiligence to make sure these procedures\n\n414\n00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:44.450\nare in place.\n\n415\n00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.180\nWe know how things are being managed.\n\n416\n00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:50.670\nThat people know who, if they detect\nan incident, who to report to.\n\n417\n00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:52.710\nThey know who at the cloud\nprovider to report to,\n\n418\n00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:56.490\nmake sure the cloud provider is competent\nif you're going with public one.\n\n419\n00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.690\nMake sure they're competent\nat dealing with that.\n\n420\n00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:00.320\nThat would be another issue.\n\n421\n00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:04.120\nThere's quite a difference between\nbeing technically competent and\n\n422\n00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.410\nbeing able to keep a cool head\nin the event of a disaster.\n\n423\n00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.000\nAnd you've gotta account for\nthat because that cloud provider,\n\n424\n00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:16.400\nmost of them are gonna be in the business\nsolely, just trying to make money.\n\n425\n00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.720\nAnd I'm not trying to be paranoid or\n\n426\n00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.340\nbeing pessimistic about that,\nthat's what they're there for,\n\n427\n00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:26.760\nthey're there to make money, to sell you a\nservice, and to make a profit off of that.\n\n428\n00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.250\nThe last thing they want to do,\n\n429\n00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:32.000\nin most cases, is to have to tell\nyou that we had an incident.\n\n430\n00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.821\nSo, you gotta make sure that if there's an\nincident that you have faith that they're\n\n431\n00:25:35.821 --> 00:25:38.653\ngonna report it, and\nthat they're competent to deal with it.\n\n432\n00:25:38.653 --> 00:25:40.775\nAnd they can work with your people and\n\n433\n00:25:40.775 --> 00:25:44.900\nsatisfy your requirements\nduring that time of a crisis.\n\n434\n00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.960\n>> All right,\nwe found a lot of great information there.\n\n435\n00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.080\nAnything else we want to throw into\nthe mix before we wrap this one up.\n\n436\n00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.510\n>> I think we've got it at least for\nright now.\n\n437\n00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.048\n>> Okay, all right, we heard it folks.\n\n438\n00:25:56.048 --> 00:25:59.030\nSo signing off for\nITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n439\n00:25:59.030 --> 00:25:59.950\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n440\n00:25:59.950 -->

00:00:14.130\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.670\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriono.\n\n5\n00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.820\nAnd in this episode, Sean we're\ngonna be talking about all kinds,\n\n6\n00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.590\nall kinds of letters\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n7\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.810\n>> That's all I know now\n\n8\n00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.600\nwe're gonna be talking about business\ncontinuity, and disaster recovery and\n\n9\n00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.260\na couple other things.\n\n10\n00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.020\nSo bunch of acronyms that\nwe're gonna define and\n\n11\n00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.922\nthen go over those concepts right.\n\n12\n00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:33.710\n>> Yup that's what the name\nof the game is here.\n\n13\n00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.843\nAlphabet soup it's not just for\nbreakfast anymore\n\n14\n00:00:36.843 --> 00:00:37.743\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:39.248\n>> Or whatever it is for\n\n16\n00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:39.917\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:39.917 --> 00:00:42.600\n>> So yeah, what we're basically doing is\n\n18\n00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.420\nwe're continuing on our discussion\nfrom the previous episode,\n\n19\n00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.970\nwhen we started talking about, you know,\n\n20\n00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.460\njust protecting the actual systems and\nthe data itself.\n\n21\n00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.250\nI mean, a lot of stuff we've been\nfocused on, up to this point has been\n\n22\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.150\ngetting stuff into the cloud and\nconsiderations that goes along with that.\n\n23\n00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.490\nNow what we're doing is, we're talking\nabout the protection mechanisms\n\n24\n00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.690\nafter everything has been put in place.\n\n25\n00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.930\nBecause it just doesn't end with getting\nit over and keeping it safe and sound.\n\n26\n00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.860\nOnce it's there, and\nnot getting that whole process done it's\n\n27\n00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.630\nbasically saying after the fact what\nhappens when the unexpected occurs.\n\n28\n00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.080\nSo that's what we're dealing with here,\n\n29\n00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.220\nwe're talking about business continuity\nmanagement, business continuity planning.\n\n30\n00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.120\nSo BCM BCP,\nthey were talking about DRP which is\n\n31\n00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.670\nDisaster Recovery Planning, and\nDRM which is the management aspect of it,\n\n32\n00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.730\nit's not digital rights management\njust in case you guys were wondering.\n\n33\n00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.510\nEven though that might actually play\na role, it's not gonna play a role here.\n\n34\n00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.280\nWhen we talk about those things,\n\n35\n00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.550\njust to kind of expand upon them- We\ntalked about business continuity planning.\n\n36\n00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.650\nBusiness continuity planning is\nputting something in place that says,\n\n37\n00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.900\nwhat we wanna do is if there's, something\nhits, an incident whatever it is hits,\n\n38\n00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.760\nthat we can maintain some\ncontinuity of operations.\n\n39\n00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.070\nThat's the whole idea.\n\n40\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.910\nContinuity operations here meaning that\n\n41\n00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.660\nwe're able to sustain\nsome level of service.\n\n42\n00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.200\nSo if something hits we have some level\nof service that can be maintained.\n\n43\n00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.940\nWe're not, you know,\ncompletely off the grid and lost.\n\n44\n00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.582\nWhich in a lot of cases would\nbe a completely devastating hit.\n\n45\n00:02:22.582 --> 00:02:28.150\nI mean you think of anybody\nthat's doing e commerce, banking,\n\n46\n00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.440\nany of those critical industries, they\nlose that stuff, that's a big problem.\n\n47\n00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.260\n>> There's a lot of industries and\nsituations that we haven't mentioned.\n\n48\n00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.030\nWe've just focused on a few.\n\n49\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.200\nThere's a lot of people that\nare using the cloud that you\n\n50\n00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.370\nmay not necessarily think of.\n\n51\n00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.950\nIt could be stuff like utilities.\n\n52\n00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.660\nWhat happens if a utility\nis sending data back and\n\n53\n00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.660\nforth through the cloud and\nrelying on that infrastructure.\n\n54\n00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.960\nThey don't have the business\ncontinuity plan in place.\n\n55\n00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.910\nYou've all of a sudden got a big,\nbig problem.\n\n56\n00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.390\nSo we need to look ahead to figure out how\n\n57\n00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.840\nwe're going to maintain some\ncontinuity of operations.\n\n58\n00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.243\nSo when that event hits, whatever it\nhappens to be, that we can maintain some\n\n59\n00:03:07.243 --> 00:03:11.713\nbasic level of services or at least know\nif everything gets, or if a good part of\n\n60\n00:03:11.713 --> 00:03:16.640\nit, gets knocked out and takes us to\nthe point where we are completely offline.\n\n61\n00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.460\nHow what we can do to restore\nit back to a point where we\n\n62\n00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.980\nhave those minimal services again.\n\n63\n00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.090\nMaybe not everything back, but\nwe have at least enough to get\n\n64\n00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.090\nour basic functions done or\nthe necessary done.\n\n65\n00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.820\nSo that's what we're talking about now.\n\n66\n00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.260\nHow do you really plan for that?\n\n67\n00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.880\nWell, it's really not that much\ndifferent than what you may have had, or\n\n68\n00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.150\nare already doing, rather,\nin your traditional environment.\n\n69\n00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.340\nYou need to figure out what\nthose core services are.\n\n70\n00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.970\nYes, you've moved things from your\ntraditional environment over to the cloud.\n\n71\n00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.450\nIt's just a matter of\ntaking that technology, and\n\n72\n00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.800\nthat set up a new account and now\nfiguring out what the basic services are,\n\n73\n00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.900\nand what you need to have\njust at your business level,\n\n74\n00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.810\nand your best operation level and\nyour process level and all that.\n\n75\n00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.820\nAnd then factor in the cloud side of it\nto figure out, okay, what do I need to\n\n76\n00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.895\nmaintain that connectivity to the cloud if\nyou're using a public could, of course.\n\n77\n00:04:11.895 --> 00:04:14.810\nYou know, what you need to do to maintain\nconnectivity, what you're going to do for\n\n78\n00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.380\nbackup services just in case, what happens\nif you're not the one that gets impacted,\n\n79\n00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.100\nit's the cloud provider that gets hit.\n\n80\n00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.660\nThat's a very real possibility\nhere that that cloud provider\n\n81\n00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.550\nif you choose maybe a smaller one, or\none that has just a single location or\n\n82\n00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.319\na couple of locations, there's\na possibility that if they get hit.\n\n83\n00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.220\nWhere they're completely offline,\nor they're hit\n\n84\n00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.280\nwhere enough things are taken down where\nthey can't service all their clients.\n\n85\n00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.460\nIn which case that's gonna impact you.\n\n86\n00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.660\nI know there's been businesses that\nhave been put in that situation, and\n\n87\n00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.120\nI'm sure you've heard of it yourself.\n\n88\n00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.940\n>> What do we do in this case like that?\n\n89\n00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.730\nHow can we protect ourselves\nagainst something like that?\n\n90\n00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.030\nA lot of it's planning ahead.\n\n91\n00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.710\nFirst of all, once you do your assessment,\nand you do your qualitative,\n\n92\n00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.470\nquantitative assessments,\nand all that good stuff.\n\n93\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.370\nThe cyst for example teaches us,\nso if you've gone through all that\n\n94\n00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.080\nit's the same type of deal here, it's just\nfiguring what those core services are.\n\n95\n00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.000\nAnd figuring out what you can do to\nprevent having a single point of failure,\n\n96\n00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.730\nor having a catastrophic loss.\n\n97\n00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.520\nYou need to figure out what minimum\nservices are, build in a buffer, so\n\n98\n00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.950\nyou're not at a point where you hit\nthose minimum services directly.\n\n99\n00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.460\nYou at least have some buffer in there,\nand\n\n100\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.830\nthen build your stuff up\nappropriately to make sure.\n\n101\n00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.610\nFor example, one of the big\nissues that comes to mind for\n\n102\n00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.680\na lot of IT people when they initially\nhit the cloud is well, what do I do\n\n103\n00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.990\nif I push my stuff out into the cloud,\nand that connectivity is severed.\n\n104\n00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:52.730\nWell, I think that's kind of\na little bit of a panic moment or\n\n105\n00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.450\na copout really, and I'm not trying\nto pick on anybody but gives and\n\n106\n00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.330\ntends to be a bit of a copout because.\n\n107\n00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.630\nIf I told you, if I told most veteran\nIT people, cloud excluded, what are you\n\n108\n00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.610\ngoing to do to ensure that line you\nhave to the outside world, the internet,\n\n109\n00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.000\nif it's severed, what are you going to do\nto ensure that you have some connectivity?\n\n110\n00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.170\nYou could probably come up\nwith a lot of stuff already,\n\n111\n00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.270\nall the way down to dial-up.\n\n112\n00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.520\nEven though you don't like it,\n\n113\n00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.810\nyou could have something like\ndial-up as your fall back.\n\n114\n00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.700\nYou could go to a,\nyou could have that one provider give you,\n\n115\n00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.080\nlet's say a T1 line, and go to another\nprovider to give you another T1 line.\n\n116\n00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.600\nSo if one vendor gets hit,\nit's unlikely that the other one gets hit.\n\n117\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.020\nThere's a lot of strategies, that\ngroundwork's already been laid and done.\n\n118\n00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.640\nSo you know in that case if you need\nto maintain continuity of operations,\n\n119\n00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.630\nyou know how to do it.\n\n120\n00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.110\nThat's not something that's necessarily\ndependent entirely on the cloud,\n\n121\n00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.320\nit's not unique to the cloud environment.\n\n122\n00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.360\nYou still just need to maintain\nconnectivity to outside world, so,\n\n123\n00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.870\ngo back to what you've been doing,\nfor all all this time.\n\n124\n00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.765\nOkay, let's just face it though.\n\n125\n00:06:56.765 --> 00:06:57.750\nDial-up ain't gonna work.\n\n126\n00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:58.577\nI'm not proposing that you do that.\n\n127\n00:06:58.577 --> 00:06:59.352\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n128\n00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:02.630\nyou could have fall\nback strategies easily.\n\n129\n00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.770\nSatellite, you name it,\nthose things are there.\n\n130\n00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.880\nSo, we've already done the work there.\n\n131\n00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.910\n>> Okay.\n\n132\n00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.960\nAnd then you got disaster recovery is\nanother thing we gotta worry about.\n\n133\n00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.160\nYeah, that disaster\nrecovery again is going to,\n\n134\n00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.090\nis gonna fit a lot of our traditional,\nfor a lot of our traditional models\n\n135\n00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.000\nis that disaster recovery deals\nwith that bad thing hits.\n\n136\n00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.140\nYou've got cognitive operations but\ncognitive operations does not deal with\n\n137\n00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:38.120\nrestoring the systematic restoring of\nservices and hardware and whatever.\n\n138\n00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.690\nTo make sure your business and\neverything comes back up to a point where\n\n139\n00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:46.803\nit was before that event that\nkicked everything off happened.\n\n140\n00:07:46.803 --> 00:07:51.654\nSo you'll get your business continuity\nplan going, and that's be the key thing.\n\n141\n00:07:51.654 --> 00:07:55.387\nSo we want to make sure the business\ncontinues to operate at some level so\n\n142\n00:07:55.387 --> 00:07:56.394\nwe get that going.\n\n143\n00:07:56.394 --> 00:07:58.932\nAt some point,\nthe disaster recovery plan will kick in.\n\n144\n00:07:58.932 --> 00:08:03.053\nAnd you'll have a DRM disaster recovery\nmanagement strategy kicking in\n\n145\n00:08:03.053 --> 00:08:07.849\nthat dictates how you're gonna start going\nthrough the process of figuring out what\n\n146\n00:08:07.849 --> 00:08:11.782\nthings are more vital, which things\nare less vital, doing the BIA.\n\n147\n00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:13.600\nRemember the business impact assessment.\n\n148\n00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.140\nIf you're unfamiliar with that term,\n\n149\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.640\nwhich ones make a bigger splash\non the business if their lost.\n\n150\n00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.060\nSo we get that all squared away and\n\n151\n00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.210\nthen we just work through that\nprocess of bringing things back.\n\n152\n00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.190\nIt's not just a matter of what we talked\nabout before of something hits and\n\n153\n00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.190\nget the backup tapes and put it back in.\n\n154\n00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.000\nThat's just one small thing.\n\n155\n00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.080\nIn fact, your data may even be\nthe thing that's not impacted.\n\n156\n00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.080\nSo, what are you going to do\nin these other situations?\n\n157\n00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.250\nWhat are you going to do if\nan application somehow gets\n\n158\n00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:50.620\nimpacted or goes offline for\nwhatever reason, you know, goes offline.\n\n159\n00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.090\nThat would qualify as major incident.\n\n160\n00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.790\nSo what processes are you going\nto go through to start restoring?\n\n161\n00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.460\nWho are you going to\ncontact to bring that back?\n\n162\n00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.000\nAnd all the way, you know,\nback to a fully operational status.\n\n163\n00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.350\nCould be a, it's pretty,\ncould be pretty daunting task.\n\n164\n00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.790\nBut again, it's not anything that's\nradically different than what\n\n165\n00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:10.860\nwe've done in the past.\n\n166\n00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.170\nIt's just a lot of planning.\n\n167\n00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:16.140\n>> Yeah, especially, I mean, if, if a lot\nof these resources are out in the Cloud,\n\n168\n00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:21.250\nwe might not have as much control over the\nrestoration process or things like that?\n\n169\n00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.980\n>> Yeah, that would be the big part of it,\n\n170\n00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.480\nright there, is how much control\ndo you have over the whole thing?\n\n171\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.610\nWe've already said several\ntimes in here that\n\n172\n00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:35.040\nthere's a question over who gets control,\nand who gets control, me or them.\n\n173\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.950\nHow much responsibility do we have?\n\n174\n00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.140\nSo, if that's the case,\nwhat we're gonna do, is say okay,\n\n175\n00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.740\nif it's their responsibility,\nit's on their side.\n\n176\n00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.520\nWell then we're going to have to figure\nout what the process is going to look like\n\n177\n00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.840\nthat we can communicate with them.\n\n178\n00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.480\nOne of the things we talked about in\nthe previous episode is having those\n\n179\n00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.250\ncommunication channels open.\n\n180\n00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.090\nYou can bet if it's a public cloud and\n\n181\n00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:56.190\nyou're pushing stuff out to that side,\nwhat do you have?\n\n182\n00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:59.100\nYou've got to make sure that if you're\npushing it out there, you've got a good\n\n183\n00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.500\nclear channel of communication\nthere where you can talk to them.\n\n184\n00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:07.730\nWe talked about, well, that physical\nfacility may not be in your location.\n\n185\n00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.850\nIt may be someplace else.\n\n186\n00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.670\nIf it's in another location, well,\n\n187\n00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.350\nwhat's gonna happen,\nyou can't just drive out there.\n\n188\n00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.090\nAnd even if you could just jump on\na plane, if you owned a plane and\n\n189\n00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:20.392\nwent out there,\nthat's still going to take some time.\n\n190\n00:10:20.392 --> 00:10:25.510\nYou are gonna have to get on the cell\nphone or whatever it is and make calls and\n\n191\n00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.390\nsend emails or whatever have you to\nget that, to get those things back.\n\n192\n00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:33.114\nSo you better make sure that\npeople you put your faith in and\n\n193\n00:10:33.114 --> 00:10:36.458\nstock in, you check them out,\nyou did your audits,\n\n194\n00:10:36.458 --> 00:10:41.571\nyou made sure everything's all squared\naway prior to you having this problem.\n\n195\n00:10:41.571 --> 00:10:43.774\nBecause you definitely do not\nwanna have a failure in that,\n\n196\n00:10:43.774 --> 00:10:45.150\nbecause that can make it just worse.\n\n197\n00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:46.170\n>> Absolutely.\n\n198\n00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:48.970\nSo it really does sound like a lot\nof planning's gonna be involved.\n\n199\n00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.830\nI can imagine, you know, we can\nprobably get a little bit complacent.\n\n200\n00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:57.440\nIf I move all my email stuff\nout to this provider, you know,\n\n201\n00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.890\nI don't have anything at my house.\n\n202\n00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.550\nSo if they go down, I really need to\nmake sure I've done my research and\n\n203\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.380\nwhat their process is.\n\n204\n00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.970\nAnd SLAs are going to come\ninto play here as well, right?\n\n205\n00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.200\n>> Yeah, there's a lot of\ndifferent factors there and\n\n206\n00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.830\nI think you really hit\nthe nail on the head there.\n\n207\n00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:17.480\nIt's that once you offload\nit to someone else,\n\n208\n00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:22.250\nthere can be this, you know,\nwhatever, this urge or\n\n209\n00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:26.160\nthis tendency to get a little complacent\nbecause whew, it's their thing.\n\n210\n00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.550\nI've done software as a service.\n\n211\n00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.140\n>> It's in the Cloud.\n\n212\n00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.670\nIt's safe.\n\n213\n00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:29.230\nIt can't go bad.\n\n214\n00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.170\n>> Yeah, right?.\n\n215\n00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:31.480\n>> It's all good.\n\n216\n00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.050\n>> That's what it tells you that\nwe've handed it off to someone.\n\n217\n00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.590\nIt's their responsibility.\n\n218\n00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.990\nHeck, that whole stack that we've\ngone through tells us it's their\n\n219\n00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.370\nresponsibility.\n\n220\n00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.560\nOkay, you could go ahead and\nroll with that if you want.\n\n221\n00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.270\nI mean, who am I to sit here and\nsay, don't do that.\n\n222\n00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:54.040\nBut what you should be doing is make\nsure that backups are getting done and\n\n223\n00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.950\nthe proper procedures are in place.\n\n224\n00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:59.420\nBut in addition, just because backups are\ngetting done and just because they've got\n\n225\n00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.620\ntheir stuff squared away to\nprotect your data on that side,\n\n226\n00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.180\ndoesn't necessarily mean that\nbetween your business processes and\n\n227\n00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.990\ntheir side of things\nare actually gonna integrate.\n\n228\n00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:12.930\nJust and\nyou're going to hit the ground running.\n\n229\n00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:17.620\nYou may need to do a little adjustment on\nboth sides to make sure that that fits.\n\n230\n00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:20.877\nSo you're really going to want to put\nthese plans in place to see what they're\n\n231\n00:12:20.877 --> 00:12:23.980\ncapable of doing what you need done,\nand see if you can meet in the middle,\n\n232\n00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.520\nif they can make adjustments,\nwhat have you.\n\n233\n00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.810\nObviously, the nature of this will change\na bit if you've got a private cloud cuz\n\n234\n00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:33.110\na private cloud, you own it.\n\n235\n00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.160\nOr we'll say that you own it.\n\n236\n00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.480\nWe do know that we can outsource a private\ncloud, and that would still be the same\n\n237\n00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.220\ntype situation as a public\ncloud model in that case.\n\n238\n00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:47.820\nSo just because you have a privately owned\ncloud that you've outsourced to somebody,\n\n239\n00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.880\ndoesn't mean that oh,\nit is a private cloud so we own it.\n\n240\n00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.910\nYeah, you own it.\n\n241\n00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.450\nBut there's a difference between\na private cloud that's on premises and\n\n242\n00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:59.170\na private cloud that's sitting somewhere\nelse like in Virginia or what have you.\n\n243\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:05.097\nIf it's not right next to you, in some\nway, shape or form, you're now relying\n\n244\n00:13:05.097 --> 00:13:11.128\non an external party that may be looking\nat it from a different angle than you are.\n\n245\n00:13:11.128 --> 00:13:14.553\nThey're just relying on getting\nthe services back up and running, and\n\n246\n00:13:14.553 --> 00:13:16.830\nmaking sure that's the way it is.\n\n247\n00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.600\nThey may not be looking at the priorities\nthe same way that you are,\n\n248\n00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.370\nbecause you've got business processes.\n\n249\n00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.270\nThey're not part of your business.\n\n250\n00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.180\nThey're something else.\n\n251\n00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.690\nYou have to make sure those two\nare integrated and plan ahead for that.\n\n252\n00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:32.240\nSo if you do that and\nmake sure everything's all nice and\n\n253\n00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.580\npurring and licking together that way,\nthen you should be in good shape.\n\n254\n00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.650\nBut if you don't and you rely on an\nexternal party, there's gonna be a clash.\n\n255\n00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:45.100\nI've seen it, not just with the cloud but\n\n256\n00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.580\nin other places where you're trying\nto coordinate with an external party.\n\n257\n00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.690\nIt's not because they don't necessarily\ncare about helping you or anything.\n\n258\n00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.400\nIt's that,\nif you wait till the last minute or\n\n259\n00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.230\nwait till a disaster happens, now,\nyou're just kinda scrambling around,\n\n260\n00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:03.260\ntrying to make procedure and\npolicy up, right there at the time.\n\n261\n00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.750\nAnd you have someone, essentially, making\njudgment calls, like, let's do this,\n\n262\n00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.470\nlet's do this.\n\n263\n00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.610\nAnd what's gonna happen, eventually, even\nthe most experienced person is gonna say,\n\n264\n00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.050\nwe need this restored, this restored and\n\n265\n00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.350\nthis brought up, and\nthis needs to get working.\n\n266\n00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:16.170\nWhat you're going to have is you're\ngoing to have kinks and bugs and\n\n267\n00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.285\neverything else because it's\njust the nature of the beast.\n\n268\n00:14:19.285 --> 00:14:22.300\nSo you're going to need to get that\nplan really squared away, tested,\n\n269\n00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:28.130\nmake sure every ones on the same page and\nget it all ironed out ahead of time.\n\n270\n00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:29.620\nBut it can be done.\n\n271\n00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:34.280\nLike I said, the cool thing about this is,\naside from the fact that you're offloading\n\n272\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.680\nresponsibilities to a certain\ndegree to someone else, or\n\n273\n00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.500\nat least they are some place else, then an\nexternal entity to you in a lot of cases,\n\n274\n00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:45.040\nthat's what makes it different.\n\n275\n00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.320\nHowever, you can say that even if you look\nat traditional disaster recovery plans and\n\n276\n00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.820\nBCP's, they do make some references\nto external vendors, as well,\n\n277\n00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:56.120\nthat you have to have them on call.\n\n278\n00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.060\nWhat if you have [INAUDIBLE] environment.\n\n279\n00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.810\nAnd a rack of servers goes down,\nand they're Dell servers.\n\n280\n00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:05.160\nWell, duh, you're responsible for\nbrining them up or bringing them up and\n\n281\n00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.730\nrepairing them and all that, but if you\nneed parts you have to contact Dell for\n\n282\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.210\nthose things potentially.\n\n283\n00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.570\nSo, they've already put those\nin the traditional planning.\n\n284\n00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.900\nWe're just expanding that out, saying\nit's not just a few parts we need, it's\n\n285\n00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.800\nthe whole service that's now out there,\nthe applications and everything else.\n\n286\n00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.360\nAnd potentially, if we're going all\nthe way software as a service, and\n\n287\n00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.510\nyou lose mailboxes or mail servers,\n\n288\n00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.730\nor whatever, you just can't go into your\nconsole and bring the thing back up.\n\n289\n00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.220\nIt really doesn't work that way.\n\n290\n00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.570\nThe console's on other consoles and\nwhere's your interface for it?\n\n291\n00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:37.640\nOn software and service, for\n\n292\n00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.090\nexample, are just concerned\nwith the management functions.\n\n293\n00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:44.160\nThey're not concerned with all those\nlittle detail recovery functions at\n\n294\n00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:44.760\na lower level.\n\n295\n00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.310\n>> Yeah, that's what I was saying.\n\n296\n00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.700\nI don't have a mail server\nto do my restore on.\n\n297\n00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.720\nIf that service provider is down, my\nmanagement console doesn't do me any good.\n\n298\n00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:54.940\nI can't connect to my service provider.\n\n299\n00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.279\nI'm really at their mercy at that point.\n\n300\n00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:59.744\n>> Yeah, you indeed are,\nand I'll tell you,\n\n301\n00:15:59.744 --> 00:16:03.865\nthis is one of the things\nthat I would roll into this,\n\n302\n00:16:03.865 --> 00:16:08.753\nwhich isn't exactly a problem\nwith the Cloud specifically.\n\n303\n00:16:08.753 --> 00:16:13.205\nIt's something that happens when\nthe Cloud is mentioned in any\n\n304\n00:16:13.205 --> 00:16:18.083\nenvironment where you have In kinda\nthat entrenched IT department.\n\n305\n00:16:18.083 --> 00:16:20.900\nAnd that sounds really bad\nwhen I phrase it that way.\n\n306\n00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:26.110\nAnd it's not meant to be, but\nwhat I'm talking about is when you have\n\n307\n00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:30.360\nan IT department sitting there already,\nand you bring in a cloud solution.\n\n308\n00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.096\nIf you have an IT department that's\nbeen there for a long time and\n\n309\n00:16:33.096 --> 00:16:34.667\nis used to managing everything, and\n\n310\n00:16:34.667 --> 00:16:37.928\nall of a sudden you're saying,\nwe're taking this and moving it out there.\n\n311\n00:16:37.928 --> 00:16:41.188\nEven though they have a ton of stuff to do\nand all that already, they're still gonna\n\n312\n00:16:41.188 --> 00:16:44.135\nfreak out that you've taken something\naway from them and put it out there.\n\n313\n00:16:44.135 --> 00:16:46.998\nBecause what they're used to to be able\nto do, they're used to being able,\n\n314\n00:16:46.998 --> 00:16:48.225\nhey something's not working?\n\n315\n00:16:48.225 --> 00:16:50.920\nThey either fix it right here or\nhey, I'll be right back.\n\n316\n00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:52.820\nGet their key cards, swipe in to a room.\n\n317\n00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.600\nAnd go fix it right\ndirectly on the server.\n\n318\n00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.900\nThat server's not there anymore.\n\n319\n00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.310\nIt's some place else.\n\n320\n00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:01.870\nIn la la land, so\nthey have to rely on someone else.\n\n321\n00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:04.030\nAnd I hear a lot of griping and\ncomplaining and\n\n322\n00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:08.680\nother issues with individuals saying,\nthat know how to do this stuff.\n\n323\n00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:10.180\nThey have the skills and all that.\n\n324\n00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.590\nSaying, well, now I have to talk\nto them and wait on this and that,\n\n325\n00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:15.860\nand blah blah blah.\n\n326\n00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.920\nThey don't like it.\n\n327\n00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.380\nSo by planning ahead for these things,\n\n328\n00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:25.170\nyou can hopefully alleviate some of the\nconcerns and some of the problems that IT\n\n329\n00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:29.940\nhas, whether it's traditional IT\nmodels that, hey, you're not doing it.\n\n330\n00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.290\nWe have someone else\nthat's handling that now.\n\n331\n00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.210\nBut, we have planned ahead.\n\n332\n00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:38.780\nSo, just in case there's a problem,\nwe know who you can talk to,\n\n333\n00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:43.130\nto help to get this done and get this done\nquicker and more efficiently than rather,\n\n334\n00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:44.720\njust call somebody you know.\n\n335\n00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.310\nWe've all heard the jokes about calling\nsomebody in India or whatever and\n\n336\n00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.780\nyou have to kind of walk, or they walk\nyou through the same things all the time.\n\n337\n00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.070\nIf you plan ahead,\nyou can talk to these people.\n\n338\n00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.130\nYou can tell them about your environment,\nyour requirements, needs, and all that.\n\n339\n00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.230\nSo it makes it much quicker for\nthem to respond, hopefully, and\n\n340\n00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.970\nbetter for you because you know they\nknow your environment a bit more.\n\n341\n00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.560\n>> And then,\nwe 've got our restoration plans in place,\n\n342\n00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.470\nalthough again that probably\ncan't be the same, because\n\n343\n00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:16.750\nWe're not there we can't walk in and put\nour backups back or anything like that.\n\n344\n00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.880\n>> Yeah,\nit has to be adapted it definitely does.\n\n345\n00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.110\nAnd to what degree it has to be adapted\ndepends on how much of the data\n\n346\n00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.780\nthey're hosting.\n\n347\n00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.420\nIf we go back to what we were\njust talking about where.\n\n348\n00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:33.210\nYou have your mailboxes being hosted\nsomeplace else then it's really on them,\n\n349\n00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:34.038\nfor the most part.\n\n350\n00:18:34.038 --> 00:18:37.460\nSome services do allow you to do\ndifferent levels of backup and\n\n351\n00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:40.630\nstuff like that through consoles and\nutilities they provide to you.\n\n352\n00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.480\nBut if it gets gets bad enough and\nthe server's corrupted or\n\n353\n00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:49.180\nsomething really in there gets messed up,\nthen they're gonna have to do it.\n\n354\n00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:53.290\nIf it's something where you're just\nputting your own propriety stuff in there\n\n355\n00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:56.180\nand all that deal, then your gonna\nbe responsible for backups so\n\n356\n00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:58.720\nnow your gonna have to come\nup with the restoration plan.\n\n357\n00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:03.590\nAnd the success of the restoration plan is\nlargely gonna be impacted by how diligent\n\n358\n00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:07.190\nand how well thought out and\ncrafted your backup strategy was.\n\n359\n00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:12.270\nAt a high level your backup strategy\nis gonna be pretty much the same\n\n360\n00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.640\nas far as frequency and stuff like that,\nyou're just moving it out there.\n\n361\n00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.300\nThe question's gonna be based\non your backup strategy.\n\n362\n00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.780\nWhat order do you restore stuff in?\n\n363\n00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.050\nWhat services get it?\n\n364\n00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:27.010\nYou know, how that's done,\nall those things.\n\n365\n00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:28.990\nWho makes the call whether\nit's a full restore or\n\n366\n00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.640\na partial restore, what have you.\n\n367\n00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:36.700\nThat is definitely gonna start having\nto be adapted to the cloud environment.\n\n368\n00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.560\nIf you have control over\nthe backups at all.\n\n369\n00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.460\nIf you don't, then you're gonna have\nto tell whoever the provider is,\n\n370\n00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.820\nif their backup is inadequate, their\nfrequency is inadequate, then you're gonna\n\n371\n00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.760\nhave to tell them what they need, and\nwhat type of response time you need for\n\n372\n00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.750\nrestoration, all that, but\nthat can all be done ahead of time.\n\n373\n00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:58.040\nSo just the big thing to keep in mind is,\nwho's gonna be able to do the backups and\n\n374\n00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.200\nwho are you gonna have to call to\ndo the restoration if it isn't you?\n\n375\n00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.360\n>> And does the physical location\nof the provider come into play?\n\n376\n00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.040\n>> It definitely can.\n\n377\n00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:08.330\nIt absolutely can.\n\n378\n00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:11.960\nIf you have a, the physical location,\nthe provider can,\n\n379\n00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.190\ndepending on what the conditions are,\nwhat the incident was,\n\n380\n00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.190\nmay even dictate whether or not they're\nin a position even to come back.\n\n381\n00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.590\nThey may be in a situation where they can\nnot bring back those services right away.\n\n382\n00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:28.395\nSo you may need to have an alternate plan\nin the event of a disaster to say heck\n\n383\n00:20:28.395 --> 00:20:32.360\nwe need to roll it over here.\n\n384\n00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:38.380\nSomething that I kind of factor into\nit is when you choose a provider,\n\n385\n00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.980\nmaybe even where they're located.\n\n386\n00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:46.120\nWhen you look at where they're\nlocated if they're someplace like,\n\n387\n00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.670\nyou know let's just say you\nhad somebody down a few years\n\n388\n00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:53.625\nago in New Orleans just\nbefore Katrina hit.\n\n389\n00:20:53.625 --> 00:20:54.510\n>> Mh-hm.\n\n390\n00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:59.890\n>> You know so your provider happened\nto be there during that event.\n\n391\n00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:02.233\nYou're stuck.\n\n392\n00:21:02.233 --> 00:21:04.520\nThat's it.\nYou're gonna have to figure out how\n\n393\n00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.230\nyou can bring your services back or\nplan ahead.\n\n394\n00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.350\nNow granted,\nthat was a unique situation, so\n\n395\n00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:14.350\nthere's something like a Katrina\nlevel disaster's event.\n\n396\n00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.233\nI love saying that cuz\nmy ex is named Katrina.\n\n397\n00:21:18.233 --> 00:21:24.740\n[LAUGH] And if she's watching, I'm gonna\nget a lot of bad emails from that.\n\n398\n00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:29.060\nBut if you have an event like that,\nthat definitely can impact you.\n\n399\n00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.080\nFortunately events like that\ndon't happen that often.\n\n400\n00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:38.330\nNow the thing is,\nis that even if you don't know,\n\n401\n00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:42.970\neven if a big event like that happens\nyou could actually prepare yourself\n\n402\n00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.280\njust by having a that's big enough that\nhas redundancy built in the system,\n\n403\n00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.690\nso that center gets hit they have\nanother place they can roll it over to.\n\n404\n00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:53.670\nSo you're not as impacted.\n\n405\n00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.220\nStuff that we've learned.\n\n406\n00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.970\nSingle points of failure.\n\n407\n00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.550\nJust becomes much more of an issue.\n\n408\n00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:03.260\nIn the cloud environment, you think\na single point of failure in a traditional\n\n409\n00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.870\nsense, we don't want to have any lions or\n\n410\n00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.040\nspots on the map that everything\ngoes through a single chokepoint.\n\n411\n00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.200\nWhat you're doing now by saying,\noh well I'm offloading that to the cloud,\n\n412\n00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.340\nyou are creating, if you're not careful,\nyou could be creating\n\n413\n00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:21.060\nunderneath that cloud, you could be\ncreating a potential chokepoint there,\n\n414\n00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:22.670\na single point of failure.\n\n415\n00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.090\nYou know that cloud could be\nhiding just a single facility or\n\n416\n00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.710\nmultiple facilities, it really depends.\n\n417\n00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.670\nSo you kind of got to do\nyour homework there too.\n\n418\n00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:31.920\n>> Absolutely.\nAll right,\n\n419\n00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.180\nwe've had a lot of good information.\n\n420\n00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.230\nAnything we need to talk about\nto wrap this episode up?\n\n421\n00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.660\n>> I think it kind of\nsquares it away really.\n\n422\n00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.520\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this one.\n\n423\n00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.690\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n424\n00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:44.410\n>> And I'm Shano Riano.\n\n425\n00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:45.699\n>> And

00:00:16.590\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.880\nAnd Sean, in this episode, we're gonna\nbe covering good old data center issues.\n\n5\n00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.210\nWhere we gotta deal with these guys,\nwe're moving our stuff out to the Cloud.\n\n6\n00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.080\nAnd there are certain things that\nare gonna arise that we might not\n\n7\n00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.820\nhad to deal with,\nbefore we started moving out to the Cloud.\n\n8\n00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.132\nSo, what kind of things are we really\nlooking at, or should we be worried about?\n\n9\n00:00:34.132 --> 00:00:36.609\n[LAUGH]\n>> You should be worried about a lot,\n\n10\n00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:37.548\nat this point.\n\n11\n00:00:37.548 --> 00:00:41.642\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What we're looking at here,\n\n12\n00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:48.660\nlike I said, is issues with your data, in\nthe data center itself, or in the Cloud.\n\n13\n00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.055\nSo we have talked about this issue before.\n\n14\n00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:55.031\nBut what we're gonna introduce here is,\n\n15\n00:00:55.031 --> 00:01:00.303\nwe're gonna introduce a few additional\nthings, as well as a tool that you\n\n16\n00:01:00.303 --> 00:01:05.761\ncan use to really kinda help you out,\ndetermine the types of stuff you need.\n\n17\n00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:10.442\nAnd really that's very much called for\nat this point,\n\n18\n00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:15.852\nconsidering we've thrown a lot\nat you with different issues.\n\n19\n00:01:15.852 --> 00:01:21.157\nAs [LAUGH] you said Mike, it's like,\nthere's another thing being added to it.\n\n20\n00:01:21.157 --> 00:01:24.069\nYeah, there's a pretty long list,\nso it's nice to\n\n21\n00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.990\nhave tools that can help you out and\njust put stuff kind of in black and white.\n\n22\n00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.240\nSo one of these tools is something\ncalled the Cloud Controls Matrix,\n\n23\n00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.330\nthat the CSA puts out,\nthe Cloud Security Alliance puts out.\n\n24\n00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.440\nAnd it's something that's designed to help\nyou see who has responsibility for what.\n\n25\n00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.220\nAnd it's something that you\ncan download for free, and\n\n26\n00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.830\nthere's all sorts of white papers written\non it, that document everything it does.\n\n27\n00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.495\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give\nyou kind of a look at this thing and\n\n28\n00:01:56.495 --> 00:02:00.040\nkinda give you a quick overview of it.\n\n29\n00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.036\nIf you are moving to the Cloud and\nthis is something that you want to use,\n\n30\n00:02:05.036 --> 00:02:10.053\nthen I'll let you refer to the guidance\nthat they have for it with a CSA.\n\n31\n00:02:10.053 --> 00:02:13.628\nAs far as what you need to know for the\nexam, you do need to be aware of what it\n\n32\n00:02:13.628 --> 00:02:17.230\nis, and some of the applications of it and\nyou'll be in good shape.\n\n33\n00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.960\nBut as far as practical use?\n\n34\n00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.800\nPractical use yes, you should refer\nto all the white papers for it.\n\n35\n00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.471\nAnd the white papers for it, it's\nsomething that's gonna take you some time,\n\n36\n00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:30.689\nbut it's gonna be time well\nspent at the end of the day.\n\n37\n00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.854\nBut we'll leave that to you to\nkinda figure out how that actually\n\n38\n00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:35.240\napplies to you.\n\n39\n00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.870\nOkay, so what I've done for you here is,\nI have up on my screen, I have downloaded\n\n40\n00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.390\nsomething, you can see it's the Cloud\nControls Matrix also known as the CCM.\n\n41\n00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.350\nDo remember with the CCM,\nthere are multiple versions of it,\n\n42\n00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.600\nso make sure you're getting\nthe latest version.\n\n43\n00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.910\nYou can see up here, I have version 3.\n\n44\n00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.584\nFor some reason they actually have version\n1, 2 and whatever, still available,\n\n45\n00:03:01.584 --> 00:03:06.670\nso make sure you've got a version\nthat's appropriate for you.\n\n46\n00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.170\nSo what I have here is,\nyou can see that's got our columns in\n\n47\n00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.360\nthere telling you the different things,\ntelling you different domains on here.\n\n48\n00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.010\nNow that first column, you can see that\nit's got different control domains.\n\n49\n00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.050\nAnd maybe we can zoom up on there a bit.\n\n50\n00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.154\nBut you can see the different control\ndomains over there on that left hand\n\n51\n00:03:28.154 --> 00:03:28.696\ncolumn.\n\n52\n00:03:28.696 --> 00:03:33.025\nIt's got stuff like Application and\nInterface Security, and\n\n53\n00:03:33.025 --> 00:03:39.010\nit had Data Integrity listed over there\nand you can see it's color coded as well.\n\n54\n00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.490\nWhat it does, is that actually aligns\ninto the 16 different domains that\n\n55\n00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.020\nare covered by the actual credential\n\n56\n00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.370\nas well as the other areas that\nthe CSA considers to be important.\n\n57\n00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.820\nSo, what you will do in there\nis you'll look at controls.\n\n58\n00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.794\nIf you're not sure what the controls are,\nit actually even tells you over here.\n\n59\n00:04:02.794 --> 00:04:07.762\nIt very nicely tells you what that\ncontrol relates to and you can decide,\n\n60\n00:04:07.762 --> 00:04:12.580\nis that something that applies to me,\nor doesn't apply to me.\n\n61\n00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.509\nYou can also see it even has,\nI'll kinda scoot some of this over.\n\n62\n00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.690\nIt has stuff listed by software\n\n63\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.460\nas a service is actually hidden\nunderneath there, I moved it over a bit.\n\n64\n00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.960\nBut it tells you okay, well,\nwhich is this gonna apply to,\n\n65\n00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.815\nwhose responsibility it is,\ndo you have multi-tenant issues.\n\n66\n00:04:32.815 --> 00:04:34.526\nAnd just goes right on down the list and\n\n67\n00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:37.460\nhas you check off the issues\nthat are gonna apply to you.\n\n68\n00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:44.370\nThe things that are really neat about\nthis is that it even aligns with,\n\n69\n00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.760\nthe CCM matrix actually aligns\nwith not just the domains that\n\n70\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.460\nthe CSA thinks that are important for\n\n71\n00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.650\nthe exam as well as for\nwhat they think is gonna be useful to you.\n\n72\n00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.900\nBut you'll notice if you kinda scoot\nover in here, it's got the CSA Guidance\n\n73\n00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.640\ncolumn in here telling you what domains\nthat these different controls pertain to.\n\n74\n00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.635\nBut if you look in there,\nit's got stuff like COBIT,\n\n75\n00:05:14.635 --> 00:05:19.423\nFedRAMP stuff here in the US,\nGAPP, HIPAA, ISO.\n\n76\n00:05:19.423 --> 00:05:26.300\nThere's Jericho, the Jericho Cloud Matrix\nwe talked about, that's their deal.\n\n77\n00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.698\nI like how they have commandments.\n\n78\n00:05:27.698 --> 00:05:30.849\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Thou shalt, move to a cloud.\n\n79\n00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.420\nAll right, so [LAUGH] and then you see\nNIST, and you go right on down the list.\n\n80\n00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:42.165\nThere's PCI, I mean heck, we've mentioned\nPCI in here already, many times.\n\n81\n00:05:42.165 --> 00:05:45.365\nNot just in this course, but\nother areas, a payment card industry.\n\n82\n00:05:45.365 --> 00:05:49.365\nSo what this is doing is it's\neven telling you what areas\n\n83\n00:05:49.365 --> 00:05:53.640\nthat those controls apply\nto within those guidances.\n\n84\n00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.550\nSo if you're planning security controls\nand you're planning data protection\n\n85\n00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.390\nthings, both physical, technical,\nand administrative, it's\n\n86\n00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.770\ntelling you where those controls actually\nrelate to in those specific guidelines.\n\n87\n00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.374\nIt's also tell you,\nit's showing you its hand, if you will,\n\n88\n00:06:10.374 --> 00:06:14.658\nthat this actually does relate, or\ndoes help you align with those specific\n\n89\n00:06:14.658 --> 00:06:18.190\nstandards, which is a huge help for\nyou at this point.\n\n90\n00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.622\nIf any of these standards apply to\nyou at all for your business or\n\n91\n00:06:22.622 --> 00:06:27.220\nyour business processes or whatever it is\nthat you're doing, they've already laid\n\n92\n00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.560\nthis out for you in such a way\nthat you can go through this and\n\n93\n00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.540\nsay, okay well,\nthe control is called out here.\n\n94\n00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.940\nWell I know where in NIST or\nHIPAA or wherever I need to\n\n95\n00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.730\ngo to elaborate more on how these\ncontrols relate to that environment.\n\n96\n00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.150\nSo it's a very, very quick and\n\n97\n00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.450\neasy tool to see where you need to go for\nadditional guidance.\n\n98\n00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.945\nIt's a huge time saver at this point.\n\n99\n00:06:48.945 --> 00:06:53.690\nAnd it's also the reason why I tell you,\nwhen you look at all this stuff,\n\n100\n00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.440\nI mean look at the FedRAMP stuff.\n\n101\n00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.393\nI mean, that looks like someone\njust puked on it, right there.\n\n102\n00:06:57.393 --> 00:06:59.390\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n103\n00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.769\n>> But it has all this stuff out there.\n\n104\n00:07:02.769 --> 00:07:06.930\nIt's gonna help you get to the information\nyou need to get to take care of those\n\n105\n00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.685\ncontrols much faster than you could if you\njust start stumbling around in the dark.\n\n106\n00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:15.885\nThis is gonna help you,\nthis is gonna help your lawyers and\n\n107\n00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:17.790\nlegal team when that comes up to it.\n\n108\n00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.590\nIt's just gonna help you go through and\nthrough and through.\n\n109\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.430\nThis is why I was saying that you always\nneed to make sure that you're getting\n\n110\n00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.440\nthe most current version of this.\n\n111\n00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.660\nBecause you don't want to use version 1, I\nmeant it does reference version 1 in here,\n\n112\n00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.220\nbut you don't want version 1 of the CCM,\nprobably in any case.\n\n113\n00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.437\nSomeone could probably make a case, and\n\n114\n00:07:37.437 --> 00:07:39.987\nI'll leave that to you if you need that or\nnot.\n\n115\n00:07:39.987 --> 00:07:42.923\nBut I would recommend always looking\nto make sure you've got the most\n\n116\n00:07:42.923 --> 00:07:43.740\ncurrent version.\n\n117\n00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:48.280\nThe other ones I'd say are pretty much\nup there for reference purposes and\n\n118\n00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.050\nstuff like that.\n\n119\n00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.365\nBut this matrix up there will tell you\nspecifically what the controls are,\n\n120\n00:07:54.365 --> 00:07:55.608\nwhat they line up to.\n\n121\n00:07:55.608 --> 00:08:00.740\nAnd make sure you're always staying\ncurrent and going to the right part of\n\n122\n00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:05.895\nyour respective regulations to make\nsure you're doing the right thing.\n\n123\n00:08:05.895 --> 00:08:10.829\nI mean, I happen to to really like\nwhat they've done to speed this up.\n\n124\n00:08:10.829 --> 00:08:14.670\nTo kind of look at this another way,\n\n125\n00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:18.774\nthey also have this CSA guide 3.0.\n\n126\n00:08:18.774 --> 00:08:22.190\nWhich is actually, there's two guides.\n\n127\n00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.620\nThere's actually something\nthat ENISA puts out,\n\n128\n00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:29.210\nand I don't know, Mike, did you put\nthe references for us in the show?\n\n129\n00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.500\n>> I definitely will, yeah.\n\n130\n00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:34.700\n>> Okay, there's two PDFs you can go\nto that can help you out, study for\n\n131\n00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.530\nthis exam, one of them is the ENISA guide,\n\n132\n00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.360\nthe other one is the CSA\nguide that I have here.\n\n133\n00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.065\nThis also shows you a look at\nthe Cloud Controls Matrix.\n\n134\n00:08:45.065 --> 00:08:48.737\nIn this case it's telling you,\nhey, just giving you an example,\n\n135\n00:08:48.737 --> 00:08:51.700\nit's saying here's HIPAA,\nhere's the controls.\n\n136\n00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.970\nIt's telling you specifications to it.\n\n137\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.861\nThis is the same stuff that the actual\nCCM does, but in long form.\n\n138\n00:08:57.861 --> 00:09:02.417\nIt tells you, hey, for HIPAA, for\nthis control, here's the parts of HIPAA,\n\n139\n00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:05.400\nthe HIPAA code that\nrelate to those controls.\n\n140\n00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:11.165\nSo you're going through the CSA guide and\nall their guidances and\n\n141\n00:09:11.165 --> 00:09:14.095\nwhat have you, and you're saying,\nokay, well there's some generic\n\n142\n00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:18.850\nguidance in the CSA guide relating to this\nand I know there's some interest there.\n\n143\n00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.540\nWell, guess what?\n\n144\n00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.820\nYou can go pull out the CCM,\n\n145\n00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:28.050\nlook to see what the guide referred to as\nthe control, and just trace it across.\n\n146\n00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.820\nIf your HIPAA, trace it across,\nit says, oh, hey, HIPAA, for\n\n147\n00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:36.670\nthis control, this is where you go to\nHIPAA to get more specific information.\n\n148\n00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.049\nWhere what we're talking\ngenerically over here,\n\n149\n00:09:39.049 --> 00:09:41.780\nyou can get it specifically tailored for\nHIPAA over here.\n\n150\n00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.940\nLike I said, it's a huge,\nhuge, huge time saver.\n\n151\n00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:49.630\nAnd it gives you an idea of just how\nmuch they've accounted for even here.\n\n152\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.740\nHealthcare, card processing payment,\npower generation.\n\n153\n00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.330\nI just mentioned that a bit ago,\n\n154\n00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:02.260\nthat they could be using the cloud across\nmany applications we haven't talked about.\n\n155\n00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.930\nSo, they have power generation.\n\n156\n00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:08.265\nAnd even, look,\nwe talked about security controls in here.\n\n157\n00:10:08.265 --> 00:10:11.155\nThis is something else that\nthis is a big help for.\n\n158\n00:10:11.155 --> 00:10:16.585\nIf you look just on screen here, you\ncan see where it says Power Generation.\n\n159\n00:10:16.585 --> 00:10:17.575\nIf you trace that across,\n\n160\n00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:22.427\nit talks about facility security\ncontrolled access points.\n\n161\n00:10:22.427 --> 00:10:23.947\nTake a look at what it's\ntalking about in there.\n\n162\n00:10:23.947 --> 00:10:28.327\nIt's talking about protecting your data\ncenters, fences, walls, barriers, guards,\n\n163\n00:10:28.327 --> 00:10:31.805\ngates, authentication mechanism,\nreception desk, patrols.\n\n164\n00:10:31.805 --> 00:10:36.893\nSo, I didn't even mention all those,\nbut it's telling you,\n\n165\n00:10:36.893 --> 00:10:41.700\nhey, these are things that very\nmuch could come into play.\n\n166\n00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:44.768\nSo it really helps you kind of not\nonly to see where you stand and\n\n167\n00:10:44.768 --> 00:10:48.898\nwhere to go for more information, but it's\nalso gonna help you think of additional\n\n168\n00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.727\nthings that you may not be covering.\n\n169\n00:10:50.727 --> 00:10:53.730\nSo it's a really, really great tool.\n\n170\n00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.970\nAnd I want to say you don't really\ntoo often see something like this.\n\n171\n00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:00.028\nIt's usually something you have to make or\nyou have to do a lot of digging.\n\n172\n00:11:00.028 --> 00:11:04.628\nThis is just a really nice thing that\nthey provided to us that can help us out.\n\n173\n00:11:04.628 --> 00:11:08.911\nSo I happen to really find it quite\nuseful, and hopefully you do too.\n\n174\n00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:12.538\nLike I said,\nit's available in Excel, it's free,\n\n175\n00:11:12.538 --> 00:11:18.350\nthere's really no reason why [LAUGH] you\nshouldn't get it is my opinion on it.\n\n176\n00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.423\nIt's just gonna be such a big deal,\n\n177\n00:11:21.423 --> 00:11:26.554\nI would tell you under any\ncircumstances you should get it.\n\n178\n00:11:26.554 --> 00:11:30.865\nEven if you don't think regulations\napply to you because of whatever\n\n179\n00:11:30.865 --> 00:11:34.080\nbusiness you're in or industry you're in.\n\n180\n00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.187\nWell, you may look at this because this\nmay give you ideas of additional controls.\n\n181\n00:11:38.187 --> 00:11:44.680\nAnd it may be in your best interest to put\nsome sort of basic framework in place.\n\n182\n00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.180\nWith the idea that, whatever you're doing,\nif a vendor later on wants to\n\n183\n00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.820\nevaluate you or a potential client wants\nto evaluate you, you can easily say,\n\n184\n00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:59.090\ninstead of saying well, we've got this\ntype of protection in place, you can say,\n\n185\n00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:03.410\nwell we have brought our\nsystems up to this standard.\n\n186\n00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:08.450\nNow they have a recognized standard\nthat's being used in different places\n\n187\n00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.020\nthat they can say,\noh they've met a certain standard.\n\n188\n00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:15.320\nWe can go and pull information on that,\nand evaluate them to a certain standard\n\n189\n00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.430\nrather than, hey they just kind\nof rolled their own solution.\n\n190\n00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.105\nThere's nothing wrong with that,\nrolling your own solution.\n\n191\n00:12:21.105 --> 00:12:26.055\nBut it also, by using the standard kind\nof as forward looking, it makes you\n\n192\n00:12:26.055 --> 00:12:29.545\nmore compatible, more recognizable and\nit just looks better to do it.\n\n193\n00:12:29.545 --> 00:12:32.295\nBut make sure you choose one,\nif you're not sure.\n\n194\n00:12:32.295 --> 00:12:37.765\nDon't all the sudden if you're\nrunning some business that's just\n\n195\n00:12:37.765 --> 00:12:42.660\ndoing whatever, don't just say,\nhey you know what, HIPAA looks good.\n\n196\n00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.785\nWhy would you choose HIPAA?\n\n197\n00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.855\nMaybe you're not in health care.\n\n198\n00:12:46.855 --> 00:12:49.042\n[LAUGH] Don't use that.\n\n199\n00:12:49.042 --> 00:12:53.621\nThey're gonna go, if you're running,\nI could go really crazy with this,\n\n200\n00:12:53.621 --> 00:12:58.500\nsay, if you're running a cloud solution\nthat's part of a bakery or something.\n\n201\n00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.128\nYou evaluate yourself to HIPAA standard.\n\n202\n00:13:01.128 --> 00:13:01.756\n>> Better safe than sorry.\n\n203\n00:13:01.756 --> 00:13:02.335\n>> Well, that's kind of nice.\n\n204\n00:13:02.335 --> 00:13:06.262\n[LAUGH]\n>> I've got customers that order lots of\n\n205\n00:13:06.262 --> 00:13:08.460\ndonuts and I don't want that\ngetting out to the public.\n\n206\n00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.757\nHow many donuts they order a week.\n\n207\n00:13:09.757 --> 00:13:12.052\n>> Yeah we do have a little\nbit of food poisoning issue so\n\n208\n00:13:12.052 --> 00:13:14.048\nwe figured we'd call our clients patients.\n\n209\n00:13:14.048 --> 00:13:16.161\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n210\n00:13:16.161 --> 00:13:17.018\n>> All right, so\n\n211\n00:13:17.018 --> 00:13:20.580\nhow does our data hosting\nfit into all of this?\n\n212\n00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.190\n>> Your data hosting, it's when\nyou're building your solution, and\n\n213\n00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.160\nyou're putting it out in the cloud\nwith your applications and all that.\n\n214\n00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.680\nYou're just gonna, like I said, you're\ngonna see where you align on this and\n\n215\n00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:33.700\njust start plugging in and\nseeing are those controls in place?\n\n216\n00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.560\nAnd first of all,\ndo you need to meet those standards.\n\n217\n00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.674\nSo if you know you need to meet the HIPAA\nstandard, you're gonna go and say,\n\n218\n00:13:39.674 --> 00:13:41.160\nokay I've got the HIPAA standard.\n\n219\n00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.279\nNow you're gonna go look at\nthe controls you have in place and\n\n220\n00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:45.808\nline them up in this matrix and\n\n221\n00:13:45.808 --> 00:13:49.802\nthen trace them across to see if those\nmeet the standard as required by HIPAA.\n\n222\n00:13:49.802 --> 00:13:54.060\nThat would make a huge, huge benefit.\n\n223\n00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.991\nIt's also something that\nyou can provide to your,\n\n224\n00:13:56.991 --> 00:14:01.570\nyou could actually cut up that template\nif you want and take out the other stuff.\n\n225\n00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:05.070\nSo if you're in something like HIPAA,\nonce again,\n\n226\n00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:09.830\nyou can take the HIPAA standard and put\nthat as the only thing on that matrix and\n\n227\n00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:15.170\ngive to your hosting provider and say,\nhow many of those controls do you have?\n\n228\n00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.680\nHow many of those things can\nyou check off this list?\n\n229\n00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.160\nI've got the different things I need,\nI've got the domains listed out there,\n\n230\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.010\nI have the controls are in that area.\n\n231\n00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.980\nCan you give me descriptions on what\nyou have that meet these areas?\n\n232\n00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:31.947\nAnd which one of these things that you\ndon't have currently can you provide me in\n\n233\n00:14:31.947 --> 00:14:33.590\nsome way, shape or form?\n\n234\n00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.292\n>> Gotcha.\n>> So, it's just great,\n\n235\n00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:40.500\nit's just a great resource to have.\n\n236\n00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.140\nTake a look at it.\n\n237\n00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.340\nI can see it looks like someone out there\nin the chat room's already downloaded it.\n\n238\n00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:49.760\nSo it's something that is definitely\nworth a look for the exam.\n\n239\n00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.490\nIt's also a great study tool for\n\n240\n00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.285\nthe exam cuz it helps kinda\nfocus your thinking a bit too.\n\n241\n00:14:54.285 --> 00:14:58.277\nAnd a little more tightly,\nas we've been going through and\n\n242\n00:14:58.277 --> 00:15:00.520\nbeen kinda tightening up some\nof the descriptions on this,\n\n243\n00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.590\nthis tightens it up to\na pretty high degree too.\n\n244\n00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.302\nSo, very, very handy thing to have.\n\n245\n00:15:06.302 --> 00:15:09.130\n>> All right, then you've got, I guess in\nour data center we've gotta worry about\n\n246\n00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:14.040\nwhen they are doing things against their\nsystems, and how that can impact us and\n\n247\n00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.920\nour performance and\nwhat we're providing or consuming?\n\n248\n00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.050\n>> Yeah, that can be something is that\nwhen you have queries run on different\n\n249\n00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:25.390\ndata sources, maintenance done on\ntheir end, how could that impact you.\n\n250\n00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:29.800\nThat could be things that happen,\nso you have that.\n\n251\n00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:34.240\nThen you have one that I, when I talk\nabout by data center operators is\n\n252\n00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:39.230\nsomething that CSA and\nISC wants you to be aware of,\n\n253\n00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:42.360\nis talking about stuff that goes\nacross different organizations.\n\n254\n00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.120\nAnd something that is a concern for\n\n255\n00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.760\nwhen I think of that, is when you're\nrunning queries across organizations.\n\n256\n00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.861\nYou have your applications, so you have\nqueries that they may be running on their\n\n257\n00:15:53.861 --> 00:15:56.595\nown to see size of data and\ngrowth and stuff like that.\n\n258\n00:15:56.595 --> 00:16:00.543\nYou wanna be careful that the provider\ndoesn't expose too much or\n\n259\n00:16:00.543 --> 00:16:03.355\nget too much information\nwhat you're doing.\n\n260\n00:16:03.355 --> 00:16:05.071\nBut you also wanna have Those,\n\n261\n00:16:05.071 --> 00:16:09.972\nyou have that concern when you're running\nacross different cloud hosting providers.\n\n262\n00:16:09.972 --> 00:16:13.381\nLet's say you have part of a service here,\na service here and a service here, and\n\n263\n00:16:13.381 --> 00:16:15.058\nyou're kind of gluing them together.\n\n264\n00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:17.140\nWhen you run queries across there,\n\n265\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.810\none something you have to be aware of is,\nhow much is being revealed.\n\n266\n00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:25.704\nIt is possible that a query against any\none of those sources may not be a problem.\n\n267\n00:16:25.704 --> 00:16:28.922\nBut if someone would run a query\nacross all those sources at once,\n\n268\n00:16:28.922 --> 00:16:31.960\nthey might be able to infer\na bigger picture on things.\n\n269\n00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:37.420\nThat's been known to happen, cuz once you\nget one data source, two data sources,\n\n270\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:43.020\nokay, if you can query across them looking\nfor stuff, that's already pretty powerful.\n\n271\n00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:47.580\nBut once you grow beyond that even, and\nyou have multiple data sources, and\n\n272\n00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.200\nI can source a record on,\nfor example, somebody here,\n\n273\n00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.950\nand then there's information here,\nhere, here, and here and here.\n\n274\n00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.810\nI pull all those together.\n\n275\n00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.670\nAny one of those may not be a big deal,\nbut\n\n276\n00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.800\nwhen I pull them together,\nit could give me a much clearer picture,\n\n277\n00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.570\nmaybe expose something very,\nvery, very sensitive.\n\n278\n00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:07.650\nSo that's something that could\nalso come into play here.\n\n279\n00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:12.328\nWhat I would think about when I'm talking\nabout the application level outside of\n\n280\n00:17:12.328 --> 00:17:17.100\nthe actual provider is, think about\nwhen you're constructing an application.\n\n281\n00:17:17.100 --> 00:17:21.287\nAnd work with your application developers\nto kinda look at what's happening there\n\n282\n00:17:21.287 --> 00:17:23.156\nand types of queries that can be run.\n\n283\n00:17:23.156 --> 00:17:26.645\nAnd would those expose anything\nthat shouldn't be be exposed?\n\n284\n00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:27.932\nThat is actually very tough,\n\n285\n00:17:27.932 --> 00:17:31.223\nwhen you start having all of these [LAUGH]\ndifferent data sources out there and\n\n286\n00:17:31.223 --> 00:17:34.085\nrunning queries across all of them,\nintegrating them.\n\n287\n00:17:34.085 --> 00:17:39.205\nIt's possible for all these things to be,\niterations to happen\n\n288\n00:17:39.205 --> 00:17:42.455\nthat may expose something that\nyou don't necessarily think of.\n\n289\n00:17:42.455 --> 00:17:47.015\nHowever, there's something that I would,\nthat's something that I want you to be\n\n290\n00:17:47.015 --> 00:17:51.010\naware of when you're talking about these\nqueries and integrating all these things.\n\n291\n00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:55.740\nDon't freak out if you're\nasking your developer and\n\n292\n00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.430\nyourself, you're going through it, and\nthe person that's hosting your data,\n\n293\n00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:03.425\nyou're going through this to make sure\nthere's not too much being exposed.\n\n294\n00:18:03.425 --> 00:18:08.200\nThere's actually a way to make this\nsituation a lot easier to check.\n\n295\n00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.110\nThere's a technique to make this stuff a\nlot easier to check, it's called fuzzing.\n\n296\n00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:17.040\nWe talked about that in ethical hacking,\nit's something called application fuzzing.\n\n297\n00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.996\nWhich is where you can use a tool\nto fire ranges of queries and\n\n298\n00:18:20.996 --> 00:18:26.236\ninputs against different applications,\nin this case against data sources.\n\n299\n00:18:26.236 --> 00:18:30.465\nYou can use it to run\ndifferent types of queries and\n\n300\n00:18:30.465 --> 00:18:34.550\nranges of queries against it very quickly.\n\n301\n00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.030\nAnd then look at the results and\n\n302\n00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.830\nsee what that exposes to see if there's\nany failures or anything like that.\n\n303\n00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.940\nit can help you do it a lot\nquicker than you can on your own.\n\n304\n00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.770\nThat's what they developed\nthat type of stuff for,\n\n305\n00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.410\none of the things they\ndeveloped fuzzing for.\n\n306\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.570\nIt's a technique that's very handy for\nthat.\n\n307\n00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.680\nThey won't mention fuzzing on this exam,\nso don't worry about it, but\n\n308\n00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.550\nI kind of wanted to provide that to you so\nyou'd know that.\n\n309\n00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:01.320\nOkay, it's all well and good that\nI need to avoid these queries and\n\n310\n00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.140\nwork with my application developers and\n\n311\n00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.950\nmake sure there's not too much exposed,\nbut how do I do that?\n\n312\n00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.320\nI could sit here and\nbe like, yeah, go, yeah.\n\n313\n00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.150\nHow do you do that?\n\n314\n00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:12.360\nVery carefully, see you later.\n\n315\n00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.139\n[LAUGH] I could do that.\n\n316\n00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:18.632\nBut just to let you know, to go back to\nother stuff that we've talked about in\n\n317\n00:19:18.632 --> 00:19:23.480\nother courses, yeah, there is\nsomething called application fuzzing.\n\n318\n00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.912\nThere's tools in Kali for it,\nthere's tools in Metasploit for it.\n\n319\n00:19:26.912 --> 00:19:31.658\nThere's a whole bunch of other tools that\nare Windows-based that we talked about, or\n\n320\n00:19:31.658 --> 00:19:34.270\nmentioned them in\nthe ethical hacking course.\n\n321\n00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:38.980\nSo you're not just left out in the cold\nthere, there are things to help you out.\n\n322\n00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.598\n>> Nice, and\n\n323\n00:19:39.598 --> 00:19:44.750\nthen we need to worry about the way the\ndata center is handling their operations.\n\n324\n00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.250\nAre we privy to any of that information?\n\n325\n00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:51.960\n>> Yeah, you should be privy\nto a certain amount of it.\n\n326\n00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:55.810\nFirst of all, we gotta think about public\nor private, if it's a private cloud,\n\n327\n00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.490\nwhether it's hosted internally or\nexternally.\n\n328\n00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:02.958\nIf it's internally we get access\nto pretty much everything, so\n\n329\n00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:05.284\nthere's no real concern there.\n\n330\n00:20:05.284 --> 00:20:10.253\nIf it's an outsourced private cloud,\nthat gives us more access\n\n331\n00:20:10.253 --> 00:20:15.390\nthan if it was fully public,\nbut doesn't give us everything.\n\n332\n00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.970\nThey'll give us a lot more,\nthey'll say hey,\n\n333\n00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:21.730\nwe've you basically in your own sandbox,\nso we'll give you information about that\n\n334\n00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:24.520\nenvironment a lot more because\nyou're the only one that's there.\n\n335\n00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.084\nIf anything happens it's your\nneck that's [SOUND], on the line.\n\n336\n00:20:28.084 --> 00:20:31.743\nIf it's public, it kinda depends,\n\n337\n00:20:31.743 --> 00:20:36.464\nit could be a little bit\nof a crap shoot depending\n\n338\n00:20:36.464 --> 00:20:41.680\non what the host and\nprovider wants to give you.\n\n339\n00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.160\nBecause they may not want to give you too\nmuch about their controls just because\n\n340\n00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.550\nthere's other people's stuff on the line\nand it may impact their hosting.\n\n341\n00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.200\nThey don't know, necessarily,\nwhy you're asking.\n\n342\n00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.280\nYou could be dressed up in a suit\nthere and look all nice and\n\n343\n00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:59.250\ntalk about signing a contract, you may be\nsomeone that's social engineering them.\n\n344\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.130\nThat's entirely possible.\n\n345\n00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:04.400\nAnd now if you sign NDAs and\nstuff like that with them and\n\n346\n00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:09.710\nput all those things out there, they're\nmore likely to give you more information.\n\n347\n00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.780\nBut don't expect them\nto give you anything.\n\n348\n00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:14.610\nThey'll give you stuff that\nrelates to what you're doing.\n\n349\n00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:18.893\nThey may not give you information,\nall the behind the scenes security stuff.\n\n350\n00:21:18.893 --> 00:21:25.585\nBut I think it's fair to ask, what do\nthey do to control access to your data.\n\n351\n00:21:25.585 --> 00:21:26.190\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n352\n00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:30.645\n>> What do they do with backups,\nwhere are they stored?\n\n353\n00:21:30.645 --> 00:21:34.070\nWhat type of encryption do they use?\n\n354\n00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.163\nThose things are entirely\nfair to be asking.\n\n355\n00:21:37.163 --> 00:21:41.272\nIf they're not willing to provide that to\nyou, especially stuff like encryption, for\n\n356\n00:21:41.272 --> 00:21:44.949\nexample, I've heard places, we're not\ntelling you about our encryption.\n\n357\n00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:48.350\nWe just don't want to\nprovide that information.\n\n358\n00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:54.530\nOkay, then we're done here,\nwe don't need to talk anymore, that's it.\n\n359\n00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:59.630\nYou know from our exploration of\nencryption, if you're using strong\n\n360\n00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:04.730\nencryption, something like AES, you're\nusing 128, 256, something like that.\n\n361\n00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:10.376\nIf I have AES256, let's say, and\nI can tell you I'm using AES256.\n\n362\n00:22:10.376 --> 00:22:12.220\nNot, well ooh, you're gonna go look it up.\n\n363\n00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.190\nGood luck, go have fun, I don't care.\n\n364\n00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:16.311\nYou know what, I'll go print it\nout in my office right now and\n\n365\n00:22:16.311 --> 00:22:19.400\nhand it to you if you want to know\nwhat the specifications for AES256.\n\n366\n00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.050\n>> That does absolutely squat for you.\n\n367\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.570\nWhat it doesn't tell you is,\nit doesn't tell you what the key is\n\n368\n00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:29.940\nI happened to use to encrypt your data,\nor other data or whatever.\n\n369\n00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:33.750\nThat's something that we had\nlearned with encryption.\n\n370\n00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:38.538\nKeeping that information secret\nisn't where security lies,\n\n371\n00:22:38.538 --> 00:22:40.760\nsecurity is in the secrecy of that key.\n\n372\n00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.585\nSo if someone says, oh, if you ask them,\nhey can I see the key and they're like,\n\n373\n00:22:44.585 --> 00:22:46.915\noh yeah, sure,\nI got it written down over here.\n\n374\n00:22:46.915 --> 00:22:47.655\nYeah, run.\n\n375\n00:22:47.655 --> 00:22:51.345\nDon't walk, run as fast as you can and\nget the heck out of there.\n\n376\n00:22:51.345 --> 00:22:53.555\nBecause that's the wrong way to handle it.\n\n377\n00:22:53.555 --> 00:22:58.065\nBut if they won't tell you about\nthe different encryption levels they have\n\n378\n00:22:58.065 --> 00:23:01.925\navailable and which ones they are using\nto protect your stuff, that's a problem.\n\n379\n00:23:01.925 --> 00:23:07.063\nEspecially if you're saying hey, I've\ngot healthcare data I'm protecting and\n\n380\n00:23:07.063 --> 00:23:09.377\nI have need AES, blahbadee-blah.\n\n381\n00:23:09.377 --> 00:23:13.320\nIf they're gonna tell you,\noh, yeah, we can do that.\n\n382\n00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.260\nOkay well, how are you implementing it?\n\n383\n00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.160\nHow are you doing this?\n\n384\n00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.923\nIf they're not gonna give you any of that,\nI'm the one that's gonna get fined.\n\n385\n00:23:20.923 --> 00:23:22.915\nI'm the one that could go to jail,\n\n386\n00:23:22.915 --> 00:23:26.380\nI'm the one that has to face\nthe music if they screw up.\n\n387\n00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.770\nAnd I'm not doing that.\n\n388\n00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:32.184\nIf they're not gonna give it to\nme I'm going someplace else, or\n\n389\n00:23:32.184 --> 00:23:34.654\nyou're just not the vendor for me.\n\n390\n00:23:34.654 --> 00:23:37.232\n>> Right, and the last thing I\nthink we wanna talk about here,\n\n391\n00:23:37.232 --> 00:23:39.050\nSean, is we need to gather information.\n\n392\n00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.490\nWe need to make sure all that's going on,\n\n393\n00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:45.986\ncould be a little more difficult if we\ngo to a multisite cloud type scenario.\n\n394\n00:23:45.986 --> 00:23:48.453\n>> Yeah, the logging, reporting,\n\n395\n00:23:48.453 --> 00:23:53.141\ngetting your picture of your data,\nthat's a huge, huge issue.\n\n396\n00:23:53.141 --> 00:23:57.448\nYour hosting environment in general, being\nable to get information is a big, big,\n\n397\n00:23:57.448 --> 00:23:58.004\nbig deal.\n\n398\n00:23:58.004 --> 00:24:02.903\nSo you need to be able to get good,\nconcrete reports on data growth.\n\n399\n00:24:02.903 --> 00:24:07.791\nAnd everything in between\nthat is necessary to you, and\n\n400\n00:24:07.791 --> 00:24:11.639\nso I would say when\nyou're looking at this,\n\n401\n00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:17.567\nsomething that you want to have is\nyou want to get sample of reports or\n\n402\n00:24:17.567 --> 00:24:20.910\nsomething from your provider.\n\n403\n00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:26.697\nAnd make sure that they have the ability\nto give you either executive summaries or\n\n404\n00:24:26.697 --> 00:24:32.820\nwhat have you, pertaining to your\nparticular hosting situation.\n\n405\n00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.730\nI wanna have it, I wanna be able to get\nreports that are either automatically\n\n406\n00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:39.630\ngenerated, or I can run my own queries,\npreferably both.\n\n407\n00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.870\nIt would be great if I have reports\nthat are generated maybe every week or\n\n408\n00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.490\nevery month,\ntelling me how much space I'm using,\n\n409\n00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:56.770\ngive me information on how quickly\nmy space requirements are growing.\n\n410\n00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:01.270\nStuff like that, so I can get\na better picture as we go through,\n\n411\n00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:06.150\nthat's what I need to really plan for\nfuture capacity, to allocate budgets and\n\n412\n00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:10.200\njust my applications, all that good stuff,\nthat's a really important thing.\n\n413\n00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.170\nBut then, being able to write my own\nqueries, cuz you know how it is,\n\n414\n00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:14.170\nif you're doing the stuff.\n\n415\n00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.850\nIf you're not the one in charge,\n\n416\n00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.490\nyou got someone over you, those people\nalways seem to come in your office.\n\n417\n00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:24.970\nHey, can you tell me this information,\nthis information, whatever query,\n\n418\n00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.645\nyou haven't written or don't know how to\nwrite, that's what they're gonna ask for.\n\n419\n00:25:27.645 --> 00:25:28.929\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Can you tell me\n\n420\n00:25:28.929 --> 00:25:31.520\nhow many files have\nthe word chocolate in them?\n\n421\n00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.336\nNo, I can't.\n\n422\n00:25:32.336 --> 00:25:38.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so just be prepared.\n\n423\n00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:43.650\nAnd it's It's not unheard of, in fact,\nit's very common to have reports\n\n424\n00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:47.910\ngeneration capabilities, as well as the\nability to create your own custom reports.\n\n425\n00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:52.070\nNow, some of the places to generate\nyour own customer reports may require\n\n426\n00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:56.470\na little more knowledge\non your side of things.\n\n427\n00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:00.410\nCuz you may need to get, in even in\nsome cases write stuff like SQL code.\n\n428\n00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.600\nSo guess what, you've gotta learn SQL, but\n\n429\n00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.160\nno one said this was going to be easy,\neither.\n\n430\n00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.594\nSo, fortunately, we've got courses there.\n\n431\n00:26:07.594 --> 00:26:10.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you could do a lot of stuff to\n\n432\n00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:15.760\nreally get a good eye on it and\n\n433\n00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:20.850\ndon't just assume that you're okay\n\n434\n00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:25.050\nif you don't have reporting capabilities\nor very basic reporting capabilities.\n\n435\n00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:29.970\nBecause there is something else\nthat's casting a shadow over\n\n436\n00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:34.120\nall this is that we talked about the\nCloud Controls Matrix in here early on.\n\n437\n00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:39.800\nYou have all these things like HIPAA and\nwhat have you, out there.\n\n438\n00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.770\nThey are going to require audits to during\ntheir audit process to have this type\n\n439\n00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:50.210\nof information so they may ask for stuff\nrelating to your hosting environment.\n\n440\n00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:54.750\nWhat specifically your client's asking for\nor an auditor's asking for,\n\n441\n00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.510\ncould vary, but the Cloud Controls Matrix\nwill help you out with that.\n\n442\n00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.260\nAnd then, you can make sure\nyour provider has those things.\n\n443\n00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:04.160\n>> All right,\nwell good information there, Sean.\n\n444\n00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.420\nIs there anything else we need to\nthrow in before we wrap this one up?\n\n445\n00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.570\nI think we covered it.\n\n446\n00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.070\nI think we got a good thing.\n\n447\n00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:13.630\nI would throw in here, if anything,\n\n448\n00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:18.500\nis that you very nicely put\nthe guides up there for them.\n\n449\n00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:20.550\nYou should also grab that Excel stuff.\n\n450\n00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:23.140\nYou should be able to type in\nCloud Control Matrix into Google,\n\n451\n00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.275\nas a matter of fact, and\nget that Excel spreadsheet.\n\n452\n00:27:25.275 --> 00:27:31.680\n[COUGH] Take a glance at it, and\nsee what it has, great study aid.\n\n453\n00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.220\nGreat thing for\nyou if you're moving into the cloud, or\n\n454\n00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:36.300\nyou already have moved into the cloud,\n\n455\n00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.450\nto make sure that you're still up to\nsnuff on what you've done previously.\n\n456\n00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.210\nSo there's some great stuff here, I think.\n\n457\n00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:43.990\n>> All right, very good.\n\n458\n00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:46.740\nWell ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this one.\n\n459\n00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:49.020\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n460\n00:27:49.020 -->

00:00:16.220\nI'm your host Mike Roderick,\nwith me today is the infamous, or\n\n4\n00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.420\nfamous, Sean Oriyano,\nI'm not sure which one yet.\n\n5\n00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.020\nNo, just kidding.\n\n6\n00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.184\n>> I'm not either.\n[LAUGH]\n\n7\n00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:23.146\n>> And in this episode,\n\n8\n00:00:23.146 --> 00:00:25.880\nwe're going to be talking about\nincident response review.\n\n9\n00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.796\nAnd Sean, this is something we've\ntalked a little bit about, but\n\n10\n00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:30.670\nwe're gonna go into\na little more depth and\n\n11\n00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.127\ntalk about some of the legal requirements\nand forensics and things like that.\n\n12\n00:00:34.127 --> 00:00:38.641\n>> Yeah, we're kind of just\nbringing everything together that\n\n13\n00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:43.587\nwe've talked about, and\nto weave all those threads into that final\n\n14\n00:00:43.587 --> 00:00:48.709\nsolution that we'll have for\ninstant response, which is definitely\n\n15\n00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:53.510\nvery important as we all know from\nour experiences in IT already.\n\n16\n00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.100\nAs I joked around with clients before,\nand other people before, it's\n\n17\n00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.340\nlike that whole idea of saying, hey, you\ntell people you have a plan for success.\n\n18\n00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.800\nIn incident response, you're planing for\n\n19\n00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.540\nfailure\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n20\n00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.110\n>> Which is what I would tell\n\n21\n00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.473\nmy kids if I had them.\n\n22\n00:01:11.473 --> 00:01:16.460\n[LAUGH] No, I'm not a parent,\njust in case you guys are wondering.\n\n23\n00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.535\nAnd some people are like yeah,\nthat's good.\n\n24\n00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:23.550\n>> [LAUGH] So, we know what\nincident response is at this point.\n\n25\n00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.980\n>> Yeah.\n>> I think we've been through it.\n\n26\n00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.640\nIf you need a refresher,\nyou can always go back and\n\n27\n00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.480\ncheck out our forensic investigators or\nour CISSP or\n\n28\n00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.620\nour casp or security plus or any number of\nthose episodes that we've got up there.\n\n29\n00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.450\nBut when it comes to cloud,\nthings like that, we still need,\n\n30\n00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.650\nwe might think that we don't it anymore.\n\n31\n00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.657\nWe've put it up in the cloud,\nit's not necessary,\n\n32\n00:01:42.657 --> 00:01:45.087\nsomebody else is gonna handle that,\nbut that's not the case.\n\n33\n00:01:45.087 --> 00:01:49.499\n>> Yeah, you cannot just say that\nyou're gonna put it up in the cloud and\n\n34\n00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:52.940\nit's in someone else's hands,\na baby to deal with.\n\n35\n00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:53.872\nIt's just not.\n\n36\n00:01:53.872 --> 00:01:56.889\nWhat you have to do is, you have to\ntake a more active role in this, and\n\n37\n00:01:56.889 --> 00:02:00.166\nin fact a much more active role than you\nmay in the past, to make sure that all\n\n38\n00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:03.320\nyour I's are dotted, T's are crossed,\nand not the other way around.\n\n39\n00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.370\nOtherwise you could end yourself\nup in a lot of hot water.\n\n40\n00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.010\nThere's a lot of bases\nto cover as we know.\n\n41\n00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.440\nSo you can adapt a lot of the stuff\nthat you already have over to the cloud\n\n42\n00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.740\nwithout major issues.\n\n43\n00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.110\nOther stuff you will have\nto make major issues,\n\n44\n00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.480\nespecially on the technical side\nbecause the environment has changed.\n\n45\n00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.560\nYou gotta make sure that those\nthings apply the same way.\n\n46\n00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.160\nOnce we have all those things\ndone,we should be in good shape to\n\n47\n00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.170\ndeal with problems when they occur.\n\n48\n00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.610\nBecause they will occur as we all know.\n\n49\n00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.490\nDisaster is always there,\n\n50\n00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.050\nit's just a question of when it's going\nto hit you, not if it's going to hit you.\n\n51\n00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.100\nSo it's a very important part,\njust from a sanity standpoint.\n\n52\n00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.420\nFrom a regulatory standpoint,\n\n53\n00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.990\nwe know that you cannot get away with it,\nwithout having this.\n\n54\n00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.340\nI cannot think of a single regulation out\nthere that would not in some way shape or\n\n55\n00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.190\nform deal with incident response.\n\n56\n00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.930\nIt's either going to say\nyou need to have one or\n\n57\n00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.390\nit's going to have a more detailed deal\nsaying this what needs to be done.\n\n58\n00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.780\nSo you will not get away without having\ninstant response and don't be stupid and\n\n59\n00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.940\nthink that oh, someone else is taking care\nof it, again that trust but verify deal.\n\n60\n00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.100\nOnce we understand the need for instant\nresponse and we understand the value for\n\n61\n00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.950\nit, then there becomes another level on it\nis when we look at it is any limitations.\n\n62\n00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.807\nThat might be incurred because\nof the cloud environment, and\n\n63\n00:03:36.807 --> 00:03:41.705\nthere actually are some limitations\nthat we've talked about, they're just\n\n64\n00:03:41.705 --> 00:03:46.469\ngonna kind of do a little bit of review\nhere on it to make sure you are aware of.\n\n65\n00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.198\nProbably the biggest one we have and\nthe biggest issues of\n\n66\n00:03:50.198 --> 00:03:55.550\nthe cloud is if you ever have to do any\nsort of forensic investigation on it.\n\n67\n00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.650\nWe did talk about this before and we've\ndone our whole forensic course on this.\n\n68\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.940\nIt was great to be able to do that look\nat all hows forensic stuff is done, but\n\n69\n00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.300\nwhen you move to the cloud,\nthat changes the picture.\n\n70\n00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.550\nIf you own a private cloud,\nthat still changes it.\n\n71\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.580\nA private cloud is still a cloud\nnonetheless, and due to the way that,\n\n72\n00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.610\nthe elasticity as you said of it,\nto use that term,\n\n73\n00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.160\nwhen you have elasticity, and\nthat dynamic allocation of resources, and\n\n74\n00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.070\nall that good stuff, the possibility\nthat stuff gets changed is much,\n\n75\n00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.190\nmuch higher than it is in\nreally any other environment.\n\n76\n00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.780\nYou just can't go through and\nthrow a switch and say this is it.\n\n77\n00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.400\nYou are supposed to basically\nwhat play the ball where it\n\n78\n00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.955\nlies as they say in golf?\n\n79\n00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:39.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Same deal here.\n\n80\n00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.420\nBut you really can't tell a cloud,\nhey just stop right where you are.\n\n81\n00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.830\nMemory forensics changes,\nfile carving, file recovery,\n\n82\n00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.680\nthose things change, and\nthey may not be possible in the same way.\n\n83\n00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.040\nNow if you're talking stuff\nthat are objects stored in that\n\n84\n00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.190\nvirtual environment, or just raw storage\nbeing stored there, it becomes easier.\n\n85\n00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.010\nIn fact in raw storage it becomes\na lot easier because you just have\n\n86\n00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.670\nsomething that's a physical device\nthat you're using as the cloud.\n\n87\n00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.370\nIf you're talking objects,\nwe still have that layer,\n\n88\n00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.830\nthe hosting environment underneath it,\nand we're storing stuff on top of that.\n\n89\n00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.790\nSo if this is deleted,\nwe don't have control of this.\n\n90\n00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.070\nThis can be allocated, what this was\nsitting on may be allocated to someone\n\n91\n00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.960\nsitting over here, a different tenant.\n\n92\n00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.790\nAnd so that becomes a problem,\neven if that tenant isn't using that space\n\n93\n00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:36.170\nright now, it just allocated them to that\nbecause they've requested more space, what\n\n94\n00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.770\nare you gonna do, say, no no, I wanna go\nand take a look at that space right now.\n\n95\n00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.390\nAnd oh, that other client's stuff\nis sitting there right now.\n\n96\n00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.190\nWe just can't say, hey,\nhere you go, and hand it to you.\n\n97\n00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.070\nWe're not gonna do that.\n\n98\n00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.880\nSo you have to kind of think about how\nyou're gonna adapt to that situation.\n\n99\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.600\nForensics doesn't work the same way.\n\n100\n00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.020\nIf you're dealing with stuff\nlike deletions in a database,\n\n101\n00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.790\nand alterations of logs,\nthat is a lot easier,\n\n102\n00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.890\nbecause that really doesn't\nchange too much between the two.\n\n103\n00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.860\nThe main difference being\nif you have a public cloud,\n\n104\n00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.440\nthen you may need to do subpoenas and\nstuff like that.\n\n105\n00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.380\nEspecially if the evidence,\nor suspected evidence,\n\n106\n00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.640\nis something that is over\nthe wall in the provider side.\n\n107\n00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.420\nIt's not within your control.\n\n108\n00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.740\nThey you're gonna have to do\nsubpoenas because you no longer have\n\n109\n00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.100\ncontrol of that.\n\n110\n00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.950\nAnd even though a provider\nis gonna want to help you,\n\n111\n00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.715\nhopefully they're gonna want to help you.\n\n112\n00:06:30.715 --> 00:06:36.210\n[LAUGH] They're still gonna\nrequire subpoenas to be issued.\n\n113\n00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.890\nI don't really know of a provider,\nI'm sure it happens.\n\n114\n00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.730\nBut I don't know of any smart provider\nthat's gonna say, yeah you want that long?\n\n115\n00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.040\nOr sure, we'll go ahead and\ngive it to you, you know?\n\n116\n00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.790\nThey're just gonna hand it over to\nyou because they're gonna wanna do\n\n117\n00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.910\nthe CYA deal just in\ncase anything comes up.\n\n118\n00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.650\nThey wanna make sure that, heck,\nthe procedures were followed and\n\n119\n00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.230\nthey requested it the right way and\nit got to the right way.\n\n120\n00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.330\nIt's been known to happen.\n\n121\n00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.820\n>> They've got other customers.\n\n122\n00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.170\nThey've gotta respect their information,\ntheir privacy, their SLAs and all of that.\n\n123\n00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:16.670\nI would be worried if my CSP did give\nme that information that easily.\n\n124\n00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:18.800\nBecause then I'm thinking if\nsomebody else asks for it,\n\n125\n00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.760\nmine could be snagged in there with it.\n\n126\n00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.440\n>> There you go.\n\n127\n00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.250\n>> Yeah, it would not be good.\n\n128\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.470\nGotta go through the proper channels,\ngotta know the procedures for that.\n\n129\n00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.200\nBecause that's different from\nwhat we are used to doing.\n\n130\n00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.260\nIf it all a myserver closet,\nI can go shut everything down and\n\n131\n00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.945\nI shut everything down.\n\n132\n00:07:30.945 --> 00:07:32.950\nBut disconnect from the network,\n\n133\n00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:36.690\nstart doing my job,\ncan't do that when it's up in the cloud.\n\n134\n00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.240\n>> Yeah.\nYou know, that's the thing.\n\n135\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.380\nMike read really nicely between\nthe lines for you there.\n\n136\n00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.880\nIs that, you don't want to go out and\njust request something and\n\n137\n00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.040\nhave it handed to you.\n\n138\n00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:50.180\nBecause that's all well and good, you\nmight be hey awesome, it was really easy.\n\n139\n00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.202\n>> It's great for you.\n[LAUGH] >> Yeah, it's great for you, but\n\n140\n00:07:52.202 --> 00:07:55.180\nwhat's to say that someone else\nisn't doing the same thing?\n\n141\n00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.815\nWhat do they think you're special or\nsomething?\n\n142\n00:07:57.815 --> 00:08:01.774\nNo, it very well could be you're doing\nthat to anybody else that requests.\n\n143\n00:08:01.774 --> 00:08:04.074\nWho knows, maybe their favorite client and\n\n144\n00:08:04.074 --> 00:08:07.110\nthat you may be the only\none they're doing that for.\n\n145\n00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.182\nBut I don't, it doesn't exactly give me a\nwarm fuzzy feeling that that's being done.\n\n146\n00:08:11.182 --> 00:08:16.766\nAnd besides, if something's not subpoenaed\nyou, as we learned on the forensics side,\n\n147\n00:08:16.766 --> 00:08:21.680\nif the process isn't followed, they're\nalso helping you by doing that too,\n\n148\n00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.519\nnot just giving that warm fuzzy feeling\nthat not just anybody can request this\n\n149\n00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:30.039\nstuff without having the proper\nchain being followed.\n\n150\n00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:36.766\nBut if you don't acquire evidence\nthe right way, it's not permissible,\n\n151\n00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:41.695\neven if that's the number\none evidence of your crime.\n\n152\n00:08:41.695 --> 00:08:44.670\nIt's got the persons picture\nstealing stuff out of there.\n\n153\n00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.510\nAnd they've got a big pile of data\nthey're holding, going whatever.\n\n154\n00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:48.750\nIt ain't gonna happen.\n\n155\n00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.702\nThat'd be a cool picture.\n\n156\n00:08:49.702 --> 00:08:52.650\nThat's gonna be on our ITPro page for\nsecurity.\n\n157\n00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.892\nIt's got a picture me just grabbing\nlike a pile of data and then going what?\n\n158\n00:08:55.892 --> 00:08:56.710\n[LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n159\n00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.860\nyou make a great point because a good\ndefense attorney's going to get that\n\n160\n00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:00.700\ntossed out in a heartbeat.\n\n161\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.210\nIt's not going to be admissible\nin court because of many things.\n\n162\n00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.980\nThere's no chain of custody there,\nor anything like that, so not good.\n\n163\n00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.338\nSo you gotta know those procedures.\n\n164\n00:09:09.338 --> 00:09:14.626\n>> Yeah, one of the things we learned\nwith forensics was that I think\n\n165\n00:09:14.626 --> 00:09:20.201\nwhen we started that, one of the things\nI said about it was the process\n\n166\n00:09:20.201 --> 00:09:25.124\nof really doing evidence collection,\nthe technical side.\n\n167\n00:09:25.124 --> 00:09:28.767\nI know some people might consider this\nto be a really kind of ignorant or\n\n168\n00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:30.947\narrogant statement or whatever to make.\n\n169\n00:09:30.947 --> 00:09:32.990\nThat's not that hard, it really isn't.\n\n170\n00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.270\nI think anyone that wants\nto put the effort in and\n\n171\n00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.730\nhas some technical ability can do that.\n\n172\n00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:43.070\nYou just have to be prepared\nto put in that effort, but\n\n173\n00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:49.590\nthe tricky part of forensics is,\nthose procedures can kill you right away.\n\n174\n00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.960\nYou can do everything technically,\nexactly the way you want, the way\n\n175\n00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.550\nit's supposed to be done, but you screw\nup on the procedures and done, it's over.\n\n176\n00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.450\nYou've lost everything right there.\n\n177\n00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:05.984\nSo I mean, heck, if you were with us for\nthat forensics course or\n\n178\n00:10:05.984 --> 00:10:11.108\nif you're gonna look at it,\none of the things you'll see is\n\n179\n00:10:11.108 --> 00:10:16.862\nthat there's those first few\nhandful of modules we went through.\n\n180\n00:10:16.862 --> 00:10:17.907\nThat was all the law.\n\n181\n00:10:17.907 --> 00:10:24.165\nI mean, we talked about some technical\nstuff, but the bulk of it was the law.\n\n182\n00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:28.244\nWe had a computer sitting out here, just\nwhen we had that little simulation set up,\n\n183\n00:10:28.244 --> 00:10:31.350\nwe had a computer in here and\nwe had some stuff sitting out here.\n\n184\n00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.668\nAnd yeah, as you know, I remember\nyou came out and grabbed something.\n\n185\n00:10:36.668 --> 00:10:39.071\nThat's what we're taught to do.\n\n186\n00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:41.660\nOkay, there's evidence here,\ngo pick it up, you've got it.\n\n187\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.362\nYou can't do it, even though it's sitting\nright there, it's tantalizingly out there.\n\n188\n00:10:46.362 --> 00:10:49.937\nYou can't just pick it up, there's gotta\nbe photographs taken, it has to be\n\n189\n00:10:49.937 --> 00:10:53.237\ndocumented and has to be tagged and\nbagged and labeled in a certain way or\n\n190\n00:10:53.237 --> 00:10:56.540\nit just starts getting to the point\nwhere it can't hold water.\n\n191\n00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:02.460\nSo same thing's gonna apply here when you\nask for stuff from the service provider.\n\n192\n00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.793\nSo do remember that, but\nif it's stuff that's under your control,\n\n193\n00:11:06.793 --> 00:11:11.530\nit becomes a lot easier but\nyou still gotta follow those procedures.\n\n194\n00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:16.510\nThose procedures may be modified but\nit's still going to be the same type of\n\n195\n00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:20.920\nprocedures on the collection side to make\nsure that you're dotting all of your I's\n\n196\n00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.750\nand crossing all your T's to\nreally make sure stuff is covered.\n\n197\n00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.950\nBut let me tell you some other areas\nwhere the forensic issue comes in.\n\n198\n00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:35.350\nIt's not just that the stuff underneath\neverything is hidden from you.\n\n199\n00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:40.689\nThere's also other things that come\ninto play that we really haven't\n\n200\n00:11:40.689 --> 00:11:45.844\ntalked about in context of forensics yet\nand in certain responses,\n\n201\n00:11:45.844 --> 00:11:51.632\nwhat happens if you do have a hosting\nprovider that has crossed state lines or\n\n202\n00:11:51.632 --> 00:11:56.080\nhas crossed country boundaries,\nnational boundaries.\n\n203\n00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.797\nThat's gonna dramatically\nchange your forensic process\n\n204\n00:11:59.797 --> 00:12:03.371\nbecause you just can't go and\nask for stuff over there.\n\n205\n00:12:03.371 --> 00:12:06.763\nI mean, heck, you brought up that\nexample with Microsoft that,\n\n206\n00:12:06.763 --> 00:12:08.560\nyou said with Microsoft, right?\n\n207\n00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:13.560\n>> Microsoft has data centers in Ireland\nand I think that, look it up, don't quote\n\n208\n00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:18.780\nme on this but all I wanna say is that\nthe DEA was requesting emails for a case.\n\n209\n00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:21.980\nAnd that stuff happened to be stored\non their servers in Ireland and\n\n210\n00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.410\nthey're saying, you can't come to us,\nyou've gotta go through\n\n211\n00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:30.040\nthe Irish court systems and ask them and\nit's a big turmoil right now.\n\n212\n00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.580\nThey're not really sure\nwhich way it's gonna go.\n\n213\n00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.760\nAs of right now I think the US courts\nsaid, no, Microsoft, you have to comply.\n\n214\n00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.500\nThey're in contempt at this point and\nthey're appealing it and\n\n215\n00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.250\nall that cuz that could change things.\n\n216\n00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.130\nBut it's a good example of\nwhat Sean's talking about how\n\n217\n00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.130\nthey've really changed these\nthings when you go to the cloud.\n\n218\n00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.830\nI didn't have to worry about\nthat kind of thing before.\n\n219\n00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:55.470\nNow my data could be bounced around\nanywhere as it does load balancing or\n\n220\n00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:59.040\nthat elasticity, or we move it for access,\n\n221\n00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:03.810\nour European access is a little bit faster\nfrom over there, changes everything.\n\n222\n00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:09.390\n>> Yeah, it really,\nreally messes up the whole issue,\n\n223\n00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.800\nor clouds the issue, as it were, for you.\n\n224\n00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:16.110\nThink about what that means, really.\n\n225\n00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:21.130\nYou look at something like\nMicrosoft's case, think about\n\n226\n00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.830\nwhat the impact of that would be if,\nlet's say,\n\n227\n00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:31.100\nthe situation was one where the stuff\nis what Microsoft's saying,\n\n228\n00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:35.490\nyou have to go to the Irish court\nsystem to get that information.\n\n229\n00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:41.890\nThink of the overall impact of that\nbecause what we're saying now is that\n\n230\n00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.420\nyou have to have legal\nrepresentation over there,\n\n231\n00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.020\nyou have to have someone\nfamiliar with that process.\n\n232\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.440\nLike you have to have someone\nhere familiar in the US,\n\n233\n00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.380\nyou have someone over there, and\nyou may very well have to go and\n\n234\n00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:58.180\nspend time and money going over there to\nnot only perform the forensic process,\n\n235\n00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.570\nto make sure you're adhering\nto those procedures.\n\n236\n00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:05.130\nSo you got a lawyer, heck you may not\neven be the person that's doing it now.\n\n237\n00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:09.040\nYou may have to have a forensic\npractitioner over there that's doing that,\n\n238\n00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.610\nwith that hosting provider.\n\n239\n00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:15.690\nSo, and you have that,\nthen you even get to other levels of it.\n\n240\n00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:21.900\nYou have those border issues\nwhen your solution crosses that.\n\n241\n00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.350\nWhat happens when you start\nhaving multiple providers?\n\n242\n00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.360\nWe talked about that.\n\n243\n00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.330\nThere could be a multi-cloud\nsituation where you're integrating\n\n244\n00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.220\nsolutions from different cloud providers.\n\n245\n00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.547\nMan, that's gonna be a mess.\n\n246\n00:14:34.547 --> 00:14:39.519\nThat's really gonna be nasty,\nso it's not insurmountable, but\n\n247\n00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:45.308\nthat's really gonna cause you a lot of\nconcern and a lot of sleepless nights.\n\n248\n00:14:45.308 --> 00:14:50.240\nI can guarantee it as you try to kind of\nunwind the whole solution and figure out,\n\n249\n00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.096\nhey we had an incident, but now I need to\ntrack it down through all these various\n\n250\n00:14:55.096 --> 00:14:59.620\nresources and then if those\nresources cross national boundaries.\n\n251\n00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:03.170\nThen we have another level\nthat's added onto it and\n\n252\n00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.870\ncan make your life kind of a nightmare.\n\n253\n00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:05.680\nAnd you could all of a sudden,\n\n254\n00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.750\nyou've gone from where you could have\na small forensic team that responds to it,\n\n255\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:13.260\nnow you've got a much larger one, and\nyou've got a much larger legal team.\n\n256\n00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:18.410\nAnd heck, there's probably situations,\nthough I haven't heard of any directly,\n\n257\n00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.650\nI know there are situations out\nthere where companies have said,\n\n258\n00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:23.750\nwe're just not pursuing it,\nit's not worth it.\n\n259\n00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.920\nNot unless there's something that is\nreally gonna nail him to the wall and\n\n260\n00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.040\ncause him a lot of problems.\n\n261\n00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:35.640\nThey just say, pursue it enough to figure\nout how they did whatever they did,\n\n262\n00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:38.585\nand just stop it from happening again.\n\n263\n00:15:38.585 --> 00:15:43.335\nIt can be a big, big,\nbig, big, big problem.\n\n264\n00:15:43.335 --> 00:15:45.392\nSo forensics, do your research there.\n\n265\n00:15:45.392 --> 00:15:50.347\nWe didn't talk about the cloud, doing\nforensics in the cloud in our forensic\n\n266\n00:15:50.347 --> 00:15:54.401\npractitioner, cuz that was\nfocused towards certification.\n\n267\n00:15:54.401 --> 00:15:59.928\nThose certifications do not cover them\nyet, because it really is a A new area,\n\n268\n00:15:59.928 --> 00:16:04.340\nbut [LAUGH] I'm sure you could look for\nthat in the future.\n\n269\n00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.930\nWe or someone else is gonna be covering\nthat, talking about class [CROSSTALK]\n\n270\n00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.600\n>> Take it now before they add it.\n\n271\n00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.220\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah get out there and do it [LAUGH].\n\n272\n00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.560\nFor the love of God, do it now.\n\n273\n00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:20.220\nSo, be aware that the picture,\nthat forensic picture, becomes\n\n274\n00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.750\nprobably one of the nastiest issues\nof all the stuff we've talked about.\n\n275\n00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:28.230\nA lot of the stuff is things that you\ncan plan for and you can visualize and\n\n276\n00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:31.150\nthere's tools for\ndoing forensics in the cloud.\n\n277\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.930\nYour software's a service,\nplatform's a service,\n\n278\n00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.990\ninfrastructure's a service,\nall those things.\n\n279\n00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:38.480\nThe responsibilities shift and\n\n280\n00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.110\nthere's different levels of\ninformation available to both.\n\n281\n00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:46.939\nAll those things can cause\nyou sleepless nights and\n\n282\n00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:52.220\na lot of manpower and time,\nmoney, and all that stuff.\n\n283\n00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:56.970\nSo be prepared, do your research.\n\n284\n00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:01.690\nFortunately it is evolving, and there are\nresources, like you can go to DFI News.\n\n285\n00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.990\nThey bring up stuff on\nthe cloud periodically, and\n\n286\n00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:12.360\ntalk about incidents and stuff like that,\nand things that they've done.\n\n287\n00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:18.550\nThere are some kind of fringe seminars and\nstuff like that you can look at.\n\n288\n00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.170\nI talked about\nthe High Tech Crime Association.\n\n289\n00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:27.047\nThey've got little seminars and\nwhite papers they send out from time\n\n290\n00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:31.770\nto time that talk about doing\nforensics as it relates to the cloud.\n\n291\n00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:38.239\nSo it is evolving pretty quickly,\nso it could be less of an issue,\n\n292\n00:17:38.239 --> 00:17:43.430\nor less of kind of a dark\narea we're going into here.\n\n293\n00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.850\nJust kind of like, where is it?\n\n294\n00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:50.850\nSo that would be one of\nthe biggest issues we have\n\n295\n00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.110\nout there with the cloud in\nthe area of incident response.\n\n296\n00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.846\n>> Yeah, and then the cloud just, it does\nbring up a lot of different issues that we\n\n297\n00:17:58.846 --> 00:18:01.522\ndidn't have to deal with in\nour traditional environment.\n\n298\n00:18:01.522 --> 00:18:02.132\n>> Yeah.\n\n299\n00:18:02.132 --> 00:18:06.139\n>> And if we try to compare and contrast\ntraditional incidents versus incidents in\n\n300\n00:18:06.139 --> 00:18:09.910\nthe cloud, I guess the incidents\nthemselves don't change.\n\n301\n00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:11.180\nOr do they?\n\n302\n00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.780\n>> They change scale is what it is.\n\n303\n00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:18.330\nWhen you get to it is that, you get\nan incident that's gone through and\n\n304\n00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.660\npushed right out there into\nthat cloud environment.\n\n305\n00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.180\nThe scales change, the underlying\nenvironment underneath it is changed.\n\n306\n00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.843\nYeah, so that changes a bit there, but\n\n307\n00:18:29.843 --> 00:18:35.130\ntraditional incident\nresponse can be adapted.\n\n308\n00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.500\nIncidents, like you said yourself,\ndon't change.\n\n309\n00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:42.410\nIn fact, some of them might\nactually decrease just a bit.\n\n310\n00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:46.230\nOne of the things that I think about is\nwhere, what if you went from a traditional\n\n311\n00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:50.880\nenvironment where you're hosting\na web application or web service\n\n312\n00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:57.180\non just your old style environments,\nyour traditional style environments?\n\n313\n00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.690\nIf someone does a denial\nof service against you,\n\n314\n00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:04.900\na distributed denial of service, it's\neasier for them to cause a problem there.\n\n315\n00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:09.860\nA cloud environment, you've got that\nhuge scale now, it's a lot harder for\n\n316\n00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.072\nthem to trip you up.\n\n317\n00:19:11.072 --> 00:19:12.800\n>> All right, Sean,\nwell a lot of good information there.\n\n318\n00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.730\nAnything else we wanna throw in this\nepisode before we wrap things up?\n\n319\n00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:21.660\n>> Well, it's just to make sure that we're\ndoing this review on incident response,\n\n320\n00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.160\nand just kinda make sure that\nwe're understanding that\n\n321\n00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:28.930\nthere's a lot of the old, but there's\na good part of the new mixed into it.\n\n322\n00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.835\nAnd that's why we're just kind\nof tying everything together,\n\n323\n00:19:31.835 --> 00:19:35.546\nis to make sure that when all these little\nindividual threads come together to form\n\n324\n00:19:35.546 --> 00:19:39.550\nyour incident response solution, you don't\nnecessarily have to reinvent the wheel.\n\n325\n00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:44.059\nBut you need to be able understand\nthe differences to see how your plan is\n\n326\n00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:48.119\ngonna be modified to account for\nthese changes in technology and\n\n327\n00:19:48.119 --> 00:19:51.080\npotential changes and\nthreats along the way.\n\n328\n00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:55.100\nOnce you take that in account you\nshould be in pretty good shape.\n\n329\n00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.840\nAnd then also the forensics part of it.\n\n330\n00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:03.028\nI would encourage those of you that\nhaven't watched the forensics course to\n\n331\n00:20:03.028 --> 00:20:06.570\nwatch it and kind of see the issues\nthat are involved there.\n\n332\n00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.468\nEspecially if you're going\ninto something like this,\n\n333\n00:20:08.468 --> 00:20:11.630\ncuz it acquaints you better with what you\nneed to do or might need to consider.\n\n334\n00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:16.010\nEven though we didn't talk about the cloud\nthere, it'll help you kind of get oriented\n\n335\n00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:19.010\nto the type of things that you\nmight need to be considering.\n\n336\n00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:20.380\n>> Very good.\n\n337\n00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.730\nAll right, well everyone,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n338\n00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.120\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n339\n00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:27.140\n>> And I'm Sean Oryiano\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n340\n00:20:27.140 -->

00:00:14.750\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.840\nWith me today is none other than Mr.\nSean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.130\nAnd Sean, in this one we're gonna be\ntalking about Cloud incident response.\n\n6\n00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.150\nI know we've already talked a little\nbit about incident response, and\n\n7\n00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.240\ndifferentiated between how we handled\nincidents in our traditional networking\n\n8\n00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.920\nenvironment versus the cloud but little\nmore focus on the cloud set of things?\n\n9\n00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.604\n>> Yes, we're kind of changing our view\njust a bit here because we've been\n\n10\n00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:41.120\ntalking, we haven't talk about incident\nresponse and as we kind of start wrapping\n\n11\n00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.050\nthings up here with the big\npart of incident response.\n\n12\n00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.250\nWe do need to talk about a couple\nspecific, or a Cloud specific issues.\n\n13\n00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.640\nAnd so we're gonna make sure we\nget those things taken care of.\n\n14\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.950\nAnd cuz like you said, for the most part,\na lot of the stuff that you have for\n\n15\n00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.010\nyour traditional environments for incident\nresponse, you can just adapt them over, or\n\n16\n00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.080\nyou can seek guidance on stuff and\nthings in the cloud.\n\n17\n00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.300\nBut we still do need to talk about\nsome things that the Cloud can\n\n18\n00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.480\nmake a little more difficult for you.\n\n19\n00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.070\nYou know Cloud has advantages, but like\nanything you don't get things for free.\n\n20\n00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.680\nYou have to pay for it somehow.\n\n21\n00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.440\nSo that's what we're coming into,\n\n22\n00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.200\nis talking about what comes\nalong as part of the package.\n\n23\n00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.370\nSo, one of the things you have when\nyou talk about scaling things up and\n\n24\n00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.490\nthe Cloud is definitely\nscaling things up and\n\n25\n00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.230\nadding in a whole another\nlevel of complexity to things.\n\n26\n00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.430\nEven though we can simplify it,\nthere still is, end of the day,\n\n27\n00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.950\nanother level of complexity added to it.\n\n28\n00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.900\nAnd how complex that gets, or\nhow many levels you get in there,\n\n29\n00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.750\nreally kinda depends on you\nin your particular situation.\n\n30\n00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.860\nOne of the things you're going to have is\nthe incident response can be a much more\n\n31\n00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.650\ndifficult proposition because even though\nyou can adapt your traditional stuff to\n\n32\n00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.660\nthe Cloud, the question comes well,\nhow quickly can you make that work.\n\n33\n00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.640\nAnd why your traditional stuff,\neven if you have multiple sites.\n\n34\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.160\nWithout a Cloud and all within the same\ncompany it is a little easier, or\n\n35\n00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.170\nit becomes a lot easier and\n\n36\n00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.740\nit is with the Cloud because what\ncan you do inside your own company?\n\n37\n00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.520\nYou've got hotlines to\nsomeone in another area.\n\n38\n00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.690\nIt's all under the same roof so to speak\neven if you're not in the same location.\n\n39\n00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.890\nIt becomes easier to deal with.\n\n40\n00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.450\nBut once you start bringing\nin a outside provider,\n\n41\n00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.810\nan additional outside providers\nas the case may be and\n\n42\n00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.725\nall the complexities as far as who's doing\nwhat, then it starts to slow things down.\n\n43\n00:02:37.725 --> 00:02:41.610\nBut the thing is, is that you can have\nan incident response with the Cloud that\n\n44\n00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.350\ncan respond to an incident, you've adapted\nto it and can respond to an incident.\n\n45\n00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.930\nBut it's one thing to\nrespond to an incident, and\n\n46\n00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.090\none thing to respond to\nan incident in a timely manner.\n\n47\n00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.960\nIt's kind of like saying,\nyeah we can put out a fire.\n\n48\n00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.000\nBut when do you put the fire?\n\n49\n00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.470\nWhen it's just small little\nthing on the end, or\n\n50\n00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.890\nis there some smoking\nembers at the bottom.\n\n51\n00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.230\nYou're just like you should\npour a glass of water on it.\n\n52\n00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.820\nThat doesn't help anybody.\n\n53\n00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.910\nSo it's just a question of how long\nit takes and so you need to learn to\n\n54\n00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.100\nadapt to that and figure out how your team\ncan really deal with this the right way.\n\n55\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.530\n>> And I would think too Sean that\nif we go with public Cloud solution.\n\n56\n00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.090\nThey probably have their\nown incident response team.\n\n57\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.420\nI mean they've got their plans,\nthey gotta do just like we do, and\n\n58\n00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.310\nprotect their network, protect their\ninformation, protect their customers.\n\n59\n00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.630\nSo we see a situation where our incident\nresponse team now has to work alongside or\n\n60\n00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.810\nwith these guys out there.\n\n61\n00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:38.620\n>> Yeah.\nYou will.\n\n62\n00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.620\nYou absolutely will.\n\n63\n00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.150\nYou have to figure out those\ncross team types of situations.\n\n64\n00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.310\nLet me tell you, working across\nany situation where you have\n\n65\n00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.990\na team from one place, team from another\nplace, who takes charge, who does what.\n\n66\n00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.930\nAre you speaking the same lingo?\n\n67\n00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.060\nThere's all sorts of issues\nthat come into play there.\n\n68\n00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.680\nI've seen it.\n\n69\n00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.960\nI've seen those things come into play and\nthey've come into play in a lot of areas.\n\n70\n00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.740\nAnd what's cool about it is if you look\nfor this information in incident response,\n\n71\n00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.930\nif you look in the right areas you can\nfind some stuff that could actually help\n\n72\n00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.840\nyou out.\n\n73\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.880\nThat may not be Cloud related, or\nmay not be IT related even but\n\n74\n00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.170\nit can help you recognize types\nof issues that might come up.\n\n75\n00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.272\nI immediately think when I start\nlooking at we have an organization and\n\n76\n00:04:30.272 --> 00:04:34.450\nthen we We had that has it's\nown incident response issues.\n\n77\n00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.005\nThey outsource stuff\nto an external vendor.\n\n78\n00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:39.100\nThat vendor may have subcontractors.\n\n79\n00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.415\nAnd we have other solutions out there\nin different parts of the Cloud,\n\n80\n00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:45.110\nand then we're gluing it together.\n\n81\n00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.730\nWith our telecom providers,\n\n82\n00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.990\nthere's a lot of people that\nare part of that pie, that solution.\n\n83\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.730\nSo what you gotta do,\nyou gotta coordinate all of those things.\n\n84\n00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.370\nThey're not all speaking the same\nlanguage, and they definitely, if\n\n85\n00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.830\nthe incident pertains to you, they want to\nhelp you cuz they want your business and\n\n86\n00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.280\nwant your money, is what it comes down to.\n\n87\n00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.150\nAnd not to sound pessimistic but\nthat's what it comes down to.\n\n88\n00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.600\nThey want your business and\nthey want to do this.\n\n89\n00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.170\nSo they're going to help you, but\n\n90\n00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.290\nthey don't have the same\nmotivations that you do.\n\n91\n00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.070\nYou need to get it because you're the one\nthat's got your neck on the line.\n\n92\n00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.910\nThey wanna help you but, again,\n\n93\n00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.820\nthey're not the ones that\nare ultimately going to be responsible.\n\n94\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.615\nIf something fails oh well.\n\n95\n00:05:27.615 --> 00:05:33.360\nI see these types of problems with\nsomething I do for the military.\n\n96\n00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.080\nIt's the command.\n\n97\n00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.820\nThey train us on that.\n\n98\n00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.770\nOne of the ratings I have is how\nto deal with these large events.\n\n99\n00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.550\nIt's kind of eye opening when you get in.\n\n100\n00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.220\nYou think that if you have to\ndeal with civilian agencies,\n\n101\n00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.350\nyou think that, shouldn't they speak the\n[INAUDIBLE] we're all on the same page.\n\n102\n00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.740\nShouldn't we be speaking\nthe same language.\n\n103\n00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.550\nThey're not speaking the same language,\nand even in the biggest situations,\n\n104\n00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.830\nyou get these political type things and\nthis infighting.\n\n105\n00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.610\nPeople don't speak the same language or\nsame priorities.\n\n106\n00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.000\nThey're trying to figure\nout who's in charge.\n\n107\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.740\nIt may not even be a political situation.\n\n108\n00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.980\nIt may be people show up, who's in charge?\n\n109\n00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.170\nSounds like the start\nof a really bad joke.\n\n110\n00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.880\nIt's like a priest and show up.\n\n111\n00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.930\nAnd it sounds like that\ntype of situation but\n\n112\n00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.080\nyou get a bunch of people that show up.\n\n113\n00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.290\nIt's, if you don't have a plan in place,\nwho's in charge?\n\n114\n00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.280\n>> I see it all the time in\nthese old cop shows where.\n\n115\n00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.160\nThe local precinct cops are there,\nand then the feds come in,\n\n116\n00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.350\nand then homeland comes in, so\nyou're saying, it's not just on tv,\n\n117\n00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.940\nthis happens when we're dealing with\nthis out there in the real world.\n\n118\n00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.820\n>> Yeah, it absolutely happens, and\nwhat they've had to do, over the past few\n\n119\n00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.910\nyears, or past decade plus\n>> They've\n\n120\n00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.580\nstarted refining these\nincident command systems.\n\n121\n00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.440\nSo here in the US,\ndepartment of homeland security and\n\n122\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.930\nFEMA has come up with\na common terminology and\n\n123\n00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.730\ncommon procedures, so\nthat is effective enough but still\n\n124\n00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.540\ngeneric enough that it can be adapted and\nadopted across multiple organizations.\n\n125\n00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.640\nAnd help them work together and\nfigure out who's doing what.\n\n126\n00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.860\nAnd it establishes what a chain of command\nwould be, so if you have those people\n\n127\n00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:24.980\nshow up you can figure out with reasonable\nease whose gonna be in charge and\n\n128\n00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.770\nhow the hand off works and\nhow crew rotations, all those things work.\n\n129\n00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.230\nSo that work has been done.\n\n130\n00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.000\nSo you can look up stuff like\nincident command system.\n\n131\n00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.280\nFEMA and DHS has that.\n\n132\n00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.862\nThey have courses called,\n\n133\n00:07:41.862 --> 00:07:46.420\nthey're little online flash courses\nthat you can go through really quickly.\n\n134\n00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.371\nThey have like, ICS 100 and\n200 and 300, so on and so forth.\n\n135\n00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:54.062\nYou probably only need\nto look at IC 100 200,\n\n136\n00:07:54.062 --> 00:07:57.628\nit'll give you an idea of some of\nthe issues that come up with large,\n\n137\n00:07:57.628 --> 00:08:00.400\nwith multiple organizations and\nlarge incidents.\n\n138\n00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.430\nWhich this, with the cloud provider,\ncould be part,\n\n139\n00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.185\nit could actually fit\nthat kind of situation.\n\n140\n00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:11.255\nNow you might not be with the mudslide or\nchemical attack or terrorists attack or\n\n141\n00:08:11.255 --> 00:08:12.595\nanything like that.\n\n142\n00:08:12.595 --> 00:08:16.285\nYou're dealing with a large incident, it\ncan help you figure out hey, I can develop\n\n143\n00:08:16.285 --> 00:08:20.165\nan instant response plan or fine tune\nmy existing instant response plan.\n\n144\n00:08:20.165 --> 00:08:23.875\nGet information from all parties involved,\nor might be involved, and\n\n145\n00:08:23.875 --> 00:08:28.445\nthen bring that together to make a plan\nthat accommodates everyone and makes it so\n\n146\n00:08:28.445 --> 00:08:32.150\nwe can respond effectively\nin a timely fashion.\n\n147\n00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.470\nWhich is what you're trying to do.\n\n148\n00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.530\nIf you don't have that, you may end\nup with people just doing that.\n\n149\n00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.410\nAgain, that start of a bad joke where\nthey just show up and people show up,\n\n150\n00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:42.860\nwho's in charge?\n\n151\n00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.020\nAnd you definitely do not want that.\n\n152\n00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:48.170\nThere's arguments and\nthings like that happening, when,\n\n153\n00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.430\nyou know, when something's on fire.\n\n154\n00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.450\n>> Makes for good TV drama.\n\n155\n00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:52.950\nNot so\n\n156\n00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.260\ngood when we're doing a real incident\nresponse and my data is on the line.\n\n157\n00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.358\n>> Yea, absolutely, and then.\n\n158\n00:09:00.358 --> 00:09:03.790\n>> You know, establishing who's\nin charge and like I said,\n\n159\n00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.470\nI've said it multiple\ntimes that terminology if,\n\n160\n00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.740\nwell heck do I really need to say\n>> I know you've got a great story,\n\n161\n00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:13.256\nlet's do it again.\n\n162\n00:09:13.256 --> 00:09:16.730\n[LAUGH] I mean first of all do\nI really need to say in the IT\n\n163\n00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.700\nfield that terminology kinda sucks?\n\n164\n00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:24.420\nEveryone has got a term for something,\nhow many times have you been out there,\n\n165\n00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:28.990\nsomeone's talking to someone\nabout using some weird term.\n\n166\n00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.080\n>> Yeah.\n>> What?\n\n167\n00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.790\nYou feel like, man,\nI need to Google this, or something.\n\n168\n00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.310\nAnd then finally,\nwhen you start talking about it.\n\n169\n00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.810\n>> Oh.\n>> They're just calling it something else.\n\n170\n00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.125\nIt's like, come here.\n\n171\n00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:39.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n172\n00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.050\nthe story, I think I mentioned it.\n\n173\n00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:46.780\nYou probably remember about\nthe terminology one, they had an incident\n\n174\n00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:51.360\nyears ago during during the riots in\n\n175\n00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.280\nsouthern California which\nhappen seasonally apparently.\n\n176\n00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.800\nIs it riot season already?\n\n177\n00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.540\nBut what they had is they\nhad a situation where\n\n178\n00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.340\nthey had some guys from\nNational Guard backing up the police.\n\n179\n00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:12.080\nAnd what happened is someone stole,\nsomeone went to a store and\n\n180\n00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.450\nstole a TV and apparently they were\narmed or something during this,\n\n181\n00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:21.180\nand so of course the police are going\nto get involved in that and\n\n182\n00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.740\nhad the National Guard backing them up.\n\n183\n00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.310\nThey had a squad of guys backing them up.\n\n184\n00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:27.310\n>> And so the two police go in.\n\n185\n00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.170\nIn those situations a civilian\nagency is in charge.\n\n186\n00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.370\nSo they track the guy through helicopter.\n\n187\n00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.880\nHe goes into a house.\n\n188\n00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.220\nThe police are out there.\n\n189\n00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.420\nThey have the guard with him.\n\n190\n00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.940\nThey're saying they're trying\nto get the guy to come out.\n\n191\n00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.420\nAnd so,\nwhen they're trying to talk to him,\n\n192\n00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.350\nthe police said that one of\nthe officers said, you know,\n\n193\n00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.760\ntold these guys to cover us and\nthat's the wrong thing to say.\n\n194\n00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.100\nThat means something different on the law\nenforcement than it does on the military\n\n195\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.560\nside, as anyone's been on\nthe military side will tell ya.\n\n196\n00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.030\nThere's, the law enforcement side and\ncivilian side cover me means hey,\n\n197\n00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:03.280\nI have everything ready to go,\nand if someone threatens you,\n\n198\n00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.700\nI'm ready to cover you and\ntake him out, or whatever.\n\n199\n00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.375\nOn the military side\neveryone's popping up and.\n\n200\n00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:13.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Spraying in a spray and\n\n201\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.160\npray kind of type thing.\n\n202\n00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.240\nYou know, maybe not that dramatic, but\n\n203\n00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.690\nyeah, that's what happened\nin the situation.\n\n204\n00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.700\nThese guys said cover us, and you've got\na couple of officers that are expecting,\n\n205\n00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.230\nhey, these guys are going to have\ntheir eyes out and taking cover and\n\n206\n00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.940\nconcealment and all this.\n\n207\n00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:34.730\n>> But no, they just stood up and\njust started unloading on this dwelling.\n\n208\n00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:38.580\nAnd they had gone through, and they\n\n209\n00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:44.880\nhad fired off a hundred,\n150 rounds, into that thing.\n\n210\n00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:49.970\n[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE] There's\nsomebody who never committed a,\n\n211\n00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.390\nthis guy won't jay walk or\nanything else anymore.\n\n212\n00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.060\nGuy isn't even tearing tags\noff of mattresses anymore.\n\n213\n00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.510\nWhat the hell just happened?\n\n214\n00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.250\nBut what you had there, all joking aside,\n\n215\n00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:06.330\nis you have something where\nit's a term that's being used,\n\n216\n00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:12.020\nthat term,cover me, and\nboth sides had a definition for that.\n\n217\n00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:16.710\nThey used the same term but\ntheir's two different definitions of that.\n\n218\n00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:21.100\n>> And the accompanying response to that,\nso what you wanna do,\n\n219\n00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.480\nis you wanna make sure that\nterm means the same thing.\n\n220\n00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.830\nAnd that was one of the incidents\nthat precipitated making sure that\n\n221\n00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.870\nthe response was to a certain\nsituation was the right one.\n\n222\n00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.860\nYou're gonna want the same thing when\nyou're responding to incidents in\n\n223\n00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.330\nthe cloud, is to make sure when you're\ntalking to all these different providers.\n\n224\n00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.810\n>> And vendors,\n\n225\n00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:46.610\nwhat you're telling them to do is\nthe expectations are set on both sides.\n\n226\n00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:51.400\nAnd they know what they should be doing,\nthey should know what you're doing and\n\n227\n00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.810\nyes, this will be defined in an SLA.\n\n228\n00:12:53.810 --> 00:12:57.340\nBut this can also be other\nparts in here to define it.\n\n229\n00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.500\nI would not be above having\nan instant response plan and\n\n230\n00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:06.560\neven having, you know,\non the back side of it.\n\n231\n00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:09.300\nYou know an appendix or\nsomething or attachment saying,\n\n232\n00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.880\nhey these were the definitions\nthat are being used.\n\n233\n00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.270\nHeck, if you're doing it the right way,\nI mean one of the most common things you\n\n234\n00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:21.310\nhave when people write documents, and\nI can tell you this from being an author.\n\n235\n00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:25.600\nIs that when I write books or\n\n236\n00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.820\nwrite papers or anything,\nI always make sure and\n\n237\n00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:35.110\nif I don't whoever's editing my stuff\nalways dings me on it which they should\n\n238\n00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:40.320\nbe, is that when I use any term,\nit's always define what that is.\n\n239\n00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.930\nIf it's an acronym or anything it's\ndefined the first time you use it and\n\n240\n00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.630\nthen after that you can use\nthe acronym without defining it.\n\n241\n00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:52.370\nSo you should be using that type of\nmethodology in your procedures as well.\n\n242\n00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.600\nIs to make sure those things are defined\nas well as hey put an attachment\n\n243\n00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.640\non there so someone can hey I see a,\nokay that's what that means so.\n\n244\n00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.900\nThere's as little ambiguity\nin there as possible.\n\n245\n00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.850\nIt's like David said in here,\na term glossary, appendix, dictionary,\n\n246\n00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:10.510\nI don't even care what you call it.\n\n247\n00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.570\nJust make sure you have it there so\nthat ambiguity is removed.\n\n248\n00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:16.470\n>> All right.\n\n249\n00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.830\nAnd then, what do you got down here,\na main source for\n\n250\n00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.410\ndetection analysis of an incident.\n\n251\n00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.800\nSo, and where are we getting\nthis information from?\n\n252\n00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.110\n>> Well, what this refers to, in here,\nis when you talk about detection and\n\n253\n00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.190\nanalysis of an incident.\n\n254\n00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:35.020\nWhat's happening here is,\nyou're trying to figure out,\n\n255\n00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.900\nnot only analyzing data from an incident,\nbut, that's challenging because,\n\n256\n00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.020\nagain, you have those multiple data\nsources that stuff is coming from.\n\n257\n00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.960\nBut then you also have a situation when\nyou talk about sources of an incident.\n\n258\n00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.080\nWhere'd the incident actually start?\n\n259\n00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.610\nDid it start at one of your providers and\nkind of crawl through various things?\n\n260\n00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.270\nOr the place where you found it,\nis that as far as it's spread,\n\n261\n00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.990\nis at the whole entire scope of it?\n\n262\n00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:05.850\nYou know, something that I think\nof is an event that a large.\n\n263\n00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:10.870\nI know a large company it's\nhappened to some years ago.\n\n264\n00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:15.770\nAnd what happened is they had\nan incident where someone that was\n\n265\n00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:20.510\ntrying to get access to product designs.\n\n266\n00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:25.130\nAnd because they couldn't get\ninto the systems at the main\n\n267\n00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.110\ncompany because they were really hardened.\n\n268\n00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:33.410\nWhat they did is since it was a very,\nvery large global company they went in and\n\n269\n00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:40.060\nbusted into, or hacked into an office on\nthe other side of the globe basically.\n\n270\n00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:44.900\nWhere they had only a small number\nof people that you're talking six or\n\n271\n00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:49.260\nless people there so they outsourced\nthe IT to the local computer guy.\n\n272\n00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.599\nLocal computer guy that maintained\nthe stuff there made some mistakes, and so\n\n273\n00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:55.450\nsomeone was able to get in there.\n\n274\n00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.852\nAnd once they got on that network in\nthat office they were able to compromise\n\n275\n00:15:58.852 --> 00:16:02.308\nsystems there and get credentials, and\nthen bump up from there and pivot and\n\n276\n00:16:02.308 --> 00:16:04.528\nturn into another network and\nanother network.\n\n277\n00:16:04.528 --> 00:16:07.132\nThey were able to keep\nmoving through networks and\n\n278\n00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:11.162\nescalating privileges to get higher and\nhigher until they got to a point where\n\n279\n00:16:11.162 --> 00:16:14.020\nthey found they were still\non the periphery of things.\n\n280\n00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:15.190\nEven though they got to bigger and\n\n281\n00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:19.750\nbigger offices they where on the periphery\nof things until they did some scanning and\n\n282\n00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:25.770\nfound that one system that\nhad two network cards in it.\n\n283\n00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.790\nAnd the, the network cards had in it,\nsomeone had, as is gonna happen,\n\n284\n00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:32.960\nthis is why you do audits and\nmake sure this doesn't happen.\n\n285\n00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.680\nSomeone had,\na system had two network cards.\n\n286\n00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.330\nOne was plugged into the secure network,\none was plugged into the regular network.\n\n287\n00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:44.620\nAnd so someone found that system and split\ntunneled it and went through and was,\n\n288\n00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:48.390\nand hopped networks and\ngot right on in to the heart of things.\n\n289\n00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.720\nAnd was able to get copies of those\n\n290\n00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.930\nproduct designs after doing\na lot of work to get there.\n\n291\n00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.610\nIt was actually a very impressive feat,\nand it was verified.\n\n292\n00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.990\nIt wasn't just something that was heresay,\n\n293\n00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:03.940\nthat they did it,\nyou're taking your word for it.\n\n294\n00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.540\nNo, it was verified by\npeople on the inside,\n\n295\n00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:11.700\nyeah we saw what that person\nis claiming and it is legit.\n\n296\n00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.210\nAnd they're pretty pissed\nthat this had happened\n\n297\n00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.500\nbecause the situation\nshouldn't have happened.\n\n298\n00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:22.000\nNow think of something along those\nlines happening in the cloud.\n\n299\n00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.900\nIf you were trying to detect an incident\nlike that, think about the challenges with\n\n300\n00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:31.820\nthat because you've got something you've\nfound in the logs in the main company that\n\n301\n00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:36.780\nsomeone has stolen or\ncopied part of your, copied your designs.\n\n302\n00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.310\nYou found that access.\n\n303\n00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.630\nNow you're tracking it back.\n\n304\n00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.950\nIt's like okay, I found an account\ncompromised here, but wait a minute.\n\n305\n00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.790\nThere's evidence on that system\nthat it came from someplace else.\n\n306\n00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.910\nNow you gotta track it back over here, and\nthen you gotta track it back over there.\n\n307\n00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.450\nAnd then you gotta unravel everything.\n\n308\n00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:56.770\nAnd since you don't actually\nknow the scope of the incident,\n\n309\n00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.070\neven when you track it back to\nthe source of where it came from.\n\n310\n00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:04.640\nYou don't know who that person was,\npresumably, at least not yet.\n\n311\n00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.670\nSo you're going through and\nyou're starting to open all this stuff.\n\n312\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.550\nAnd you're peeling away the layers.\n\n313\n00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:11.230\nCuz you don't know how far this goes.\n\n314\n00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:13.300\nYou know, you've got to take\neverything into account.\n\n315\n00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:15.970\nYou can not afford to be lazy and\nsay okay,\n\n316\n00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.700\nwell this doesn't look like they got this.\n\n317\n00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:25.500\nYou've got to be absolutely sure\nthat someone didn't dig into this.\n\n318\n00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:27.760\nYou can't just say,\nokay they didn't get over here.\n\n319\n00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:29.050\nAre you sure they didn't get over there?\n\n320\n00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:30.110\nHave you checked it?\n\n321\n00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:34.360\nYou've gotta check all these loopholes and\nissues to track it down.\n\n322\n00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:36.790\nSee how far down that rabbit hole goes.\n\n323\n00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:41.760\nAnd it's a very costly,\ntedious and painful thing to do.\n\n324\n00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.500\n>> I suppose it probably goes without\nsaying, but as we move to the cloud,\n\n325\n00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.958\nwe are increasing our attack surface.\n\n326\n00:18:47.958 --> 00:18:50.870\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes to\n\n327\n00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.680\nyou that's a beautiful term to be using.\n\n328\n00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.430\nThat's exactly what it is is that.\n\n329\n00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.290\nThe attack surface has increased.\n\n330\n00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.940\nYou've introduced complexity.\n\n331\n00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.450\nYou can do things to harden systems,\nand the vendor themselves,\n\n332\n00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.800\nwho's providing the stuff should\nbe doing things to harden systems.\n\n333\n00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.090\nBut still, there's enough there.\n\n334\n00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:12.010\nOnce you start pushing stuff\noutside your perimeter,\n\n335\n00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:13.600\nyou're de-perimeterizing things,\n\n336\n00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.860\nto use that term, you have increased\nthe complexity and the attack surface.\n\n337\n00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.120\nAnd while you can make it,\nyou know, secure.\n\n338\n00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:27.110\nIt is a very tricky situation to\ncontend with and very challenging.\n\n339\n00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.910\nJust imagine how difficult\nit is to track down\n\n340\n00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.210\nan incident with\nthe forensics we looked at.\n\n341\n00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.412\nWe were talking about single incidents and\nsmall incidents,\n\n342\n00:19:36.412 --> 00:19:39.860\nnow you bring in the cloud and\nthe stuff we talked about there and\n\n343\n00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:45.120\nthen multiple clouds and\nacross borders, all these unknowns.\n\n344\n00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:49.230\nIt'll have you pulling your hair out,\nit will.\n\n345\n00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.220\n>> I can imagine.\n\n346\n00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.070\nAnd then trying to contain it,\nthat was one of the things we talk\n\n347\n00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:56.650\nabout in our other shows with\nforensics investigations, or\n\n348\n00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:00.540\nin incidence response, the first thing we\nwanna do, try to limit the damage, right?\n\n349\n00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.210\nTry to contain it.\n\n350\n00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.190\nHow do I do that when\nit's out in the cloud?\n\n351\n00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.360\n>> That is something that could\nbe done as a case by case basis.\n\n352\n00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.230\nYou start getting into\nsome unknowns there.\n\n353\n00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.020\nYou do wanna try to contain it, but\n\n354\n00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:18.180\nhow do you contain it based on\nthe nature of that specific incident?\n\n355\n00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:19.490\nYou don't know.\n\n356\n00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:22.080\nFirst, you've gotta do that analysis and\nstart figuring out,\n\n357\n00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.360\nhow can you start locking it down?\n\n358\n00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.550\nAnd then when you start looking at it,\nthink about this,\n\n359\n00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:31.300\nunless you own that cloud, if its been\ncompromised or someone's busted isolation.\n\n360\n00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.750\nI could actually see situations where\nsomeone's busted into a tenant,\n\n361\n00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:39.340\nanother tenant of the hosting\nproviders you've been in.\n\n362\n00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:40.520\nBusted isolation and\n\n363\n00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:45.690\nhopped over into your stuff, in which\ncase, hey, they've come from over here.\n\n364\n00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.180\nMaybe you've done your forensic analysis.\n\n365\n00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.480\nHey, I've got evidence that\nthey've come from right over here,\n\n366\n00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.800\non the other side of this.\n\n367\n00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.780\nWell, they do that.\n\n368\n00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:52.910\nWhat are you going to do?\n\n369\n00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.090\nTell them, hey, shut those people down.\n\n370\n00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:56.055\n>> Right.\n>> Good luck.\n\n371\n00:20:56.055 --> 00:20:59.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me know how that works out.\n\n372\n00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.700\nYou might be able to succeed at it, but\nit's going to be very, very tricky.\n\n373\n00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.620\nYou're not gonna call up your provider and\ngo, yeah can you shut so and so down,\n\n374\n00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.890\nbecause I've got an attack being launched?\n\n375\n00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:11.240\nYeah thank you, click.\n\n376\n00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.810\nYeah it just ain't gonna happen.\n\n377\n00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:16.240\nThey're gonna be, okay, that's very cute.\n\n378\n00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:17.480\nYou got another joke for us?\n\n379\n00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.120\nThat's the way it's gonna be, they're\nnot just gonna take your word for it.\n\n380\n00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.010\nSo they're gonna have to do\ntheir own incident response.\n\n381\n00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.390\nThey're gonna have to figure out\nwhat's going on on their side.\n\n382\n00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:28.680\nYou may be able to provide them\nwith your information that's,\n\n383\n00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.270\nand you should be providing them with\nthe information that validates this or\n\n384\n00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:38.000\nvalidates your position as you see it,\nbut you may not get anywhere.\n\n385\n00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.130\n>> Right.\n\n386\n00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:40.710\nAll right, well, Sean,\nlot of great information.\n\n387\n00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:44.350\nI know we got more than we want to\ntalk about with incident response and\n\n388\n00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.880\nthe cloud but look at the clock.\n\n389\n00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.380\nWe're about out of time for this one.\n\n390\n00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:50.230\nAnything else you wanna throw\nin before we wrap this one up?\n\n391\n00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.390\n>> No, I don't think we have anything,\nreally, right now.\n\n392\n00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.560\nI mean,\nthat kinda just covers the big issues.\n\n393\n00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:00.170\nWe're coming to the end of covering\nthe major portions of incident response,\n\n394\n00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:04.760\nand you know, hopefully you're getting\nthe feeling for the fact that you can get\n\n395\n00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.800\nan instant response system but\nwhy you can adapt traditional.\n\n396\n00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.860\nIt's traditional but\nit's also new stuff too.\n\n397\n00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:13.620\n>> Very good.\n\n398\n00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.830\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n399\n00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:17.190\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n400\n00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.520\nSigning off for\nITProTV I am Mike Roderick.\n\n401\n00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.315\n>>

00:00:14.520\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.340\nWith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.610\nAnd Sean, in this one we're gonna be\ntalking about, well, you guessed it,\n\n6\n00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.410\nmore Cloud incident response, right?\n\n7\n00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.140\n>> That's it.\n\n8\n00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.946\nWe're going to complete our\njourney to the dark side.\n\n9\n00:00:26.946 --> 00:00:32.910\n[LAUGH] Just make sure your guys know who\nDarth Vader is cuz we had that discussion.\n\n10\n00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.060\n>> Yeah [LAUGH]\n>> So, you had to be here.\n\n11\n00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.470\nBut yeah, we're talking about our\nlittle SLPs here on incident response,\n\n12\n00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.970\nto kind of just wrap everything up,\nor bring it to its conclusion here.\n\n13\n00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.140\nSo, what we're trying to do here for\n\n14\n00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.130\nincident response is, we're also\ntrying to be a little proactive.\n\n15\n00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.690\nAnd so that's what this is getting into,\n\n16\n00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.840\nis we're talking about doing things\nto reduce the type of incidents.\n\n17\n00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.620\nThat's where things like your reports\ncome in, and your logging comes in,\n\n18\n00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.680\nis that you're looking at those\nthings as incidents happen.\n\n19\n00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.840\nAnd I would even go as far as to say,\nand I don't think this is unreasonable.\n\n20\n00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.770\nIt's not something that I'm coming up\nwith something revolutionary here.\n\n21\n00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.990\nIs that don't just wait for an incident to\nhappen to go look at your data points and\n\n22\n00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.770\nsee what's going on.\n\n23\n00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.790\nLook at your data points.\n\n24\n00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.330\nYou should be checking your reports and\nyour logs regularly anyway.\n\n25\n00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.300\nThat shouldn't be, you know, just wait for\ndisaster to happen and go, oh, hey,\n\n26\n00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.396\nlook what happened, you know.\n\n27\n00:01:27.396 --> 00:01:32.480\nNo, you do check-ups on things to see\nwhat type of things are occurring,\n\n28\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.420\nis there anything that might be of\na concern that you can be proactive and\n\n29\n00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.620\nstop, before it becomes a problem.\n\n30\n00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.680\nThe analogy I always use is it's easier\nto, you know, stop a boulder from starting\n\n31\n00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.240\nto roll downhill than it is to stay in the\nmiddle and put your hand up and like that.\n\n32\n00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.460\nIt will run you over, you know, so.\n\n33\n00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.180\n>> An ounce of prevention is worth\na pound of cure or something.\n\n34\n00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.172\n>> If you want to put it that way.\n\n35\n00:01:58.172 --> 00:01:59.070\n[LAUGH]\n>> You know,\n\n36\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.476\nbut that's exactly what it is.\n\n37\n00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:01.030\nIt is.\n\n38\n00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.370\nIt's much easier to, well,\nnot easier, maybe, but it's much\n\n39\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.860\nbetter in the long-run if you can prevent\nit from ever happening in the first place.\n\n40\n00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.420\n>> Exactly.\n\n41\n00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.825\nYou don't go in the power\nof being proactive.\n\n42\n00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:13.076\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So.\n\n43\n00:02:13.076 --> 00:02:16.738\n[LAUGH] Is it the end of the day already?\n\n44\n00:02:16.738 --> 00:02:19.510\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, kind of.\n\n45\n00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.080\nSo, we really do.\n\n46\n00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.510\nWhat we wanna try to make sure\nthat this isn't something or\n\n47\n00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.880\nthat we're taking the right\nsteps to protect ourselves.\n\n48\n00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.110\nWe don't want to just sit around and\nwait and assume that everything is good.\n\n49\n00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.720\nSo that's what you're talking about.\n\n50\n00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:32.330\n>> Yeah .Exactly.\n\n51\n00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.940\n>> Check the reports.\n\n52\n00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.490\nCheck your stuff and\ntry to find the vulnerabilities.\n\n53\n00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.630\nTry to see where something might\nhave slipped through the cracks or\n\n54\n00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.510\nwhere I can tighten up\nthe screws a little bit so\n\n55\n00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.190\nthat I can prevent it from\noccurring in the first place.\n\n56\n00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.480\nYou know we always talk about\nthat in security, right?\n\n57\n00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.350\nWe try to understand the bad guys so\nthat we take a look at our stuff,\n\n58\n00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.690\nunderstand what they're going to be doing,\nand that way I can better protect myself.\n\n59\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.523\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n60\n00:02:53.523 --> 00:02:57.640\nI mean you always want to try to\nbe proactive wherever possible.\n\n61\n00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.270\nI mean, you can't always be\nproactive about everything.\n\n62\n00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.000\nWe've realized that but\nyou try to be proactive.\n\n63\n00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.150\nYou look at the logs.\n\n64\n00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.170\nYou look at what's happening.\n\n65\n00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.970\nYou look at how you've\ndone things in the past.\n\n66\n00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.240\nYou do your research outside of that.\n\n67\n00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.780\nI mean, it's not just happening to you,\nit's other things that are happening.\n\n68\n00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.570\n>> Other incidents from other\norganizations maybe give us some insight.\n\n69\n00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.700\n>> Yeah, exactly, that's where things like\nI said, the High Tech Crime Association.\n\n70\n00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.760\nI've mentioned them.\n\n71\n00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.810\nI've mentioned courses, I've mentioned\nthings like InfoGuard for FBI.\n\n72\n00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.000\nI mentioned other stuff\nin here along the way.\n\n73\n00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.510\nThe purpose of, well DFI,\nI mentioned the DFI news and\n\n74\n00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.120\ntheir digital forensic investigation.\n\n75\n00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.830\nAll those things can be great sources for\nyou to keep you, kind of your ear\n\n76\n00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.350\nto the ground, and be aware of\ntypes of issues that are happening.\n\n77\n00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.330\nAnd they're not the only ones.\n\n78\n00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.100\nThere's stuff like naked security,\nSophos or\n\n79\n00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.360\nSophos or whatever, however you\npronounce their stuff does that.\n\n80\n00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.360\nThere's Hacking News and a bunch of\nother ones you can take a look at\n\n81\n00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.310\nthat give you an idea of the types of\nincidents that occur and the big issues.\n\n82\n00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.780\nAnd you can see, am I vulnerable?\n\n83\n00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.440\nIt is something I need to think about?\n\n84\n00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.180\nThat's what they're doing now.\n\n85\n00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.870\nHey, great.\n\n86\n00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.430\nIf it doesn't apply to you.\n\n87\n00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.265\nBut just check to make sure\nthings don't apply to you.\n\n88\n00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:20.055\nDon't wait for yourself to be a victim,\nbefore you do something about it.\n\n89\n00:04:20.055 --> 00:04:23.925\nAnd also, remember,\nthere's something at play here.\n\n90\n00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:29.445\nThat we've talked about before,\nis the whole idea of,\n\n91\n00:04:29.445 --> 00:04:33.755\nif you're not doing your research on it\nand you wait until an incident happens,\n\n92\n00:04:33.755 --> 00:04:37.720\nand you happen to be an industry that's\nregulated, or you have customers\n\n93\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.850\nthat are relying on you and an incident\nhappens and it's something that you should\n\n94\n00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.970\nhave known about because you should\nhave been doing your due diligence.\n\n95\n00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.000\nYou're gonna be in a lot of hot water,\npotentially.\n\n96\n00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.900\nIt could very well happen\nthat was because they'll say,\n\n97\n00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.280\nwell everyone else knew about it,\nhow come you didn't know about it?\n\n98\n00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.270\nLawsuits are gonna start pouring in.\n\n99\n00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.710\nAnd then they could very\nwell be successful,\n\n100\n00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.070\nif you where it's shown not to\nbe doing your due diligence.\n\n101\n00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.290\nHeck, you could be argued that\nyou were actually guilty of\n\n102\n00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.130\nnegligence to varying degrees\nif you didn't do your research.\n\n103\n00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.570\nThey could get you and\nnail you to the wall for that.\n\n104\n00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.130\nAnd that's not going to be a pretty sight,\nyou know, if that occurs.\n\n105\n00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.010\n>> And I'm sure part of our\ndue diligence is testing.\n\n106\n00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.920\n>> Yeah, testing.\n\n107\n00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.990\nTesting your plans to make sure they work.\n\n108\n00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.480\nI would never want to see\na situation where you're blowing\n\n109\n00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.450\nthe proverbial dust off of\na plan when something happens.\n\n110\n00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.910\nI mean,\nthat's just not the way to do things.\n\n111\n00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.970\nThere are so many things wrong with that.\n\n112\n00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.440\nYou don't know it works.\n\n113\n00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.270\nSomeone had to go dig it out.\n\n114\n00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.880\nThere's no familiarity with it.\n\n115\n00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.880\nAll those things mean that\nyou don't know if that\n\n116\n00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.850\nplan's necessarily going to work anymore.\n\n117\n00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.870\nPeople have to learn right there as things\noccur and the response time gets slower.\n\n118\n00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.170\nSo by the time you actually\nget your act together and\n\n119\n00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:02.370\nmake things happen,\nincident's gotten way out of control.\n\n120\n00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.830\nIt's gotten magnitudes worse than it\nwould have been in the first place.\n\n121\n00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.170\nSo you really got to\ntest these things out.\n\n122\n00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.970\nThe question is how often\ndo you test them out and\n\n123\n00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.440\nthat's something that every situation's\ngoing to be a little different.\n\n124\n00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.470\nThere's regulations call for ones and\nthen there's common sense stuff.\n\n125\n00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.430\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> I try to avoid doing, you know,\n\n126\n00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.120\nmeeting the standard as they say,\nyou know you hear that term a lot.\n\n127\n00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.256\nDo you wanna meet the standard?\n\n128\n00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:31.082\nDo you want to shoot for the middle?\n\n129\n00:06:31.082 --> 00:06:32.235\n[LAUGH] You know.\n\n130\n00:06:32.235 --> 00:06:35.905\nDon't do that because that\nreally gives you no buffer.\n\n131\n00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:39.635\nIt shows that you're doing it just\nbecause you're being told you have to,\n\n132\n00:06:39.635 --> 00:06:43.580\nnot because you have any\nreal desire to do things.\n\n133\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.600\nSo those things could work against you.\n\n134\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.100\nSo I always like to build in a little\nbit of a buffer in there and\n\n135\n00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.440\njust be cautious and be prepared.\n\n136\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.320\nAnd test those things out and\ncatch problems with your\n\n137\n00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.960\nincident response before you\nhave to go live with it.\n\n138\n00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.740\nI don't want to find out in the field.\n\n139\n00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.580\n>> And I would think the testing process\nprobably becomes more complex but\n\n140\n00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.210\nis probably even more important\nwhen we start adding,\n\n141\n00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.030\nlike we were talking about earlier.\n\n142\n00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.000\nWe've got our incidence response team, but\nnow we've got our stuff in the cloud and,\n\n143\n00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.250\nif it's a public college,\nwe've got their incidence response team.\n\n144\n00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.780\nHow well do our teams work together?\n\n145\n00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.250\nHow do we handle incidents like that?\n\n146\n00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.850\nAnother reason to really test.\n\n147\n00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:25.730\n>> Yeah.\n\n148\n00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.910\nThat's another really big part of it.\n\n149\n00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.740\nI mean, heck,\nthat's why you look at stuff I was\n\n150\n00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.790\nreferencing with civilian agencies,\nlaw enforcement, and all those things.\n\n151\n00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.630\nThat's why they go out and\ndo that training like that.\n\n152\n00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:46.140\nTo learn where these gaps may be and\ndo those after action reports and\n\n153\n00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.300\nfigure out,\nthese are problems that we had.\n\n154\n00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:55.270\nHow can we do things better and\nbe more cohesive and responsive team.\n\n155\n00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.780\nThat's what you're really looking for\n\n156\n00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.500\nto make sure everything works\nlike a well-oiled machine and\n\n157\n00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.655\ngets you the responses and\nstuff that you really need to do your job.\n\n158\n00:08:04.655 --> 00:08:06.230\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n159\n00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.765\nThen you talk about offline analysis.\n\n160\n00:08:08.765 --> 00:08:12.500\nWere we talking about, we're not talking\nabout taking everything offline but\n\n161\n00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.730\ngoing back and looking at things after or.\n\n162\n00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.040\n>> Yeah that's kind of\nwhere I would fit this in.\n\n163\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.010\nIs kind of I look at offline\nanalysis as being kind of modeling\n\n164\n00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:27.300\nincidents as well as looking at\nthe incidents that you've had and\n\n165\n00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.450\nfiguring out what other\ntypes of things could occur.\n\n166\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:34.350\nBecause this happened there's a potential\nthat other things could happen and\n\n167\n00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.700\nlet's figure out what those\nsituations may look like and\n\n168\n00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.410\nwhat we can do to keep those\nfrom becoming an issue.\n\n169\n00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:47.800\nSome people might say offline analysis\nis pulling stuff out of the Cloud and\n\n170\n00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.660\nlooking at it.\n\n171\n00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:50.830\nI just don't think that's\na realistic way to look at.\n\n172\n00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.230\nBecause some of the stuff\npulling out of the Cloud,\n\n173\n00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.950\nyou're just not going to be\nable to do it effectively.\n\n174\n00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:58.710\nIt would be more along the lines if\nyou're doing an offline analysis.\n\n175\n00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.700\nI think of it as a post mortem of\n\n176\n00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.460\nhow you respond to existing incidents as\nwell as modeling potential incidents and\n\n177\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.176\nputting those things together\nto see what you can do better.\n\n178\n00:09:10.176 --> 00:09:12.338\n>> Some what if analysis type?\n\n179\n00:09:12.338 --> 00:09:14.780\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n180\n00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:22.320\nThat's also where, you know,\nto kind of fit another area into this.\n\n181\n00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.260\nThat's when the ethical\nhacking even comes in because\n\n182\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.350\nthat's what we do as ethical hackers or\npen testers.\n\n183\n00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.330\nIs that we poke and prod and\ntry to model incidents and\n\n184\n00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:37.550\ntry to find where the holes are and\nshow you where the potential problems are.\n\n185\n00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:46.320\nOr where problems are, before that problem\nthat exists does become a real issue.\n\n186\n00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.060\nSo there's a lot of ways you can cope\nwith that and figure out these problems,\n\n187\n00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:56.309\nascertain them, see the scope of them, and\nclose them, as the case may be, or develop\n\n188\n00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:02.020\na solution, or response to it,\nbefore they become live.\n\n189\n00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:07.320\nYou see that all over the place,\nyou see some of these IT groups,\n\n190\n00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.730\nI've seen, IT teams that are distributed,\n\n191\n00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:17.590\nhave things like I ran with some of\nthe Sacramento area that their IT team was\n\n192\n00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.830\ndistributed over a pretty large area.\n\n193\n00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.440\nAnd he was on incident\nresponse part of it.\n\n194\n00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.490\nAnd just in case there was a problem and\none of the things they accounted for\n\n195\n00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:32.770\nwas like a flood, if one of the dams broke\nor levies broke in the Sacramento area.\n\n196\n00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:38.880\nIf there was a flood, and took out\nanything as part of that, these guys had\n\n197\n00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.240\nsatellite phones, as part of things that\nthey were issued, for incident response.\n\n198\n00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.560\nNot everyone had them, just team leads.\n\n199\n00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.100\nSo the people that were in different\nareas, that were deemed the people that\n\n200\n00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.390\nneeded to be constantly in contact,\nthey would have these things issued them.\n\n201\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:59.740\nIf they started seeing that\nthings were getting bad or\n\n202\n00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.780\nthat they just felt that there was more of\na risk and they needed to have them, but\n\n203\n00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.580\nthey had them prepared and ready.\n\n204\n00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:08.840\nSo that was something where they modeled\nan existing incident, and they had\n\n205\n00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:14.260\nthings like satellite phones, and other\nstuff, you know, available just in case.\n\n206\n00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.130\n>> Yeah and we,\nwe've kinda talked about it, but\n\n207\n00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.730\nwe've never really used that term,\nbut pen testing, right?\n\n208\n00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:24.330\nWe've talked about on other shows\nabout doing penetration tests.\n\n209\n00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.300\nTest our systems to see\nhow our security is.\n\n210\n00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.420\nWe have to carry that out\nto the Cloud too, don't we?\n\n211\n00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:30.510\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n212\n00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:34.690\nIt changes things a bit when you have\nto do pen testing out in the Cloud.\n\n213\n00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:41.400\nBut it's nonetheless important to help\nyou figure out where your issues are.\n\n214\n00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.056\nI mean all these things\nstart playing a role.\n\n215\n00:11:43.056 --> 00:11:47.340\n>> So we got to have people that are\ntrained in that and plus as we've talked\n\n216\n00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.360\naways with pen testing especially if it's\na public cloud scenario we've gotta talk\n\n217\n00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.210\nto the Cloud servers, providers and\nmake sure it's okay with them.\n\n218\n00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.570\n>> Yeah.\n>> For whatever we're doing.\n\n219\n00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.487\n>> Yeah, you got a have your parents sign\nyour permission slip basically [LAUGH] is\n\n220\n00:11:59.487 --> 00:12:00.772\nwhat we're talking about there.\n\n221\n00:12:00.772 --> 00:12:02.980\nYou ain't doing nothing without those.\n\n222\n00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.720\nSo [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah.\n\n223\n00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.890\n>> Be prepared if you wanna do that.\n\n224\n00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.230\nDon't just, aren't saying go in and\nstart pen testing.\n\n225\n00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:10.600\nIt ain't your infrastructure.\n\n226\n00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.320\n>> You stressed to us many times\nhow easy would be, cuz you're\n\n227\n00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.330\nhacking with permission, so of course\nyou could bring systems down in that.\n\n228\n00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.080\nAnd if I'm doing that in-house,\nI'm bringing my systems down,\n\n229\n00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.590\nmy company down, horrible.\n\n230\n00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:29.080\nWe move out into a public cloud scenario\nand I start bringing things down, and\n\n231\n00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.160\nbringing down other\ncompanies with me possibly.\n\n232\n00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.770\nSo yeah, I can see where we\nreally gotta ratchet up our CYA,\n\n233\n00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.382\nas you like to call it.\n\n234\n00:12:37.382 --> 00:12:40.326\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly, that's what it is.\n\n235\n00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:41.510\n>> Yeah.\nSo, all right.\n\n236\n00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:43.430\nWell, Sean, a lot of good info there.\n\n237\n00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:44.830\nWe have anything else\nwe want to talk about?\n\n238\n00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.360\nWe've talked a lot about\nincident response.\n\n239\n00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.480\nIs there anything else\nwe wanna talk about?\n\n240\n00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.090\n>> It's just to kind of just,\n\n241\n00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:56.640\nto wrap up that, this portion of instant\nresponse that we're talking about.\n\n242\n00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.230\nIt's just, these are all little threads\nthat went off in different directions.\n\n243\n00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.600\nIt looked like, but\nthey're all the same thing.\n\n244\n00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.710\nWith these last two or three episodes,\n\n245\n00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.745\nwe're starting to bring all those\nthreads together and tie them together.\n\n246\n00:13:09.745 --> 00:13:14.950\nIncident response is extremely important\nbecause we can do all the planning and\n\n247\n00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:19.740\nall the preparation and all that\ngood stuff, but bad stuff happens.\n\n248\n00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:21.300\nThat's Murphy's Law right?\n\n249\n00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.810\nBad stuff is going to happen.\n\n250\n00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:27.460\nSo we bring in all these\nthreads together it's and to\n\n251\n00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:33.310\ngive us a really good idea and picture\nof what instant response looks like.\n\n252\n00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:37.820\nNow it's your turn to go through and\nreally flush that out and\n\n253\n00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.860\ntake your traditional, take your Cloud,\ntake all those things and\n\n254\n00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.340\njust start weaving them together to\nmake your really good incidence response\n\n255\n00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.370\nsystem that's adaptable, practical, and\neffective for this new environment.\n\n256\n00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:51.380\n>> Very good.\n\n257\n00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.730\nAll right, well ladies and gentlemen a lot\nof great information from Sean there.\n\n258\n00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.180\nHope you enjoyed watching this one.\n\n259\n00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.470\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n260\n00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:59.190\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n261\n00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.537\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n262\n00:14:00.537 --> 00:14:06.669\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:18.100\nI'm your host Mike Roderick,\nwith me today is the famous Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.300\nSean in this episode we're going to be\ntaking a look at application security and\n\n5\n00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.928\nIDEA, not that I have an idea,\nbut IDEAs and identity.\n\n6\n00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:29.907\n[LAUGH] What is it,\nidentity entitlement and\n\n7\n00:00:29.907 --> 00:00:33.124\naccess management, if I remember\ncorrectly, these crazy acronyms.\n\n8\n00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:36.005\n>> Yeah, that's what it says right here.\n\n9\n00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:36.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n10\n00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.530\n>> A little cheat sheet there.\n\n11\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.520\nSo yeah, we're gonna talk\nabout application security and\n\n12\n00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.380\nwe've gotta worry about, we always have\nto worry about application security.\n\n13\n00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.390\nSo it's no different if we try\nto go out to the cloud, right?\n\n14\n00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.530\n>> Yeah, it's some of the same\nstuff that we had in the past.\n\n15\n00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.980\nBut we're kind of just evolving and\napplying it to what we have in the cloud.\n\n16\n00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.580\nAs always, that's been a recurring theme\nthrough all the episodes that we've done.\n\n17\n00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.852\nSo we go through and talk about this,\nprobably the first thing that we\n\n18\n00:01:06.852 --> 00:01:11.320\nreally need to kind of clarify is\nwhat the whole purpose of IDEA is.\n\n19\n00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.310\nAnd it's a fancy acronym,\nprobably one they invented in part for\n\n20\n00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.250\nthe cloud, or dug up and\nreapplied to the cloud.\n\n21\n00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.676\nCuz for an idea,\nthe acronym used in other places, but\n\n22\n00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:27.790\nit seems like it's gaining more\nsteam in the cloud, so to speak.\n\n23\n00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.252\nSo what we have is, when we talk\nabout IDEA, like Mike was saying,\n\n24\n00:01:32.252 --> 00:01:36.330\nit stands for identity entitlement and\naccess management.\n\n25\n00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.875\nAnd yeah, I have to look at the note too.\n\n26\n00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:40.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No matter how many times to do that to\n\n27\n00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.985\nmake sure I'm getting it right,\nis when you talk about that that's\n\n28\n00:01:45.985 --> 00:01:48.725\njust really a way when you\nthink about the terms there.\n\n29\n00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:52.345\nIdentity entitlement and\naccess management.\n\n30\n00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:57.685\nIt pretty much spells it out if you just\nsit there and think about it for a moment.\n\n31\n00:01:57.685 --> 00:01:58.865\nWhat's going on with it.\n\n32\n00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:04.055\nBut to flush it out, what we're talking\nabout when we deploy software or\n\n33\n00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:07.000\nany sort of application or\nenvironment in the cloud.\n\n34\n00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.970\nIt's pretty much not gonna be a situation\nwhere just anyone gets access to it in\n\n35\n00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.540\nkind of like a Wild West type scenario.\n\n36\n00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.140\nIt's gonna be a situation where you\nhave to figure out how your identity\n\n37\n00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.340\nmanagement is gonna be done, so you'll\nhave to have some mechanism for that.\n\n38\n00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.050\nThat could be, when you think about it,\ncould be somewhat challenging.\n\n39\n00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.220\nIf we go back to prior episodes,\n\n40\n00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.040\none of the things has been brought in\nmultiple times, is what do you do if\n\n41\n00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.170\nyou're integrating multiple services\nacross platforms and even across vendors.\n\n42\n00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.683\nOne of the tools we talked about it was\nsomething known as Federated Services.\n\n43\n00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:51.420\nFederated Services would definitely\nfit what we're talking about here.\n\n44\n00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.450\nIt is a mechanism for\nvalidating identities,\n\n45\n00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.570\nidentity and\nthen authorization part of things.\n\n46\n00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.349\nSo that's a big part of this.\n\n47\n00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.670\nSo you have that, and the next thing\nwould be, the entitlement part.\n\n48\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.860\nThe entitlement part, just a real\nfancy way, you say entitlement,\n\n49\n00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.290\nI always have to double check if I\nhaven't used this term for awhile.\n\n50\n00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.830\nI'm like entitlement,\nI think of political stuff,\n\n51\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.280\nand things like that,\nwhich we're not going to get into.\n\n52\n00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.320\nI think of entitlement stuff like that,\nI'm like okay, hold on.\n\n53\n00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.940\nWhat they're talking about is permissions,\nprivileges.\n\n54\n00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.210\nThat's what we call them\non a day to day basis.\n\n55\n00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.750\nTechnically those are entitlements.\n\n56\n00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.080\nWhat are you entitled to use and\nhow are you entitled to interact with it.\n\n57\n00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:43.795\nThe term does fit, and\ndoes explain what's happening,\n\n58\n00:03:43.795 --> 00:03:45.325\nwhen you're talking about those.\n\n59\n00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:46.985\nBut they decide to use entitlements,\n\n60\n00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:51.400\ninstead of saying privileges and\npermissions.\n\n61\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.500\nProbably because it doesn't\nmake a nice acronym I guess.\n\n62\n00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.740\nIt's like, hey we're using the word\nIDEA and figure out something.\n\n63\n00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.410\nSo that could be what's happening\nthere and then the last part of that,\n\n64\n00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.950\nyou know access management.\n\n65\n00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.050\nWell, you can kind of think of\nwhat's happening there is that\n\n66\n00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.460\nonce you have the identification and\nauthorization going on.\n\n67\n00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.150\nThen you're figuring out as part\nof the authorization process,\n\n68\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.390\npermissions and\nall that's going to happen.\n\n69\n00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.760\nHow do you assign and remove and just\noverall do the whole management process\n\n70\n00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.820\nof how people are going to access various\nobjects, parts of an application and\n\n71\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.080\nservices and\nall that good stuff that goes with it.\n\n72\n00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.660\nYou can definitely see when you\ntalk about the process of IDEA\n\n73\n00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.410\nyou can see that it's not\nsomething that is new at all.\n\n74\n00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.420\nIt's something that is.\n\n75\n00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.700\nThe concept is something\nthat you're already doing\n\n76\n00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.560\nin whatever environment you have.\n\n77\n00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.360\nYou, if you're not involved in the cloud,\n\n78\n00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.990\nyou just have an active directory\ndeployment, you're using IDEA.\n\n79\n00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.290\nYou may not call it IDEA, but you're\nusing IDEA in some way, shape or form.\n\n80\n00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.710\nActive directory, for example,\nhas a way for you to provide an identity.\n\n81\n00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.090\nIt has a way to do authentication and\nauthorization.\n\n82\n00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.810\nAnd then it definitely does\nthe access management part.\n\n83\n00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.330\nAnd remember, access management can\ninclude not just managing permission and\n\n84\n00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.730\nprivileges and all that.\n\n85\n00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.070\nIt also can include the other side,\nwhich is the accountability part.\n\n86\n00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.320\nThey haven't really accounted for\nthat here, no pun intended.\n\n87\n00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.570\nThey haven't really accounted for\nthat here, but yeah,\n\n88\n00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.870\nit could be definitely a part\nof that whole scenario.\n\n89\n00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.890\nWhat this means for\nus is when we move into the cloud,\n\n90\n00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.950\nwe're gonna need to have\nthe same type of thing.\n\n91\n00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.400\nHow that's implemented is definitely\ngonna change to some degree.\n\n92\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.708\nWe don't know what degree\nit's gonna change,\n\n93\n00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:45.546\nbut we do know it's gonna change\nwhen we go into the cloud.\n\n94\n00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:50.672\nYou can have a situation where\nyou're using something that\n\n95\n00:05:50.672 --> 00:05:55.400\nwe spoke about actually\nwithin the last few episodes.\n\n96\n00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.450\nWe talked about Federated Services and how\nit integrates with the active directory.\n\n97\n00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.440\nIf you're having Microsoft host\nyour active directory services,\n\n98\n00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.272\nthat part of your infrastructure, we said\nthat you still do have a responsibility\n\n99\n00:06:10.272 --> 00:06:13.157\nto have a stub, or\nsmall portion, of it onsite.\n\n100\n00:06:13.157 --> 00:06:18.038\nAnd we would use Federated Services as\na glue that brings those two together,\n\n101\n00:06:18.038 --> 00:06:22.409\nand so you have a situation there\nwhere those two things are talking.\n\n102\n00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:27.690\nThere's a whole management system going\non and you're making these things work.\n\n103\n00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:30.185\nSo you add a different level\nof complexity to the things.\n\n104\n00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:31.967\nYou're still using active directory, but\n\n105\n00:06:31.967 --> 00:06:34.096\nit's not just one active\ndirectory structure now.\n\n106\n00:06:34.096 --> 00:06:37.840\nYou've got two and you have this\nglue between them making them work.\n\n107\n00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.505\nSo IDEA in action and\n\n108\n00:06:40.505 --> 00:06:44.660\nthen IDEA bringing in other components as\nthey move into that cloud environment.\n\n109\n00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.884\nIt's not really the only way we can do it,\neither.\n\n110\n00:06:46.884 --> 00:06:49.590\nThere are other things we can use.\n\n111\n00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.190\nIf we have services that are all\nCerberus enabled, for example,\n\n112\n00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.780\nit's possible that if we're\nhaving a Microsoft environment or\n\n113\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.590\nwe have just a bunch of environments\nthat are all compatible with that.\n\n114\n00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.250\nWe have another option open to us to\nprovide some compatibility between them\n\n115\n00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.070\nand do this whole IDEA processed.\n\n116\n00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.700\nThe thing here being that we need to have\nsomething that's doing IDEA to control\n\n117\n00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.470\naccess and what levels of access\npeople are going to have to cloud.\n\n118\n00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.828\nIt's not just going to be,\nhey just grab what you need and that's it.\n\n119\n00:07:21.828 --> 00:07:24.600\nThere's has to be a way\nto kind of regulate that.\n\n120\n00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.490\n>> Yeah I mean, just like we would\ninternally when we build an application or\n\n121\n00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.270\na web app or\nwhatever it is we're trying to provide.\n\n122\n00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.970\nWe've gotta have some way\nto control that access.\n\n123\n00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.850\nJust because we put it out in\nthe cloud doesn't mean all of a sudden\n\n124\n00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:37.890\nanybody can go access it, right.\n\n125\n00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.190\n>> Yeah, it's absolutely not.\n\n126\n00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:45.010\nThere's gonna be some sort of control\nbeing placed on the whole thing.\n\n127\n00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.870\nI need to get some turtle wax for Monday.\n\n128\n00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:47.394\nLook at that.\n\n129\n00:07:47.394 --> 00:07:48.651\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that is nice.\n\n130\n00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:50.475\nAll right, so.\n\n131\n00:07:50.475 --> 00:07:51.492\n[LAUGH] Looking shiny.\n\n132\n00:07:51.492 --> 00:07:55.598\n>> And, it also is gonna affect our\nsoftware development life cycle when we\n\n133\n00:07:55.598 --> 00:07:57.617\nstart moving apps out on the cloud or\n\n134\n00:07:57.617 --> 00:08:01.413\ndesigning applications that we\nplan on only hosting in the cloud.\n\n135\n00:08:01.413 --> 00:08:02.992\nThat changes that as well?\n\n136\n00:08:02.992 --> 00:08:06.670\n>> Yeah, there's going to\npotentially be a dramatic change.\n\n137\n00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.120\nIt depends on the type of hosting\nenvironment you're looking at.\n\n138\n00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.820\nOne of the things that\nkind of fits into this,\n\n139\n00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:17.140\nfirst of all, is talking about\nsomething called SPI model.\n\n140\n00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.730\nAnd SPI model stands for\nSoftware Platform Infrastructure,\n\n141\n00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:24.700\nall as a service,\nit's which one you're going with.\n\n142\n00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:29.770\nNow, the reason why we kinda\nskip to that just briefly is\n\n143\n00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:34.860\nbecause when you look at each one of\nthose things, if we go all the way back,\n\n144\n00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.670\nand I know we sound probably like\na broken record at this point,\n\n145\n00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:44.189\ngo all the way back to the beginning,\nwe talked about the reference models.\n\n146\n00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.920\nThe reference model that\nCSA provides you tells you\n\n147\n00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.790\nwho's gonna get what level or\nwho's going to be doing what and,\n\n148\n00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.968\nhence, what responsibility is going\nto fall on one side versus the other.\n\n149\n00:08:57.968 --> 00:09:02.870\nSo every one of those models dictates\njust how much they're gonna get\n\n150\n00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.770\nresponsibility for versus we're gonna get\nresponsibility for, so we have to consider\n\n151\n00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:13.110\nthat when we're developing our solution\nand going through the whole SDLC process.\n\n152\n00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:18.070\nNow when we start looking at\nthe SDLC process, first of all,\n\n153\n00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.990\nSDLC process, we'll do a little\nreview on it here in a moment.\n\n154\n00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:27.060\nBut the SDLC process helps\nguide our development process,\n\n155\n00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:30.490\nwhether we're developing\na solution from scratch, or\n\n156\n00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:35.200\nwe are molding an existing\nsolution to the cloud environment.\n\n157\n00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.730\nDo you remember that when you do\nthe software development life cycle?\n\n158\n00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.200\nNothing in that term\n\n159\n00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.660\nof software development life cycle\nsays that it has to be brand new.\n\n160\n00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.370\nIt could be that you are evolving and\n\n161\n00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:53.190\nthere actually is a step in\nthere that includes evolving,\n\n162\n00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.960\nor what we call maintenance in\nsome circles, of an application.\n\n163\n00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.790\nSo you could take the SDLC and\napply it to an existing application,\n\n164\n00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.210\nhave that structure in place\nto make sure it's evolving and\n\n165\n00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:09.120\nchanging to meet new requirements and\nnew features, and so on and so forth.\n\n166\n00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.310\nSo it could have a big impact.\n\n167\n00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:17.420\nThe great thing about this is SDLC\nis something that probably most\n\n168\n00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:24.320\nof our viewers have seen because it's\nbeen talked about in other course you and\n\n169\n00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.450\nI have done, Mike and we're not the only\nones that have talked about it I'm sure.\n\n170\n00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.759\nI haven't seen everything\nin the IT Prolight.\n\n171\n00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:35.145\nOh, of course, yes, I have,\nit's quality stuff.\n\n172\n00:10:35.145 --> 00:10:37.406\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, we'll edit that out so\n\n173\n00:10:37.406 --> 00:10:41.209\nthe rest of you, if you tell anybody,\nwe'll have you killed.\n\n174\n00:10:41.209 --> 00:10:46.775\n[LAUGH] But you know I haven't\nseen everything in there, but\n\n175\n00:10:46.775 --> 00:10:53.676\nI've seen quite a bit, and it's\nmentioned in a few other places as well,\n\n176\n00:10:53.676 --> 00:10:58.574\nso the thing about it is\nthat it's not something that\n\n177\n00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:02.613\nis brand spanking new\nto you in most cases.\n\n178\n00:11:02.613 --> 00:11:05.811\nWe're just taking an existing tool and\napplying it to an environment,\n\n179\n00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:09.330\nwhich is something that should make you\nbreathe kind of a sigh of relief because\n\n180\n00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.085\nit's one less thing for you to learn.\n\n181\n00:11:11.085 --> 00:11:12.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One less thing for your study for\n\n182\n00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.210\nyour credential as well.\n\n183\n00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:19.910\nSo, with that being said, let's kind of\ntake a look to do a review for everybody,\n\n184\n00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:25.290\ntake a look at what SDLC is cuz I've\ngone through and brought us, and\n\n185\n00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:29.730\ngot us a nice colorful chart,\nboth to make it look pretty and\n\n186\n00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.732\nto distract you from the fact\nthat I'm incompetent.\n\n187\n00:11:31.732 --> 00:11:35.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] So what I've got here is you\n\n188\n00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:41.780\ncan see this is another cycle going on,\nand when we look at this cycle,\n\n189\n00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:48.800\nthis software system development life\ncycle, it's got these different phases.\n\n190\n00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.800\nTypically what we're going to do is,\nwe're gonna start right up there\n\n191\n00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.540\nin that red arrow right up top\nwhere it says requirement analysis.\n\n192\n00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:59.170\nSo we're going to sit down and\n\n193\n00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:04.280\nstart figuring out what problem\nwe're trying to address.\n\n194\n00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.050\nNow, if you're developing something\nfrom new, fine, from scratch,\n\n195\n00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:11.380\nyou're developing a brand new whatever and\n\n196\n00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.414\nyou are starting to kind of have\nyour brainstorming session,\n\n197\n00:12:15.414 --> 00:12:20.290\nfiguring out what problem you're trying\nto address and then you're gonna start\n\n198\n00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.430\nfiguring out what the requirements\nare gonna be to address that problem.\n\n199\n00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.890\nSo, that's gonna take\nsome time to do that.\n\n200\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:34.500\nIt's just kind of a high-level look at\nwhat shape things possibly could take.\n\n201\n00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.580\nSo, we get that done, like I say,\nwe do our brainstorming, we do our\n\n202\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.690\nthorough analysis, we really take a good\nlook at the problem, all that good stuff.\n\n203\n00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:48.050\nAnd we start putting things down,\ndefining what it is we want to take place,\n\n204\n00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.930\nwhat goals are trying to meet\nonce this whole process is done.\n\n205\n00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:53.620\nSo that's gonna happen there.\n\n206\n00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.990\nWhat it doesn't do typically at the\nrequirement analysis phase is it doesn't\n\n207\n00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:01.530\nsay, well, this is what we're\ntrying to accomplish and\n\n208\n00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.000\nthis is how we're gonna accomplish that.\n\n209\n00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.260\nAt least it won't say in\nnauseating detail, as I say,\n\n210\n00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:12.040\nit's not gonna say how a specific\nfeature or something is gonna work.\n\n211\n00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:16.430\nThat's for our next phase,\nthat's not for requirement analysis,\n\n212\n00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:20.810\nrequirement analysis is just for\nwhat the name implies.\n\n213\n00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:23.780\nWe are looking to see what\nwe're trying to address,\n\n214\n00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.610\nwhat requirements are to meet,\ndefining them and\n\n215\n00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:31.140\nthen once we're done defining them we\npush them along over to the design phase.\n\n216\n00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:35.680\nThe design phase says we're\ntaking those high-level\n\n217\n00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.280\nthings and starting to translate\nthem into marching orders.\n\n218\n00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:46.240\nWe're starting to really kinda see this\nis how we want them really to look and\n\n219\n00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:51.200\ngetting a good idea of how those\nrequirements translate more\n\n220\n00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:54.700\nrealistically into\nthe working environment.\n\n221\n00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.550\nYeah, so you'll start taking\neither the whole requirement and\n\n222\n00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:03.450\ntranslating them over to\nthese workable things, or it\n\n223\n00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:08.520\ncould be that you parcel that up and break\nit up and hand it to different teams.\n\n224\n00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.290\nI mean, you could be talking\npretty big solution here.\n\n225\n00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.310\nRemember, it's not like you're\ntalking a single piece of software.\n\n226\n00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.948\nI mean, heck, even a single\npiece of software sounds like,\n\n227\n00:14:16.948 --> 00:14:18.655\noh, it's a single piece of software,\n\n228\n00:14:18.655 --> 00:14:22.190\nright, it kind of gives you to imply\nit's just some small little, no, no.\n\n229\n00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.856\nIt could be something,\na single piece of software.\n\n230\n00:14:24.856 --> 00:14:29.165\nWindows qualifies as a single piece of\nsoftware, and by no means would you have\n\n231\n00:14:29.165 --> 00:14:33.620\njust handing those requirements to one\nsmall group and saying, take care of it.\n\n232\n00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.038\nIt's actually going to be broken up.\n\n233\n00:14:35.038 --> 00:14:38.845\n>> Yeah, I look at our team here and\nwe've got, even a small shop like us,\n\n234\n00:14:38.845 --> 00:14:42.490\nwe've got one group of people who\nworks on the interface, itself.\n\n235\n00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:46.240\nWe've got another group of people that\ndoes the code behind the application.\n\n236\n00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.970\nSo you break it up into these chunks.\n\n237\n00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.676\nEverybody's got their area of\nexpertise that they work in.\n\n238\n00:14:50.676 --> 00:14:53.694\n>> Yeah, absolutely, and\nthat's a great example.\n\n239\n00:14:53.694 --> 00:14:58.100\nIt's not just something that is unique\nto the software development environment.\n\n240\n00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.030\nAny sufficiently big project,\nyou're gonna have to say,\n\n241\n00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.910\nwell one person can't handle it,\na few people can't handle it.\n\n242\n00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.230\nYou're gonna have to say okay,\nwe're gonna divide this up.\n\n243\n00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.560\nYou do this, you do this, you do this.\n\n244\n00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.350\nIn terms of the cloud,\nthat could very easily be the situation.\n\n245\n00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:16.770\nIt could be a case of that you have\npeople doing a requirements analysis and\n\n246\n00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:21.160\nthen saying, we're taking our existing\nsolution, moving it to the cloud,\n\n247\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.900\nand you guys are gonna be responsible for\nthis part of it,\n\n248\n00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.712\nyou guys are gonna be responsible for\nthis part of it, and so on and so forth.\n\n249\n00:15:29.712 --> 00:15:30.376\nI mean, think about it.\n\n250\n00:15:30.376 --> 00:15:34.754\nWhat if you have a solution internally\nthat is using locally hosted\n\n251\n00:15:34.754 --> 00:15:39.524\nstuff like federated services and\nspecial data base applications, and\n\n252\n00:15:39.524 --> 00:15:44.856\nit's integrated with email, and file\nstorage, and keep going on and on and on.\n\n253\n00:15:44.856 --> 00:15:48.948\nThat may very well, as we know, not be one\ncloud service provider, in which case,\n\n254\n00:15:48.948 --> 00:15:52.923\nyou're gonna have to say, okay well,\nthere's this cloud service provider and\n\n255\n00:15:52.923 --> 00:15:54.569\nthis team's working with them.\n\n256\n00:15:54.569 --> 00:15:57.064\nAnd then there's a team\nworking with these guys, and\n\n257\n00:15:57.064 --> 00:15:58.846\nyou're just getting that all going.\n\n258\n00:15:58.846 --> 00:16:01.715\nAnd then there's a team\nthat works across that and\n\n259\n00:16:01.715 --> 00:16:04.325\nis talking about integrating these things.\n\n260\n00:16:04.325 --> 00:16:08.936\nAnd then there's going to be a high\nlevel group that manages the whole thing\n\n261\n00:16:08.936 --> 00:16:09.970\ncollectively.\n\n262\n00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.080\nSo, you're talking many levels and\nmany moving parts.\n\n263\n00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.770\nAnd talking somebody has to keep\nthem all going the same direction.\n\n264\n00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:20.880\nTricky proposition, but definitely doable,\nbeen doing that type of stuff for years.\n\n265\n00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.339\nI mean, that's really where your\nproject management skills and\n\n266\n00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.990\na lot of late nights, a lot of drinking,\nyou know, all come into play.\n\n267\n00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.880\nYou know, so [LAUGH] that's but\nthat's where the design comes in.\n\n268\n00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.990\nThe design's actually starting\nto break down those requirements\n\n269\n00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.300\ninto something that's really practical.\n\n270\n00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.990\nYour marching orders.\n\n271\n00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.360\nAnd then once you're done with the design,\nit goes over to implementation.\n\n272\n00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.740\nImplementation is just\nlike the name implies.\n\n273\n00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.970\nYou're now really taking those design and\nvisualization stuff.\n\n274\n00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:58.580\nAnd you're moving them into actually\ncreating the code, molding the solution,\n\n275\n00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:03.080\ntaking an existing solution and\nmolding it to the cloud environment,\n\n276\n00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:07.260\ncuz like I said, nothing says that\nthis is a brand new solution.\n\n277\n00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.780\nIt could be an existing solution\nthat you're trying to find, hey,\n\n278\n00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.880\nit needs to go from here over to there,\nand so\n\n279\n00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.400\nwe know we just can't take this,\npick it up, and shove it over there.\n\n280\n00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.020\nIt's something that we're gonna\nhave to do some adjustments.\n\n281\n00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.298\nSo, you make the appropriate adjustments.\n\n282\n00:17:24.298 --> 00:17:27.833\nSo it could be implementing new\nfeatures to account for that, or\n\n283\n00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:29.410\nexpanding on new features.\n\n284\n00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.611\nOnce we've got that implementation done,\n\n285\n00:17:32.611 --> 00:17:37.290\nthen testing to make sure that\nthings are working the right way.\n\n286\n00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:42.568\nOr the way that we expect them to operate.\n\n287\n00:17:42.568 --> 00:17:48.740\nDo you remember when you do testing\non things, do remember that\n\n288\n00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:54.020\nyou can get to situations where you\ndon't get everything that you want,\n\n289\n00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:59.780\nthat's a very common thing is that you\ndon't get everything that you want.\n\n290\n00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.020\nIt could be that you've had to compromise\nbecause of the different solutions and\n\n291\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.410\nplay, you can't just get\neverything you want,\n\n292\n00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.690\nyou have to kind of do a little give and\ntake and compromise.\n\n293\n00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:14.120\nIt may be that once you move in the cloud\nenvironment, it's no longer possible to do\n\n294\n00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.590\nthings the same way, you have to\nshift to do things a different way.\n\n295\n00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.180\nYou do need to be prepared for\nthat as well.\n\n296\n00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:26.310\nI mean, that's happened to\na number of different people when\n\n297\n00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:30.200\nthey made migrations to any new platforms,\nis that they've had to adjust for\n\n298\n00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:35.650\nthings that just don't work the same way,\nor they're unavailable.\n\n299\n00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:40.190\nI mean heck, you could get a case where\nit's not unheard of for someone to go to\n\n300\n00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:45.170\na cloud environment because they had\na legacy system, and they had a choice.\n\n301\n00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:47.360\nThey reached that fork\nin the road as they say.\n\n302\n00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.739\nThey reached that fork in the road where\nthey can either keep things locally and\n\n303\n00:18:52.739 --> 00:18:55.265\nupgrade it, or they can say, well,\n\n304\n00:18:55.265 --> 00:18:59.194\nthis upgrade's gonna take\na lot of effort to undertake.\n\n305\n00:18:59.194 --> 00:19:03.818\nWe're gonna have to do just a lot\nof things to take what our existing\n\n306\n00:19:03.818 --> 00:19:08.540\nstuff is and move it to a new\nenvironment or upgrade the technology.\n\n307\n00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.570\nSo instead of spending\nall that money here,\n\n308\n00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.230\nit actually may be cheaper just to go\nover here to the cloud environment and\n\n309\n00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.265\nmake the adjustments for\nthat and call it a day.\n\n310\n00:19:16.265 --> 00:19:20.665\nAnd so, if you reach that fork in\nthe road, you're going to have to,\n\n311\n00:19:20.665 --> 00:19:24.195\nyou're going to need to make sure that\nyou implement the features right, and\n\n312\n00:19:24.195 --> 00:19:25.285\nyou're doing the testing, and\n\n313\n00:19:25.285 --> 00:19:30.755\nyou're still doing something close to\nwhat you were before if not exact.\n\n314\n00:19:30.755 --> 00:19:33.675\nYou're probably not going to get exact, to\nbe honest, but you're going to try to get\n\n315\n00:19:33.675 --> 00:19:38.540\nas close to that as possible,\nand hopefully add features and\n\n316\n00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:43.470\ndo as much as you can to future\nproof stuff along the way.\n\n317\n00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:45.650\nNow once you've done testing,\nyou're satisfied with it, and\n\n318\n00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:49.720\nremember testing could be one of the\nbigger phases where you're going through\n\n319\n00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.920\nand testing and tweaking and testing and\ntweaking and all that stuff over again.\n\n320\n00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.180\nYou could have testing say,\nwhere something's just crap and you've\n\n321\n00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.530\ngotta go all the way back to the design\nphase and say, well, let's try this again.\n\n322\n00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.980\n>> Yeah, you could almost draw a little\nintermediary loop between design,\n\n323\n00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.300\nimplementation and testing, right?\n\n324\n00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.562\n>> Yeah, we could sketch some stuff\nin here really quickly, right?\n\n325\n00:20:09.562 --> 00:20:12.720\n>> [LAUGH] Because it might take a few\ntimes to get it to where you're,\n\n326\n00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.810\nbecause you can't just move out\nthere to put it out until you're\n\n327\n00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.940\nfinished testing and\neverything works the way you want it.\n\n328\n00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.960\n>> Yeah, it looks nice and pretty when you\nlook at it this way, but yeah, Mike's 100%\n\n329\n00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.740\nright on that, is that this could be\nthat this isn't gonna work this way.\n\n330\n00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.278\nAnd you could add that\nat any point in there.\n\n331\n00:20:28.278 --> 00:20:31.330\nYou could have do your requirements\nanalysis and miss something,\n\n332\n00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.950\nwhich isn't unheard of, and you get to\nyour design implementation phrase and\n\n333\n00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.080\nyou're like, wait a minute,\nhow am I gonna do this.\n\n334\n00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.420\nIt's like, oh crap,\nwe need to go back to do a job review of\n\n335\n00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.150\nour requirements analysis and\nfigure out where we can work that in.\n\n336\n00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.800\nAnd then who's responsible for doing that.\n\n337\n00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.790\nAnd then do design implementation and\ntry again.\n\n338\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:50.210\nIt's been known to happen.\n\n339\n00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:55.130\nI hope it doesn't happen to you or\nit's minimized, but heck it can happen.\n\n340\n00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:59.420\n>> We should do a dual ring one in each\ndirection so we can jump back and go back.\n\n341\n00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.555\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n342\n00:21:00.555 --> 00:21:08.920\n[LAUGH] But then you get that and\nthen there's the last stage, evolution.\n\n343\n00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:14.440\nEvolution, I think that's kind of just\na goofy thing, term to put out there.\n\n344\n00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.230\nI get what they're saying.\n\n345\n00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.600\nBut evolution,\nthat should be kind of like your care and\n\n346\n00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.660\nfeeding, your ongoing maintenance.\n\n347\n00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:28.010\nWhere people are actually using that whole\nproduct or solution that you came up with.\n\n348\n00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:32.070\nJust kinda going through and\nletting it purr along.\n\n349\n00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:36.230\nThe thing with evolution is\nyou're gonna find things there,\n\n350\n00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:40.210\nonce something gets out into the field\nthat becomes your real test.\n\n351\n00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:44.710\nIs that you've pushed it out there and\nnow the the rank and file get to use it,\n\n352\n00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:48.640\nand they're going to reveal\nlittle glitches and hiccups and\n\n353\n00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.380\nthey're going to have\ncomplaints about things.\n\n354\n00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.530\nIt always happens.\n\n355\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.080\nAnd you're going to have to figure out\nhow you're going to adapt to those.\n\n356\n00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.875\nMaybe it's something that\nyou can fix right now.\n\n357\n00:21:56.875 --> 00:21:58.755\nMaybe it's something that's\ngoing to be noted and\n\n358\n00:21:58.755 --> 00:22:01.955\nput into the next requirement\nanalysis to go through.\n\n359\n00:22:01.955 --> 00:22:04.325\nSo it is a very cyclical process.\n\n360\n00:22:04.325 --> 00:22:10.405\nNow like I said along the way, I started\ntalking about the cloud working into that.\n\n361\n00:22:10.405 --> 00:22:11.325\nIt's more of the same.\n\n362\n00:22:11.325 --> 00:22:14.735\nThe cloud as far as you're concerned\nis just a new technology that your\n\n363\n00:22:14.735 --> 00:22:16.875\nincorporating into your solution.\n\n364\n00:22:16.875 --> 00:22:21.140\nSo, it's a question of do you understand\nthe capabilities of the cloud?\n\n365\n00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.060\nYou understand the solution you either\nhave the solution you're striving for and\n\n366\n00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.570\nthen you just use SDLC to\nincorporate the cloud technology and\n\n367\n00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:33.290\nwhat you're trying to do into\none solution and make it happen.\n\n368\n00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:35.560\nThat's what it should be able to do.\n\n369\n00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.190\nAnd if you use it right,\nit should have a huge\n\n370\n00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:44.140\nimpact on how effective your solution is.\n\n371\n00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:49.660\nYou know and SDLC by the way, even though\nthis is the one that ISE tends to test on\n\n372\n00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.340\nor does test on, it's not the only one.\n\n373\n00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:57.250\nThere's probably people out here that\nare doing software development already and\n\n374\n00:22:57.250 --> 00:22:59.250\nthey're saying that we\nuse different models.\n\n375\n00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:04.290\nI mean there's models like\nwaterfall models and And\n\n376\n00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:08.970\nextremed a, extreme programming models,\nand all sorts of stuff out there.\n\n377\n00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.090\nThey may say, well this is\nthe one I'm more familiar with.\n\n378\n00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.240\nThis is the one I use.\n\n379\n00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.600\nI don't, you know, quite frankly,\nI don't care whatever you use.\n\n380\n00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.600\nIf you wanna create your own solution,\nand that solution, and\n\n381\n00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:24.020\nthat solution uses a model that You're\nmore comfortable with, go for it.\n\n382\n00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.340\nJust because this is the one they test on\ndoesn't mean it's the only game in town.\n\n383\n00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.990\nSo I just felt like I\nshould emphasize that.\n\n384\n00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:35.300\nThat they have an ISE and\nthe cloud security alliance hasn't\n\n385\n00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:39.590\nmagically determined this is the only one\nyou shall use, and they blessed it and\n\n386\n00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:40.500\nall that good stuff.\n\n387\n00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.240\nNo, there's other ones that you can use.\n\n388\n00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.380\nThis is just the one that is\non a lot of people's radar and\n\n389\n00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.560\nit's something that we can pretty\nmuch find a lot of documentation on,\n\n390\n00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.718\nhave familiarity with, and just go with.\n\n391\n00:23:52.718 --> 00:23:53.377\n>> Very good.\n\n392\n00:23:53.377 --> 00:23:58.020\nSean had a lot of great information on\nthe software development life cycle and\n\n393\n00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.770\nhow it It changes a little bit now\nthat we've got to bring in the cloud.\n\n394\n00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.510\nWe're trying to move\napplications out to the cloud,\n\n395\n00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:08.680\nit's something we've got to consider but,\nall in all it doesn't seem to change it\n\n396\n00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.430\nthat much, it's just bringing in like\nyou said some different technologies,\n\n397\n00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.080\nsome different delivery methods.\n\n398\n00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.780\nMaybe some different\nauthentication methods, but\n\n399\n00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.640\nin the end it's that same process.\n\n400\n00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.920\n>> Yeah that's what I'd like to emphasize\nhere, is I could've easily sat here and\n\n401\n00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.220\njust baffled you with BS and said oh,\n\n402\n00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:30.610\nwell here's a bunch of, here's how\nthe cloud really changes things and\n\n403\n00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:35.390\nhere's all the extra stuff, and\nbe careful of this, this, and this.\n\n404\n00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.700\nIt's just another technology.\n\n405\n00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:45.770\nI expect you to be familiar with your\nparticular requirements and needs are.\n\n406\n00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:50.160\nAnd then you're going to go over and look\nto see what the cloud provides you and\n\n407\n00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.290\nthen see how you can integrate those two.\n\n408\n00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:54.540\nIt's just another technology,\n\n409\n00:24:54.540 --> 00:25:00.260\nanother thing that you can use to\nbuild the solution in a different way.\n\n410\n00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:00.830\nThat's it.\n\n411\n00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:05.890\nYou just gotta know what that can provide\nyou and what you need to do and see Can\n\n412\n00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:12.280\nyou get to a better solution or the goal\nthat you want by incorporating this is in.\n\n413\n00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.500\nThat's really it, that's like any I\nmean if heck, I take the cloud and\n\n414\n00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:20.380\nall this other stuff out and say you're\ndeveloping an application, period.\n\n415\n00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:23.940\nIt's just a matter of you're gonna\ndo the same type of thing here.\n\n416\n00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.340\nWhat are you trying to do?\n\n417\n00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.510\nAnd then you are going to evaluate\nwith what you already know and\n\n418\n00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:32.110\ndo other research to see what things\nare out there that you're gonna\n\n419\n00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:35.260\nweave into your application\nto accomplish that task.\n\n420\n00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.760\nAnd just rock and roll with it.\n\n421\n00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:44.030\nSo I'm trying to kind of demystify it and\nmake it easier for you.\n\n422\n00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:45.230\nAs we go through.\n\n423\n00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:46.380\nThat's my whole thing.\n\n424\n00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.100\nI like to do, keep it easy and simple.\n\n425\n00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.210\nLet's focus on getting\nthe solution implemented.\n\n426\n00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.620\nLet's not focus on, hey,\nwhat terminology was that?\n\n427\n00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.200\nAnd blah blah blah blah blah.\n\n428\n00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.200\nLet's just get things done.\n\n429\n00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.380\n>> Very good.\nAll right.\n\n430\n00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.420\nAnother great episode.\n\n431\n00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.280\nHope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n432\n00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.620\nSigning off for

00:00:14.980\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:15.730\nWith me today is Mr.\n\n5\n00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.810\nSean Oriyano, and Sean, in this one,\nwe're going to be talking about additional\n\n6\n00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.280\napplication issues that we start\nMigrating our stuff out in the Cloud,\n\n7\n00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.630\nmaking these applications available from\nInternet accessible or access devices.\n\n8\n00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.490\nSo other things we gotta\nthink about besides\n\n9\n00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.120\nwhat we've already talked about which was\nthe software development life cycle and\n\n10\n00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.110\nhow that changes with\nmoving out to the cloud.\n\n11\n00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.730\n>> We're moving through things, you know\nyou've done the SDLC, so presuming you've\n\n12\n00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.500\ngone through the SDLC and you've got\nthings moved up to the cloud and\n\n13\n00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.430\nyou've done your testing and you're well\non your way to going through that cycle.\n\n14\n00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.760\nThat's great,\nthat's a big plus right there.\n\n15\n00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.730\nThe next thing we have going on here is\nwhat do you do after that's been deployed.\n\n16\n00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.470\nThere's things that do have to happen in\naddition to just using the thing, and\n\n17\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.625\npatting yourself on the back that you've\ngot thing up there, what we have going\n\n18\n00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:23.715\nnow is the actual testing and\nconfiguration and all that good stuff.\n\n19\n00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:28.805\nAs far as testing and setup goes, you've\ngot the configuration of the application\n\n20\n00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:33.885\nitself, lining stuff up and\nmaking sure it's all working.\n\n21\n00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:38.171\nThen you have stuff like,\nwhen we go back to the whole idea of idea,\n\n22\n00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:39.753\nI didn't stutter.\n\n23\n00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:44.200\n[LAUGH] If you go back to the identity and\n\n24\n00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.150\naccess management type stuff,\nwhen we go through and we look at that,\n\n25\n00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.330\nthere's even part of the configuration\nis going to include that, and\n\n26\n00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.360\nthere's something called\nan entitlement matrix you can set up.\n\n27\n00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.310\nIt's something that you probably\nheard the term before, if you haven't\n\n28\n00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.280\nIt's just a matter of, hey, you got\nyour people in groups down one side,\n\n29\n00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.280\nthe rights they have on the other side for\na resource.\n\n30\n00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.870\nAnd you're just checking the boxes\nappropriately and go from there.\n\n31\n00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.430\nThat's kind of what we got going on there.\n\n32\n00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.960\nSo, you can work through that too either\nby doing the exercise I just talked about,\n\n33\n00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.890\nwhere you line everything up in\na matrix and check stuff off, or\n\n34\n00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.080\nyou just do it some other way and\n\n35\n00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.152\nstart applying those rights and\nprivileges to the appropriate personnel.\n\n36\n00:02:25.152 --> 00:02:29.989\nSo once we've got that out of the way,\n\n37\n00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.250\nthings we have coming in is, you've got\neverything set up, you're happy, well,\n\n38\n00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.490\nyou just can't leave it\nlike that unfortunately.\n\n39\n00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.730\nI know you wanna be like,\nall right I've done a good job, I'm done!\n\n40\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.470\nI'm off to fight for justice!\n\n41\n00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.080\nYou wanna do that but\nthere's more to it than that.\n\n42\n00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.215\nThe next step of this process is gonna be,\nespecially for compliance reasons\n\n43\n00:02:56.215 --> 00:03:01.120\nbecause you probably thought we were\ndone with compliance, we're not.\n\n44\n00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.220\nSo, sorry.\n\n45\n00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.110\nBut, if you've got compliance issues or\nheck,\n\n46\n00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.335\nif you just wanna be smart\nabout the whole thing.\n\n47\n00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:11.080\n[LAUGH] Which we know,\nyou wanna be smart about this.\n\n48\n00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.750\nYou want to make sure that things are\nworking the way that they are suppose to.\n\n49\n00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.538\nAnd that's where doing tests against your\napplications your environments come in.\n\n50\n00:03:19.538 --> 00:03:24.850\nAnd what we want to do is we wanna kind\nof split some hairs here at his point,\n\n51\n00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.510\ncuz we've been talking kinda\ngenerically about tests.\n\n52\n00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.970\nWell, now we're gonna break\nit up a bit more, and\n\n53\n00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.480\nsay that we have tests that we\ncan do internally with our stuff.\n\n54\n00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.750\nWe have tests that we can run\nagainst our applications,\n\n55\n00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.520\nas we own it, but then,\nthere's other things that come in.\n\n56\n00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.350\nAnd one of the things that comes in\nis these remote vulnerability tests,\n\n57\n00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.530\nwhich typically are gonna be\nundertaken by a outside party.\n\n58\n00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.355\nIt's someone that you contract with,\nor maybe someone internally is\n\n59\n00:03:53.355 --> 00:03:57.783\ngoing to emulate those tests by\ndoing it from another location.\n\n60\n00:03:57.783 --> 00:04:01.770\nThey could do it from home,\nthey could do it from another office.\n\n61\n00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.280\nAnd what they want to do is they want\nto see from the outside looking in\n\n62\n00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.600\nwhat type of vulnerabilities\nthey can find.\n\n63\n00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.480\nAnd that's going to closely\nemulate what an actual hacker,\n\n64\n00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.610\nmalicious user, or\njust what life has in store for you,\n\n65\n00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.380\nsee what vulnerabilities are there and\nhopefully try to squash those things and\n\n66\n00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.690\naddress those things before\nthey become a big problem.\n\n67\n00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.740\nBut heck, we've gone through ethical\nhacking and anyone of you can look at\n\n68\n00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.110\nthe best course anti-pro library,\nthe ethical hacking course.\n\n69\n00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.688\nI mean, I'm not biased,\nI'm gonna tell them the truth here.\n\n70\n00:04:39.688 --> 00:04:41.570\n[LAUGH] You could look at that course and\n\n71\n00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.750\nsee the whole ethical hacking process and\nwhat it is, giving you the tools,\n\n72\n00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.990\ngiving you the knowledge to do that,\nyou just gotta go through and\n\n73\n00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.110\npractice them and then you could use\nthose to test your environment remotely.\n\n74\n00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.745\nSo that's a great thing, I mean you've\neven got stuff like metasploit and\n\n75\n00:04:58.745 --> 00:05:03.234\nall that all could come into play here\nall stuff we've talked about, but\n\n76\n00:05:03.234 --> 00:05:04.723\nits not as easy as that.\n\n77\n00:05:04.723 --> 00:05:08.160\nAs much as you kinda hope it is,\nits not as easy as that.\n\n78\n00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.260\nWhat's going to happen is you\ndo have the whole idea that you\n\n79\n00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:20.495\ncan test your stuff remotely and do\nwhatever you want against your own stuff.\n\n80\n00:05:20.495 --> 00:05:25.045\nNotice the emphasis there,\nyour own stuff, stuff that you own.\n\n81\n00:05:25.045 --> 00:05:29.145\nYou could do that against\nstuff that you don't own.\n\n82\n00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:31.280\nIt becomes a little more of a problem.\n\n83\n00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.650\nYou just can't go in, and\n\n84\n00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.950\nstart poking and prodding around\nat your cloud provider's stuff.\n\n85\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.430\nIn most cases.\n\n86\n00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.290\n>> Sean, why not?\n\n87\n00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.400\n>> Yeah, why not?\n\n88\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.490\nHeck, if you're pen testing somebody's\nstuff, you get caught, and you suck,\n\n89\n00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.228\nyou had no business doing\nit in the first place.\n\n90\n00:05:48.228 --> 00:05:49.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, that's\n\n91\n00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.690\n>> That's my theory.\n\n92\n00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.840\nI'm gonna,\nthat's gonna be the title of my next book,\n\n93\n00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.423\nYou Suck If You Can't Do This\nWithout Being Caught [LAUGH].\n\n94\n00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:59.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so all kidding aside,\n\n95\n00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:06.040\nyou have to, when you do this, it's one\nof our core tenets of being a pen tester\n\n96\n00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.570\nis that you have to have\npermission to do this.\n\n97\n00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.530\nNow, the thing is is that you can have\npermission to test your own stuff.\n\n98\n00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.110\nThe cloud becomes a little\ntrickier of an issue.\n\n99\n00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.450\nThings that can change that cuz up to\nthis point, we've been saying oh well,\n\n100\n00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.000\nit's the cloud, you don't own it.\n\n101\n00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.850\nSomeone else's stuff.\n\n102\n00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.400\nDon't touch.\n\n103\n00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.130\nLeave it alone, and\nyou're probably just not gonna get it.\n\n104\n00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.432\nWell, let's change that picture a bit.\n\n105\n00:06:32.432 --> 00:06:35.560\nNow it's time to change\nthat picture a bit.\n\n106\n00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.390\nAnd what we're looking at\nchanging here is the idea that\n\n107\n00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.580\nwhat if someone is outsourcing?\n\n108\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.860\nIf you are outsourcing\nto a cloud provider,\n\n109\n00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.360\nif it's a private cloud,\nyou're probably gonna get more latitude\n\n110\n00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.160\nbecause you're the only one on that cloud,\npresumably.\n\n111\n00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.680\nIn fact, by definition you should\nbe the only one on the cloud.\n\n112\n00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.710\nYou're all isolated.\n\n113\n00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.030\nIt's physically protected and all that.\n\n114\n00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.440\nAs long as you set it up ahead of time\nwith your cloud service provider,\n\n115\n00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.010\nyou may very well be able\nto beat the heck out of it.\n\n116\n00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.920\nYou want to crash it?\n\n117\n00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.420\nGo ahead.\n\n118\n00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:13.260\nYour dime.\nYou know,\n\n119\n00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.990\nyou're gonna have to pay\nthe provider to set it back up.\n\n120\n00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.435\nBut they could very well\nWe'll look at it that way.\n\n121\n00:07:19.435 --> 00:07:24.165\nIf it's somebody that you're on a multi\ntenant solution, don't count on it.\n\n122\n00:07:24.165 --> 00:07:27.145\nThey may allow you to do some tests.\n\n123\n00:07:27.145 --> 00:07:31.230\nUsually you can do some tests and\nthat's the thing\n\n124\n00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:36.390\nis that while you can do some tests,\nyou can't do some of the more risky ones.\n\n125\n00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.320\nThey're not gonna typically let\nyou do stuff denial of service,\n\n126\n00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:43.811\nthat's gonna be completely verboten,\nas they say.\n\n127\n00:07:43.811 --> 00:07:46.137\n[LAUGH] You're not gonna\nbe able to do that.\n\n128\n00:07:46.137 --> 00:07:51.794\nCould you run a vulnerability scan and\nstuff to audit permissions and\n\n129\n00:07:51.794 --> 00:07:55.708\nstuff like that remotely and\nthings like that?\n\n130\n00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:57.985\nYeah, they probably would\nallow you to do that,\n\n131\n00:07:57.985 --> 00:08:00.047\njust because it's a little less invasive.\n\n132\n00:08:00.047 --> 00:08:04.552\nThey might allow you to do things where\nyou try to use something like Metasploit,\n\n133\n00:08:04.552 --> 00:08:09.860\nto break in and do remote exploits against\napplications that you're hosting there.\n\n134\n00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.960\nAnd see okay,\nwell I'm hosting there, I'm gonna\n\n135\n00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.890\nsee if there's a vulnerability in that\nplatform that lets me get in any further.\n\n136\n00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.403\nThey may allow you to do that,\nbecause that's a little less invasive.\n\n137\n00:08:21.403 --> 00:08:25.504\nBut if you're doing stuff like a denial of\nservice, or stuff to shut these down, or\n\n138\n00:08:25.504 --> 00:08:29.431\nanything like that to monkey with the\nunderlying systems or anything on there,\n\n139\n00:08:29.431 --> 00:08:32.656\nthey're gonna start putting\nthe brakes on that pretty quickly,\n\n140\n00:08:32.656 --> 00:08:34.677\nunless it happens to be a private cloud.\n\n141\n00:08:34.677 --> 00:08:39.419\nThen if it's a private cloud\nthat you're outsourcing,\n\n142\n00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:43.186\nthen you may very well\nbe cut a lot more slack.\n\n143\n00:08:43.186 --> 00:08:46.891\nIf it's a cloud that you own, hey,\ndo whatever, take a sledge hammer to it,\n\n144\n00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:49.012\nI don't care, cuz you own it, your stuff.\n\n145\n00:08:49.012 --> 00:08:53.450\nSo you just kinda gotta consider\nwhat the specific situation is.\n\n146\n00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.020\nBut regardless,\nit's something that you do wanna check,\n\n147\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.680\njust because it's in the cloud, and\nyou may be in a multi-tenant environment,\n\n148\n00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.240\ndoesn't mean that there isn't some\nlevel of testing that should be done.\n\n149\n00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.540\nAnd you wanna investigate what those\nactually are, what the options are.\n\n150\n00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.250\nUsually, if you need to do those tests,\n\n151\n00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.410\nwhich you should be prepared to do them\nif you're in a regulated industry or\n\n152\n00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:21.370\nyou're a large company just wanting to\nmake sure you're doing your due diligence.\n\n153\n00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.860\nThen, you need to have that talk with\nyour provider saying, we need to do these\n\n154\n00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:32.240\nthings for insurance purposes and for\nregulatory purposes and all these things,\n\n155\n00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.350\nour lawyers, the government,\nwhoever says we have to do these things.\n\n156\n00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.420\nWhat can you do to accommodate us?\n\n157\n00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.880\nThey're gonna ask what type\nof test do you wanna run.\n\n158\n00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.440\nAnd they're gonna go through that.\n\n159\n00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.180\nExpect if you do it without permission,\n\n160\n00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.990\nthere could be a lot\nof things that happen.\n\n161\n00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.511\nAnd I know the obvious is that-\n>> Lawsuits.\n\n162\n00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:52.844\n[LAUGH]\n>> Lawsuits, yeah, that could be,\n\n163\n00:09:52.844 --> 00:09:55.870\nthat would be a very obvious one,\nand not unexpected.\n\n164\n00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.060\nYou could be kicked off their stuff.\n\n165\n00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.870\nThey could shut all your access down,\nand say, well,\n\n166\n00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:05.380\nyou're not welcome here anymore,\ngo find someplace else to host your stuff.\n\n167\n00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.620\nSo there are some consequences\nthat could happen there that you\n\n168\n00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.600\ndefinitely wanna be aware of.\n\n169\n00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.660\nBut if you make them aware\nof these things, sometimes,\n\n170\n00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.670\nthey'll still let you do them.\n\n171\n00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.890\nI know there's ISPs out there that\n\n172\n00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.380\nif they see certain types of traffic\ngo across their network, and\n\n173\n00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:31.690\nit's not accounted for, it'll just\nlock down your connection, it's done.\n\n174\n00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:35.110\nYou'll have to call them, and\nthey'll probably shed you a lot\n\n175\n00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.300\nof finger shaking at you and all that to\nfigure out why you were doing that and\n\n176\n00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.930\ntelling you that's a bad thing and\nall that, and you're a bad person.\n\n177\n00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.850\nBut if you clear it ahead of time saying,\nwell, I need to check this, and this is\n\n178\n00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.920\nwhat I'm gonna do, they'll probably be a\nlot more willing to work with you and say,\n\n179\n00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:55.270\nwell, as long as you're not\npoking around this stuff or\n\n180\n00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:59.710\ndoing this or whatever operation,\nthey'll cut you some slack.\n\n181\n00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:04.490\n>> And this is probably something we could\ncheck with our cloud service provider\n\n182\n00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.480\nahead of time with before we make that\ndecision of what CSP I'm gonna go to.\n\n183\n00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:12.400\nIf I'm in a regulated industry, and\nI know that I've gotta perform these tests\n\n184\n00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.650\nperiodically, might be something\nI wanna discuss with them.\n\n185\n00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.743\nOr that they might already be\nfamiliar with if they're used to\n\n186\n00:11:18.743 --> 00:11:21.303\nhaving customers that are say,\nHIPAA compliant.\n\n187\n00:11:21.303 --> 00:11:25.578\n>> Yeah, it would be completely\nreasonable to ask them ahead of time.\n\n188\n00:11:25.578 --> 00:11:29.893\nI mean, this is, essentially when\nyou're going to a service provider,\n\n189\n00:11:29.893 --> 00:11:33.660\na cloud service provider,\nthis is an interview process.\n\n190\n00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.180\nIf you're not getting what you\nwant out of the interview process,\n\n191\n00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.450\nthen that's not the right candidate for\nyou.\n\n192\n00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.120\nYou go someplace else.\n\n193\n00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:46.624\nAnd if they do have experience\nhosting clients from these industries,\n\n194\n00:11:46.624 --> 00:11:51.820\nthey should have some familiarity with the\nfact that these things need to be done.\n\n195\n00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.356\nAnd if that's the case,\nthen they should be able to tell you, hey,\n\n196\n00:11:55.356 --> 00:11:59.940\nthese are the things we can accommodate\nyou on, these are the things we can't.\n\n197\n00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.180\nAnd some of those tests\nthat are required for\n\n198\n00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:08.270\nthese regulations, they're not\ndesigned to be destructive in any way.\n\n199\n00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.320\nThey're just designed to\ntest certain things and\n\n200\n00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.000\nto give confidence that\nsystems are working.\n\n201\n00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.340\nThey're not expecting you to try to\ncrash things or anything like that,\n\n202\n00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.440\nnothing that aggressive in most cases.\n\n203\n00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.210\nIf you're working in some industries,\nit's not\n\n204\n00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:29.360\nunheard of to find stuff like,\nI wanna say a payment card industry.\n\n205\n00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.020\nPayment card industry,\nbecause of the nature of what they do,\n\n206\n00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.360\nthey have their own pen testers.\n\n207\n00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.491\nIf you wanna be a pen\ntester in the PCI industry,\n\n208\n00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:44.187\nwhat you have to do is you have to go\nthrough a vetting process with them,\n\n209\n00:12:44.187 --> 00:12:49.826\nwhere they will require you to get certain\nlevels of insurance, certain checks, and\n\n210\n00:12:49.826 --> 00:12:54.915\ndo certain things before you're put on\ntheir list to be used as a pen tester for\n\n211\n00:12:54.915 --> 00:12:57.458\nanybody that's in the PCI industry.\n\n212\n00:12:57.458 --> 00:13:02.340\nAnybody that's in the PCI industry\nneeds a pen test by mandate has\n\n213\n00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:06.866\nto go through the PCI commission,\nor whatever they call it,\n\n214\n00:13:06.866 --> 00:13:11.596\nto make sure that they are using\nsomebody that they approve of.\n\n215\n00:13:11.596 --> 00:13:15.143\nAnd then there's all sorts of reports that\ngotta be written on their pen testers and\n\n216\n00:13:15.143 --> 00:13:16.621\nall that after each and every job.\n\n217\n00:13:16.621 --> 00:13:22.625\nAnd if they don't meet certain quality\nstandards, and they're counseled and\n\n218\n00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:28.894\nstuff like that, it kinda follow that in\nan industry like that, that a cloud search\n\n219\n00:13:28.894 --> 00:13:34.825\nprovider that is going to be hosting\npeople that have anything to do with that.\n\n220\n00:13:34.825 --> 00:13:38.395\nThey are going to be aware of\nthese different guidelines, and\n\n221\n00:13:38.395 --> 00:13:43.339\nthey are probably going to do additional\nthings that other non-PCI hosts would say,\n\n222\n00:13:43.339 --> 00:13:45.290\nwell, we don't need to do that.\n\n223\n00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.240\nThese guys say well, if we're gonna host\nPCI clients, we've gotta satisfy certain\n\n224\n00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.000\nPCI standards, and so\nthey'll make accommodations for you.\n\n225\n00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.450\n>> And then we've got security\nmonitoring as well that we have to do on\n\n226\n00:13:56.450 --> 00:13:59.970\nour applications, whether they're\nhosted locally or in the cloud.\n\n227\n00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:04.750\nBut again, moving it out in the cloud\nchanges the way we go about doing that.\n\n228\n00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:09.980\n>> Yeah, when you talk about logging and\nmonitoring and all sorts of\n\n229\n00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.820\naudits, we've pretty much beaten\nthat to death on previous episodes.\n\n230\n00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:21.020\nSo we won't go through in depth here and\n\n231\n00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:25.180\ntalking about oh, well, what's auditing,\nwhat's logging, and all that stuff.\n\n232\n00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.660\nWe'll soon let you know that, if not,\n\n233\n00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:32.650\nthen you know, you can go back and\nlook at different types of logging.\n\n234\n00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:38.390\nIn fact, logging in general, you should be\nable to go to any course that we have or\n\n235\n00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.095\nan IT pro that talks about logging and\nget the idea.\n\n236\n00:14:42.095 --> 00:14:46.510\nSo you've got plenty of options for\nlogging.\n\n237\n00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.330\nThe question is when you go in the cloud,\nyou're going to expand the number of\n\n238\n00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:54.990\nlogs and\nmonitoring mechanisms dramatically.\n\n239\n00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:59.290\nI mean, that's an understatement because\nnow you have the ones on your side\n\n240\n00:14:59.290 --> 00:15:00.490\nplus the ones on their side.\n\n241\n00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:04.950\nAnd now the challenge that then comes\nin is unifying all the information,\n\n242\n00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.390\nbringing it together\ninto a cohesive thing,\n\n243\n00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:12.250\nthat you can do data analysis on,\nand really see what's going on.\n\n244\n00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:18.056\nThink of the nightmare you'd have if\nyou've got multiple cloud providers,\n\n245\n00:15:18.056 --> 00:15:22.880\nand you're trying to uncover\nan incident that has occurred over\n\n246\n00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.186\nmultiple hosts or\non multiple cloud service providers.\n\n247\n00:15:27.186 --> 00:15:30.915\nYou're gonna have to coordinate all\nthose logs and correlate everything and\n\n248\n00:15:30.915 --> 00:15:34.960\nsee okay, this is what happened,\nthe person went from here to here to here.\n\n249\n00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:41.690\nAnd I can see that by bringing all these\nlogs and everything else together.\n\n250\n00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.210\nSo that would be one challenge.\n\n251\n00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.654\nThe other challenge would be is,\nmaking sure that your cloud\n\n252\n00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:51.260\nservice provider can give you the level\nof logging and monitoring that you need.\n\n253\n00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.883\nRemember you're not always\nable just to choose this,\n\n254\n00:15:54.883 --> 00:16:00.316\nyou may actually have to follow certain\nGuidelines on just how much you can audit,\n\n255\n00:16:00.316 --> 00:16:04.723\nor how little you can audit,\ndepending on how you wanna look at it,\n\n256\n00:16:04.723 --> 00:16:07.634\nglass full, glass half empty type thing.\n\n257\n00:16:07.634 --> 00:16:13.845\nSo you'll have to figure out what\nlevel of monitoring you need,\n\n258\n00:16:13.845 --> 00:16:15.795\nand just make that happen.\n\n259\n00:16:15.795 --> 00:16:19.735\nFor the most part,\nwhat level of logging and\n\n260\n00:16:19.735 --> 00:16:23.715\nmonitoring you have is really going\nto go back to again that CSA model.\n\n261\n00:16:23.715 --> 00:16:27.495\nIt's where on that stack you lie\nversus where in that stack they lie as\n\n262\n00:16:27.495 --> 00:16:28.475\nyour provider.\n\n263\n00:16:28.475 --> 00:16:30.625\nWho's going to be the person responsible,\nor\n\n264\n00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:34.438\nwho's going to be the person that needs to\nbe aware of what they need to be logging?\n\n265\n00:16:34.438 --> 00:16:38.064\nIf I offload stuff,\nif I'm doing software as a service and\n\n266\n00:16:38.064 --> 00:16:43.170\nI offload certain things to a service\nprovider, well, I'm gonna make them aware\n\n267\n00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:47.999\nof these are the things that they need\nto monitor to make sure I'm compliant.\n\n268\n00:16:47.999 --> 00:16:53.217\nBecause if they don't monitor those things\nand provide me those in the form of\n\n269\n00:16:53.217 --> 00:16:58.515\nreports and printouts and all that, then\nI'm kind of stuck as far as using them\n\n270\n00:16:58.515 --> 00:17:04.321\nas a provider because my industry requires\nthat I provide that in depth information.\n\n271\n00:17:04.321 --> 00:17:08.190\nAnd so it can be kind of tricky.\n\n272\n00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.360\nAnd think about the stuff\noutside of logging.\n\n273\n00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.180\nThink about stuff like IDS is and\nstuff like that.\n\n274\n00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:20.500\nA lot of that stuff could be on\nthe hosting provider's side.\n\n275\n00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.220\nYou may need to see if there's a way\nthat they can provide you information on\n\n276\n00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.470\nthose or provide you logs on\nthat to verify what's happening.\n\n277\n00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:32.370\nSo it's gonna get complicated.\n\n278\n00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:33.700\nJust the way it's gonna work.\n\n279\n00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.250\n>> All right.\n\n280\n00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.100\nBut a lot of things change,\nbut it's all still possible,\n\n281\n00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:41.310\nwe just have to adjust our methodologies,\npossibly we've gotta make sure that we\n\n282\n00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.770\nhave permissions when applicable,\nif we're dealing with public cloud or\n\n283\n00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.650\neven private cloud that's\nbeing hosted by somebody else.\n\n284\n00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:53.360\nCuz there's always that risk that we might\ninterfere with somebody else's operations,\n\n285\n00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.810\nas well as possibly the ISP that\nthe traffic is bouncing across.\n\n286\n00:17:56.810 --> 00:18:00.680\nWe've gotta make sure we have\npermissions there as well.\n\n287\n00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:06.990\nPerformance monitoring, is that pretty\nmuch the same or kinda the same thing?\n\n288\n00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:09.830\n>> I'd put it in the same category,\nit's kind of like when you look at\n\n289\n00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:14.320\nWindows logs, in Windows logs,\nyou have logs for really everything now.\n\n290\n00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.300\nAnd you see logs that\nhave nothing to do with\n\n291\n00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:21.560\nthe actual technology working that stuff\nthat would be relating directly back to\n\n292\n00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.670\nperformance of the individual components.\n\n293\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:28.160\nSo yeah, all these things are included,\nand I'd say performance, I mean you're\n\n294\n00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.135\ngetting back, you're starting to\ncreep into that availability area.\n\n295\n00:18:31.135 --> 00:18:37.090\nSo it's definitely something\nthat you should have.\n\n296\n00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:42.060\nIt's also worth doing performance\nmonitoring because when you put your cloud\n\n297\n00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:46.970\nsolution up initially, you wanna make\nsure that that cloud solution is still\n\n298\n00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:52.190\nable to service the types\nof demands that you have.\n\n299\n00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:57.000\nRemember, most places, or\nthe rule of thumb more or\n\n300\n00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.510\nless is that every 18 months,\n\n301\n00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:04.620\nan organization doubles the amount of\ninformation that they have on hand.\n\n302\n00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.619\nSo that means that every 18 months,\n\n303\n00:19:07.619 --> 00:19:12.250\nyou're gonna require more\nspace to put your stuff.\n\n304\n00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.550\nYou're also going to need to make changes\npotentially to how you do backups.\n\n305\n00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.460\nYou're going to make changes to how\n\n306\n00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.170\nyou analyze the data that you\nhave currently sitting there.\n\n307\n00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:25.440\nSome of that stuff might be old and\nmight be able to be purged.\n\n308\n00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.918\nBut we as human beings and as businesses\ngenerate that amount of information.\n\n309\n00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:37.660\nLike I said, on average, every 18 months,\ncompanies double the size of their data.\n\n310\n00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.320\nI mean, that's staggering.\n\n311\n00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.720\nAnd that was actually a number that\nwas quoted as far back as six,\n\n312\n00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.130\nseven years ago.\n\n313\n00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:53.380\nIt may very well accelerate, every year\nthey double the amount of data they have,\n\n314\n00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:55.220\nand think about how mind numbing that is,\n\n315\n00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.680\nhow much stuff that you\nhave to keep an eye on.\n\n316\n00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.530\nSo doing performance monitoring, one of\nthe things you're looking at is usage and\n\n317\n00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:06.340\nresources and all that are available, the\nnumber of clients you have coming in and\n\n318\n00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.600\nusing your resources, and seeing well,\n\n319\n00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.340\ndo I need to start stacking on some\nmore resources so I have a buffer?\n\n320\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.500\nBecause I'm starting to\nkind of chew away and\n\n321\n00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.370\nwear away that actual\nbuffer that I had before.\n\n322\n00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:21.990\nSo if there's any surges or spikes,\nI'm gonna get to a point where\n\n323\n00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:26.650\nif there's a surge or\na spike in traffic or requests or\n\n324\n00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:32.400\na spike in data,\nI can easily hop right over my limits and\n\n325\n00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.520\njust kind of have my performance and\neverything else go in the toilet.\n\n326\n00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.360\nYou don't want that, so\nyou need to be prepared.\n\n327\n00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:44.610\nIt's also worth knowing, Mike,\nyou mentioned yesterday about,\n\n328\n00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.650\nI forget the host and\nprovider you mentioned.\n\n329\n00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:50.430\nWas it Google, or somebody else\nthat you can try their service,\n\n330\n00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:55.000\nbut if you go over that limit they'll\njust start charging you for it.\n\n331\n00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.252\nIt's like, we're not warning you [LAUGH],\nwe're just like [SOUND] yeah whatever,\n\n332\n00:20:57.252 --> 00:20:57.776\nyou're charged.\n\n333\n00:20:57.776 --> 00:21:02.860\nWhere one of the other guys,\nAmazon, was it's free.\n\n334\n00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.650\nThey put limitations on it,\nhard limitations on it right up front.\n\n335\n00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:10.860\nBut for a year you get to test it and\npoke and prod it and play around with it.\n\n336\n00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.570\nSo that's another thing you'd wanna be\naware of when you're doing this monitoring\n\n337\n00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:19.070\nof usage is it gives you an idea of,\nhey, we'd better get some more money in\n\n338\n00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:23.240\nthe pipeline because we're starting\nto more consistently get closer and\n\n339\n00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:28.760\ncloser and closer to that, at some point\nwe're gonna be over what we have now.\n\n340\n00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.830\nThe ISP can provide us that space,\n\n341\n00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:34.470\nbut if they have to allocate space for\nus they're gonna start charging us for it,\n\n342\n00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:38.582\nso more money that we have to make\nsure is in the budget to cover that.\n\n343\n00:21:38.582 --> 00:21:41.770\n>> All right, well Shaun has a lot of good\ninformation, a lot of things we gotta\n\n344\n00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:45.220\nthink about as we start moving these\napplications out to the cloud.\n\n345\n00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.820\nAll the way from the design process\nto the implementation process, and\n\n346\n00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:51.160\nthen it continues on, right?\n\n347\n00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.220\nOnce you put it up there, we're not done,\nas we've seen in this episode.\n\n348\n00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.610\nWe've gotta consider how we go\nabout testing those applications,\n\n349\n00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:01.280\nmonitoring those applications,\npen testing applications.\n\n350\n00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.280\nThere's a lot of different things we've\ngotta consider when we move those\n\n351\n00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:04.850\napps to the cloud.\n\n352\n00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:08.130\nSo anything else we wanna talk\nabout before we wrap this one up?\n\n353\n00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:12.790\n>> I think you really hit the nail on\nthe head there at the end, is that, yeah,\n\n354\n00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:13.970\nthis is not a done issue.\n\n355\n00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:17.080\nIt's something that you\nneed to keep an eye on,\n\n356\n00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.490\nespecially in those cloud environments.\n\n357\n00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:23.495\nIt tends to be a very dynamic environment,\nso you've got to make sure that you're\n\n358\n00:22:23.495 --> 00:22:28.515\nreally keeping an eye on things, and\ndon't let things get out of hand.\n\n359\n00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:32.535\nYou don't want to deal with something\nafter all the fires have lit and\n\n360\n00:22:32.535 --> 00:22:34.240\neverything's broken loose.\n\n361\n00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.180\n>> Very good, all right,\nanother great episode.\n\n362\n00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.910\nHope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n363\n00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.380\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n364\n00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.229\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n365\n00:22:41.229 --> 00:22:42.438\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n366\n00:22:42.438 --> 00:22:48.510\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:16.186\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick\nwith me today is Mr.\n\n4\n00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:19.907\nSean Oriyano and Sean in this\nepisode we're gonna be talking about\n\n5\n00:00:19.907 --> 00:00:24.105\nsome encryption issues that we might\nhave as we move out towards the cloud.\n\n6\n00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:27.497\nI know we've hinted around a little bit,\nor we've mentioned, we haven't hinted,\n\n7\n00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:29.341\nwe've actually mentioned\na couple of times.\n\n8\n00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:32.351\nSome of the issues that we\ncan run into with encryption,\n\n9\n00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:33.899\ntake a closer look at it now.\n\n10\n00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.393\n>> Yeah, that's really you know\nwhat we're looking at here,\n\n11\n00:00:37.393 --> 00:00:41.779\nlike we said we have talked about\nencryption, mentioned it here and there,\n\n12\n00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:46.779\nbut we haven't really, until now, haven't\naddressed it head on, so now it really,\n\n13\n00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:49.350\nthe time is to address it head on.\n\n14\n00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.170\nSo where does encryption fit in and\nwhat does it provide for you?\n\n15\n00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.250\nSome of these little details that\nare still hanging out as far as that goes.\n\n16\n00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.790\nWell we know what encryption\nis at this point or we should.\n\n17\n00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.580\nThere's different types of encryption.\n\n18\n00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.300\nWe have symmetric, asymmetric,\nwe've got hashing.\n\n19\n00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.080\nThose are all the types that are on\nthe table for what we're doing here.\n\n20\n00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.530\nThe question is\nthe strengths that come in,\n\n21\n00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.890\nthe types that you can use and the\nsignificance of it overall is gonna be and\n\n22\n00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.380\nhow it's gonna impact the legal\nside of things and stuff like that.\n\n23\n00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.980\nWell, when we get down to it,\nencryption, first of all,\n\n24\n00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.560\nis gonna play a major role in just\nabout everything you do here.\n\n25\n00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.870\nIf you're putting stuff up in the cloud,\nyou've got a choice.\n\n26\n00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.610\nYou can put it up in the cloud completely\nunencrypted, or you can encrypt it.\n\n27\n00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.800\nAnd if you're sensible,\nthen you are going to encrypt it.\n\n28\n00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.110\nAnd either the provider's gonna give you\nsome encryption options, or you're gonna\n\n29\n00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.770\nplace it up there and manage it in\nencrypted format completely yourself.\n\n30\n00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.530\nSo that's at least the initial part of it.\n\n31\n00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.790\nNow as far as what types\nof encryption you use,\n\n32\n00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.750\nthat's where we start getting into\na little bit of the nastiness there\n\n33\n00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.890\nis the different strengths and\ndifferent types that are available to you.\n\n34\n00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.160\nFor the most part,\n\n35\n00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.490\nyour providers are gonna stick with\nthe major players in the market.\n\n36\n00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.590\nThey shouldn't give you some obscure,\nout of the way encryption format.\n\n37\n00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.490\nBut you should expect to see stuff\nlike your AESs, your triple DES,\n\n38\n00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.220\nthose type of guys should definitely\nbe making an appearance in here.\n\n39\n00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.740\nSo, you would choose something like one\nof those if you're doing bulk encryption.\n\n40\n00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.110\nThe thing you have to decide is if\nyou're going AES or Triple DES.\n\n41\n00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.350\nWhat keystroke or what key length do\nyou need would be a big, big, big,\n\n42\n00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.360\nbig part of it.\n\n43\n00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.610\nIn fact, no matter what encryption\nalgorithm you're using,\n\n44\n00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.070\nkey length is gonna be a big part.\n\n45\n00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.920\nYou could choose a very good algorithm,\nbut you choose the wrong key strength and\n\n46\n00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.590\nthat's really not gonna\nbe all that useful.\n\n47\n00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.790\nSo you definitely have to think about\nthose are some of the issues right\n\n48\n00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.990\nup front.\n\n49\n00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.470\nThe next thing you have to concern\nyourself with is things like storage\n\n50\n00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.510\nof the key.\n\n51\n00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.800\nWhat method are you gonna use for that?\n\n52\n00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.160\nIn fact that opens up,\nas we've seen in previous episodes,\n\n53\n00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.730\nthat's gonna open up big\ncans of worms there.\n\n54\n00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.460\nFor example, it's one thing to create\n\n55\n00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.860\na encryption key as part\nof the encryption process.\n\n56\n00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.920\nYou'd need to do that obviously so,\nyou generate an encryption key to put\n\n57\n00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.970\nyour stuff into the format, and\npull it out of that format.\n\n58\n00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.110\nBut storage of the encryption\nkey now becomes the big issue.\n\n59\n00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.513\nWho's gonna be responsible for\nhandling that?\n\n60\n00:03:49.513 --> 00:03:53.722\nSome cloud providers will say, we will\nstore that for you as part of their\n\n61\n00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:57.724\nservice, they will act not only as\nthe person who stores your data and\n\n62\n00:03:57.724 --> 00:03:59.596\nall your services and all that.\n\n63\n00:03:59.596 --> 00:04:05.459\nThey will also act as a key escrow agent\nas it were, you know, so they're holding\n\n64\n00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.083\nthat for you too but one of the things\nthat we've seen that comes as result of.\n\n65\n00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:16.055\nThat is that now you have someone\nthat has your data encrypted data and\n\n66\n00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:22.066\nthen has the key to actually unlock it and\nknows has knowledge of the algorithm too.\n\n67\n00:04:22.066 --> 00:04:26.649\nSo all those things going together means\nthat you have someone other than yourself,\n\n68\n00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:29.890\nthat can take that information\nout of an encrypted format.\n\n69\n00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.650\nSo that could be very nasty, when you\nstart factoring in things, like do\n\n70\n00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.140\nyou trust 100% the people that are having\nphysical access to those facilities?\n\n71\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.470\nThat you're not gonna get\nany data leakage issues, or\n\n72\n00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.220\ndata theft issues that can be a big thing.\n\n73\n00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.560\nAnd then, even on top of that,\nis the question of what if a subpoena is\n\n74\n00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.465\nserved or a search warrant is\nserved as the case may be that\n\n75\n00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:04.155\nprovider is now in a position where\nthey are a nice juicy target.\n\n76\n00:05:04.155 --> 00:05:10.957\nIf there's a legal issue and\nthey're gonna be going after you.\n\n77\n00:05:10.957 --> 00:05:15.747\nWell, they can now go after you without\neven having to involve you at that point.\n\n78\n00:05:15.747 --> 00:05:19.647\nThey can go directly to\nthe cloud service provider and\n\n79\n00:05:19.647 --> 00:05:22.067\nsay, we need this person's information.\n\n80\n00:05:22.067 --> 00:05:23.777\nAnd we need this person's key.\n\n81\n00:05:23.777 --> 00:05:26.367\nWe know you have it, so cough it up.\n\n82\n00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:28.329\nIn which case,\nyou don't really get much of a say.\n\n83\n00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:34.650\nIn fact,\nI would draw your attention back towards\n\n84\n00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.050\nsomething that was brought up\nin the forensics course was you\n\n85\n00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.300\nin essence if you recall in the forensics\ncourse if I take my notebook here,\n\n86\n00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.400\nright we had that whole thing like\nI got my notebook sitting here and\n\n87\n00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.800\nI take this notebook and take it to\nlike a Best Buy or something like that.\n\n88\n00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.490\nAnd they find something that's\nquestionable they might find pirated\n\n89\n00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.670\ncontent on there.\n\n90\n00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:04.020\nThey have the ability to call\nlaw enforcement to say, hey,\n\n91\n00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:11.210\nthis customer of ours, Sean Oriyano,\nhas got some pirated content on here.\n\n92\n00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.150\nSo that we know is illegal for\nhim to have.\n\n93\n00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.540\nSo we want you take a look at it.\n\n94\n00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.130\nI have by taking into Best Buy,\nI've given control of it to a third party.\n\n95\n00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.990\nSo it starts to alleviate some\nof those search warrant rules.\n\n96\n00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.920\nSo which case, they can call it in and\nthey can start poking through it.\n\n97\n00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.110\nAnd I don't have any room to sit there and\ncry and stomp my feet and\n\n98\n00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.000\nsay well you can't do that\neyes of the law, they can,\n\n99\n00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.280\nbecause you've yielded\ncontrol to a third party.\n\n100\n00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.100\nIt would be the same type of thing here.\n\n101\n00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.910\nIt's that you've yielded control of your\ndata and your keys to a third party.\n\n102\n00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.180\nYou signed that over, in essence.\n\n103\n00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.850\nThe key, heck, you probably have\nsigned control of the key over.\n\n104\n00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.110\nYou're saying, well,\nI want you to do key escrow for me.\n\n105\n00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.560\nHere, let me grab the paperwork here,\nand sign, put my John Hancock on it.\n\n106\n00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.330\nYou've got control of it.\n\n107\n00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.390\nHey they can do a lot with that without\nhaving to serve a traditional search\n\n108\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.850\nwarrant way in a lot of cases.\n\n109\n00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.360\nThink about all of these things that\ncan kinda revolve around this thing and\n\n110\n00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.470\nreally complicate the issue.\n\n111\n00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.900\n>> I can see whereas a company I might\nnot be as willing to give up that key,\n\n112\n00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.050\nI might fight that process a little more,\nfight that subpoena and\n\n113\n00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.820\nhave good reasons to do it.\n\n114\n00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.240\nWhereas that service provider,\nthey don't have the same reasoning or\n\n115\n00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.270\nmotivation to keep that key and not give\nit up when that search warrant comes out.\n\n116\n00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.026\nIn fact probably the opposite.\n\n117\n00:07:29.026 --> 00:07:34.007\nThey wanna comply with everything they can\nwith the law so that they save face or\n\n118\n00:07:34.007 --> 00:07:35.828\nthey look good with the law.\n\n119\n00:07:35.828 --> 00:07:38.704\nAnd they're gonna be a lot more\nwilling to cough up that key, so\n\n120\n00:07:38.704 --> 00:07:41.905\nyeah something to consider and\nthen to go back to your key length Sean,\n\n121\n00:07:41.905 --> 00:07:44.360\nwe talked about that before as well,\nright?\n\n122\n00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.913\nYou don't just automatically choose\nthe longest key possible for\n\n123\n00:07:47.913 --> 00:07:52.356\nthat particular encryption while the\nstrength of the encryption might increase,\n\n124\n00:07:52.356 --> 00:07:56.235\nthere's downsides to using a really,\nreally long key as well, right?\n\n125\n00:07:56.235 --> 00:07:58.360\n>> Yeah there's performance hits and\n\n126\n00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.887\nall that like you're saying that go\nwith using a longer key, so There's a,\n\n127\n00:08:02.887 --> 00:08:06.733\nyou got to find that balance\nbetween security and performance.\n\n128\n00:08:06.733 --> 00:08:10.637\nSo usually you're going to err on the side\nof security rather than you're going to\n\n129\n00:08:10.637 --> 00:08:11.610\nsave performance.\n\n130\n00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.215\nBut you're not going to go\nridiculous with it either.\n\n131\n00:08:13.215 --> 00:08:17.805\nYou know getting a longer key,\neven though computing power has\n\n132\n00:08:17.805 --> 00:08:22.220\nbeen bumped up a bit over the past\nfew years well constantly,\n\n133\n00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:26.550\nit's still a point where you\ncan push things too far.\n\n134\n00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.110\nBut to go back to something\nthat you mentioned, Mike.\n\n135\n00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:37.588\nLet's kind of expand upon the issue\nthat you have a provider.\n\n136\n00:08:37.588 --> 00:08:42.310\nYou and let's put you in a situation\nwhere I'm the cloud provider and\n\n137\n00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.400\nyou come to me to host your information.\n\n138\n00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.870\nLet's say the government comes to me and\n\n139\n00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:51.620\nsays, well Mike's got\nsome pirated content.\n\n140\n00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.100\nWe're sure he's got it,\nbut it's encrypted.\n\n141\n00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.680\nWe can't get access to it,\nbut heck Sean we know that,\n\n142\n00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.300\nnot only do you have physical possession\nof the stuff in your facility?\n\n143\n00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.700\nMike doesn't have control\nof the encryption key.\n\n144\n00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.060\nYou have control of the encryption key,\n\n145\n00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.650\ncuz you're acting as a key\nescrow agent on his behalf.\n\n146\n00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:15.310\nYou know, so you have to,\nwe're gonna give you a court\n\n147\n00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:20.560\norder that says you have to\ngive the key plus the data.\n\n148\n00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:26.400\nIt's not always a question of if I,\nwhether I want to comply or not.\n\n149\n00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.120\nI'm compelled to comply, you know,\nor I'm the one that's in contempt.\n\n150\n00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.930\nSo that puts companies in\nan uncomfortable situation.\n\n151\n00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:40.370\nThey may actually, in my case,\nMike's a client of mine, I really\n\n152\n00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.090\ndon't want to be put into a position\nwhere I have to give up his information.\n\n153\n00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:48.210\nI think it should be you have to go to\nhim as the government go to him and\n\n154\n00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.390\nget that,\ndon’t ask me I had nothing to do with it.\n\n155\n00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.740\nI'm just hosting the data and\nI’m holding the key for him,\n\n156\n00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.900\nI am the business owner here,\nhe's the one doing it.\n\n157\n00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.710\nYou know so that puts me in\nan uncomfortable situation,\n\n158\n00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:03.230\nthere are cloud service providers\nthat have had to deal with that.\n\n159\n00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:07.410\nYou know it's not something that we're\njust, oh let's make up the scenario.\n\n160\n00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.100\nIt has already happened, and\n\n161\n00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.600\nit puts you in a very uncomfortable\nsituation as the cloud services provider\n\n162\n00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.000\nas well as it gives you something to\nreally think about as the customer.\n\n163\n00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.570\nYou know, Mike would need to think\nabout that if he's coming to me as like\n\n164\n00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:20.980\nwhat could happen?\n\n165\n00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:26.590\nIf I got served, if I'm hosting\nthis pirated content up here,\n\n166\n00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:28.720\nam I going to be able\nblock a search warrant?\n\n167\n00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.680\nIf he's thinking ahead on it,\nhe's going to block a search warrant,\n\n168\n00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.270\nhe could, if they went to him,\nhe could do some stuff to fight it.\n\n169\n00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:37.040\nMaybe not ultimately block,\nbut you could delay it and\n\n170\n00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.660\ndo all these delaying tactics.\n\n171\n00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.790\nIn my case, as a source provider,\nthey could very easily lean on me and\n\n172\n00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:46.400\nsay, you gotta give this stuff up or\nwe're gonna shut down your business, and\n\n173\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.500\nwe're gonna hold you in contempt,\nand we're gonna find you.\n\n174\n00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.490\nIt may not be a battle\nthat I want to get into,\n\n175\n00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.260\nputs me in a very uncomfortable situation.\n\n176\n00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.840\nBecause I am now in a situation where I've\ngot a customer that I've got a contract\n\n177\n00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.240\nwith, that they're paying me and trusting\nme to do all this stuff, as Mike would be.\n\n178\n00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.120\nBut I got the government\n\n179\n00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.210\non this side telling me that\nI have to give this stuff up.\n\n180\n00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.310\nI'm caught in the middle.\n\n181\n00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.680\nI don't wanna be there,\n\n182\n00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.810\nnow cloud service providers have\nfound a way to deal with that.\n\n183\n00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:16.290\nOne of their tactics to deal\nwith it is to just say.\n\n184\n00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.470\nIf we're talking this situation.\n\n185\n00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:23.115\nMike comes to me as a customer and\nI being that cloud's service provider,\n\n186\n00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:24.985\nI just tell them, all right,\nyeah, you can host your stuff.\n\n187\n00:11:24.985 --> 00:11:29.445\nI support such and such encryption\nstrengths with my technology.\n\n188\n00:11:29.445 --> 00:11:33.295\nAnd I tell them that, once he\ngenerates a key, if he asks me, well,\n\n189\n00:11:33.295 --> 00:11:37.975\nI don't really want to keep control of the\nkey just because of how sensitive it is.\n\n190\n00:11:37.975 --> 00:11:40.865\nI want to make sure someone's really\nbacking it up and taking care of it.\n\n191\n00:11:40.865 --> 00:11:43.390\nI don't want to have to worry about that.\n\n192\n00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:48.010\nI could turn around and say I don't offer\nany service to do a key escrow for you.\n\n193\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:52.880\nOnce you generate a key, you generate\nthat key, you're gonna export it out and\n\n194\n00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.640\nyou're keeping it.\n\n195\n00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.970\nThat's it.\nI will not keep control of that key.\n\n196\n00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.300\nIt's wiped from my system.\n\n197\n00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.700\nOnce it's generated it's wiped from my\nsystem and it's in your possession.\n\n198\n00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.680\nSo now in the same scenario if a search\nwarrant's issued and they come to me and\n\n199\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.720\nsay, hey Sean you gotta give us\nMike's stuff and his encryption key.\n\n200\n00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.850\nI can give you his data if that's\nwhat you really want, but lo and\n\n201\n00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:16.890\nbehold Mike's chosen\nan encryption standard\n\n202\n00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:22.370\nthat's really strong like AES plus maybe\na thousand-bit encryption key let's say,\n\n203\n00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.170\nthey're not gonna break\nthat without going to him.\n\n204\n00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.870\nNow they've gotta serve him\ndirectly a search warrant.\n\n205\n00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.710\nAnd so he now knows that\nthis stuff is happening, and\n\n206\n00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:33.610\nhe can engage his lawyers or\nwhatever else.\n\n207\n00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.760\nSomething that I'm not\nnecessarily gonna do.\n\n208\n00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.360\nAnd like I said,\nthat scenario's played out and\n\n209\n00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.780\nI remember hearing about it only\nmaybe six, seven months ago that\n\n210\n00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.980\nthey had an ISP that just finally said,\nno more, we're not doing this.\n\n211\n00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.450\nApparently they got approached\nwith it once and said,\n\n212\n00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:51.930\nthere's gonna be no more of this.\n\n213\n00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.830\nThey just said as far as\nthem holding the keys,\n\n214\n00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.680\nthey were done with that part of things.\n\n215\n00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.650\nThey said,\n\n216\n00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.770\nyou brought your own encryption,\nyou kept your own keys, and that's it.\n\n217\n00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:06.850\nThere was no way in heck they\ncould actually decrypt your data.\n\n218\n00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:11.100\nSo they would say, from then on out,\nthat said that if they had any legal,\n\n219\n00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.950\nthey made it well know that there's\nany legal requests to do stuff,\n\n220\n00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.270\nthere was no hope in hell that they\ncould go through and decrypt your data.\n\n221\n00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.270\nThey said that was done.\n\n222\n00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.250\nThey said they had to go to you.\n\n223\n00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.730\nThey had to inform you as the customer\ndirectly and that was the end of it.\n\n224\n00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:30.020\n>> You know you said that you're going to\nget pressure, kind of in between wanting\n\n225\n00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.980\nto keep your customer happy, and\nyou have wanting to comply with the law,\n\n226\n00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:39.720\nand kind of almost on\nthe same side of the laws.\n\n227\n00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.320\nThe risk of the customers you have.\n\n228\n00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:46.130\nYou want that loyalty to you customer, but\nyou also can't say I'm gonna protect this\n\n229\n00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.090\ncustomer at the expense of\nevery other customer I have.\n\n230\n00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:52.020\nBecause if the law shuts me down,\nnow I've lost all my business.\n\n231\n00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.530\nSo, really touch spot for the provider,\n\n232\n00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.430\nsomething we've got to think about\nWhere we're going after the cloud, so.\n\n233\n00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.820\nAnd then you also talk about keys per\nuser, how does that come into play here.\n\n234\n00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.575\n>> Yeah, you could definitely have that\nwhere they're issues where the data's\n\n235\n00:14:06.575 --> 00:14:08.747\nbeing accessed on a per user basis.\n\n236\n00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:13.291\nAnd so I think of something, like to\ngive everyone something they can easily\n\n237\n00:14:13.291 --> 00:14:17.540\nidentify and sink there teeth into,\nthink of something like.\n\n238\n00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.950\nThe encrypted file system\nthat you have in Windows,\n\n239\n00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:23.980\nis that you can have everything\nstored in the same file system.\n\n240\n00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.590\nBut if someone chooses\nto encrypt those files,\n\n241\n00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:32.050\nunless they use a mechanism to allow\nsomeone else to decrypt, it's their files.\n\n242\n00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:33.290\nThey're the only ones that can open it.\n\n243\n00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:36.160\nYou can see that they're stored there but\nyou can't touch them.\n\n244\n00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.760\nSo that could be a way of\ngetting a little more granular\n\n245\n00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:46.330\ncontrol over data and so\nto say I'm gonna encrypt this whole blob.\n\n246\n00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:49.280\nNo that whole blob may be encrypted,\n\n247\n00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.930\nbut an application accesses it and\ndecrypts it and does stuff.\n\n248\n00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.270\nBut once that application decrypts it,\n\n249\n00:14:56.270 --> 00:15:01.040\nwho can access stuff inside of it\nis now based on a per user basis.\n\n250\n00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.480\nSo that can be another\nway of handling that.\n\n251\n00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:09.550\nAnd like I said the best analogy of that\nis thinking of something like EFS which is\n\n252\n00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:12.870\na prime example of that scenario.\n\n253\n00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:16.790\nAnd then how does tokenization\nrelate to all of this?\n\n254\n00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.360\n>> Tokenization goes to, and tokenization.\n\n255\n00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.140\nI put tokenization masking,\nanonymization, and all that stuff.\n\n256\n00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.040\nThat goes down,\nthat's another part of the per user\n\n257\n00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:31.670\nkey situation where you're signing them,\nyou know attach it to their user tokens,\n\n258\n00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.560\nor stuff like that,\nthat's where you're doing it,\n\n259\n00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.480\ninstead of just giving it just\nrandomly assigned to their account.\n\n260\n00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:41.020\nNow you're actually just assigning it to\na token that's being carried with their\n\n261\n00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.077\naccount when the access something.\n\n262\n00:15:43.077 --> 00:15:48.118\nAnd it can be even taken out to another\nlevel when you start having multiple\n\n263\n00:15:48.118 --> 00:15:52.927\napplications, and you start bringing\nthat identity management in.\n\n264\n00:15:52.927 --> 00:15:55.157\nIt can actually start\nmanaging those tokens and\n\n265\n00:15:55.157 --> 00:15:57.508\npass them between applications and\nall that too.\n\n266\n00:15:57.508 --> 00:16:00.126\nSo that's where that kinda comes in.\n\n267\n00:16:00.126 --> 00:16:04.339\nThe masking and all that starts taking it\nto the next level, where you can actually\n\n268\n00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:08.240\nstart blocking what applications and\nservices can actually use that.\n\n269\n00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.920\nYou may not wanna allow those encryption\nkeys to be used in every place.\n\n270\n00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:18.020\nSo there's a lot of little things that\ncan occur as a part of using encryption.\n\n271\n00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:22.810\nAnd trust me,\nwe're only touching that top,\n\n272\n00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:27.180\nreally just touching that top part of it.\n\n273\n00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:31.130\nI have encouraged you as we've gone\nthrough this cloud course that if you're\n\n274\n00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:37.420\nnot somebody that is not comfortable with\nencryption, we do have that, the several\n\n275\n00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:43.110\nhours here in the ITPro library on\ncryptography that Mike and I did.\n\n276\n00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:46.730\nThat if you really wanna get into the kind\nof the nuts and bolts and mechanics of it,\n\n277\n00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:48.950\nthat give you a better understanding.\n\n278\n00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:53.890\nBut barring that you go through that,\nthere's a lot of options.\n\n279\n00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:57.080\nYou're gonna wanna familiarize yourself\nwith the different things that come in.\n\n280\n00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.700\nAnd there's even, we look at encryption.\n\n281\n00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.800\nThere's the technical side, but\nbecause of the way encryption is, you\n\n282\n00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.680\nalso have the policy side and the legal\nside that really comes into play too,\n\n283\n00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.490\nwhich is something that most IT\npeople are not as familiar with.\n\n284\n00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:18.390\nAs you can understand that there is\na legal requirement to use encryption.\n\n285\n00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:24.700\nThat most of us get, it's more than just\nbeing smart about it and using encryption.\n\n286\n00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:29.010\nIt's actually what levels\nof encryption you can use,\n\n287\n00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:32.270\nwhich ones are acceptable and\nwhere you can use them.\n\n288\n00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.450\nThere are places where you can not use\n\n289\n00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:39.152\ncertain levels of encryption just\nbecause they are barred by law.\n\n290\n00:17:39.152 --> 00:17:44.300\nIf you're here in the US, and we're\nnot the only ones who do that do this,\n\n291\n00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:46.330\nyou can go to other countries and\nhave this.\n\n292\n00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:50.990\nThey actually bar the use of certain\ncryptography in certain locations\n\n293\n00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:56.455\nbecause it actually falls under\nthe same heading as munitions.\n\n294\n00:17:56.455 --> 00:17:59.995\nSelling weapons and\nstuff like that to another party, or\n\n295\n00:17:59.995 --> 00:18:03.355\nto a hostile country or whatever.\n\n296\n00:18:03.355 --> 00:18:05.435\nIt falls under the exact same banner, so\n\n297\n00:18:05.435 --> 00:18:07.765\nyou definitely have to\nbe careful with that.\n\n298\n00:18:07.765 --> 00:18:12.705\nUsually providers will be aware of that\nbecause they're the ones that'll also\n\n299\n00:18:12.705 --> 00:18:16.700\nget hit pretty hard for offering it\nin places where they shouldn't be.\n\n300\n00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:20.670\nBut if you happen to be one that's\njust having them do that shim,\n\n301\n00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:24.270\nthat basic stuff, and you're\nimplementing encryption on top of that,\n\n302\n00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:26.370\nnow that gets pushed off over to you.\n\n303\n00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.970\nWe talked about responsibilities,\n\n304\n00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:32.430\nour responsibilities versus\ntheir responsibilities.\n\n305\n00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:36.690\nIf you're doing the encryption, the ISP\ncan say, we're just providing this part,\n\n306\n00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:39.670\neverything from here on\nup that's on the client.\n\n307\n00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:43.470\nSo a State Department or\nwhoever comes in and\n\n308\n00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.620\nsays hey,\nyou're not supposed to be using that.\n\n309\n00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.350\nThey're going to say okay,\nyeah we're gonna go over there and\n\n310\n00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.820\nhave a nice talking to with these people.\n\n311\n00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.820\nAnd tell them what the consequences\nof doing this are.\n\n312\n00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.460\nAnd the consequences\nare gonna be pretty steep.\n\n313\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:03.940\nSome of the biggest challenges you have\nwith that, or when you start having data\n\n314\n00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.922\ndispersed over very large areas through\ndifferent cloud hosting services and\n\n315\n00:19:08.922 --> 00:19:11.980\nfacilities, you start crossing borders and\n\n316\n00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.960\nother boundaries that could\ndefinitely have an impact.\n\n317\n00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.280\nUsually within a country,\n\n318\n00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:21.290\na single country, once you know,\nit becomes pretty easy.\n\n319\n00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.640\nBut once you start moving\nout of a country and\n\n320\n00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.540\ncrossing borders,\nthen it starts clouding the issue a bit.\n\n321\n00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:34.080\nI'd say for the most part if\nyou are somebody that is doing\n\n322\n00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:38.830\nbusiness with different countries, and\nyou're using the cloud across different\n\n323\n00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:43.080\ncountries, probably for the most part, any\nplace where you're doing business you're\n\n324\n00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.860\nprobably not gonna have a real\nbig concerns with that.\n\n325\n00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.470\nYou're gonna keep an eye on it, but\n\n326\n00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:55.175\nit's not gonna be really, really, really\nbig concerns because the cryptography and\n\n327\n00:19:55.175 --> 00:19:59.940\ncryptographic controls export licenses,\nthough it had been relaxed.\n\n328\n00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.580\nBut if you happen to be someone that\nis doing business in some of these\n\n329\n00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.600\ncountries that are put on\ncertain watch lists and\n\n330\n00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:10.960\nstuff like that, then it's gonna\nchange issues for you dramatically.\n\n331\n00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:16.120\nBut I also think that heck, if you're\none of those countries on a watch list,\n\n332\n00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.100\nyou're probably not watching\nthis right now anyways.\n\n333\n00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.325\nThat would be a whole\ndifferent matter there.\n\n334\n00:20:22.325 --> 00:20:25.570\nYou'd have a whole different set\nof legal concerns there too.\n\n335\n00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:29.490\nThe one that's kind of interesting me on\nthis right now when I think about little\n\n336\n00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.700\nconcerns and this is not something\nthat's gonna come up on the exam,\n\n337\n00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.720\nbut it's something that would be kind of a\nreal world scenario that makes me kind of\n\n338\n00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:43.410\nthink is,\nwe're normalizing relations with Cuba.\n\n339\n00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:47.310\nWe're in the process of doing that so,\nwe have businesses pushing in there,\n\n340\n00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.120\nUS businesses starting to\npush in there and do things.\n\n341\n00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:54.140\nCuba was one of those places before where\na cryptography of certain strengths\n\n342\n00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:54.850\nwas not gonna go.\n\n343\n00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.130\nIt was on a watch list before.\n\n344\n00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.420\nIt was on the list here in the US.\n\n345\n00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.580\nSo, it'd be interesting if any of you\nhacker actually push it into Cuba and\n\n346\n00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:11.340\ndoing business with them, yeah that\nstuff is allowed now, those relations\n\n347\n00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:16.230\nare getting normalized all the time,\nwell, are more normalized all the time.\n\n348\n00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:20.300\nIt'd be interesting scenario for\nyou to see how that's gonna impact you.\n\n349\n00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.060\nBecause they used to have those things but\n\n350\n00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.350\nnow those are being,\nthose things are being relaxed,\n\n351\n00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.930\nyou may still have a concern there if\nyou're starting to do business over there.\n\n352\n00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:33.070\nSo, that's just something that came\nto mind I haven't looked into it cuz\n\n353\n00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.650\nI haven't had deal with it.\n\n354\n00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:38.030\nAs of this point I haven't\nhad to deal with it,\n\n355\n00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:39.810\nwho knows if I will in the future.\n\n356\n00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.810\nBut it's something that does\nbring up an interesting point.\n\n357\n00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.820\nSometimes when they take someone off\na list, it's just, hey, takes a little bit\n\n358\n00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.620\nand then they just open the doors and\nsay, okay, all this stuff is fine.\n\n359\n00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.440\nBut in some cases they\ncan limit it a bit more.\n\n360\n00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.680\nIt all really depends.\n\n361\n00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.800\n>> And I understand why the countries\nare a little more obvious, but\n\n362\n00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.230\nwasn't France on our list for awhile?\n\n363\n00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.320\nI don't know if they still are as far\nas encryption algorithms together.\n\n364\n00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.860\nDo you know off hand?\n\n365\n00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.140\nI know for awhile it was you\ncouldn't use anything over 256.\n\n366\n00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:07.820\nIf I'm not mistaken.\n\n367\n00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.425\n>> I don't know the answer to that one,\nI surrender.\n\n368\n00:22:09.425 --> 00:22:09.980\n[LAUGH] I'm sorry.\n\n369\n00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:14.872\n>> Now would it be more of a-\n>> France could have been,\n\n370\n00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:20.890\nI know there were some people that\nwere kind of conspicuous at one point.\n\n371\n00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.240\n>> Yeah like China,\nNorth Korea, those things.\n\n372\n00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.300\nAs far as the US government goes,\nthose might be a little obvious.\n\n373\n00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.002\nBut there might be a couple that aren't so\nobvious, so\n\n374\n00:22:28.002 --> 00:22:29.494\nit's definitely something\nyou gotta look at.\n\n375\n00:22:29.494 --> 00:22:34.257\nNow if, let's say I've got data, and I am\nbouncing around between these countries,\n\n376\n00:22:34.257 --> 00:22:38.497\nwould I look at encrypting it with one\nstrength while the data is stored here,\n\n377\n00:22:38.497 --> 00:22:41.954\nencrypting it with a different\nstrength if it goes over there,\n\n378\n00:22:41.954 --> 00:22:45.346\nor do I have to kind of compromise\nacross the entire board, and\n\n379\n00:22:45.346 --> 00:22:49.570\ndrop everything down,\nbecause I do business in that one country?\n\n380\n00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.090\nCould I do it either way?\n\n381\n00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:55.790\n>> I'm gonna tell you once again that\nthat's a hell of a loaded question.\n\n382\n00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:59.163\nBecause it's gonna be a question for\nthe lawyers.\n\n383\n00:22:59.163 --> 00:23:03.720\nIt’s gonna be lawyers and it's gonna be a\nquestion of compromise, or you may have to\n\n384\n00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:09.130\ncome up with some funky solution\nwhere you got data in one place and\n\n385\n00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:12.290\nthen the same data mirrored in another\nplace, but encrypted differently.\n\n386\n00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:16.210\nYou might have have to do that,\nand then there's exceptions,\n\n387\n00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:22.110\nthe State Department here in the US\ncan grant exceptions to things.\n\n388\n00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.600\nYou have to go through them, but\n\n389\n00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.910\nthey can very well say,\nyeah you're granted an exception.\n\n390\n00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:31.820\nOne that I think of,\nthat's happened for a long time\n\n391\n00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:36.440\nis there was a point in time where,\nin the 90s those of you that were around\n\n392\n00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:41.400\ndoing the stuff in the 90s in IT, I know\nyou've been around doing this for a while.\n\n393\n00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:46.840\nRemember how they used to have the 56\nbit encryption patches for Windows?\n\n394\n00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.958\nAnd then there was the high\nsecurity 128 bit one?\n\n395\n00:23:49.958 --> 00:23:55.681\nSo the 56 bit was approved for everywhere\nin the US that Microsoft released,\n\n396\n00:23:55.681 --> 00:24:00.623\nthe 128 bit would only be allowed\nto To be used here on US shores but\n\n397\n00:24:00.623 --> 00:24:03.730\nthat was the blanket statement.\n\n398\n00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:08.345\nThere were exceptions to that, the one\nthat I think of immediately is if you,\n\n399\n00:24:08.345 --> 00:24:13.113\nin our case would be US Embassies,\nmilitary, it's military stuff like that.\n\n400\n00:24:13.113 --> 00:24:18.412\nThey would be allowed even though they're\nbased in different we have basis and\n\n401\n00:24:18.412 --> 00:24:21.420\nstuff like that in different countries.\n\n402\n00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:26.020\nThey would be granted exceptions to\nthat because that's a US facility,\n\n403\n00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.340\neven though it's someplace else,\nit's a US facility wherever.\n\n404\n00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:34.961\nSo the State Department would obviously\nwould say okay that's not an issue and\n\n405\n00:24:34.961 --> 00:24:37.660\nthat would be documented accordingly.\n\n406\n00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.860\nThe IT people and all that that would\nbeing doing stuff with those overseas\n\n407\n00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:46.602\nfacilities that as people working with\nthose they would have certain exceptions,\n\n408\n00:24:46.602 --> 00:24:51.073\nbut they couldn't distribute those\nservice packs to non U.S. owned systems\n\n409\n00:24:51.073 --> 00:24:55.359\nwithout some consequences, or\nat least special permission being given.\n\n410\n00:24:55.359 --> 00:25:01.434\nSo that situation doesn't happen anymore,\nkind of shows you how things have changed,\n\n411\n00:25:01.434 --> 00:25:07.196\nbecause we used to have the 56 bit and\nthe 128 bit encryption, service packs.\n\n412\n00:25:07.196 --> 00:25:10.052\nYou don't see those anymore\nthat's why I have to sit here and\n\n413\n00:25:10.052 --> 00:25:13.748\ntell you hey well those of you who have\nbeen around long enough may remember that\n\n414\n00:25:13.748 --> 00:25:17.165\nbecause they stopped doing that I\nbelieve in the early days of 2000.\n\n415\n00:25:17.165 --> 00:25:18.561\nThey stopped doing that\nwith service packs.\n\n416\n00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:22.730\nThey consolidate them all into one,\nwhat use to be called a service pack and\n\n417\n00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:26.304\nthe high security service pack,\nis now called a service pack and\n\n418\n00:25:26.304 --> 00:25:29.100\nit all uses the same level of encryption.\n\n419\n00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.395\nAnd the reason being that the controls\n\n420\n00:25:32.395 --> 00:25:36.895\nduring the Clinton Administration\nactually were lax on the export controls.\n\n421\n00:25:36.895 --> 00:25:40.585\nSo, we don't have to worry about, oh,\nwell those things are gonna be allowed,\n\n422\n00:25:40.585 --> 00:25:44.405\nthese things allowed, these things\nnot allowed, so on and so forth.\n\n423\n00:25:44.405 --> 00:25:46.955\nSo they kinda relaxed it a bit,\nwhich is great for\n\n424\n00:25:46.955 --> 00:25:49.580\nus that are implementing IT solutions.\n\n425\n00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.940\nBecause if you tried to do the same\nthing in the environment that\n\n426\n00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:58.790\nexisted in the 90s with encryption,\nyeah it was gonna be a nightmare.\n\n427\n00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.750\nYou were gonna have a lot of lawyers, and\n\n428\n00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:03.990\na lot of heads coming together\nsaying how are we gonna compromise.\n\n429\n00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.190\nLike Mike was saying, how do you do that?\n\n430\n00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:11.830\nIf you have here and here and here,\nhow do you figure what encryption?\n\n431\n00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:13.920\nDo you compromise and use different ones?\n\n432\n00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.420\nYeah, it's like I said,\nthat's a loaded question.\n\n433\n00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.250\nI wasn't kidding,\nthat was a hell of a loaded question.\n\n434\n00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:23.954\nBecause of the fact that there's so\nmany different ways to approach that and\n\n435\n00:26:23.954 --> 00:26:29.000\nmake a solution, that I can't just say,\noh yeah, here's the solution to it.\n\n436\n00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.350\nThere's not just one solution,\nthere's a lot of solutions on the table,\n\n437\n00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:36.550\nthat you can get creative with, and\nmake up to get something out of that.\n\n438\n00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.410\nSo encryption can be\na very very tricky thing,\n\n439\n00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:43.360\nthat's why I recommend that you know it,\nknow the strengths, know the terminology.\n\n440\n00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:48.500\nAnd then that will help you ask\nquestions of your service provider,\n\n441\n00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:53.060\nor questions of your application developer\nwhen you're doing deployment to the cloud,\n\n442\n00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:56.250\nespecially in that\nmultinational type situation.\n\n443\n00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.760\nIf you're here in the US or all within\none country, that's where all your\n\n444\n00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:04.500\nbusinesses are restricted,\na lot of those concerns go away.\n\n445\n00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.290\nBut as soon as you start crossing\nstuff then the legal stuff\n\n446\n00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.362\nstarts becoming a big problem.\n\n447\n00:27:09.362 --> 00:27:11.180\n>> All right well Sean\na lot of great information.\n\n448\n00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:15.000\nAny parting thoughts before\nwe wrap this one up?\n\n449\n00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.247\n>> Yeah, watch the cryptography course.\n\n450\n00:27:16.247 --> 00:27:17.563\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What are you doing?\n\n451\n00:27:17.563 --> 00:27:19.141\n>> [LAUGH] Then come back and join us.\n\n452\n00:27:19.141 --> 00:27:20.455\n>> Yeah.\n\n453\n00:27:20.455 --> 00:27:21.540\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n454\n00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.250\nWell ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed watching this one.\n\n455\n00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.620\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n456\n00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.620\n>> And I'm Sean

00:00:15.230\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.040\nWIth me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.415\nIn this episode, Sean, we're gonna\nbe taking a look at IdEA, right?\n\n6\n00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:25.820\nIdentity, entitlement and\naccess management.\n\n7\n00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.570\nWe've talked a little bit about\nthis concept already, but\n\n8\n00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.620\nnow we're going to take a look\nat it from another angle.\n\n9\n00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.911\n>> That's really what we're doing here, is\nwe're trying to kind of expand this out.\n\n10\n00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:41.738\nBecause we talked a little bit about\nidentity access management before and\n\n11\n00:00:41.738 --> 00:00:44.145\nentitlement and all that nonsense.\n\n12\n00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:46.930\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, so that's why I said nonsense.\n\n13\n00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.240\n>> All that nonsense that's\ngonna be on the exam, you know.\n\n14\n00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.940\n>> It's nonsense to me cause\nI have the credential,\n\n15\n00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.480\nI don't care [LAUGH].\n\n16\n00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.260\nLook at that customer service\n\n17\n00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.671\nthere [LAUGH]\n>> Again the views expressed by\n\n18\n00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:05.720\nSean Oriyano are not shared by IT Pro TV.\n\n19\n00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.130\n>> Yeah we're gonna put that in in post.\n\n20\n00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.388\nI think we should get a shirt\n\n21\n00:01:13.388 --> 00:01:19.150\nmeme for me for that.\n\n22\n00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.485\nThere's a lot going on here,\nI joke around and call it nonsense,\n\n23\n00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:29.940\nbut it is actually very important,\nbecause it's a core thing that allows you\n\n24\n00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.650\nto control access it and overall\nmanage it and do all that good stuff.\n\n25\n00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.730\nIt's very, very important to have this.\n\n26\n00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.710\nOtherwise, you've got two choices, to give\neveryone access or give no one access.\n\n27\n00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.010\nAnd that's not what you want.\n\n28\n00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.293\nYou want something more\ngranular than that.\n\n29\n00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:52.320\nSo, the question is, kind of,\nwhat options do you have?\n\n30\n00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.500\nAnd also introduce some terms here\nthat you are gonna see in the exam,\n\n31\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.550\nyou may not see as much\noutside of the exam.\n\n32\n00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.070\nBut we're gonna talk about here\nto make sure you are clear.\n\n33\n00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.750\n>> And it really does break down to, I'm\nlooking at it saying all right, I've got\n\n34\n00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.260\nto prove something or I've got to validate\nor figure out who somebody is first.\n\n35\n00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.340\nAnd then for entitlement,\n\n36\n00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.070\nas you said previously,\nwe can think about it as permission.\n\n37\n00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.880\nSo if I can know who you are, and\n\n38\n00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.570\nI know what permissions you have,\nnow I can control your access.\n\n39\n00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.580\nSo that's basically what it comes down to.\n\n40\n00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.112\nAnd again,\nentitlement instead of permissions\n\n41\n00:02:33.112 --> 00:02:37.515\nbecause IP doesn't make the same acronym,\nright.\n\n42\n00:02:37.515 --> 00:02:39.435\n>> Yeah, it doesn't sound right.\n\n43\n00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:42.582\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> IPA is something else, ain't it?\n\n44\n00:02:42.582 --> 00:02:43.689\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly [LAUGH]\n\n45\n00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:44.710\n>> [LAUGH] That's a lot I'm\n\n46\n00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.607\ngoing for on a Friday night.\n\n47\n00:02:45.607 --> 00:02:48.887\nBut the same concepts that we have to\ndeal with in our traditional network\n\n48\n00:02:48.887 --> 00:02:52.700\nenvironment where I have accounts that we\nlog in with so now I know who you are.\n\n49\n00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.070\nI've got resources that I control with\npermissions so I can control who has what\n\n50\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.990\nlevel of access to it, and then some\nsystem to put that in place like NTFS.\n\n51\n00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.100\nSo we got the same concept, we're just now\ntaking it out to the cloud environment.\n\n52\n00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.510\n>> Yeah that's really what it is\nwhen you talk about it locally.\n\n53\n00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.830\nOn most systems, the identity\naccess management system is gonna,\n\n54\n00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.550\nin the Windows world at least, is gonna\nbe something like Active Directory.\n\n55\n00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.360\nAnd that's something for us, easy to\nunderstand, and sink our teeth into.\n\n56\n00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.060\nIt's when we start moving outside of\nthat and have different services and\n\n57\n00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.700\ndifferent vendors, and they have their\nown deal on whatever's going on.\n\n58\n00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.290\nSo if we integrate them this becomes\nmuch more of a sticky issue.\n\n59\n00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.620\nAnd yeah for\n\n60\n00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.190\nall intents and purposes, yeah to borrow\nthat term from a few moments ago, yeah,\n\n61\n00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.140\nit can be or it can seem like a lot\nof nonsense when you get into it.\n\n62\n00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.170\nBecause there's gonna be so\nmany things that confuse you, so\n\n63\n00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.410\nmany things that just seem like\nthey matter but don't matter.\n\n64\n00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.290\nThey really are just kinda\nnonsense at the end of the day.\n\n65\n00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.510\nWhat you need to thing about at high\nlevel is let's break out of just\n\n66\n00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.720\nsimply being an Active Directory\nenvironment.\n\n67\n00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.080\nI'm going to assume that probably\nmost of you have experience with\n\n68\n00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.650\nActive Directory that are viewing this.\n\n69\n00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.590\nIf you don't,\nwe've got courses here at IT Pro for\n\n70\n00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.180\nthat and that you could even see probably\n\n71\n00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.910\njust the beginning of it to get kind of\nan overview of what Active Directory is.\n\n72\n00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.010\nBut in any case, Active Directory I\nsaid does the management and\n\n73\n00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.420\ncontrols the stuff on a local network or\na corporate network, it does that.\n\n74\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.600\nBut once we start expanding\nout to the cloud and\n\n75\n00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.710\nwe don't necessarily have that homogenous\nenvironment that Active Directory brings.\n\n76\n00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.790\nIt's great if everything's 100%\nActive Directory then hey, that's great.\n\n77\n00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.870\nMakes it a lot easier.\n\n78\n00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.117\nBut once we start moving outside\nof that it starts becoming,\n\n79\n00:04:51.117 --> 00:04:52.780\nwe'll say more interesting.\n\n80\n00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.250\nIt becomes a lot more\ninteresting at that point.\n\n81\n00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:59.180\nOr exciting if you wanna\nlook at it that way.\n\n82\n00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.110\nSo that may require that you use something\nlike a Federated Service Technology,\n\n83\n00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.120\nand Microsoft's not the only\none that does that.\n\n84\n00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.970\nThat's not their term,\nthat's something that they adopted\n\n85\n00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.880\nto make it sound like other\nstandards that are out there.\n\n86\n00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.450\nSo you could have other places that do it.\n\n87\n00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.020\nAs a matter of fact,\n\n88\n00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.030\nif you decide that you just want to\nnot even mess with Federated Services.\n\n89\n00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.890\nBecause Mike, you and\n\n90\n00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.625\nI talked about Federated Services a bit\na few episodes ago, yesterday or whatever.\n\n91\n00:05:35.625 --> 00:05:36.620\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n92\n00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.430\n>> And you and I were both saying yeah,\nit does take a lot to set up.\n\n93\n00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.900\nThere's a lot involved to make it work.\n\n94\n00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.540\n>> There is a lot of infrastructure.\n\n95\n00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.120\nThis typically has gotta be done\non both sides of the puzzle.\n\n96\n00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.960\nIf you've got two companies that\nare trying to extend that authentication,\n\n97\n00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.830\nthat trust of authentication\nacross forest boundaries or\n\n98\n00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.000\nbetween organizations, yeah,\nboth sides have to set it up.\n\n99\n00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.380\nTypically at least I have my experiences\nwith Microsoft's Federation Services.\n\n100\n00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:11.690\nAnd, you create claims, which is kind of\na different way of doing authentication.\n\n101\n00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.930\nWe can create claims based on attributes.\n\n102\n00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.060\nWhich is really cool.\n\n103\n00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.270\nI mean, it does extend the functionality\nof the authentication.\n\n104\n00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.531\nWe can create a claim about somebody\nbased on any of their attributes in\n\n105\n00:06:22.531 --> 00:06:23.560\nActive Directory.\n\n106\n00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.430\nWhereas, prior to this we used\na token which had the SID,\n\n107\n00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.010\nthe S-I-D, of your user account and\nof the groups you belong to.\n\n108\n00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.230\nWell, with claims,\nwe start integrating that stuff,\n\n109\n00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.760\nI can add to your token a thing that says,\nwell your favorite color is blue, right?\n\n110\n00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.520\nAnd the other side of the equation, can\nthen control access based on that claim.\n\n111\n00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.805\nThey could say,\nwell if a user comes in and\n\n112\n00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:49.530\ntheir favorite color is blue,\nI'm going to give them this much access.\n\n113\n00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.210\nBut if they come in and a claim about\nthat user, that identity says their\n\n114\n00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.250\nfavorite color is red, then I'm going\nto increase their access to this level.\n\n115\n00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.420\nSo it does expand that\nability that we have and\n\n116\n00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.500\nit gives us the ability again to\nprovide that single sign-on, right?\n\n117\n00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.680\nBecause without Federation I can't\nlog on with my work account and\n\n118\n00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.670\ngo to some other company's web app and\ntry to gain access\n\n119\n00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.360\nbecause my identity has been\nauthenticated by my domain controller.\n\n120\n00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.760\nIt's not going to be\ntrusted on that other side.\n\n121\n00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.510\nThey're going to look at that token and\ngo.\n\n122\n00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.790\nI don't know who authenticated this.\n\n123\n00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.216\nI'm not gonna trust it.\n\n124\n00:07:23.216 --> 00:07:25.090\nWhen we set up Federation,\nreally, what we're doing is,\n\n125\n00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:30.406\nwe're saying, I'm gonna trust this other\norganization's authentication process.\n\n126\n00:07:30.406 --> 00:07:34.880\nAnd now I can take my credentials that\nI've been authenticated with here, and\n\n127\n00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.550\ngo across those boundaries and\nnot have to sign on again.\n\n128\n00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.670\nWithout it, they'd have to make a separate\naccount for me on their system.\n\n129\n00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:46.476\nThat I would have to log onto my work\naccount, connect to their web app,\n\n130\n00:07:46.476 --> 00:07:49.014\nand then remember another\nset of credentials to\n\n131\n00:07:49.014 --> 00:07:52.136\nauthenticate to that web app\nthat was maintained by them.\n\n132\n00:07:52.136 --> 00:07:56.517\nAnytime my organization wanted to add\na new person to gain access to their web\n\n133\n00:07:56.517 --> 00:08:01.035\napp, or change my level of access to their\nweb app, I'd have to call them up and\n\n134\n00:08:01.035 --> 00:08:02.488\nthey would have to do it.\n\n135\n00:08:02.488 --> 00:08:03.765\nFederation services.\n\n136\n00:08:03.765 --> 00:08:08.000\nThey can manage all of that independent\nof the identities on my end.\n\n137\n00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.690\nSo it keeps the control on either side.\n\n138\n00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.970\nIt's really a fantastic thing.\n\n139\n00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:15.460\nAnd I know Microsoft provides\ncloud based federation services so\n\n140\n00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.430\nthat we can remove some\nof that complexity.\n\n141\n00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.460\nWe don't have to set up\nthe federation services on our end,\n\n142\n00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.310\nwe can use Microsoft's cloud\nbased federation services.\n\n143\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.430\nAgain though,\nmy experience is all with Microsoft so\n\n144\n00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.090\nI don't know about some of the other\nsolutions, but general idea.\n\n145\n00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:34.980\n>> Yeah, what Mike just went through,\nit was a great\n\n146\n00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:40.410\ndescription of the technology and\nwithin the concepts behind it.\n\n147\n00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:43.380\nI mean you could actually,\nfor what Mike was saying,\n\n148\n00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.170\nas long as you strip out the stuff\nwith Microsoft and Active Directory,\n\n149\n00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.890\nyou got the idea what\na federated system does.\n\n150\n00:08:52.890 --> 00:09:00.160\nYou mentioned having the different\ncolors attached to someone's identity.\n\n151\n00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.070\nSo we have an identity.\n\n152\n00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.610\nWe can tack on extra attributes\nthat make sense in other systems.\n\n153\n00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.340\nSo that's a very powerful thing to have.\n\n154\n00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.510\nIt takes some work to set up but\n\n155\n00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:14.310\nit's a very powerful thing to have,\nas Mike's subscription showed.\n\n156\n00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:15.880\nIt's a very good thing to have.\n\n157\n00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:20.220\nCan make life a lot easier for you which\nis ultimately what we we wanna do.\n\n158\n00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.200\nYou don't wanna move into the cloud,\nand then say, oh, hey.\n\n159\n00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.890\nHere's all these great services.\n\n160\n00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:24.740\nAnd guess what?\n\n161\n00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.300\nYou got 15 different,\n16 different logins now.\n\n162\n00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.710\nThat's not helping anybody.\n\n163\n00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.500\nIt's gonna get a lot of\npeople,quite frankly,\n\n164\n00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.830\npissed off at you, because you just\nmade their life more difficult.\n\n165\n00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.170\n>> I mean, they're not gonna\nremember all those passwords, or\n\n166\n00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.920\nthey're gonna use the same\npassword across all accounts.\n\n167\n00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.950\nWhen they go to change one password,\nit doesn't change the other password,\n\n168\n00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:50.650\njust too many problems that that kind\nof system would bring into play.\n\n169\n00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.870\nAnd it's not just between\norganizations too.\n\n170\n00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.760\nLet me make sure you guys understand it.\n\n171\n00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.080\nI might have my internal stuff,\nmy local stuff, here might be one forest,\n\n172\n00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.950\nI might have a separate forest out in\nthe clouds, so maybe even my own stuff.\n\n173\n00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:05.620\nBut I want to provide my\nusers that single sign-on\n\n174\n00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.700\ncapability whether they're\naccessing local resources, or\n\n175\n00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.570\naccessing my cloud-based resources,\nwe can do that with that single sign-on.\n\n176\n00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.190\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n177\n00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:20.134\nHeck, we could say\nan example like I think of\n\n178\n00:10:20.134 --> 00:10:24.553\nthese large financial institutions.\n\n179\n00:10:24.553 --> 00:10:28.461\nThey've had technology adopted in\ntheir environments for a long time.\n\n180\n00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:32.493\nBecause as those financial\ninstitutions got bigger and\n\n181\n00:10:32.493 --> 00:10:37.468\nhad more accounts, and\nthey're in more investments and whatever,\n\n182\n00:10:37.468 --> 00:10:43.220\nto manage, they had to create their own\nsolutions and do so on and so forth.\n\n183\n00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.900\nWell, as they move to the modern world,\nyou get somebody like,\n\n184\n00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.220\nlet's say, and\nI'm just picking a name here.\n\n185\n00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:55.190\nLet's say we have something like Citibank,\nwhich Citibank over a span of years,\n\n186\n00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.150\nthey started gobbling up other companies.\n\n187\n00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.110\nAnd they went from being big to very,\nvery, very big.\n\n188\n00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.340\nSo you get someone of that size,\n\n189\n00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:09.370\nyou bet that not only do they have custom\nstuff in-house in the original size,\n\n190\n00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:14.150\nbut now they've acquired other things\nthat have their own stuff in there.\n\n191\n00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.410\nSo now they've got to integrate across\nall these things to make everything look\n\n192\n00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:20.510\nlike one big happy family,\nand make it all work nicely.\n\n193\n00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:25.230\nThey can't have people saying, okay, well,\nyou're working for the original size city\n\n194\n00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:30.090\nbank, but now we have additional entities\nthat we've purchased and merged with.\n\n195\n00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.290\nSo even though we're all\nunder the same umbrella,\n\n196\n00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:38.450\nwhat we want to do is we don't want to\nhave it so you're logging in over here,\n\n197\n00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.620\nand logging in over here with\na different set of credentials.\n\n198\n00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.280\nAnd logging in over here with\neven another set of credentials.\n\n199\n00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.188\nThey would use something like Federated\nServices to glue all those things together\n\n200\n00:11:49.188 --> 00:11:54.280\nfor the long-term or even the short-term\nas they started migrating stuff over.\n\n201\n00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.970\nYou could use it either way.\n\n202\n00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:59.410\nSo, the question is, is that who's\ngonna take responsibility for that.\n\n203\n00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.510\nIs it gonna be you?\n\n204\n00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:06.110\nI mean, if you're someone, again like\na Citibank that' may have had to\n\n205\n00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:10.260\ndo something like that where they gobbled\nup a bunch of companies and had that.\n\n206\n00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:12.830\nWell then, it may make sense for\nyou to do that.\n\n207\n00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:17.810\nIt's a big company, they can hire the\nexpertise to do that and glue it together.\n\n208\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:22.860\nBut, if you're a company that doesn't\nnecessarily want to invest in that.\n\n209\n00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:26.520\nHaving developers come in and have to\nlearn everything and glue it together.\n\n210\n00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.830\nYou could very well do something,\n\n211\n00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:32.960\nlike Mike was saying, you could\ngo to somebody like Microsoft and\n\n212\n00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.350\nthey do offer that service and\nthat means they've got that all set up.\n\n213\n00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:38.820\nIt doesn't mean it's easy.\n\n214\n00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.570\nIt's not, you know,\nnone of us are going to claim that,\n\n215\n00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.700\nare going to say oh, it's easy.\n\n216\n00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.510\nI don't think Microsoft is going to say,\nyeah plug it in, turn key,\n\n217\n00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.140\nwe're good, you know, no problem.\n\n218\n00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.765\nIt ain't and anyone that tells\nyou that is lying to you.\n\n219\n00:12:51.765 --> 00:12:55.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So it's not that easy but it's easier\n\n220\n00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.250\nthan having to set the whole thing up from\nscratch yourself and manage everything.\n\n221\n00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.770\nIt means that you just have to worry about\nselective parts of it so it limits it and\n\n222\n00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.510\nso you focus on that.\n\n223\n00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:07.260\nYou get everything glued together.\n\n224\n00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.210\nAnd then you just go on from there and\neverything works.\n\n225\n00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:15.260\nBut it is one more service you have to\nintegrate, but even though it's one more\n\n226\n00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.070\nservice you gotta bring and support and\nintegrate into your environment.\n\n227\n00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:23.530\nOn the other side of it the tradeoff is\nthat you don't have to do all of that\n\n228\n00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.310\nlocally now.\n\n229\n00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.710\nYou don't have more things to babysit.\n\n230\n00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.290\nYou can glue all these\ncloud services together.\n\n231\n00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:36.240\nSo it makes things tremendously\neasy in the scheme of things.\n\n232\n00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.068\nAnd that's what we're going for.\n\n233\n00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:40.640\nAnd count on the fact that\nif you use a cloud solution,\n\n234\n00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:45.140\nyou may very well run into\nFederated Services pretty quickly.\n\n235\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:50.020\nI recall when Microsoft first came out\nwith Federated Services, you were probably\n\n236\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.140\nin the same situation with your students\nwhen they came in doing those classes.\n\n237\n00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.390\nYou talked about it and they're all like,\nwell, why we would use this?\n\n238\n00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:02.420\nAnd you had to kind of make a scenario\nup and draw the nice pretty diagrams and\n\n239\n00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:07.380\nall that because it was kinda hard\nto find too many real situations.\n\n240\n00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.420\nYou knew they were out there and you had\nto go to Microsoft's case studies and\n\n241\n00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.020\nstuff like that to really get a good one.\n\n242\n00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.660\nBut you could explain it.\n\n243\n00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:19.260\nNow it's much more likely, you know,\nCloud has really pushed that out there.\n\n244\n00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.986\nYou know,\nespecially when you have different clouds,\n\n245\n00:14:22.986 --> 00:14:28.708\nmultiple cloud solutions and the like that\nare trying to glue all together like that.\n\n246\n00:14:28.708 --> 00:14:32.105\nIt becomes much more likely you're gonna\nhave to use something like that and\n\n247\n00:14:32.105 --> 00:14:34.810\nmaybe, just plain and simple,\npay someone else to do it.\n\n248\n00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.070\n>> The one thing that sticks out in my\nmind was from the Microsoft official\n\n249\n00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.270\ncurriculum.\n\n250\n00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.990\nThis drawing was describing\nthe communication path that was\n\n251\n00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:48.050\ngoing on when you went through Federation\nServices and were gaining access to this,\n\n252\n00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:53.600\nweb app on somebody else's forest, and\nit was the worst road map I've ever seen.\n\n253\n00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.840\nIt was amazingly complex.\n\n254\n00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.080\nBut as you said, very powerful.\n\n255\n00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.570\nIt really did give us that capability,\nwhich we really needed.\n\n256\n00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.634\nAnd we need it even moreso now because\nof the fact that we are doing things\n\n257\n00:15:06.634 --> 00:15:08.330\noutside of our boundaries.\n\n258\n00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.590\nThat forest is where all that\ntrust is all automatic, right?\n\n259\n00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:15.480\nWithin that forest,\nat least within Windows environments.\n\n260\n00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.140\nEasy to work with, a single sign on.\n\n261\n00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:23.150\nI mean, Active Directory gives us\nthat single sign on just by default,\n\n262\n00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.700\nbut as soon as we start\ncrossing forest boundaries\n\n263\n00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.510\nthat becomes a whole nother challenge.\n\n264\n00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:31.210\nAnd for\nawhile I know we've talked about it,\n\n265\n00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:34.870\nkind of joked around with I know David and\nsome others out there in the chat room,\n\n266\n00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.748\nabout how they're trying to create trust\nbetween forests and things like that.\n\n267\n00:15:38.748 --> 00:15:43.446\nFederation Services is the next\nevolution of that process.\n\n268\n00:15:43.446 --> 00:15:48.274\nWe don't have to create those same level\nof trust, we can just use the identity\n\n269\n00:15:48.274 --> 00:15:52.372\nfederation in Microsoft World\nFederation Services Complex, and\n\n270\n00:15:52.372 --> 00:15:57.365\nI was saying now with everything going\nbeyond our borders going out to the cloud.\n\n271\n00:15:57.365 --> 00:15:59.908\nOther organizations and\ntheir cloud deployments.\n\n272\n00:15:59.908 --> 00:16:02.300\nIt's a huge help.\n\n273\n00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:07.270\n>> Yeah I might very well nowadays\njust I'm deploying a big enough or\n\n274\n00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.240\ncomplex enough cloud solution,\n\n275\n00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.180\nI might decide unless I've got\na really compelling reason.\n\n276\n00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.010\nI might just flat out decide I'm\npushing that out to the cloud.\n\n277\n00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:19.820\nI'm gonna go to a cloud provider and\nsince I'm already in for all this,\n\n278\n00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.280\nI mean what the saying you're in for\npenny, you're in for pound.\n\n279\n00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:29.560\nYou might as well just get that additional\nservice, and use that to go through and\n\n280\n00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.340\nreally leverage one other thing in\nthe cloud to really make things work.\n\n281\n00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:39.710\nNow it is gonna seem like a lot of\na big mess initially going in and\n\n282\n00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.390\nreally complex, it's gonna seem like,\nin my favorite word, they're gonna throw\n\n283\n00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:49.160\na lot of nonsense at you along the way\nbut, there's the initial set up.\n\n284\n00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:54.350\nNo one here is gonna say, and I don't\nthink anyone out here, and any one of our\n\n285\n00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:59.640\nviewers or anyone watching this is gonna\nsay, oh, well it's too complex to set up.\n\n286\n00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.340\nNo, of course it's complex to set up.\n\n287\n00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.320\nBut the idea is the complexity, and\n\n288\n00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.790\nthe difficulty in setting it up a lot of\nthat can be alleviated via planning and\n\n289\n00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.778\nreally thinking things through and\nreally taking a lot of care.\n\n290\n00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:14.660\nOnce that's set up, it's seamless.\n\n291\n00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.380\nAsk anybody that's got federated\nservices going, ask them,\n\n292\n00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.350\ngo how tough was it to set up?\n\n293\n00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:25.270\nThey're probably gonna have nice,\nyou know a deal like this.\n\n294\n00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:28.310\nAnd it ain't gonna be shaved, either.\n\n295\n00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.790\nIt gonna really be smooth.\n\n296\n00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:34.230\nYou're gonna have people that are really\nlike that, but ask them, okay.\n\n297\n00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:35.170\nThe setup was tough.\n\n298\n00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:39.380\nThe setup took you several months or\na good amount of time to set up and\n\n299\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.790\nyou had to do your consultations,\ndevelopers.\n\n300\n00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:46.120\nAnd, there was headaches and\nlong nights and what have you.\n\n301\n00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.910\nBut after it was set up,\nask him what the situation's like.\n\n302\n00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:53.930\nMost situations that after they set\nit up and got their tweaking done,\n\n303\n00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.740\nthey're like oh works great now.\n\n304\n00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.890\nIt works really well and\nthat's we're looking for because.\n\n305\n00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:00.740\nReally the system.\n\n306\n00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.510\nYou got to think about system isn't really\nbuilt for you as the technical person,\n\n307\n00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:05.400\nthat's what I always like to say,\n\n308\n00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.950\nit's not built for you as the techie,\nthe IT person, the developer.\n\n309\n00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:11.590\nYeah, you're using it but\nit's build for someone.\n\n310\n00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.770\nYou know, it's usually built for\nan end user,\n\n311\n00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:15.550\nsomeone that doesn't need to\nworry about all this stuff.\n\n312\n00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:19.780\nAnd so if you get that all the stuff you\ninvest over here, all that blood, sweat,\n\n313\n00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.330\nand tears you're investing to set it up,\nit makes it a lot easier\n\n314\n00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:26.470\ncause they don't see the federate\nservices working back there.\n\n315\n00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.470\nThey don't see all these\ndifferent providers.\n\n316\n00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.692\nAll they know is they open up a console,\nan application, whatever it is and\n\n317\n00:18:32.692 --> 00:18:37.260\nthings work and they have access to all\nthis power, which is what we really want.\n\n318\n00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:41.850\n>> And once you get it setup, too, adding\nadditional business partners or other\n\n319\n00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:46.460\norganizations that you want to trust is\nactually a pretty smooth process as well.\n\n320\n00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.430\nNow, I know you mentioned in here,\n\n321\n00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:52.970\nwe also need to talk about policy decision\npoints and policy enforcement points.\n\n322\n00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:53.520\n>> Yeah.\n\n323\n00:18:53.520 --> 00:19:00.328\nThese are terminology that you yes,\nyou're going to see on your exam.\n\n324\n00:19:00.328 --> 00:19:03.530\nYou're also gonna see them in your\nwhite papers and stuff like that.\n\n325\n00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.490\nSo, do expect vendors to bring this up as,\nso they are important things.\n\n326\n00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.980\nThe decision points and\n\n327\n00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:13.280\nenforcement points, it's something that\nyou already know, to be quite honest.\n\n328\n00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.080\nIt's something that you\nreally already know.\n\n329\n00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:15.880\n>> I like things like that.\n\n330\n00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.741\n>> Yeah.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:19.503\n>> It's just that they're deciding to call\n\n332\n00:19:19.503 --> 00:19:20.766\nit a different name.\n\n333\n00:19:20.766 --> 00:19:23.360\nIt's like me when,\nyou know I travel a lot,\n\n334\n00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:28.370\nand I'm used to being in California,\nI've always grown up calling it a coke and\n\n335\n00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.725\nI go someplace like Colorado and\nit's a pop.\n\n336\n00:19:30.725 --> 00:19:32.189\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Like stop doing that,\n\n337\n00:19:32.189 --> 00:19:34.560\nyou can call it a coke when I'm here.\n\n338\n00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.100\n>> Okay.\n[LAUGH]\n\n339\n00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.310\n>> And that's why they\n\n340\n00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.098\ndon't allow me back in\ntheir state anymore.\n\n341\n00:19:39.098 --> 00:19:39.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, but.\n\n342\n00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:44.700\n>> But all kidding aside, that\n\n343\n00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:50.570\nwould be kind of a crude example, but\nan example of what they're doing here.\n\n344\n00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:55.170\nA decision point, a policy decision point,\na policy enforcement point.\n\n345\n00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.090\nWhat they are is,\nthe policy decision point,\n\n346\n00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:01.160\nthe name kinda says it\npolicy decision point.\n\n347\n00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.370\nIt's really something that's consulted for\n\n348\n00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:09.230\nthe rules and authorization guidelines,\nthat's what that is.\n\n349\n00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.270\nI would think of it almost as\na policy server for the most part.\n\n350\n00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.050\nThat's what that is.\n\n351\n00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:20.260\nAn enforcement point, on the other hand,\nwould be any object that you go to.\n\n352\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:25.560\nAnd when you try to access that object and\nto borrow ISCs terminology\n\n353\n00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.650\nwhen you are a subject accessing that\nobject, what happens is that when you\n\n354\n00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.490\ntry to make that access with that object,\nthere's an additional\n\n355\n00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:37.240\nlevel of filters that you're going through\nwhen you access that object, telling you.\n\n356\n00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.640\nThat hey this is the level of access that\nyou're allowed to have to this guy you\n\n357\n00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.180\nknow so that would be\nthe actual enforcement point.\n\n358\n00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.340\nYou could actually throw in if you\nreally kinda wanna drill down and\n\n359\n00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.640\nget away from the abstract\nto the more specific and\n\n360\n00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.556\nyou go from your talking about subject and\nobject.\n\n361\n00:20:52.556 --> 00:20:57.250\nThat object is a file,\nyou're talking a file has an ACL or\n\n362\n00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.420\naccess control list on the front of it.\n\n363\n00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:04.010\nAnd then there's ACE that access control\nentries that describe the type of access\n\n364\n00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:05.085\nthat any subject.\n\n365\n00:21:05.085 --> 00:21:08.405\nThat touches that object is gonna get.\n\n366\n00:21:08.405 --> 00:21:08.975\nYou know?\nSo,\n\n367\n00:21:08.975 --> 00:21:14.715\nthat would be a more crystal\nversion of the whole scenario.\n\n368\n00:21:14.715 --> 00:21:19.310\nSo, an enforcer point is\nliterally is that point.\n\n369\n00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.740\nWhere something is enforced.\n\n370\n00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.620\nSo, in this case,\nyou're accessing an object.\n\n371\n00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:29.400\nThe actual enforcement is done at that\nway when you get access to that object.\n\n372\n00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:32.950\nThere's no reason to do any enforcement\nwhen you're just swimming around\n\n373\n00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:34.339\nlooking and browsing at stuff.\n\n374\n00:21:34.339 --> 00:21:36.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's when you actually go to\n\n375\n00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.320\naccess something that, that's what\nthe enforcement point actually is.\n\n376\n00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.300\nThe actual decision point is going to be\nlike the server or something out there\n\n377\n00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.460\nthat has the rules and all that type of\nstuff out there, that could be part of it.\n\n378\n00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.080\nSo, if you get down to it.\n\n379\n00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.190\nThe decision point.\n\n380\n00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.510\nYou could tie something like\nactive directory if you\n\n381\n00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.770\nkinda wanna use that example.\n\n382\n00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:02.420\nYou could have,\nthere's the network policy servers.\n\n383\n00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.470\nIf you guys are familiar with Microsoft\nstuff, they have the network policy server\n\n384\n00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:12.220\nthat centralizes stuff for remote access,\nand a few other things, if they've\n\n385\n00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:18.003\ngot that it would be another really good\nexample, so that's whats going on here.\n\n386\n00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:22.360\nYou even think I wanna use even\nradius clients or radius servers,\n\n387\n00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:27.710\nI kinda want to get that where the radius\nclient would be the enforcement\n\n388\n00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:31.200\npoint where you're coming and\nthat's where things are actually enforced.\n\n389\n00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.200\nAnd the actual radius server\nwould be the actual point\n\n390\n00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:39.650\nwhere the server that's holding all\nthe rules and all that type of stuff.\n\n391\n00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:41.190\n>> Yeah.\nSo, that enforcement point.\n\n392\n00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.490\nYou try to access something.\n\n393\n00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:48.450\nThe enforcement point is there to\nenforce the rules or the access levels.\n\n394\n00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:50.210\nBut it doesn't know what they are, so\n\n395\n00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:53.960\nit has to pass that request on\nto the policy decision point.\n\n396\n00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.320\nThe policy decision point compares,\nlooks at rules, what have you,\n\n397\n00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.870\nsends the decision back to the enforcement\npoint, and then it enforces.\n\n398\n00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:02.880\nIt says yes you can or no you can't.\n\n399\n00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:08.270\n>> Exactly, that would be the best\ndescription to think about there.\n\n400\n00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.520\n>> I do already know it, we're good to go.\n\n401\n00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.780\n>> Yeah that was the thing, I could've\ngone through CSAs guidebook, you know.\n\n402\n00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:20.790\nHere opened up their stuff and\nreally just read you the riot act on that.\n\n403\n00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.620\nYou know?\nI'm not about that.\n\n404\n00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.470\nI want to use stuff that you already that,\nif I can stuff that you already know and\n\n405\n00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.980\njust relate it back to these terms.\n\n406\n00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.960\nSo, this is one example\nwhere we can do that.\n\n407\n00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.520\nI just need you when you're doing your\nstudying or you're sitting there for\n\n408\n00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.170\nthis exam, if that's what you're gonna do.\n\n409\n00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.030\nWhen you set the credential\njust make sure.\n\n410\n00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:40.310\nYou got that linkage in your head and\nyou'll be just fine.\n\n411\n00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.550\n>> So, like in a cloud.\n\n412\n00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:44.550\nI bet, it would be the same\nthing in a cloud environment.\n\n413\n00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.170\nI would go to access some\ncloud-based resource.\n\n414\n00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.619\nThat resource is on the enforcement point.\n\n415\n00:23:49.619 --> 00:23:53.124\nIt would have to check with some policy\ndecision point to see if I should or\n\n416\n00:23:53.124 --> 00:23:56.628\nshould not have access and what level\nof access it reports back and I can or\n\n417\n00:23:56.628 --> 00:23:57.558\ncan't access it.\n\n418\n00:23:57.558 --> 00:23:58.731\nSo exact same concept.\n\n419\n00:23:58.731 --> 00:23:59.706\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n420\n00:23:59.706 --> 00:24:01.122\n>> Easy.\nI like that.\n\n421\n00:24:01.122 --> 00:24:03.247\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well good [CROSSTALK] easy.\n\n422\n00:24:03.247 --> 00:24:05.870\n>> Two more acronyms to\nthrow on our list of, done.\n\n423\n00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:06.545\n>> Yeah.\n\n424\n00:24:06.545 --> 00:24:11.760\n>> [LAUGH] All right, provision and\nauthoritative sources.\n\n425\n00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:16.555\n>> Yeah, this is another area that comes\nin, we're talking about access management\n\n426\n00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:20.095\nand about getting access\nto resources in general.\n\n427\n00:24:20.095 --> 00:24:25.445\nWhen you look at provisioning,\nprovisioning, it's a very common term.\n\n428\n00:24:25.445 --> 00:24:28.180\nIt's an old term,\nit's one that you've seen,\n\n429\n00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.630\nit just means it's a way that we\nare divvying up and handing out and\n\n430\n00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.560\nbreaking down, parceling out,\nwhatever you wanna call it, resources.\n\n431\n00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.800\nSo if you have a big ol' cloud out\nthere with all these resources on it,\n\n432\n00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.130\nand you're chopping it up and\nsetting it up and making it ready for use,\n\n433\n00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.140\nthat's what that would be.\n\n434\n00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.920\nIf you have a private cloud,\nwe had an awesome example,\n\n435\n00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.590\nif you've got a private cloud,\nit's probably not gonna\n\n436\n00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:50.870\nbe used by the whole organization\nthe same way, so what do you do?\n\n437\n00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.400\nYou have the whole thing set up,\nmake the cloud, and\n\n438\n00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.816\nthen you get that big old cleaver up there\nand chop it up into pieces that are gonna\n\n439\n00:24:57.816 --> 00:25:02.530\nbe used service-wise or whatever-wise by\n\n440\n00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:06.550\nwhomever inside that organization, that'd\nbe the very simple way of looking at it.\n\n441\n00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:11.330\nProvisioning can be done either by someone\nthat's managing the cloud directly, or\n\n442\n00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:16.950\nit could be done by\nself-service situation.\n\n443\n00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:22.160\nIn fact self-service is not\nan uncommon thing to see when you have\n\n444\n00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:27.910\na situation where you've got a public\ncloud and someone needs another mailbox or\n\n445\n00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:33.500\nanother ten mailboxes or needs additional\nbandwidth or space or whatever.\n\n446\n00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.800\nA lot of public providers\nyou can just go up there,\n\n447\n00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.610\naccess your account through a control\npanel, say I need this, this, and\n\n448\n00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:44.080\nthis, pop in your credit card or whatever\nand it's added on and you're ready to go.\n\n449\n00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:48.680\nAll you gotta do is,\nyou have those mailboxes allocated to you.\n\n450\n00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.090\nIf it's a mail service, now you've\njust gotta go through the process and\n\n451\n00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.280\nsteps of provisioning those, setting\nthem up getting them ready for use and\n\n452\n00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.260\nthen inform the people that\nyou've assigned them to that hey,\n\n453\n00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:04.042\nyou're ready to get spammed I guess,\nat that point.\n\n454\n00:26:04.042 --> 00:26:06.520\n>> [LAUGH] Woo-hoo, love me some spam.\n\n455\n00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.620\nAll right, and then authoritative source,\n\n456\n00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:12.530\nis that just who has the authority\nto do the provisioning, or?\n\n457\n00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:16.090\n>> That could be part of it, but\n\n458\n00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:21.340\nit could also be if you start\nhaving replication issues,\n\n459\n00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.890\nwhich one is actually authoritative\ncopy of things that could happen.\n\n460\n00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:31.010\nWe talked about dispersion and\nsharding of data, if you're sharding\n\n461\n00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.790\ndata it could be a situation where these\nshards are replicas of one another but\n\n462\n00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:39.975\nthey're geographically dispersed\nin a way that makes access easier.\n\n463\n00:26:39.975 --> 00:26:43.980\nBut, you're gonna want to\nmake sure that one of those\n\n464\n00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.790\nis either the authoritative copy, if\npractical, sometimes it's not practical,\n\n465\n00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:49.930\nsometimes the mechanism\ncan take care of itself.\n\n466\n00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:54.140\nI mean, you look at something like\nactive directory, active directory,\n\n467\n00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:58.830\naside from those FSMO\nroles notwithstanding,\n\n468\n00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.840\nthere really isn't in most\ncases authoritative copy.\n\n469\n00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.910\nIt's something you can go to any\ndomain control and make a change and\n\n470\n00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:05.580\nit gets replicated out.\n\n471\n00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.560\nSo, there aren't necessarily always\nsituations where you have authoritative\n\n472\n00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:11.670\nsource of something, but\nthere can be in some situations.\n\n473\n00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.860\nSo you're gonna want to know if there's a\nsituation where there's a primary copy and\n\n474\n00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.670\nthat way you can make sure that that's\nthe one that everyone keys off to and\n\n475\n00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:23.020\nchanges are actually sent to.\n\n476\n00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.480\n>> Yeah, and I think like, with active\ndirectory replication that maybe\n\n477\n00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:31.120\nthe source of the change, when you modify\nsomething, it has to replicate out.\n\n478\n00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.937\nSo change might have occurred here,\nreplicated to domain controller b,\n\n479\n00:27:34.937 --> 00:27:37.945\ndomain controller b has replicated\nto domain controller c, but\n\n480\n00:27:37.945 --> 00:27:41.540\ndomain controller a is still that\nauthoritative source of the change or DNS.\n\n481\n00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.010\nWhen you said authoritative that was\nthe first thing I thought of was DNS,\n\n482\n00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:46.120\nkind of the same thing there?\n\n483\n00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.640\n>> That would be a fair analogy,\nit may take a little bit of adjustment,\n\n484\n00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.518\nbut I would accept that as\na fair analogy for it too.\n\n485\n00:27:52.518 --> 00:27:55.520\n>> Nice, all right well Sean, a lot of\ngreat information there when it comes to\n\n486\n00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.160\nidentity, entitlement,\nand access management.\n\n487\n00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.000\nA lot of those concepts that\nwe're already familiar with\n\n488\n00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.840\nfrom maintaining our traditional network,\nwe can just take that out to the cloud.\n\n489\n00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.240\nWe might have to change\nthe terminology a little bit, but\n\n490\n00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.925\nthe concept is relatively the same.\n\n491\n00:28:10.925 --> 00:28:16.450\nSome new stuff, we've got to think\nabout the identity federations,\n\n492\n00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:18.640\nin Microsoft world that's\nthe federation services, but\n\n493\n00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.990\nthere's other platforms that\nalso do identity federation.\n\n494\n00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:25.170\nThat concept of extending\nthe authentication, or\n\n495\n00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:29.790\nthe trust of the authentication process,\nbeyond our organizational boundaries.\n\n496\n00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.420\nBecause that's what the cloud\nis all about, right?\n\n497\n00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:35.070\nIt's all about putting it out there so\nthat we can access from anywhere,\n\n498\n00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.280\nfrom other networks,\nbusiness partners, what have you.\n\n499\n00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:42.350\nSo, a lot of good info,\nany parting thoughts for us on this one?\n\n500\n00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:46.720\n>> I would tell people, really,\nwhen you look at something like this,\n\n501\n00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:51.060\nI think this would be a very good\npoint in time for them to look at,\n\n502\n00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.580\nat the very least, federated services.\n\n503\n00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.370\nJust to kind of give you that quick and\n\n504\n00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:03.500\ndirty view at it and see kind of what\none implementation of it looks like.\n\n505\n00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.100\nIt'll probably clear up a lot for\nyou with what we're talking about.\n\n506\n00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:11.540\nCuz remember we're just talking on,\nwith this credential, we're talking\n\n507\n00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:15.680\nat just a point where we're setting\nwhat decisions are best to make and\n\n508\n00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.750\nwhat drives decisions and all that.\n\n509\n00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:20.310\nWe’re counting on the fact that\nyou understand the technology and\n\n510\n00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:23.690\nstuff leading into it or at least\nhave some basic understanding of it.\n\n511\n00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:27.660\nYou may never have set up federated\nservices you may never have to set up\n\n512\n00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:31.260\nfederated services, but I will tell\nyou if you're applying this stuff out,\n\n513\n00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:36.170\nyou better know what federated services\nare to be able to make the right\n\n514\n00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:41.390\ndecision no limitations, and whether it's\nbetter to do it internally or externally.\n\n515\n00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:45.050\nSo, you might wanna go ahead and\ntake a look at\n\n516\n00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:48.280\nthe courses we have here that actually\nincorporate federated services.\n\n517\n00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.880\nI believe it should still be in\nthe active directory course.\n\n518\n00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.060\n>> Yep.\n\n519\n00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.670\n>> So there should be some stuff on\nthere you can take a look at and\n\n520\n00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.230\nget the overview of it.\n\n521\n00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.020\n>> Very good.\n\n522\n00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.920\nAll right, well ladies and\ngentlemen, that's gonna do it for\n\n523\n00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.060\nanother show here at ITProTV.\n\n524\n00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.650\nWe hope you enjoyed watching,\nsigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n525\n00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:04.760\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n526\n00:30:04.760 -->

00:00:14.940\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.140\nWith me today is the famous Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.420\nAnd in this episode, Sean, we're gonna\nbe talking about virtualization and\n\n6\n00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.070\nsome of the pitfalls or\nsome of the things we've got to consider,\n\n7\n00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.910\nI guess,\nwhen we talk about virtualization.\n\n8\n00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.230\nAnd really, when we go to the Cloud,\nI don't know if we can say guarantee, but\n\n9\n00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.840\nwe can almost guarantee, that we're gonna\nbe doing some type of virtualization?\n\n10\n00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.150\n>> Yeah, in a lot of cases.\n\n11\n00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.430\nThis tends to be a very popular solution,\nas a matter of fact.\n\n12\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.650\nI mean, so you're right,\nyou can't guarantee it.\n\n13\n00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:41.440\nBut it's\n\n14\n00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.130\nalmost assuredly that someone is gonna\nbe doing some sort of virtualization.\n\n15\n00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:52.300\nI mean, stuff like mail services and\nstuff like that excluded, this tends to be\n\n16\n00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.570\nthe popular thing, is just to virtualize\nyour stuff and put it up in the cloud.\n\n17\n00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.970\nThe cloud servers aren't maintaining\nindividual physical servers for\n\n18\n00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.890\neach one of their customers,\nif I need ten servers I'm not going and\n\n19\n00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.199\nbuying ten Dell's and\nthrowing them in the rack.\n\n20\n00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.780\n>> Yeah, absolutely not.\n\n21\n00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.040\nThey're just providing\nyou a bunch of space,\n\n22\n00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.450\nhowever they're doing it underneath\neverything, doesn't matter to you.\n\n23\n00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.820\nWhat you're doing is you're\ngetting that space or whatever and\n\n24\n00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.110\nyou're using virtualization to\nput your machines up there.\n\n25\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.360\nAnd so it tends to be a very popular\nchoice for the exact same reasons\n\n26\n00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.110\nit would be in traditional deployments,\nis that you can do that consolidation,\n\n27\n00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.890\nyou get the security benefits,\nyou get better utilization of resources.\n\n28\n00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.560\nYou just get all those things that we've\nbeen reaping over all these years.\n\n29\n00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.420\nSo we really like that.\n\n30\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.840\nYeah, so it's not always the part\nof the solution, but In a lot\n\n31\n00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.350\nof cases it does tend to be that and which\nvirtualization solution does kind of vary.\n\n32\n00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.210\nI mean if you go from Microsoft,\nthey have their own stuff.\n\n33\n00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.000\nIf you go with the VMware, we saw that\nback in our first few episodes of this.\n\n34\n00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.360\nWe took a look at some of the providers.\n\n35\n00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.630\nWe saw at EMC actually\nhas got there own stuff.\n\n36\n00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.850\nYou pretty much know what they're going\nto be using in their situation so\n\n37\n00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.610\nyou've got different\nvirtualization solutions up there.\n\n38\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.560\nNow how you do it-\n>> I wonder what virtualization solution\n\n39\n00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.230\nMicrosoft Azure uses.\n\n40\n00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.761\n>> Yeah, I wonder that, too.\n\n41\n00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:26.204\n[LAUGH] Virtual PC.\n\n42\n00:02:26.204 --> 00:02:30.730\n>> [LAUGH] But it is one of the things\nwe gotta think about when we're\n\n43\n00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.260\nchoosing our provider if we are concerned\nwith the platform that we're using.\n\n44\n00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.020\nEspecially if we're doing,\nI would think, like infrastructure as\n\n45\n00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.230\na service where we're going to be\ncreating the virtual servers and\n\n46\n00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.950\nwe're going to be putting them up there.\n\n47\n00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.740\nI'd like to be familiar with the Hyper\nvisor technology that they're using.\n\n48\n00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.020\nSo that if I'm used to working\nwithin my network with Hyper-v, for\n\n49\n00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.850\nexample, yet\nI go to another cloud service provider or\n\n50\n00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.970\nmy cloud service provider and\nthey're using a different hyper visor.\n\n51\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.990\nThere's a learning curve there,\nand some challenges.\n\n52\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.693\n>> Yeah.\nAnd even if you take out the different\n\n53\n00:03:03.693 --> 00:03:06.432\nHyper visor or learning curve rather,\n\n54\n00:03:06.432 --> 00:03:10.945\nthe different Hyper visors mean\ndifferent security concerns.\n\n55\n00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:12.320\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Because you're coming in at different\n\n56\n00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.310\npoints of that stack once again.\n\n57\n00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.810\nSo there's definitely impact on how\nyour security's gonna work, and\n\n58\n00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.440\nhow much security you have available or\ndon't have available, as the case may be.\n\n59\n00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.620\nSo there's all the benefits that we\nhave of virtualization normally.\n\n60\n00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.830\nBut as we know,\nthere's different types of virtualization.\n\n61\n00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.190\nThey do not all work the same.\n\n62\n00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.190\nYou have application level, you've got,\nyou know, hardware level on\n\n63\n00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.040\nall sorts of stuff in between that\nyou can use to make this happen.\n\n64\n00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.130\n>> Yeah.\nAbsolutely.\n\n65\n00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.370\nYou've got your type 1 and\ntype 2 Hyper visors and, I would think for\n\n66\n00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.095\nthe most part, our cloud service\nproviders they are gonna be doing\n\n67\n00:03:53.095 --> 00:03:57.685\ntype one Hyper visors because of the\nperformance and the fact that you're right\n\n68\n00:03:57.685 --> 00:04:00.817\ndown there at the hardware level with\na thin layer of abstraction between them.\n\n69\n00:04:00.817 --> 00:04:05.675\nType two Hyper visor's more like where\nwe used to have virtual server for\n\n70\n00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:08.205\nMicrosoft, virtual box.\n\n71\n00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:13.105\nThese are ones that run as an application\non top of the operating system and\n\n72\n00:04:13.105 --> 00:04:17.660\none of the big issues with those is the\nfact that we have to share data between\n\n73\n00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.290\nthe operating system, and that the Hyper\nvisor, the type 2 Hyper visor.\n\n74\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.050\nWhereas with a type 1,\nyou get your parent partition,\n\n75\n00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.360\nright, which is your\nhost operating system.\n\n76\n00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.460\nAnd then you got your child partitions,\nwhich are your VM's that you're creating.\n\n77\n00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.870\nAnd they're not sharing data.\n\n78\n00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.190\nI mean, you can set it up so\nthey share data, but\n\n79\n00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.100\na virtual the child partition\ndoes have direct access to that\n\n80\n00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.830\nvirtualized hardware through that VM bus\nso you get a little better security there.\n\n81\n00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.750\nIt's one of the things\nyou've got to think about.\n\n82\n00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.810\nAnother security concern with\nthe Hyper visors, you've got,\n\n83\n00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.930\nand again I'm going to use Windows\nbecause that's where my expertise is,\n\n84\n00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.240\nyou know server 2012 R2,\nI can install that.\n\n85\n00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.110\nFull blown standard or data center.\n\n86\n00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.700\nThen I can install the Hyper visor role\non top of that server which is great.\n\n87\n00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.230\nOr I can go with that\nslimmed down version,\n\n88\n00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.510\nI can get 2012 R2 Hyper-V which\nleaves out all those other roles,\n\n89\n00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.320\nall those other things\nit's just a Hyper visor.\n\n90\n00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.270\nSo I eliminate a lot of the need\nto do some of those patches,\n\n91\n00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.040\nthose security concerns, that I get\nfrom the operating system itself, and\n\n92\n00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.820\nthe interface and all those other\ntools and all those other services.\n\n93\n00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.200\nAnd again, this is something, I think,\nthat really comes more into play\n\n94\n00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.040\nif you're setting up a private cloud and\nyou're creating this yourself.\n\n95\n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.930\nIf you're going out to a public cloud,\n\n96\n00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.220\nthis is something they decided and you're\njust choosing to do business with them.\n\n97\n00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.240\nBut if you're doing a private cloud or\nsomething like that,\n\n98\n00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.300\nan internal cloud, definitely\nsomething that we got to consider\n\n99\n00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.110\nin that design phase is what are we going\nto use for our virtualization technology.\n\n100\n00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.560\nAnd do we want to go with a I want to call\na thin Hyper visor where it's really just\n\n101\n00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.390\nthe Hyper visor solution or something like\nwe install servers that can do Hyper-V and\n\n102\n00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.790\nother things,\nyou know that can make a big difference.\n\n103\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.380\n>> Yeah absolutely, virtualization\nis one of those that there's just so\n\n104\n00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.170\nmany choices on and\nlike Mike said there at the end,\n\n105\n00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.550\nyour public and private cloud solutions\ncould dramatically impact which\n\n106\n00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.320\nvirtualization options you have available.\n\n107\n00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.510\nThe good thing about about it is if you go\nwith a public cloud, a public solution.\n\n108\n00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.450\nThey should be able to tell you and\n\n109\n00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.310\nthey usually have it right there on their\nad slicks or their websites or whatever.\n\n110\n00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.780\nTelling you this is what we're using,\nthis is how it works and\n\n111\n00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.520\nheck a lot of them will give\na quick demo environment\n\n112\n00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.770\nthat you can try the stuff out and\nsee how it works for you.\n\n113\n00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.880\nI mean that's a really really\ncool thing that is offered.\n\n114\n00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.720\nBut yeah, you do get the situation\nwhere you're not necessarily\n\n115\n00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.420\nusing a proprietary format, but\nyou do have a certain degree of lock in.\n\n116\n00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.850\nI would add to that,\nbecause you could end up\n\n117\n00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.650\nporting your solution over to their\nvirtualization environment, and\n\n118\n00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.550\nthat can contribute to some degree\nof lock in at the very least.\n\n119\n00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.600\nYou may be able to get it out of there,\nbecause we did talk in prior episodes\n\n120\n00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.020\nabout conversion tools and stuff like\nthat to move it over to a new one, but\n\n121\n00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.290\nthat's not always an easy proposition.\n\n122\n00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:28.640\nBut usually you can get it out of that so\nthat's a big benefit.\n\n123\n00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.320\nNow if you go with\na private cloud you do have\n\n124\n00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.100\npretty much the world's your oyster,\nright?\n\n125\n00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.190\nYou can do whatever you want.\n\n126\n00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.110\nYou can use the virtualization options\nthat are best for you, that will work in\n\n127\n00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.690\nthe Cloud and that will get something\nthat fits your specific needs.\n\n128\n00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:47.370\nBut then again,\n\n129\n00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.350\nyou are gonna be inheriting a lot\nmore of the responsibility.\n\n130\n00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.858\nIn fact,\nall of the responsibility is now yours.\n\n131\n00:07:53.858 --> 00:07:57.016\nSo choosing the right one,\ngetting it tuned.\n\n132\n00:07:57.016 --> 00:08:02.281\nHow well it works or\nhow bad it works is all going\n\n133\n00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:08.020\nto depend on just Just\nhow well you do your job.\n\n134\n00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:13.410\nSo you really need think about how\nmuch you're willing to take on.\n\n135\n00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.520\nFortunately, I'd say with virtualization,\n\n136\n00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:22.010\nit's been at least we're\ntalking a decade at this point.\n\n137\n00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.171\n>> I remember XP, we had Virtual PC.\n\n138\n00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.983\nThat was when I first\nstarted playing with it.\n\n139\n00:08:26.983 --> 00:08:31.227\n>> Yeah, so it's got a good\nlong track record behind it,\n\n140\n00:08:31.227 --> 00:08:33.710\na good long history behind it.\n\n141\n00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:40.410\nSo I wanna say ten years and yeah,\nwe had stuff before that too.\n\n142\n00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:43.390\nBut if you look at it\nover the last decade,\n\n143\n00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.340\nthere's been so much stuff documented\non it, so much testing being done.\n\n144\n00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:51.980\nThere's so many white papers and so\nmany tools out there to help you\n\n145\n00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.540\nplan the stuff out and\nget the right solution in place.\n\n146\n00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.001\nThat the chances of you\ncreating a private cloud and\n\n147\n00:08:59.001 --> 00:09:04.556\ngetting the wrong solution is, you almost\nhave to purposefully make a mistake and\n\n148\n00:09:04.556 --> 00:09:09.003\ndecide not to do your research on it,\nis the way I would look at it.\n\n149\n00:09:09.003 --> 00:09:11.323\nCuz for the most part,\nthat research has been done,\n\n150\n00:09:11.323 --> 00:09:13.135\nthat ship's sailed as far as that goes.\n\n151\n00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:16.871\nIt's just a question of,\ndo you want to take the time and\n\n152\n00:09:16.871 --> 00:09:18.870\nhow important is this to you?\n\n153\n00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.610\nSo you look at Microsoft, Microsoft\nhas these planning and design guides.\n\n154\n00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.010\nThey've been around for several years now.\n\n155\n00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.640\nNot a decade, but\nthey've been around for several years.\n\n156\n00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:33.770\nAnd one of the things the planning and\ndesign guides cover is virtualization.\n\n157\n00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.185\nSo they will tell you exactly\nwhat information to gather,\n\n158\n00:09:37.185 --> 00:09:41.310\ncertain considerations,\nthings that can influence your decision.\n\n159\n00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.244\nAnd as you go through this flow chart and\ncollect this information,\n\n160\n00:09:45.244 --> 00:09:47.797\nand use these aids that\nthey have with them,\n\n161\n00:09:47.797 --> 00:09:51.802\nbecause they have these information\ngathering aids and matrices and\n\n162\n00:09:51.802 --> 00:09:56.860\nExcel spreadsheets that you can populate\nor even customize based on your needs.\n\n163\n00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:00.960\nYou can get all that information and\nalong the way,\n\n164\n00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.590\nat each step, it tells you if\nyour numbers look like this,\n\n165\n00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:07.680\nyour information looks like this,\nthis is what's coming out of this step.\n\n166\n00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.900\nYou go to the next step,\nget this information,\n\n167\n00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.670\nthis is what this choice will be.\n\n168\n00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:15.880\nAnd right on through and at the end of it\nyou should have a much clearer picture\n\n169\n00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.890\nthan you would have had going in.\n\n170\n00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.720\nOr at least have validation of your\nchoice as you go through this.\n\n171\n00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.993\nSo that's something that we have going for\nus now, is that if you go to\n\n172\n00:10:25.993 --> 00:10:30.563\na public vendor or do your own private\ncloud, the chances of you having any\n\n173\n00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:34.864\nmajor pitfalls with virtualization\nlike they did in the early days.\n\n174\n00:10:34.864 --> 00:10:39.451\nI mean people virtualized in the early\ndays just because they could virtualize,\n\n175\n00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:41.360\nthat's not a good reason.\n\n176\n00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.380\nNow you can find not only if\nthere's a good reason, but\n\n177\n00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:49.100\nwhat that solution will look like, how to\nallocate resources, how many things to\n\n178\n00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:52.370\nput in that virtual environment,\nwhat's suitable, what's not suitable.\n\n179\n00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.070\nAll those things can come into play,\nwhich is great.\n\n180\n00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.690\nIt makes things a lot easier for you.\n\n181\n00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.260\nAnd we've thrown a lot of stuff at you\nover these episodes of things that go into\n\n182\n00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:07.400\ncreating a good cloud environment,\na good secure cloud environment, and\n\n183\n00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.700\nit can be a little mind\nnumbing at this point.\n\n184\n00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.050\nBut this is one place where you can\nkind of, you still have work to do, but\n\n185\n00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:19.830\nit's a lot easier because they have some\nof these tools out there, books, whatever.\n\n186\n00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.797\nAnd all the vendors I think,\nvirtualization at least,\n\n187\n00:11:22.797 --> 00:11:27.593\nanything like VMware, Hyper-V, anything\nlike that, there's enough consultants and\n\n188\n00:11:27.593 --> 00:11:29.063\nstuff like that out there.\n\n189\n00:11:29.063 --> 00:11:33.160\nI know EMC even has their own, and\nI know Microsoft has them too, but\n\n190\n00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.710\nEMC I know has their own\nconsultants that'll come out and\n\n191\n00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.630\nhelp you set up the right\nvirtualization solution.\n\n192\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.281\nIf you're not entirely sure,\nthey'll do that.\n\n193\n00:11:42.281 --> 00:11:46.376\n>> Right, and then we've gotta deal with\nthe, one of the things I think we see is\n\n194\n00:11:46.376 --> 00:11:49.465\nsometimes people forget,\nthat guest operating system,\n\n195\n00:11:49.465 --> 00:11:53.119\nwe really gotta treat it just like we\nwould a physical machine as far as\n\n196\n00:11:53.119 --> 00:11:56.988\nthe hardening process that we talk\nabout in all of our security classes.\n\n197\n00:11:56.988 --> 00:12:01.151\n>> Yeah, this is a really good point in\nthis is that one of the things that you\n\n198\n00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:05.183\nalways hear when you talk about\nvirtualization is when you think about\n\n199\n00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:06.312\nvirtualization.\n\n200\n00:12:06.312 --> 00:12:10.956\nOh virtualization, if you do it makes\nthings more secure cuz you got everything\n\n201\n00:12:10.956 --> 00:12:15.763\nall sealed up inside this nice little box\nand that's what they kind of visualize.\n\n202\n00:12:15.763 --> 00:12:19.987\nBut while it's true, doing stuff in\nvirtualization offers the ability to\n\n203\n00:12:19.987 --> 00:12:24.747\nmake things more secure, it doesn't mean\nthat hey, you put it in virtualization,\n\n204\n00:12:24.747 --> 00:12:29.000\nclick your heels together three times,\nall of a sudden it's secure.\n\n205\n00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.780\nIndeed it doesn't, it means you still,\nas Mike said here, you could still have\n\n206\n00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:38.600\nto do some hardening to make sure that\nyou're getting a secure solution.\n\n207\n00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:44.910\nVirtualization does not equal\nbetter security, period.\n\n208\n00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:49.039\nYou have to get your hands dirty and\nget in there and make things happen.\n\n209\n00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:53.754\nSo you're gonna have to,\nwe don't necessarily need to talk about\n\n210\n00:12:53.754 --> 00:12:58.650\nhardening steps here,\nbecause that legwork's already been done.\n\n211\n00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.490\nBut you can look at, for\nreally any application,\n\n212\n00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:04.210\nany operating system,\nthere's best practices,\n\n213\n00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:09.260\nguidelines, and plenty of stuff written\nsaying how to harden each application.\n\n214\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.441\nOperating systems, I mean heck, there's a\ncountless number of things that have been\n\n215\n00:13:13.441 --> 00:13:15.460\nwritten and documented in various ways.\n\n216\n00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.390\nThere's stuff that probably all\nof our viewers out here have,\n\n217\n00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.710\nfrom their own experience, come up with.\n\n218\n00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.680\nI mean, so you're just gonna be\napplying that same kind of stuff\n\n219\n00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.887\ntowards the cloud and\ntoward a cloud environment.\n\n220\n00:13:26.887 --> 00:13:31.407\n>> Right, and then, VM sprawl's an\ninteresting one cuz I know we were guilty\n\n221\n00:13:31.407 --> 00:13:35.660\nof it here early on when we\nstarted going into virtualization.\n\n222\n00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:40.620\nIt's so tempting, you have 12 servers,\nphysical servers, in the rack.\n\n223\n00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:45.660\nYou choose your hyperviser,\nyour virtualization solution, and now\n\n224\n00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.965\nyou're down to three physical servers in\nthat rack for redundancy and performance.\n\n225\n00:13:49.965 --> 00:13:54.370\nAnd when you've got physical servers,\nyou don't want to just go out and\n\n226\n00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.180\nbuy a new one every time you\nneed to spin up a new service.\n\n227\n00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.070\nSo you start combining roles and\nthings like that.\n\n228\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:03.920\nWhen you start virtualizing your servers,\nwe found that we actually had\n\n229\n00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:08.495\nmore virtual servers in that first six to\neight months than we did physical servers,\n\n230\n00:14:08.495 --> 00:14:10.100\nright, before we went virtualized.\n\n231\n00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:15.400\nWe had like 12 or 13 in the rack, but\nafter a few months of virtualization,\n\n232\n00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.970\nwe were up to like 20-something\nvirtual servers running.\n\n233\n00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:21.400\nBecause each one was doing one\nlittle thing and that was it, and\n\n234\n00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.850\nif you needed something new you\njust spun up a new machine.\n\n235\n00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:27.220\nVery easy to do, and the problem is you\nstart running out of resources because\n\n236\n00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.530\nyou've got to divide those host\nresources up amongst all those VMs.\n\n237\n00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.690\n>> Yeah, that's a very good point.\n\n238\n00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.478\nI remember those types of things as well.\n\n239\n00:14:35.478 --> 00:14:38.523\nIt's like, oh, we need another virtual\nmachine, need another virtual machine.\n\n240\n00:14:38.523 --> 00:14:39.890\nWell, why do you have two?\n\n241\n00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:42.135\nWell, that one I check my email on.\n\n242\n00:14:42.135 --> 00:14:43.315\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, what?\n\n243\n00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:46.899\n>> [LAUGH] And especially with\nthe self-provisioning type stuff,\n\n244\n00:14:46.899 --> 00:14:51.102\nthose self-service portals, very easy\nto start getting quite a few VMs.\n\n245\n00:14:51.102 --> 00:14:53.639\n>> Yeah, it was that case of, heck,\n\n246\n00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:57.320\nI kinda envision it as\npeople going to the buffet.\n\n247\n00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.043\nIt's like ooh, I want all of that.\n\n248\n00:14:58.043 --> 00:15:00.360\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's like no, no, no, no, no, no.\n\n249\n00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.560\nLet's think about this a bit more before\nyou start going crazy with it and\n\n250\n00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.330\nmaking all these weird choices.\n\n251\n00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:10.600\nThink just because you can,\ndoesn't mean you should.\n\n252\n00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.199\nIt's like, there's valid reasons to\nhave different virtual machines,\n\n253\n00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:17.974\nbut there's valid reasons to combine them.\n\n254\n00:15:17.974 --> 00:15:21.680\nAnd heck, there's some cases where\nthere's no reason to have one.\n\n255\n00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.590\nYou pretty much made up a reason and\n\n256\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:29.380\nhad a solution that was looking for a\nproblem, rather than the other way around.\n\n257\n00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:34.183\nWhich, unfortunately, happens with,\nI wanna say really any new technology,\n\n258\n00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:35.252\ncloud included.\n\n259\n00:15:35.252 --> 00:15:40.778\nYou get a cloud comes out and\nit's a nice brand-new shiny technology.\n\n260\n00:15:40.778 --> 00:15:44.424\nAnd all of a sudden we're like, oh,\nthe cloud, that's a cool thing.\n\n261\n00:15:44.424 --> 00:15:46.607\nLet's just start shoving\nwhatever we can inside the cloud.\n\n262\n00:15:46.607 --> 00:15:49.330\nWell, there's no reason\nto put it up there.\n\n263\n00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:52.450\nBut we've got to have it because\nthey have it next door and\n\n264\n00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.060\nwe've got to do the same\nthing they're doing.\n\n265\n00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:00.252\nOkay, whatever, so You really got to think\nabout if it's practical to do everything,\n\n266\n00:16:00.252 --> 00:16:04.270\nand some stuff just isn't going\nto work in virtualization anyway.\n\n267\n00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.475\nIt's just not where it belongs.\n\n268\n00:16:07.475 --> 00:16:12.890\nAnd fortunately, things have gotten\nbetter, with what runs in virtualization.\n\n269\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.960\nBut still it doesn't mean that you just\nneed to shove everything in there.\n\n270\n00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.140\nIt doesn't mean that.\n\n271\n00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.160\nThe big offenders I used to think of\nare the ones that would have where\n\n272\n00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.790\nwe combine multiple roles,\nlike you said on a server.\n\n273\n00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:26.150\nAnd instead of doing that now,\nit's like oh,\n\n274\n00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.870\nI'm not gonna put them all on one server.\n\n275\n00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.140\nI'm gonna take a virtual machine and\n\n276\n00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.440\nput one role on this one, and\none role on this one, one on this,\n\n277\n00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.442\nit's like, those can all go on one\nmachine we've been doing that for years.\n\n278\n00:16:34.442 --> 00:16:34.986\n>> Right.\n\n279\n00:16:34.986 --> 00:16:38.260\n>> It's like, but I can do this over here.\n\n280\n00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:45.015\nThey just saw a nice new toy that\nthey could start messing with.\n\n281\n00:16:45.015 --> 00:16:46.945\nBut that always happens.\n\n282\n00:16:46.945 --> 00:16:52.343\nAnd now we're starting to get over that or\nwe have gotten over it for the most part.\n\n283\n00:16:52.343 --> 00:16:56.080\nDo you still see places that have just\ncountless numbers of virtual machines for,\n\n284\n00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.410\nit seems like, and\nyou can't justify that many?\n\n285\n00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:02.700\nYeah and\nit's probably always gonna be that way but\n\n286\n00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.055\nhopefully it's not gonna be something\nwhere you're gonna see a lot of it.\n\n287\n00:17:06.055 --> 00:17:10.100\n>> Yeah I always, my rule of thumb was\nalways I look at the security involved in\n\n288\n00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.590\nthe role or\nwhatever it is that I'm putting on that.\n\n289\n00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:17.340\nAnd for example,\nif I've got a domain controller and\n\n290\n00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.570\na web server,\ntwo separate virtual machines.\n\n291\n00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:22.310\nCuz I've got different levels\nof access to those machines,\n\n292\n00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.900\ndifferent security\nconcerns of those roles.\n\n293\n00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:28.470\nSo that's typically what\nI would use to look at.\n\n294\n00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.110\nAnd another issue we gotta\ndeal with is data commingling.\n\n295\n00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:35.930\nAnd that's very easy to do as we start\ncreating these virtual environments and\n\n296\n00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:40.120\nthese virtual networks because we tend\nto start combining everything right?\n\n297\n00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.630\nWe connect them all to\nthe same virtual switch.\n\n298\n00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:45.020\nAnd all of a sudden, from one VM,\n\n299\n00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.530\nif you've got one VM that's transmitting\ndata that's not so sensitive another VM,\n\n300\n00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.640\nbut attached to the same network Is\ntransmitting very secure information,\n\n301\n00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.230\nwe might not want those\ntwo commingling like that,\n\n302\n00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.590\nrunning across the same virtual network.\n\n303\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.930\nWe want separate physical adapters,\n\n304\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.180\nwe want to make sure we\nset up virtual switches.\n\n305\n00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:09.290\nOn the different adapters, and\nlimit the virtual machines to\n\n306\n00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:12.660\nconnect into one particular one,\nfor example.\n\n307\n00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.310\nVLANs give us some protection\nagainst that, but not completely,\n\n308\n00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:20.355\nbecause if I'm sniffing traffic on\nthe VLAN, IDs don't really help, right?\n\n309\n00:18:20.355 --> 00:18:20.855\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n310\n00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:27.575\nYeah, there's going to be a hit you can\ntake with any of these types of things.\n\n311\n00:18:27.575 --> 00:18:31.630\nThis commingling issue, yeah,\nit's been something that,\n\n312\n00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:35.750\nwhat I think of is that people\nare focused too much on the front end.\n\n313\n00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.340\nThey've got the virtualization going,\nand they're like, oh well,\n\n314\n00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.850\nthey're all separate machines.\n\n315\n00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.174\nThey're not thinking, it's like yeah,\n\n316\n00:18:41.174 --> 00:18:42.807\nthey're all drinking from\nthe same pool back here.\n\n317\n00:18:42.807 --> 00:18:43.504\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n318\n00:18:43.504 --> 00:18:47.700\n>> So you really need, thinking\nabout how you're splitting that up.\n\n319\n00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.700\nThat's something that goes back to that\nfragmentation dispersion, sharding\n\n320\n00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.460\ndeal is that breaking things up like that\nbecause it may very well be the most\n\n321\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:02.555\na very effective way of\npreventing stuff from being\n\n322\n00:19:02.555 --> 00:19:07.620\naccessed or\navoiding certain types of access.\n\n323\n00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:13.040\n>> That reminds me of,\nwhen you say the back end, the storage,\n\n324\n00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.245\nthe virtual hard drives for\nthese virtual machines.\n\n325\n00:19:16.245 --> 00:19:21.185\nIf you've got virtual hard drives\non a SAN but that SAN is storing\n\n326\n00:19:21.185 --> 00:19:25.815\nother data that users can access through\nan app directly or something like that,\n\n327\n00:19:25.815 --> 00:19:30.700\nnow you get that chance where I might be\nable to browse to other stuff on there,\n\n328\n00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:35.370\ngain access from one virtual machine\nto another virtual machine's data.\n\n329\n00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:39.430\nSo trying to segregate it out base on\nsecurity I think's an important part.\n\n330\n00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.050\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n331\n00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:45.350\n>> And then we're gonna talk about\nthe fact that, what do we got here?\n\n332\n00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.770\nCharacter assisted serious complexity for\naudits.\n\n333\n00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.210\nThat becomes challenging as well, right?\n\n334\n00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.830\n>> Yeah, think about that one when you\nthink about all the things you could have\n\n335\n00:19:54.830 --> 00:20:00.040\npotential with doing audits\nin a virtualized environment.\n\n336\n00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.980\nEspecially if you start bringing in\nstuff like this commingling issue, and\n\n337\n00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:07.930\nthe sprawl issue, and there could be\na number of things that actually start\n\n338\n00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:12.820\nworking their way into this whole picture.\n\n339\n00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.050\nSo it could increase\nthe level of complexity,\n\n340\n00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:20.700\nbut I would say as long as you've\ndocument and keeping track of this stuff,\n\n341\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.600\nyou should be reasonably good shape.\n\n342\n00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.400\nIt just means that it's probably going to\ntake a little longer to do your audits.\n\n343\n00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.100\nBut, it shouldn't be a major, major,\nmajor, major, major, major problem.\n\n344\n00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:37.350\nIt just means more to do which is one\nof the reasons to keep it simple.\n\n345\n00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.228\nJust because you're spitting up,\n\n346\n00:20:39.228 --> 00:20:42.500\ncan spit up as many virtual\nmachines as you want on demand\n\n347\n00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.710\nthrough your self service portals or\nwhatever doesn't mean you should do that.\n\n348\n00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.230\nIt should always be for\ncreating any new virtual machine and\n\n349\n00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:56.120\ndoing anything that should be a process\nthat its gone through to make\n\n350\n00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.350\nsure that that is going too meet needs and\nnot cause any undue problems,\n\n351\n00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:04.300\nor strain, or overhead, or\nwhatever you want to call it.\n\n352\n00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.340\nIt could be as simple as just saying\nthat's going to be part of our\n\n353\n00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.690\nchange management process.\n\n354\n00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:14.650\nBecause it would fit,\nI'd say pretty much squarely in that.\n\n355\n00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:18.360\nYou're thinking about, well,\nif an audit has to happen.\n\n356\n00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.020\nThat could be one of the factors\nthat's evaluative if an audit happens,\n\n357\n00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:24.210\nthat's one more thing that has to be\naudited and checked and hardened and\n\n358\n00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.370\nverified and all that.\n\n359\n00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.418\nSo fortunately we do have tools\nthat help us out with that,\n\n360\n00:21:30.418 --> 00:21:34.340\nlook at Microsoft's like virtual\nmachine and system center sweep.\n\n361\n00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.980\nThey have tools for\nmonitoring all of that but\n\n362\n00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.830\nthat still doesn't absolve you\nfrom all responsibility and\n\n363\n00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.670\nit only makes it a little easier,\nyou still have to think about things.\n\n364\n00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.910\n>> And auditing the host itself, right.\n\n365\n00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.340\nSometimes we tend to\nforget about that guy, but\n\n366\n00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.660\nif somebody can gain access to the host\nthey can potentially gain access to any\n\n367\n00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:55.800\none of the virtual machines\nthat's being run on that host.\n\n368\n00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.306\n>> Yeah, that's a very good\npoint is that the configuration\n\n369\n00:21:58.306 --> 00:22:03.240\nof these virtual machines can very\neasily allow data to flow back and\n\n370\n00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.550\nforth and access to flow back and forth\nthat shouldn't otherwise be happening.\n\n371\n00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:09.870\nIn fact, it talks to the issue\nof compartmentalization as well.\n\n372\n00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.546\nIs that when you've got virtual machines\nyou want to make sure that if you're\n\n373\n00:22:13.546 --> 00:22:17.282\nsetting them up for security reasons,\nand going through all the hardening and\n\n374\n00:22:17.282 --> 00:22:19.450\nall that, that's all well and good But\n\n375\n00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:24.460\nyou wanna make sure that they're set\nup in such a way that if they're\n\n376\n00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.090\ndoing things that have different\nsecurity levels involved, if this one,\n\n377\n00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:32.240\nif this virtual machine's working at\na higher security level than this one is,\n\n378\n00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.350\nthese two should not be just directly\ninteracting whenever they want,\n\n379\n00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:40.110\nbecause that's decreasing security.\n\n380\n00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.790\nSo what you wanna do is you wanna see okay\nwell if these two are talking make sure\n\n381\n00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:48.790\nthey're compartmentalized and there's\nsome way that regulates the flow of\n\n382\n00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:52.360\ninformation between the two,\nif it happens at all.\n\n383\n00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.040\nThat's where stuff like you mentioned\nMike, VLANs and stuff like that come in.\n\n384\n00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:59.130\nThat can actually control that\nflow of data back and forth.\n\n385\n00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:06.370\nThat again, takes a lot of planning and\nthought, to really get right.\n\n386\n00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.160\nIf you're just spinning up virtual\nmachines wherever you want and\n\n387\n00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.651\nnot thinking about it,\nthen you may end up in a lot of hot water,\n\n388\n00:23:12.651 --> 00:23:15.260\nespecially when they try to go\nto audit this stuff later on.\n\n389\n00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.110\nIt's like what's happening here?\n\n390\n00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.990\nThere's a big mess here it\nlooks like someone puked up\n\n391\n00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:24.180\na bunch of virtual machines, and I don't\nknow what the rhyme or reason is here, and\n\n392\n00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.138\nyou don't want that to be the issue\nthat comes up during an audit.\n\n393\n00:23:27.138 --> 00:23:30.538\n>> All right well, Sean, a lot of\ngood information on virtualization.\n\n394\n00:23:30.538 --> 00:23:35.426\nA lot of things to think about especially\nif you're setting up your own cloud,\n\n395\n00:23:35.426 --> 00:23:39.958\nwhether it's internal private cloud or\neven an internal public cloud.\n\n396\n00:23:39.958 --> 00:23:46.320\nBut, anything else we wanna talk about\nin there before we wrap this one up?\n\n397\n00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:49.460\n>> I would just tell people\nreview their virtualization and\n\n398\n00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.640\nreally take a good look at it,\nbefore they move to the cloud.\n\n399\n00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.490\nBecause the situation you have\nvirtualizing stuff currently\n\n400\n00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:59.500\nmay not be something that migrates\nseamlessly directly in the cloud.\n\n401\n00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.620\nYou may have new issues to consider.\n\n402\n00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:05.290\nAnd most people are that way, is that\nthey do have new issues to consider.\n\n403\n00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:09.350\nDoesn't mean necessarily that\ndeployment is gonna change at all,\n\n404\n00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:12.300\nyou might be able to take something and\njust push it right on into the cloud.\n\n405\n00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.577\nYou might be able to do a P2V and\ndo physical to virtual and\n\n406\n00:24:15.577 --> 00:24:19.470\njust throw it up in the cloud,\nthat has been known to happen.\n\n407\n00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:23.542\nWhat I'm saying is evaluate to make sure\nthat, hey while these tools sound really\n\n408\n00:24:23.542 --> 00:24:28.140\nnice that you can do a P2V and throw it up\nin the cloud and get rid of that machine.\n\n409\n00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.730\nIt may not be the solution\nthat you're looking for.\n\n410\n00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.920\nIt may be something that\nyou need to go through and\n\n411\n00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.870\nrethink if that's the best way to do it.\n\n412\n00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.690\nMaybe that that system\nyou're trying to do P2V on,\n\n413\n00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.550\nmaybe you can actually\ndisburse those roles or\n\n414\n00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:46.800\nresponsibilities over other machines and\njust get rid of that completely.\n\n415\n00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.670\nThere may not be any reason\nto take what's existing and\n\n416\n00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.250\nthrow it up there in the same form.\n\n417\n00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:55.820\nIt may just be a case of, I'm taking\nsomething that's junk over here and\n\n418\n00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.260\nputting junk up in the cloud.\n\n419\n00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.880\nAnd that's not necessarily\nwhere you wanna go.\n\n420\n00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.680\n>> Very good.\n\n421\n00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.360\nAll right, well Sean,\nanother great episode.\n\n422\n00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.420\nLadies and gentlemen,\nthat's gonna do it for this one though.\n\n423\n00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.040\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n424\n00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.860\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n425\n00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:09.209\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n426\n00:25:09.209 -->

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:13.627 --> 00:00:17.389\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n5\n00:00:17.389 --> 00:00:18.597\nIn this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:18.597 --> 00:00:23.520\nwe're going to be talking about\noutsourcing security out to the Cloud.\n\n7\n00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.980\nSean, I tell you,\nsounds kinda scary at first.\n\n8\n00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.018\n>> It does.\n\n9\n00:00:29.018 --> 00:00:33.696\nAnytime I, as a security person,\nhear that I am outsourcing something as\n\n10\n00:00:33.696 --> 00:00:38.710\nimportant as security to someone else,\nyeah, it's gonna raise a few hairs.\n\n11\n00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.249\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, it would.\n\n12\n00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:42.572\nYou gotta kind of visual,\nwe'll add that in post too.\n\n13\n00:00:42.572 --> 00:00:47.738\n[LAUGH] But\nit is gonna raise some concerns with me,\n\n14\n00:00:47.738 --> 00:00:52.535\njust because something\nthat's supposed to be\n\n15\n00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:56.963\nunder my control is in\na situation now where\n\n16\n00:00:56.963 --> 00:01:01.520\nit's not entirely under my control at all.\n\n17\n00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.393\nI'm kinda just keeping my fingers\ncrossed that someone else\n\n18\n00:01:06.393 --> 00:01:10.036\nis doing their job, and\nkinda leave at that.\n\n19\n00:01:10.036 --> 00:01:12.888\n>> It seems like when it's my data,\nwhen it's my stuff,\n\n20\n00:01:12.888 --> 00:01:15.440\nI have that vested interest\nin protecting that.\n\n21\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.090\nAnd if I go and\nI outsource that to somebody else,\n\n22\n00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.710\ndo they have that same vested interested?\n\n23\n00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.830\nAre they taking shortcuts\nthat make it easier?\n\n24\n00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.220\nI don't know, it's nerve-racking.\n\n25\n00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.560\nBut it's becoming something that\nwe see more and more often.\n\n26\n00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.000\n>> Yeah,\nit's definitely become part of the mix.\n\n27\n00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.070\nWhen you're pushing stuff out to the\nCloud, it's definitely becoming an issue.\n\n28\n00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.439\nBecause now we're gone way past\nthat consumer idea of people\n\n29\n00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.610\nare pushing photos and videos,\nstuff like that on Cloud.\n\n30\n00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.360\nThat's what consumers are used to, and\nthat stuff has its own security concerns,\n\n31\n00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.380\nto be sure.\n\n32\n00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.355\nI mean, there's been breaches even\nat that level, as a matter of fact.\n\n33\n00:01:56.355 --> 00:01:59.520\nAnd they're trying to tighten\nup security at that level.\n\n34\n00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.280\nYou think of, what was it, earlier this\nyear or last year, they had that massive\n\n35\n00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.700\nbreach of celebrity photos in\nvarious states of undress.\n\n36\n00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.591\nWhich are on my website,\nif you wanna look at them.\n\n37\n00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:13.033\nNo.\n\n38\n00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But in all seriousness, no,\n\n39\n00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.940\nthey had that.\n\n40\n00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.127\nThat was with Apple's,\nwith their iCloud service.\n\n41\n00:02:19.127 --> 00:02:20.330\n>> I believe so.\n\n42\n00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.070\n>> They had that breach and that raised\na lot of eyebrows at that point,\n\n43\n00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.220\nbecause you had people with\nall their personal and\n\n44\n00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.660\nprivate pictures scattered\nall over the place.\n\n45\n00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.540\nAnd so\n\n46\n00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.790\nother people started worrying about what\ntype of, it wasn't just about celebrities.\n\n47\n00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.730\nIt was other people worried now about hey,\nwhat about my pictures up there?\n\n48\n00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.480\nMaybe I'm not as big a target as whatever\ncelebrity, but I do have stuff up there.\n\n49\n00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.740\nAnd whether it's someone in states of\nundress, or it's just a personal document,\n\n50\n00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.170\nor financial information,\nit's still a concern.\n\n51\n00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.682\nBut we have it at that level, but\n\n52\n00:02:57.682 --> 00:03:01.280\nthen you have even more on the line\nwith the stuff that we're talking about.\n\n53\n00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.360\nWe're talking about business and\nprofessional stuff.\n\n54\n00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.750\nSo when we move it up to that level,\nthere's much more at stake.\n\n55\n00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.790\nYou're not talking just embarrassment.\n\n56\n00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.612\nI mean, the celebrities and\npeople that happened to, yeah,\n\n57\n00:03:12.612 --> 00:03:13.872\nthere was embarrassment.\n\n58\n00:03:13.872 --> 00:03:17.100\nAnd yeah, there was some lawsuits and\nstuff like that off of it.\n\n59\n00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.780\nBut when you're talking corporate level,\nyou're definitely talking fines.\n\n60\n00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.950\nI would just assume that the information\ngets out, you're getting sued.\n\n61\n00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.570\nPeriod, end of story,\nwhat else do you need to know?\n\n62\n00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.720\nSo that's something that kinda gets\nfactored into this whole thing.\n\n63\n00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.460\nIf you're outsourcing security,\nyou better make sure that, first of all,\n\n64\n00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.070\nit's something that you're\ncomfortable with and confident in.\n\n65\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.900\nIf I was working for one of you,\nand you're making a choice to\n\n66\n00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.870\nhost out in the Cloud,\nif I have any say so, you're not doing\n\n67\n00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.020\nit until I'm 100% confident that the risks\nare low enough that they're acceptable.\n\n68\n00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.220\nI'm not gonna have you just fling your\ndata out into the Cloud and hope for\n\n69\n00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.320\nthe best, because they say it's the best.\n\n70\n00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.430\nThey're gonna have to prove it to me that\ntheir security's gonna be up to snuff.\n\n71\n00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.190\nBecause I've got things to worry about,\nlike compliance.\n\n72\n00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.660\nThat's something that has to be\nworried about if I'm in the industry\n\n73\n00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.050\nthat deals with stuff like HIPPA.\n\n74\n00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.130\nThere's a huge compliance issue there.\n\n75\n00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.460\nI'm not gonna allow data to be flung out\nthere into this big black hole we call\n\n76\n00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.570\nthe Cloud, and assume that oh, it's gonna\nbe nice and safe because they say it.\n\n77\n00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.220\nThey don't necessarily have, like you\nsaid, Mike, that vested interest on that.\n\n78\n00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.430\nSo I need to have a good\ndegree of confidence.\n\n79\n00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.780\nSo I'm gonna be asking them,\nhave you dealt with this before?\n\n80\n00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.070\nIf they haven't dealt with it before, can\nI use the tools that they have available\n\n81\n00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.260\nto roll a solution that is gonna work for\nme?\n\n82\n00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.050\nI mean, just because someone hasn't\never dealt with HIPAA information before\n\n83\n00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.900\ndoesn't mean I can't ask for audits and\ncertain information from them.\n\n84\n00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.750\nAnd look at the tools that they have as\nfar as encryption and other things go, and\n\n85\n00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.960\ncompartmentalization, and say well, yeah,\n\n86\n00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.910\nI can make a solution that's HIPPA\ncompliant with the tools that you give me.\n\n87\n00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.940\nSo that's something that\nyou kinda gotta look at.\n\n88\n00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.230\nThat's where knowing things like\nencryption, and knowing your security, and\n\n89\n00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.010\nknowing what your requirements are,\ngoing through something like the SDLC,\n\n90\n00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.320\nthat's where that all comes into play.\n\n91\n00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.660\nAnd then we bring in stuff\nlike the Jericho Cube,\n\n92\n00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.110\nthe CSA Cloud reference model, all those\nthings, plus other stuff that you can get\n\n93\n00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.980\nin the form of white papers and what have\nyou, can help you ask the right questions.\n\n94\n00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.860\nAnd make sure you're getting\nthe right confidence from them, and\n\n95\n00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.640\nyou can survive safely with their\nsolution in a regulated industry.\n\n96\n00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.550\nBecause they may not\nhave experience with it.\n\n97\n00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.828\nAnd even if they do have\nexperience with it,\n\n98\n00:05:51.828 --> 00:05:54.045\nyou're gonna run into a situation where,\n\n99\n00:05:54.045 --> 00:05:58.003\nheck, they get to do all the work and you\nget to pay for them to do all the work.\n\n100\n00:05:58.003 --> 00:06:00.538\nBut you've got all the responsibility and\n\n101\n00:06:00.538 --> 00:06:05.480\nget your head chopped off if something bad\nhappens, which is what you don't want.\n\n102\n00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.700\nSo it could be a very tricky\nsituation just there alone.\n\n103\n00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.070\n>> And I know you see another one\nof those as a service acronyms,\n\n104\n00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.380\nwe should probably be familiar with,\nright?\n\n105\n00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:18.491\n>> Yeah, a SECaaS,\nif you want to pronounce it.\n\n106\n00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:23.074\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or it's SEC, S-E-C as a service, so\n\n107\n00:06:23.074 --> 00:06:25.820\nsecurity as a service.\n\n108\n00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.660\nSo yeah,\nthey like throwing that one at you.\n\n109\n00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.610\nSo you've got security as a service.\n\n110\n00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.720\nAnd keep in mind, security as a service\ndoesn't necessarily mean that\n\n111\n00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.850\nyou're always gonna be in the realm of\nhey, I'm hosting the stuff out there,\n\n112\n00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:43.360\nmy software, my virtual machines,\nmy whatever out there.\n\n113\n00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.780\nIt could actually extend\nit to different areas.\n\n114\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.535\nIt can extend into areas like\ncloud-based antivirus scanners.\n\n115\n00:06:52.535 --> 00:06:57.386\nThere's cloud-based vulnerability scanners\nthat can constantly be checking on regular\n\n116\n00:06:57.386 --> 00:06:59.406\nintervals, be checking your stuff.\n\n117\n00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:04.343\nIn fact, we talked about one of\nthose in our ethical hacking class,\n\n118\n00:07:04.343 --> 00:07:06.593\nis that when we looked at that,\n\n119\n00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:11.811\nthere was one that you can pay these\npeople to run vulnerability scans.\n\n120\n00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:15.756\nAnd so a third party's running\nvulnerability scans against you, and\n\n121\n00:07:15.756 --> 00:07:20.220\nthey're always updating their database and\nchecking you for the latest things.\n\n122\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.650\nSo you're getting the latest intel and\n\n123\n00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.780\ninformation back on what you look like\nfrom a vulnerability stand point.\n\n124\n00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:30.580\nSo you can presumably close those things\nor address those things in some way,\n\n125\n00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.130\nshape, or form,\nbefore they become a problem.\n\n126\n00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.750\nWhich is great.\n\n127\n00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:37.200\nIt doesn't necessarily have to mean\nI'm taking all my information and\n\n128\n00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.680\njust bundling it up and going hey,\n\n129\n00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.890\nhere you go, and throwing it over\nthe wall and kiss it goodbye.\n\n130\n00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.200\nIt could be these other things,\nlike I said, malware scanners,\n\n131\n00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:51.480\nvulnerability scanners,\nfirewalls you can put out there.\n\n132\n00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.728\nYou can do a lot of things\nthat can help you out.\n\n133\n00:07:55.728 --> 00:07:58.770\nSo that's kind of\nthe cool thing with this.\n\n134\n00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.091\n>> All right, and\nthen we already kind of mentioned it.\n\n135\n00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:03.390\nWe can do security as a service.\n\n136\n00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:07.057\nEven in a regulated industry,\nwe just gotta make sure that whoever it\n\n137\n00:08:07.057 --> 00:08:11.356\nis we're paying for or getting to do the\nsecurity as a service, is confident, or\n\n138\n00:08:11.356 --> 00:08:15.370\nnot confident, but competent,\nin that particular regulation.\n\n139\n00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.970\n>> Yeah, that would definitely be it,\nis that they're aware of that,\n\n140\n00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.860\nthey're aware of that regulation.\n\n141\n00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:26.500\nOr we're aware of the regulation enough to\nknow that their solution is gonna cut it.\n\n142\n00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.310\nIf they're offering us the ability,\nlet's say,\n\n143\n00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.490\nto store our data up there in\nthe cloud on their service,\n\n144\n00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:38.380\nyou ask them do you have any experience\nwith hosting data related to HIPAA.\n\n145\n00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.430\nWell if they don't, it's not the end\nof the world, it just means that you're\n\n146\n00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:48.450\ngonna have to look at their technology if\nyou wanna to go with them, then you can\n\n147\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:52.540\nreally look at their technology, and ask\nsome questions on how they isolate stuff,\n\n148\n00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:57.260\nfor example, how they control access,\nwhat encryption levels they offer, and\n\n149\n00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.706\nsee if those things are within\nthe rules for compliance.\n\n150\n00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:02.709\nYou know remember when we talked about\n\n151\n00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.380\nin previous episodes we talked about\nthe cloud controls matrix, that CCM.\n\n152\n00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:14.180\nWe talked about, you know, going down that\ncolumn and looking at all the controls and\n\n153\n00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.690\nthen tracing it across.\n\n154\n00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:18.610\nIf you're in HIPAA,\nyou can look across and say okay,\n\n155\n00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:23.390\nwell you have to worry about\nencryption levels and storage of data.\n\n156\n00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:27.530\nYou can trace right across to HIPAA, look\nup the HIPAA guideline on that, and see,\n\n157\n00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:32.530\nokay, well, I need to encrypt it, what\ndoes HIPAA say the minimum standard is?\n\n158\n00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.955\nAnd so\nyou can look at their standard and say,\n\n159\n00:09:34.955 --> 00:09:39.845\noh yeah well the provider does provide\nAES256, so even though they're not\n\n160\n00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:45.075\nexperienced with HIPAA, that encryption\nstandard does meet my requirements.\n\n161\n00:09:45.075 --> 00:09:46.410\nSo I'm good.\n\n162\n00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.480\nJust requires some more due\ndiligence on your side.\n\n163\n00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.330\nNo one said due diligence was\ngonna be easy and no one said due\n\n164\n00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:55.740\ndiligence was gonna go away just because\nyou made it someone else's responsibility.\n\n165\n00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.250\nYour neck is on the line if\nsomething bad happens, so\n\n166\n00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.570\nyou always should be doing due diligence\nif you want to avoid jail time and\n\n167\n00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.200\na very light pocket book or\nwallet at the end of the day.\n\n168\n00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.810\n>> Both of which I would like to avoid.\n\n169\n00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:09.510\n>> I would think so.\n\n170\n00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:14.080\n>> All right, so are there some things\nwith these service providers that do\n\n171\n00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.820\nsecurity as a service can do to make\nme trust them a little bit more, and\n\n172\n00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.959\nmake me willing to try\nthe security as a service?\n\n173\n00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.360\nI personally like to see\nwith anything security,\n\n174\n00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.960\ncloud included,\nI like to see a track record.\n\n175\n00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.050\nI like to see some transparency\nas much as possible.\n\n176\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.760\nI like to be able to have\nreferences that I can talk to,\n\n177\n00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.750\nto see if they've been doing this for\nawhile.\n\n178\n00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:42.430\nThat other people are satisfied with them,\nI wanna hear about what\n\n179\n00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:47.010\nmeasure they're taking and\nwill be taking to protect my stuff.\n\n180\n00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.180\nWhat their incident response looks like.\n\n181\n00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:53.240\nBecause I don't want to hear that,\noh, well, you know,\n\n182\n00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.470\nwe haven't had any incidents.\n\n183\n00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:57.570\nIf you tell me that I'm like okay,\nwe're done here.\n\n184\n00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:58.920\nPretty much anything\nthat's been around for\n\n185\n00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.510\nany length of time has had an incident,\nperiod.\n\n186\n00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.080\nIt's just a question of If\nyou had an incident, okay,\n\n187\n00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.390\nI can except that you had an incident.\n\n188\n00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.920\nHow quickly did you respond it and\n\n189\n00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.410\nwhat did you do to make sure\nthat didn't happen again.\n\n190\n00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.790\nAnd was that incident something that\nwas just negligence, carelessness or\n\n191\n00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.950\njust life happened to role\nthe dice at you and it was fate.\n\n192\n00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:23.980\nI wanna see those types of things,\nbut having a track record and\n\n193\n00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:29.580\nhaving things that can actually, evidence\nin the form of customer referrals,\n\n194\n00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.870\nnot just something that they're\nhanding me a piece of paper.\n\n195\n00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:36.370\nHey a customer wrote us this nice\nletter about this, you want it, yeah.\n\n196\n00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:40.198\nThere's people in high school that\nwrote doctor's notes from their\n\n197\n00:11:40.198 --> 00:11:41.255\nmother too [LAUGH].\n\n198\n00:11:41.255 --> 00:11:44.430\nSome of the people here probably did,\nnot me.\n\n199\n00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.350\n>> What you know about that?\n\n200\n00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:52.560\n>> Start seeing beads of sweat forming,\nI know who's doing it.\n\n201\n00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:59.209\nSo you want to be able to talk to\nthese people, talk to customers,\n\n202\n00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.470\nyou want to see how their work,\nlearn what incidents they've had.\n\n203\n00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.820\nIf they're,\nones they're willing to talk about.\n\n204\n00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.500\nAnd they should be willing, to a certain\ndegree, to talk about incidents.\n\n205\n00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.660\nI do think that's fair.\n\n206\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.460\nI don't,\nthey can put me under NDA if they want.\n\n207\n00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:17.420\nI'm fine with that.\n\n208\n00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.590\nIt's like well, yeah we had incidents.\n\n209\n00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.960\nWe've had incident but.\n\n210\n00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.280\nWe cannot really say to much about it.\n\n211\n00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.780\nOk well I want to know\nabout that incident.\n\n212\n00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.700\nWould you prefer to put me under NDA?\n\n213\n00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.530\nAnd we can talk about it then.\n\n214\n00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.360\nWould that be acceptable?\n\n215\n00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.190\nThey might be.\n\n216\n00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:38.510\nIt is worth that but\nI want them to be able to\n\n217\n00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:43.540\nbe able to prove this type of stuff,\nthe burdens are only on them to prove it.\n\n218\n00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:48.500\nWhat really helps me out is if they have\nmet certain standards, they've had audits,\n\n219\n00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.670\nif they've had audits\ndone by a third party.\n\n220\n00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:56.050\nI mean heck, if they've had,\nlet's say that your cloud service provider\n\n221\n00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:01.130\nwas to contract with someone\nlike me as an outsider.\n\n222\n00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:05.240\nWell, you could go and say well,\nto that service provider,\n\n223\n00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.590\nhas your stuff been audited,\nhas it been checked?\n\n224\n00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:11.480\nIt's like, well, yeah,\nwe had a third party do this, and\n\n225\n00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.920\nthis is the report that they gave.\n\n226\n00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.740\nIt's been posted, notarized,\nvalidated, and, you know,\n\n227\n00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.030\nyou can look to see what\ntheir findings were.\n\n228\n00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:24.630\nThose things all make me feel better about\nhosting with that particular vendor.\n\n229\n00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.066\nAnd they should be willing\nto provide a lot of this.\n\n230\n00:13:28.066 --> 00:13:34.880\nAnd usually there will be some\nbarriers to getting this information.\n\n231\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.330\nBut if you ask it the right way and\nthey're gonna be forthcoming,\n\n232\n00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:41.270\nreally want your business, they'll do it.\n\n233\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:45.060\n>> Tend to make you a little nervous\nif they're not willing to provide that\n\n234\n00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.380\ninformation, right?\n\n235\n00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.993\n>> Yeah.\n>> If they're like, yeah we don't like to\n\n236\n00:13:48.993 --> 00:13:54.196\ntalk about that, or that's something that\nI'm not authorized to talk about it.\n\n237\n00:13:54.196 --> 00:13:58.589\nDepending on how they word it,\nif they're not authorized well who is?\n\n238\n00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:06.701\nAnd if they can't talk to you about it\nbecause we can't talk to you, well.\n\n239\n00:14:06.701 --> 00:14:11.326\nIt'slike well, is it an NDA issue or\nlet's talk about that.\n\n240\n00:14:11.326 --> 00:14:15.845\nBecause if i'm gonna do business with you\nI need to know who i'm getting in bed with\n\n241\n00:14:15.845 --> 00:14:18.990\nto come up with this solution and\nhost my stuff with.\n\n242\n00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.610\nI just can't go ahead and\nsay here you go, host it and take that,\n\n243\n00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.230\nbecause my necks on the line.\n\n244\n00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.240\nIf I'm not comfortable with you,\nI go someplace else, simple as that.\n\n245\n00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.190\nDo you want my business or not?\n\n246\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:33.760\nSo sometimes they might tell you,\nbugger off we're not gonna deal with you.\n\n247\n00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.480\nIf that's their attitude fine,\nthey don't wanna host with them anyway,\n\n248\n00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.090\ngo someplace else.\n\n249\n00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.340\nBut I want to be able to get this\ninformation, they need to earn my trust,\n\n250\n00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.678\nthey need to prove it.\n\n251\n00:14:42.678 --> 00:14:45.750\nAnd like said in the security industry,\nhaving a track record,\n\n252\n00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:50.440\nhaving things that are verifiable and\nvalidated.\n\n253\n00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.320\nHelp out a lot,\nyou look at someone like myself, and\n\n254\n00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.980\nI joke around, you hurt me,\nyou hurt me, during in between taking,\n\n255\n00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.860\nyou hear me joking around, I'll just\nbring my book in and stuff like that.\n\n256\n00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:07.340\nWell, when I do stuff like that,\nall kidding aside when I joke around\n\n257\n00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.770\nlike that, for me if you're asking me\nas a security professional to prove my\n\n258\n00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.420\ncredentials, you know, I,\nyeah I've got a resume.\n\n259\n00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.510\nBut I also have books and white papers and\nstuff like that to prove it.\n\n260\n00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:20.460\nI have to prove to you hey I've got these,\n\n261\n00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.890\nI've got these things to\nshow you that I've done it.\n\n262\n00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:26.760\nI have written things, not just to share,\nbut to share what I know with people.\n\n263\n00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.860\nBut also it helps validate\nwho I am as a professional,\n\n264\n00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.610\nthat's the same thing,\nyou should be expecting that for\n\n265\n00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:39.240\nme to be able to prove that if you\never ask me what my credentials are.\n\n266\n00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.590\nYou should be totally.\n\n267\n00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.520\nI should totally prepared to prove that,\nand\n\n268\n00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.860\nyou're totally in your rights to ask that.\n\n269\n00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:52.340\nJust like you should be with\nanyone you do business with.\n\n270\n00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:56.840\nProve what your credentials are,\nprove that I can put something like my\n\n271\n00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.600\ndata in your hands in your and\nbe okay with it.\n\n272\n00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.580\nI can sleep well at night.\n\n273\n00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:07.375\nI can know that the chance of\nme getting sued, taken to court,\n\n274\n00:16:07.375 --> 00:16:11.444\ngoing to jail,\nall that is extremee Extremely low.\n\n275\n00:16:11.444 --> 00:16:13.092\n>> And\nI probably can see both sides of this.\n\n276\n00:16:13.092 --> 00:16:18.430\nI see it from somebody that has\nthe experience and security as you.\n\n277\n00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:22.670\nIf your organization was moving to\nthe cloud and you were thinking about\n\n278\n00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.356\ndoing security as a service,\nlots of questions you wanna ask,\n\n279\n00:16:26.356 --> 00:16:30.060\nyou know what you wanna ask,\nwhat to look for, and things like that.\n\n280\n00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.700\nBut I can see where it's also\nbeneficial maybe to somebody that's\n\n281\n00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:37.090\nnew to this stuff and their organization\nis pressuring them to go to the cloud.\n\n282\n00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:41.270\nAnd they're the sole IT guy there,\nmaybe security isn't their forte.\n\n283\n00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:44.460\nThis might be a chance to go, whew.\n\n284\n00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:49.440\nI can take advantage of this\nprovider's expertise, and\n\n285\n00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.050\nnot have to lose all my sleep at night,\ncuz I don't know how, for sure,\n\n286\n00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:55.095\nto secure this cloud stuff.\n\n287\n00:16:55.095 --> 00:16:56.100\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n288\n00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.040\nYeah, exactly.\n\n289\n00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.560\nYou should be able to get\nthis information, and\n\n290\n00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:06.750\nit should make you feel comfortable about\nthe situation you're entering into.\n\n291\n00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:11.060\nIf you're not comfortable with it, there's\nalways going to be some risk involved.\n\n292\n00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.630\nThat's what the name of the game\nis about is managing risk and\n\n293\n00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.530\ndeciding what level of\nrisk you can handle.\n\n294\n00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.670\nIf the risk is not right for\nyou, don't enter into it.\n\n295\n00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.320\nThat's what I would just tell you.\n\n296\n00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:29.419\nYou know, if somebody's pressuring\nyou to go into a situation that is\n\n297\n00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.650\nmore risk than you want assume, it's like,\nwell, I'm not doing it, you know.\n\n298\n00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.420\nI'm the type of person that would\ntell somebody go someplace else then.\n\n299\n00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.450\nI'm not going to take that risk.\n\n300\n00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.740\nI'm telling you I'm not gonna\ntake that risk with your stuff.\n\n301\n00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.150\nAnd if you want me to go there and I'm not\ncomfortable with it, then I'm not willing\n\n302\n00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:56.350\nto do that and I don't feel right\nabout it and so just forget it.\n\n303\n00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.550\nAnd trust me, I have done that.\n\n304\n00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.960\nWhere I've said, well too bad, you know?\n\n305\n00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:06.350\nI mean I can remember\na personal situation.\n\n306\n00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.430\nIt wasn't a cloud thing or\ntechnology thing.\n\n307\n00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.285\nWhere I had friends asking me, you know,\nas a pilot, asking me to fly some place.\n\n308\n00:18:12.285 --> 00:18:14.640\nThey're like, oh there's\na thunderstorm over there, it's fine.\n\n309\n00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.210\nI mean there's literally a thunderstorm\nin the area, like, it's fine.\n\n310\n00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:18.230\nHe says you're a good pilot.\n\n311\n00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:21.100\nIt's like, yeah, that's why I'm still\nalive, is cuz I'm a good pilot.\n\n312\n00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.510\nHe says, you wanna go over there?\n\n313\n00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:27.195\nHe says, you better start walking now\ncuz my plane ain't leaving the ground.\n\n314\n00:18:27.195 --> 00:18:34.080\n[LAUGH] You know, it's because\nI knew what the situation was,\n\n315\n00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.140\nI'm trained as a pilot,\nI know what I was looking at.\n\n316\n00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.570\nI knew the risk was too high for that.\n\n317\n00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:45.841\nThere's a chance that yeah, you could\nbe fine going up in that weather, but\n\n318\n00:18:45.841 --> 00:18:48.595\nthere's a much bigger\nchance that you're not.\n\n319\n00:18:48.595 --> 00:18:51.740\nAnd that unknown, and that chance that\nthere's gonna be a problem was something I\n\n320\n00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.710\nwasn't going to deal with,\nthe risk was too high.\n\n321\n00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:57.830\nIt's the same thing in something like\nthis, with hosting in the cloud,\n\n322\n00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:03.030\nif I'm gonna host something in the cloud,\nif I'm not comfortable with the security\n\n323\n00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.230\nsituation and the way things stand,\nit's a done deal, it's not happening.\n\n324\n00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:12.570\nI will find another provider or\nI will wait and see if I can\n\n325\n00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:17.630\nfind other provider or heck, if I really\nneed a cloud environment and an external\n\n326\n00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.180\nprovider can't do it, you should know\nwhere I'm going to go at this point.\n\n327\n00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.486\nI'm gonna build my own.\n\n328\n00:19:22.486 --> 00:19:25.964\nYou know, that's what happened with that\ncompany in California you talked about.\n\n329\n00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:30.260\nThey did healthcare, they had all\nthese records they had to maintain.\n\n330\n00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.340\nThey needed and wanted a cloud solution\ncuz it was the best solution for\n\n331\n00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:34.910\nwhat they needed.\n\n332\n00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.130\nThey knew they needed a cloud,\nso that wasn't even a question.\n\n333\n00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.540\nThey knew they needed a cloud solution.\n\n334\n00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.040\nThe question is, what was the shape of\nthe cloud gonna be at the end of the day?\n\n335\n00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.750\nAnd so, when they did all their\nchecking and verification,\n\n336\n00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:50.740\nit turned out that they could\nnot go with a public cloud.\n\n337\n00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.550\nThere was nothing that gave them that\nnice, warm fuzzy feeling that would let\n\n338\n00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.750\nthem, you know, rest their head on their\npillow at night and know they were fine.\n\n339\n00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:02.330\nSo they just said, you know hey we're\ngoing to have to break out our checkbooks\n\n340\n00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:05.540\nand raid the piggy bank and\nbuild our own cloud internally\n\n341\n00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.400\nbecause that's the only way we will\nbe within all our risk tolerances.\n\n342\n00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.590\nAnd manage our risk\nthe way we want it to and\n\n343\n00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.790\nfeel like we're doing\nright by our customers.\n\n344\n00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:22.460\nAnd don't forget, one of the things\nwe talked about several episodes\n\n345\n00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.150\nago was dealing with risk management and\ncalculating it and all that.\n\n346\n00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:27.190\nWe talked about that.\n\n347\n00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.750\nSo, that's something\nthat will go into this.\n\n348\n00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:34.686\nSo this discussion right here\nis also gonna include that too.\n\n349\n00:20:34.686 --> 00:20:35.772\n>> Right.\n\n350\n00:20:35.772 --> 00:20:38.880\nAll right well I tell you what Sean a lot\nof good information and we know that we\n\n351\n00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:43.400\nhave the ability to outsource our\nsecurity, we can do security as a service.\n\n352\n00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.330\nGoes right along with all the other\nservices we can do out there in the cloud.\n\n353\n00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.840\nBut, very good info Sean,\n\n354\n00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.590\nanything else we wanna throw in\nthis one before we wrap it up?\n\n355\n00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.060\n>> No, I think we've kinda got it and\n\n356\n00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:58.380\nwe're in good shape with ready to\nmake our move into that cloud.\n\n357\n00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.450\n>> Very good.\n\n358\n00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.740\nAll right, well ladies and\ngentlemen that's gonna do it for this one.\n\n359\n00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.200\nWe hope you enjoyed watching.\n\n360\n00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.510\nSigning off for ITProTV, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n361\n00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:06.470\n>> And I'm Sean Oriyano.\n\n362\n00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:07.539\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n363\n00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:13.540\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
