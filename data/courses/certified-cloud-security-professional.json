Roderick and\nwith me today is Mr. Sean Oriyano.\n\n4\n00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.930\nAnd in these upcoming episodes\nwe're gonna be covering the CCSP or\n\n5\n00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.920\nthe Certified Cloud Security Professional,\n\n6\n00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.230\nput on by ISC squared and the CSA or\nthe Cloud Security Alliance.\n\n7\n00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.800\nSo we're gonna be covering these courses.\n\n8\n00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.300\nAnd Sean,\nyou know this is obviously a new cert,\n\n9\n00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.080\na relatively new\ncertifications that are out.\n\n10\n00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.680\nSo tell us a little bit about who might\nbe interested in taking these videos.\n\n11\n00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.960\n>> Well, it, the.\n\n12\n00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.190\nWhen you talk about the cloud security\nprofessional, this is actually\n\n13\n00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.610\na certification that would be\ngeared towards someone that is both\n\n14\n00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.470\nan IT professional, someone that really\nknows their stuff as far as IT goes,\n\n15\n00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.920\nthe more advanced user, as well as someone\nthat would be around the level of a CCSP.\n\n16\n00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.320\nAnd that's an important little detail\nthere as a matter of fact is someone that\n\n17\n00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.360\nholds a CCSP credential would be pretty\nmuch be qualified to set the CCSP.\n\n18\n00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.090\nYou're just gonna need to unload the\nmaterial, of course, but you've already\n\n19\n00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.820\nmet the core requirements for the most\npart if you already have the CCSP.\n\n20\n00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.170\nSo, if you look at what the CCSP is and\nwho that type of person is,\n\n21\n00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.250\nwhich is a high-level\nsecurity professional.\n\n22\n00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.840\nI should say mid-to-high\nlevel security professional.\n\n23\n00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.480\nThat's kind of what we're looking at\nas far as theory and all that goes.\n\n24\n00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.310\nIn practice, yeah,\nyou should be an IT person.\n\n25\n00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.110\nYou should have some experience with\napplications, databases would be great but\n\n26\n00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.330\nnot necessary to have but\nyou should know your IT stuff so\n\n27\n00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.640\nyou understand some of the issues and\nthings that go on with that.\n\n28\n00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.510\nAnd of course, like I said,\n\n29\n00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.300\nthe CSSP is gonna give you\nthe security side of things.\n\n30\n00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.100\n>> So this is really geared towards those\npeople that might be responsible for\n\n31\n00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.730\nmigrating their resources up to\nthe cloud in an organization.\n\n32\n00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.540\nOr if you are already in\nthe cloud managing and\n\n33\n00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.320\nmaintaining your cloud service.\n\n34\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.020\nBecause really when it comes down to it,\nsecurity in the cloud\n\n35\n00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.350\nis a lot different than what we're used to\ndealing with our internal infrastructure.\n\n36\n00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.310\nRight there is a whole new set of things\nthat we got to worry about some of our\n\n37\n00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.370\nprocedures that we use now\nare not gonna be the same, or\n\n38\n00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.410\nnot work the same up in the cloud, huh?\n\n39\n00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.110\n>> Yeah,\nthings are not gonna be the same old,\n\n40\n00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.110\nsame old stuff as you move to the cloud.\n\n41\n00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.190\nThat's something that could very\neasily get you into trouble.\n\n42\n00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.550\nAnd so, what the CCSP tries to teach you\nis it tries to teach you how to plan\n\n43\n00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.080\neither that migration or\n\n44\n00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.530\nthe integration of cloud technologies\ninto what you already have.\n\n45\n00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.860\nSo whatever you currently have,\nif you're hosted in house or\n\n46\n00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.680\nyou're working with an external provider,\nand remember an external\n\n47\n00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.380\nprovider doesn't have to mean you're\nworking with a cloud provider already,\n\n48\n00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.600\nyou could be using something\nentirely different than that.\n\n49\n00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.300\nIt's talking about how to\nbring what you have now, and\n\n50\n00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.510\nsomehow, put the cloud into that mix.\n\n51\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.010\nAnd do it safely and securely,\ninstead of just saying, well, hey,\n\n52\n00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.550\nsnap my fingers, put the cloud in there\nand everything's all said and done.\n\n53\n00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.130\nYou definitely wanna avoid that.\n\n54\n00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.950\nI mean, cuz that's happen a lot of times\nin the past with new technology as,\n\n55\n00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.670\nhey that's great.\n\n56\n00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.080\nLet's, it sounds great.\n\n57\n00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.180\nLet's all the benefits and all that or\njust look awesome on paper.\n\n58\n00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.210\nLet's bring that in.\n\n59\n00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.145\nBut it's how do you get there\nfrom where you are right now.\n\n60\n00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:25.625\nThe CCSP is designed to do that.\n\n61\n00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:29.455\nIt's designed to help you plan and\naddress certain issues and\n\n62\n00:03:29.455 --> 00:03:32.445\ndecide which model of deployment\nis really best for you.\n\n63\n00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:35.534\nIt's not just a case of either\nyou have the cloud or you don't,\n\n64\n00:03:35.534 --> 00:03:37.472\nit's how much of the cloud do you have.\n\n65\n00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:40.492\nAnd you could almost say there's\nas many different models of clouds\n\n66\n00:03:40.492 --> 00:03:43.114\nas there are clouds in the sky,\nyou really could.\n\n67\n00:03:43.114 --> 00:03:47.272\nYou kinda gotta be aware of those to\nsee which one's the best fit for you.\n\n68\n00:03:47.272 --> 00:03:51.042\n>> Right, because we're gonna have those C\nlevel executives coming to us, and they've\n\n69\n00:03:51.042 --> 00:03:54.302\nheard the buzzwords, they know some of\nthe power that we can get from the cloud.\n\n70\n00:03:54.302 --> 00:03:57.242\nAnd then they come to us and say well,\nlet's get our stuff out there.\n\n71\n00:03:57.242 --> 00:03:59.160\nWe want to be in the cloud as well.\n\n72\n00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.290\nBut it's not quite that easy.\n\n73\n00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.890\nYou can't just push a button and\nmake everything go up there.\n\n74\n00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.440\nLots of things are managed differently.\n\n75\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.480\nSecurity is managed differently,\nforensics is managed differently.\n\n76\n00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.110\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n77\n00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.140\n>> It's a big game changer.\n\n78\n00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.470\nThat's what this certification is\nreally geared towards, is teaching us,\n\n79\n00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.210\nmaking sure that we can implement what\nthose C level executives want out of us.\n\n80\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.720\nI've got the ISC webpage pulled up again.\n\n81\n00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.100\nThis is one of the providers,\nit was a partnership between the ISC and\n\n82\n00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.320\nthe Cloud Security Alliance or the CSA.\n\n83\n00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.700\nAnd I'll make sure we throw\nthis in the show notes.\n\n84\n00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.760\nBut if we look, this particular\nexam is gonna be four hours,\n\n85\n00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.610\nabout 125 questions on that exam,\nmultiple choice.\n\n86\n00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.380\nYou need about a 700 out of\n1000 to pass that exam, and\n\n87\n00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.480\nthe pricing is a little\nsteep on this one Sean.\n\n88\n00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.300\nIt is right up there with the CISSP.\n\n89\n00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.980\nWe're looking at the CCSP\nexam $549 to take that,\n\n90\n00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.555\nand we can take that, let me just\ndouble check that, through prometric.\n\n91\n00:04:57.555 --> 00:05:01.815\nThrough Pearson Vue, sorry, Pearson Vue\nis gonna be the exam provider for that.\n\n92\n00:05:01.815 --> 00:05:06.405\nSo that's the idea, if you're getting\nready to migrate your infrastructure out\n\n93\n00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:11.070\nto the cloud, or integrate cloud services\ninto your existing infrastructure,\n\n94\n00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.280\nthese are gonna be the episodes for you.\n\n95\n00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.080\nStay tuned as Sean and\nI progress through the CCSP, or\n\n96\n00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.227\nthe Certified Cloud Security\nProfessional Objectives.\n\n97\n00:05:21.227 --> 00:05:27.079\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
