--> 00:00:21.532\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're going over Domain 1 and CISSP.\n\n4\n00:00:21.532 --> 00:00:24.160\nWhich is security and risk management, and\n\n5\n00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.278\nspecifically we're gonna be looking at\napplying the concepts of confidentiality,\n\n6\n00:00:29.278 --> 00:00:34.260\navailability, and integrity,\nas well as security governance compliance.\n\n7\n00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.280\nAnd with me today to help us out\nwith all of this is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.050\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.490\n>> Good, good.\nHey everybody.\n\n10\n00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.340\nGood to be back, welcome.\n\n11\n00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.580\n>> Absolutely.\n\n12\n00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.830\n>> So let's talk a bit about security.\n\n13\n00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.208\nLet's talk about confidentiality,\nlet's talk about integrity,\n\n14\n00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:48.687\nlet's talk about availability, right?\n\n15\n00:00:48.687 --> 00:00:51.500\nCuz these are the three building blocks,\nif you will.\n\n16\n00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.630\nThe three pillars of information\nsecurity management.\n\n17\n00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.724\nWhen we think about them,\n\n18\n00:00:54.724 --> 00:00:58.224\nwe often talk about them from the respect\nof being the information security triad.\n\n19\n00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:02.786\nOr you often will hear them referred to\nas the iron triangle, or the AIC triad.\n\n20\n00:01:02.786 --> 00:01:04.230\nThere's lots of different\nway we talk about them.\n\n21\n00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.620\nBut at the end of the day what\nwe're really thinking about is\n\n22\n00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.650\nwe're thinking about three things\nthat form the underlying bedrock,\n\n23\n00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.100\nthe baseline of everything we\ndo within information security.\n\n24\n00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.190\nConfidentiality is all about\nthe idea that ultimately\n\n25\n00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.320\nwe are focusing on ways in which we can\nprotect information, keep it secure.\n\n26\n00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.180\nIf I tell Mike something, and I write\nit down and I pass it over to him, so\n\n27\n00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.150\nhe doesn't know what it is, but he looks\nat it, but nobody's around to see it.\n\n28\n00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.080\nIf I say, Mike, keep that secret,\nmake sure you don't share it with anybody.\n\n29\n00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.650\nMake sure nobody sees it, nobody knows\nabout it, then that's confidentiality.\n\n30\n00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.270\nIf Mike looks at that information, but\nmaybe George is standing in the corner,\n\n31\n00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.880\nand maybe, inadvertently, George\ncatches a glimpse of that information.\n\n32\n00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.360\nThen, Mike may have done\nwhat we call exposed or\n\n33\n00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.490\nbroken the confidentiality\nof the information.\n\n34\n00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.640\nSo we wanna make sure we\nkeep information secure.\n\n35\n00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.840\nWe keep it away from,\nas we'll talk about later,\n\n36\n00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.420\npeople that are unauthorized,\nthat are not supposed to see it.\n\n37\n00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.820\nWhen we think about integrity,\n\n38\n00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.500\nwe think about the idea of information\nthat is going to be monitored.\n\n39\n00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.150\nWe're gonna figure out what\ninformation looks like, and\n\n40\n00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.430\nultimately once we know that,\nwe wanna capture that current state.\n\n41\n00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.320\nWe wanna know what that is, and\n\n42\n00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.480\nthen once we've done that,\nwe wanna keep track of it over time.\n\n43\n00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.020\nAnd if that information changes in any\nway, we want to be told about that.\n\n44\n00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.780\nWe want to, in other words, be notified\nthat the information has been modified.\n\n45\n00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.860\nWe talked about notification\nof modification,\n\n46\n00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.240\nwhen we talk about integrity.\n\n47\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.530\nThe idea of integrity,\n\n48\n00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.480\nis all about ensuring not that\ninformation is kept secret.\n\n49\n00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.570\nNot that Mike reads the message, but\ndoesn't actually show it to anybody but,\n\n50\n00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.450\nrather, that the message\nis not going to change.\n\n51\n00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.550\nSo if the message to Mike on\nthe paper that I pass him is,\n\n52\n00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.700\nthe dog is blue period.\n\n53\n00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.030\nThen that information should always\nstay the same, it should never change.\n\n54\n00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.080\nThe dog is blue no period.\n\n55\n00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.310\nThe blue is dog, whatever that may be,\n\n56\n00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.910\nhowever we modify that, is a change in\nthe integrity status of the information.\n\n57\n00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.840\nIntegrity becomes important,\nbecause when information is modified,\n\n58\n00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.020\nthe meaning of the information may change.\n\n59\n00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.742\nAnd if the meaning changes, then as a\nresult of that, we may not really be able\n\n60\n00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:11.220\nto communicate effectively what the intent\nof that message or that information was.\n\n61\n00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.410\nWe'll talk about methods that help us\ndo both, focus on confidentiality and\n\n62\n00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.810\nintegrity in upcoming conversations, but\nwe'll talk about things such as encryption\n\n63\n00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.600\nand the use of public and\nprivate key encryption, symmetric,\n\n64\n00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.740\nasymmetric solutions to\nprovide confidentiality.\n\n65\n00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.480\nAnd we'll talk about integrity mechanisms,\nthings like hashing and\n\n66\n00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.030\ndigital signatures,\nin order to be able to provide integrity,\n\n67\n00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.270\nas well as nonrepudiaton and\nproof of origin.\n\n68\n00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.940\nAnd we'll be talking about those\nthings in relation to integrity in\n\n69\n00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.310\nupcoming conversations as well.\n\n70\n00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.655\nWhen we think about availability of that,\nwe think about just what that implies.\n\n71\n00:03:45.655 --> 00:03:48.810\nData is there, we could see it,\nwe use it, we interact with it.\n\n72\n00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.043\nBut on demand and most importantly,\nwhen necessary for\n\n73\n00:03:52.043 --> 00:03:55.086\nthose that are authorized\nto be able to see the data.\n\n74\n00:03:55.086 --> 00:03:58.790\nSo if Mike is authorized right, and\nMike and I are having a conversation,\n\n75\n00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.378\nthen Mike should be able\nto interact with the data.\n\n76\n00:04:01.378 --> 00:04:06.178\nIf Mike is only authorized to see the data\nbetween, let's say, normal business hours,\n\n77\n00:04:06.178 --> 00:04:08.553\nnine to five, let's say hypothetically.\n\n78\n00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:13.142\nThen, if it's outside that window, Mike\nshould not have access to the data and\n\n79\n00:04:13.142 --> 00:04:18.075\navailability controls should ensure, in\nthis case, something we know as a temporal\n\n80\n00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:21.981\ncontrol, a time based control,\nshould ensure or somehow kick in,\n\n81\n00:04:21.981 --> 00:04:26.390\nand prevent Mike from seeing the data\noutside the nine to five window.\n\n82\n00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.840\nThis is what we think about when\nwe think about availability,\n\n83\n00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.190\nbut in addition we also focus on things\nhaving to do with business continuity,\n\n84\n00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.160\ndisaster recovery, things like being\nable to have redundancy in our systems.\n\n85\n00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.360\nSo if Mike needs to see the data, but\nMike's using a wireless network connection\n\n86\n00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.430\nto get to the data, what if\nthe wireless network stops working?\n\n87\n00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.730\nAvailability is all about making sure\nthat, that network has a redundant path,\n\n88\n00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.720\na secondary solution that would allow\nMike, maybe with a wired connection or\n\n89\n00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.290\na backup access point that would\nkick in if the first one failed or\n\n90\n00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.680\nwhatever we talk about to insure\nthat Mike can still see the data,\n\n91\n00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.960\nif he's authorized to during the period\nof time, all those kind of things.\n\n92\n00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.190\nSo when we think about confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability\n\n93\n00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.710\nas we start our conversations off, these\nare probably the most critical elements.\n\n94\n00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.600\nThe most critical things\nwe have to focus on.\n\n95\n00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.270\nIf we know about those things,\n\n96\n00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.790\nwe're gonna be able to then have all\nthe wide ranging conversations about,\n\n97\n00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.260\nas you heard, risk, compliance,\ngovernance, what we call GRC activities.\n\n98\n00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.075\nBut in addition, we're also gonna\nbe able to make sure that we're\n\n99\n00:05:27.075 --> 00:05:29.841\nfocusing on the mission critical systems,\nand how to manage them\n\n100\n00:05:29.841 --> 00:05:32.950\nas well as the mission critical data,\nand how to manage them as well.\n\n101\n00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.050\nAnd all these things together form the\nbasis of information security management,\n\n102\n00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.970\nand as CISSP candidates and\n\n103\n00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.650\nultimately when you are successful\nwith certifying CISSPs.\n\n104\n00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.420\nThis becomes the mantra, this becomes the\nthing that we constantly come back to and\n\n105\n00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.710\nrefer to,\nin regards to security management.\n\n106\n00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.330\nWhen we build something known as the ISMS,\n\n107\n00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.850\nthe information security\nmanagement system.\n\n108\n00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.030\nWhich there are ISO\nstandards to talk about.\n\n109\n00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.840\nWe'll, at some point later as we\ntalk about some of these standards,\n\n110\n00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.590\nmention ISO 27001 and\n27002 with regards to this.\n\n111\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.810\nWhen you think about building a holistic\nsystem to manage information security,\n\n112\n00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.060\nwe think about the ideas of\nconfidentiality, integrity, and\n\n113\n00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.720\navailability, and how they come\ntogether to be able to do that.\n\n114\n00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.910\nAnd this is part of that whole\nconversation that we're thinking about and\n\n115\n00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.490\nthe whole idea behind this is\nwhat we're really getting at.\n\n116\n00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.910\nSo as we think about aligning strategy,\nthink about aligning governance,\n\n117\n00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.350\nthink about the goals, missions and\n\n118\n00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.060\nobjectives of the organization, we have\nto really think about what that means.\n\n119\n00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.110\nIs it enough to say,\nwe're just gonna focus on confidentiality?\n\n120\n00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.480\nDoes the business have integrity and\navailability needs?\n\n121\n00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.640\nAnd more often than not, we find they do.\n\n122\n00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.780\nDoes the business have availability\nneeds that are being met?\n\n123\n00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.990\nDo we have to worry about whether or\nnot there are new emerging threats and\n\n124\n00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.950\ntechnologies that may do the job better,\nor may put our data at risk?\n\n125\n00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.580\nAnd these are things that\nsecurity professionals today,\n\n126\n00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.770\nthat we're constantly thinking about,\nthat are constantly on our mind.\n\n127\n00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.835\nIs our data secure?\n\n128\n00:06:56.835 --> 00:06:59.710\nIf the answer is yes,\nthe answer really is yes,\n\n129\n00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.680\nbut it's secured today\nunder these conditions.\n\n130\n00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.300\nNot, it's always secure, and\nit's always secure no matter what.\n\n131\n00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.224\nAnd as a result of that, we come to really\nthink about and talk about the fact that\n\n132\n00:07:10.224 --> 00:07:14.410\nsecurity's an ever evolving,\never emerging thought process.\n\n133\n00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:17.970\nAnd if we think of it as a frozen moment\nin time, what we often find is that we\n\n134\n00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.490\nmiss the general warning signs,\nright, the red flags,\n\n135\n00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:24.870\nthe things that we have to look at\nas practitioners, as professionals.\n\n136\n00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.658\nAnd we're not making the policies,\n\n137\n00:07:26.658 --> 00:07:29.554\nwe're not focusing on the areas\nthat we have to be aware of.\n\n138\n00:07:29.554 --> 00:07:32.042\nFor instance, think about,\nas you're listening to us and\n\n139\n00:07:32.042 --> 00:07:35.800\ngoing through the conversations with us,\nwhat you're doing with cloud technologies.\n\n140\n00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.957\nWhat you're doing with the Internet\nof things and convergence.\n\n141\n00:07:38.957 --> 00:07:41.060\nWhat you're doing with virtualization.\n\n142\n00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.743\nWhat you're doing with these kinds of\ntechnologies that are probably known to\n\n143\n00:07:44.743 --> 00:07:47.864\nmost of you, but five years ago,\nif we'd had this conversation,\n\n144\n00:07:47.864 --> 00:07:51.270\nwould've been theoretical talking\npoints about technology that may or\n\n145\n00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.261\nmay not have made sense and\nprobably wasn't widely deployed.\n\n146\n00:07:54.261 --> 00:07:57.411\nAt least not the convergence\ntechnologies we talk about today.\n\n147\n00:07:57.411 --> 00:08:00.042\nBeing able to manage\neverything with an app and\n\n148\n00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:03.146\nhaving an app that does multiple\nthings Is very easy for\n\n149\n00:08:03.146 --> 00:08:06.802\nus as security professionals,\nit's easy for us as consumers.\n\n150\n00:08:06.802 --> 00:08:09.870\nBut what does it mean for us from\nan information security standpoint?\n\n151\n00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.390\nIt can mean a lot of things.\n\n152\n00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.080\nIt means there's potentially risk,\nit means there's potentially governance,\n\n153\n00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.940\npotentially compliance concerns\nthat we have to focus on.\n\n154\n00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.930\nAnd integrating all of\nthese into our business and\n\n155\n00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.680\nour thought processes everyday is part\nof what we talk about when we identify,\n\n156\n00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.160\nand ultimately as a result of identifying.\n\n157\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.410\nLearn how to better track and\nmanage confidentiality, integrity,\n\n158\n00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.540\nand availability concerns.\n\n159\n00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:35.750\nSo thinking about how to align\nsecurity function of the business\n\n160\n00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.830\nwith the overall goals is a very\nimportant thought process.\n\n161\n00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.320\nSo do this for just a second, think\nthrough this in your world, if you will,\n\n162\n00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.140\nand Mike's gonna play along with me, and\nwe're gonna have a little contest here.\n\n163\n00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.140\nSo what I want you to think\nabout is the following, right?\n\n164\n00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:52.610\nAs a security professional or as somebody\nwho's looking to become one, right?\n\n165\n00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:53.910\nEither way, doesn't really matter.\n\n166\n00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.010\nBut as somebody who is\nan IT focused on security,\n\n167\n00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.270\nhow good are you at identifying need?\n\n168\n00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.120\nAnd let's think about need,\nlet's talk about need for a minute, right?\n\n169\n00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:06.500\nI have, as Mike knows, a need for\nespresso at various points in my day.\n\n170\n00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.620\nIt's very important to me, right?\n\n171\n00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.950\nSo I have clearly defined needs\nwhen I'm doing this kind of\n\n172\n00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.210\ndiscussion with you, right?\n\n173\n00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.830\nIn order to be chipper up and\nfocused and hyperfocused on material and\n\n174\n00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.900\nreally animated, I have to have at least\none espresso before I talk to you.\n\n175\n00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.000\nSo-\n>> [LAUGH] Wait, one?\n\n176\n00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.230\n>> Well, only one,\nmore than one maybe, but at least one.\n\n177\n00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.120\nWe take care of that, right.\n\n178\n00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.710\nI have a need, it's been identified,\nwe service that need.\n\n179\n00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.840\nDo you know what the needs\nof your business are?\n\n180\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.350\nDo you understand the security needs of\nthe technology's and the information that\n\n181\n00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:38.888\nyou have been asked for or will be asked,\nas a CISSP, to take on the notch.\n\n182\n00:09:38.888 --> 00:09:43.270\nAnd if the answer is, I think I do Adam,\nbut I'm not real sure, well,\n\n183\n00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:47.270\nthat might be a problem because\nthe business has clearly defined needs.\n\n184\n00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:49.630\nAnd whether you realize them,\nwhether you understand them,\n\n185\n00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.280\nwhether you're aware of them or\nnot, they are there.\n\n186\n00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.500\nAnd so one of the things,\nas a security professional,\n\n187\n00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.270\nwe have to get you to start thinking\nabout is how do you identify need and\n\n188\n00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.880\nyou have to do that by asking questions.\n\n189\n00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.440\nI mean,\nthis is really fairly straight forward.\n\n190\n00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.590\nYou've been doing this probably\nmost of your adult life.\n\n191\n00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.280\nYou've been asking these\nkind of questions,\n\n192\n00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.470\nyou learned about them in school most\nlikely, they're the five Ws and the H.\n\n193\n00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.390\nThe traditional who, what,\nwhen, where, why, and how.\n\n194\n00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.570\nAnd we often ask those question\nintuitively or at least,\n\n195\n00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:19.660\nwe think about them intuitively\nas we examine the situation.\n\n196\n00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.890\nWhat we tend not to do and\nwhat is the really important skill for\n\n197\n00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.360\nan information security professional\nto figure out how to master\n\n198\n00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.150\nis to take the information coming\nback from those questions.\n\n199\n00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.340\nAnd put it into some sort\nof ongoing dialogue and\n\n200\n00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.800\nhave a dialogue and\na dialogue is a conversation, right?\n\n201\n00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:40.540\nAnd conversation between Mike and I about\nsecurity may go something like this.\n\n202\n00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.660\nSo, Mike, let's talk about a security\nneed for just a second, right?\n\n203\n00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.350\nSo when we think about a security need,\nwhat we're thinking about is the ability\n\n204\n00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:52.180\nto understand how to understand or\nidentify a problem or a concern.\n\n205\n00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.340\nSo if I say to Mike,\n\n206\n00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.952\nMike, what's the current security problem\nthat your business is focused on?\n\n207\n00:10:56.952 --> 00:10:59.570\nMike's gonna probably have\na laundry list of things.\n\n208\n00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:00.692\nI'm not sure what they are.\n\n209\n00:11:00.692 --> 00:11:02.550\nMike's gonna tell us at\nleast one of them right now.\n\n210\n00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.180\nSo what's one of the primary needs?\n\n211\n00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.790\n>> I've got to make sure that\nonly authorized people get access\n\n212\n00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:07.821\nto our course library.\n\n213\n00:11:07.821 --> 00:11:10.656\n>> Okay, so only authorized people\nshould get access to the course library,\n\n214\n00:11:10.656 --> 00:11:12.370\nthat's a really important need.\n\n215\n00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.756\nWell let's talk about that need for\n\n216\n00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:16.920\njust sec, let's develop this a little\nbit more is a conversation item.\n\n217\n00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.230\nSo in of itself, preventing unauthorized\npeople from getting access to the course\n\n218\n00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.570\nworld library, is that a need\nthat we can make actionable?\n\n219\n00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.650\nAnd this is a question\nyou have to ask yourself.\n\n220\n00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:30.640\nCan we clearly identify confidentiality,\nintegrity, and\n\n221\n00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.460\navailability concerns in there.\n\n222\n00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.000\nAnd we can, I think there's\ndefinitely all three in there, but\n\n223\n00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.860\nthe challenge is as stated, want to\nprevent unauthorized people from gaining\n\n224\n00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.950\naccess to that information,\nthe content library.\n\n225\n00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.230\nWe may have to dove a little deeper,\n\n226\n00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.980\nwe may have to do what's called\npeeling back the onion, right.\n\n227\n00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:51.300\nAnd getting to a more finite and\nmore baseline or granular thought process\n\n228\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:55.800\nto understand that need and categorize it,\nis an idea of drilling down.\n\n229\n00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.980\nWe talked about the thought process\nof the iterative question or\n\n230\n00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.480\nthe asking of why, right.\n\n231\n00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.440\nSo, if I say to Mike, okay,\nlet's clarify that a little bit.\n\n232\n00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.320\nMike, why is that important?\n\n233\n00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.370\nWhat's going on there, right?\n\n234\n00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.410\nAnd we gotta examine that a little bit.\n\n235\n00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.360\nI'm gonna start to develop more detail and\nwe may have to go through two or\n\n236\n00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.420\nthree iterations of this.\n\n237\n00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.310\nBecause Mike on the surface may be\nthinking in his mind as what we would\n\n238\n00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:20.650\nidentify very important term, the\nstakeholder, right, in this conversation.\n\n239\n00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.840\nMike's our customer,\nour stakeholder, it's his need.\n\n240\n00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.505\nHe representing the business, right?\n\n241\n00:12:25.505 --> 00:12:30.280\nMythical company, ABC.com or\nitpro.tv, or whatever.\n\n242\n00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.120\nBut if Mike's the stakeholder\nrepresenting the company,\n\n243\n00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.860\nMike's gonna be the spokesperson.\n\n244\n00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.320\nAnd Mike has to help me as the consultant,\nas a security professional,\n\n245\n00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.600\nto drill down and understand and\ndevelop that need.\n\n246\n00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.300\nAll right, so, we were just talking about\nthe fact way to identify a need and\n\n247\n00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.680\nyou heard Mike's telling me, right?\n\n248\n00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:48.300\nThat his need is,\nlet's control unauthorized access,\n\n249\n00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:53.160\nmaking sure nobody gets into the video\ncontent in the ITProTV library, right?\n\n250\n00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.290\nSo, if that's our overall need,\noverarching as the stakeholder\n\n251\n00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:01.830\nrepresenting ITProTV, the business,\nMike's told me, hey, this is my need.\n\n252\n00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.554\nBut here's a problem,\n\n253\n00:13:02.554 --> 00:13:06.160\nright, as security professionals, do we\nget the need nailed on the first try?\n\n254\n00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.130\nWell, we've got a need, but we've got\na very broad statement of need and\n\n255\n00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:12.040\nwhat we're gonna find is that\nwe probably have to drill down.\n\n256\n00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.860\nBecause what Mike's told me, in his mind,\nprobably makes a lot of sense.\n\n257\n00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.960\nI've told Adam what I need him to know.\n\n258\n00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.090\nHe is the security professional.\n\n259\n00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:20.150\nHe's gonna go out.\n\n260\n00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.413\nHe's gonna do whatever\nsecurity professionals do.\n\n261\n00:13:22.413 --> 00:13:24.671\nAnd he's gonna stop the bad\npeople from coming in and\n\n262\n00:13:24.671 --> 00:13:27.184\ntaking my content and\nstop the bad people from coming in and\n\n263\n00:13:27.184 --> 00:13:29.560\nseeing what they're not\nsupposed to unless they pay.\n\n264\n00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.740\nAnd then they become good people, right?\n\n265\n00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.470\nWhen they pay.\n\n266\n00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.700\nAnd so they're gonna do all that,\ncuz Adam knows how to do all that.\n\n267\n00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.900\nBut I'm sitting here in the conversation\nthinking, hey, Mike, the reality is\n\n268\n00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:41.320\nwhile I think I have a clue,\nI need to ask some additional questions.\n\n269\n00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:46.310\nBecause I'm not really sure what\nauthorized users mean in your world, for\n\n270\n00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:47.070\ninstance, right?\n\n271\n00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:49.330\nI have a sense but I may not know.\n\n272\n00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.000\nIs an authorized user somebody who's\npaid a fee to become a member?\n\n273\n00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.390\nIs an authorized user somebody who's\ndemoing and trying out the product?\n\n274\n00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:59.840\nThat may be a type of authorized user but\nthere may be a separate category.\n\n275\n00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.030\nAnd while they making\naccess to certain contents,\n\n276\n00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.350\nthey may not get access\nto all the content.\n\n277\n00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:08.240\nAnd what about availability, do authorize\nusers have access all the time?\n\n278\n00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.340\nIs there a window where maybe\nthey don't have access?\n\n279\n00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:13.160\nSo I gotta go back and\nask Mike some questions.\n\n280\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.979\nSo we're gonna go back at this again,\nright?\n\n281\n00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:17.278\nWe're gonna have another round of this and\nI'm gonna say to Mike.\n\n282\n00:14:17.278 --> 00:14:19.744\nMike, what is that, from your perspective,\n\n283\n00:14:19.744 --> 00:14:23.794\nreally ultimately means from your\nperspective in terms of availability and\n\n284\n00:14:23.794 --> 00:14:27.480\nbeing able to get in, and integrity,\nbeing able to safeguard data.\n\n285\n00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.250\nWhat are you thinking?\n\n286\n00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.460\nWhat does that really mean in your world,\nright?\n\n287\n00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.960\nAnd then we have to see what Mike says.\n\n288\n00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.800\nMike's gonna come back to me and\nsay the following, whatever Mike says.\n\n289\n00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.350\n>> Yeah, I would say like, well, I wanna\nmake sure that nobody is modifying or\n\n290\n00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:43.030\nusing my videos outside\nof our ITProTV library.\n\n291\n00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:47.941\nI do have to worry about some temporary,\nI want people to have some demo accounts.\n\n292\n00:14:47.941 --> 00:14:51.740\n>> Okay, so Mike helped me to identify\ntwo various specific things, right.\n\n293\n00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:55.150\nWe want some people that can come in\nwith some sort of restricted access,\n\n294\n00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.170\ndemos account or some kind.\n\n295\n00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.360\nBut in addition,\n\n296\n00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.390\nwe also wanna make sure that people\nare going to provide payment, right?\n\n297\n00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.110\nSo they'll be authorize through\nsome sort of transaction.\n\n298\n00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.590\nI'm guessing most likely on the web, but\n\n299\n00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.660\nwe would ask another round of question for\nthat.\n\n300\n00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:09.540\nSo you get the idea, right?\n\n301\n00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:10.660\nWe have to drill down.\n\n302\n00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.910\nMy point is it's not so simple on the\nsurface say, hey I've identified the need.\n\n303\n00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.818\nCustomer said something I have need,\nI'm gonna go and execute.\n\n304\n00:15:17.818 --> 00:15:21.760\nWhat identification of need is all\nabout is asking questions, iterating\n\n305\n00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.390\nthrough multiple rounds until you really\nget down to what we called root cause.\n\n306\n00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:28.310\nWe called that root question or\n\n307\n00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:33.040\nthe root cause of what the particular\nneed is, whatever it is.\n\n308\n00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.840\nAnd when Mike told me to establish that\nand then we go back and we go through,\n\n309\n00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.290\nwe make sure we agree.\n\n310\n00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:42.290\nWe really then can address\nconfidentiality, integrity and durability.\n\n311\n00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.920\nBut most importantly, we've figured out\nthe way to strategically align that\n\n312\n00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.012\nconversation with business requirements.\n\n313\n00:15:48.012 --> 00:15:50.515\nThis is a very important skill set for\n\n314\n00:15:50.515 --> 00:15:55.116\nthe CISSP in the real world as you\nstart to put these skills to bear and\n\n315\n00:15:55.116 --> 00:15:59.582\npractice and actually go out and\nuse them in your organizations.\n\n316\n00:15:59.582 --> 00:16:03.270\nYou're gonna have to make sure that\nyou are comfortable challenging\n\n317\n00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.549\nassumptions, right?\n\n318\n00:16:04.549 --> 00:16:07.833\nBecause the way we get to root cause,\nthe way we understand need,\n\n319\n00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:11.136\nis by asking questions and\nsometimes there are tough questions.\n\n320\n00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:15.499\nHey Mr. and Mrs. Stakeholder, Mr.\nCIO, Mrs. CIO, Mr. CTO, Mr.\n\n321\n00:16:15.499 --> 00:16:18.481\nand Mrs. Sea Level Executive,\nyou said this but\n\n322\n00:16:18.481 --> 00:16:21.558\nthey don't really know\nif that's what you mean.\n\n323\n00:16:21.558 --> 00:16:22.698\nSo we clarify.\n\n324\n00:16:22.698 --> 00:16:24.726\nAnd you obviously have to\ndo this in a tactful way,\n\n325\n00:16:24.726 --> 00:16:26.750\nyou have to do this in\na way that make sense.\n\n326\n00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:28.868\nBut the point is you have\nto challenge assumptions.\n\n327\n00:16:28.868 --> 00:16:32.595\nJust because the business says I\nwant this, doesn't mean that's\n\n328\n00:16:32.595 --> 00:16:37.012\nnecessary the thing they want or\nneed, or that is the best solution.\n\n329\n00:16:37.012 --> 00:16:40.970\nAnd as security professionals,\nwe have to stand on the front lines.\n\n330\n00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.270\nLogically and physically.\n\n331\n00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.490\nWe're gonna talk a lot\nabout the difference and\n\n332\n00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.450\ndistinction between that\nin our conversations.\n\n333\n00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:50.860\nBut the point at the end of the day is we\nstand between the good things inside and\n\n334\n00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.820\nthe bad things outside.\n\n335\n00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.350\nAnd we form what we call\na security perimeter.\n\n336\n00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.840\nAnd we use policies, and we use\nprocedures, and we use tools to manage and\n\n337\n00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.390\nto instantiate that perimeter and\nto ultimately make sure it sticks.\n\n338\n00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:04.610\nIt's our job to be relentless\nin our pursuit of understanding\n\n339\n00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:06.640\nwhat the boundaries of that\nperimeter need to be and\n\n340\n00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.910\ndefining it in a way that makes sense for\nthe business.\n\n341\n00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.320\nThis is a very important thought process\nas we talk about goals, missions, and\n\n342\n00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.900\nobjectives, and\nstrategically aligning them.\n\n343\n00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.720\nIf you ask your stakeholders,\nwhoever they are, in the business.\n\n344\n00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.650\nThe Mikes, in your business.\n\n345\n00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.890\nIf you ask them what are the goals\nof operational security?\n\n346\n00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.660\nWhat are the goals that we have to\nachieve for confidentiality, integrity,\n\n347\n00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.640\nand availability?\n\n348\n00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.710\nWhat's our mission?\n\n349\n00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:31.798\nWhat are our objectives?\n\n350\n00:17:31.798 --> 00:17:36.190\nIf you can break things down and answer\nthose questions, you've got a strategical,\n\n351\n00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.885\nyou've got an operational, and\nyou have a tactical view of the world.\n\n352\n00:17:39.885 --> 00:17:43.490\nThe strategic view\nare going to be the goals.\n\n353\n00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:48.530\nThe tactical view is gonna be ultimately\nwhat you do, and how you execute on them.\n\n354\n00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:53.200\nAnd the operational vision is gonna\nbe what stitches those two together.\n\n355\n00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.310\nSo the strategy being managed through\npolicy and procedure and being implemented\n\n356\n00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.530\nday to day is what we figure out how\nto ultimately distilled down and track.\n\n357\n00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:07.670\nStrategy, policy and purpose ultimately\nleading to execution is where we wanna be.\n\n358\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:11.050\nAnd if we can figure these things out,\nwe ultimately have a really good solution.\n\n359\n00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.460\nIf we can't then,\nwe may not have such a good one.\n\n360\n00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.570\nWe gotta go back to the well and\n\n361\n00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.370\ntry to figure out again,\nwhat ultimately we need to do.\n\n362\n00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.632\nThe relationship between security and\nrisk in other words,\n\n363\n00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:20.928\nis really what we're focused on.\n\n364\n00:18:20.928 --> 00:18:24.287\nAnd this idea of identifying\nconfidentiality, integrity and\n\n365\n00:18:24.287 --> 00:18:27.706\navailability, with regards to\nwhat it means to the business and\n\n366\n00:18:27.706 --> 00:18:31.908\nthe perspective of, or ultimately,\nthrough the lens of the context of risk.\n\n367\n00:18:31.908 --> 00:18:35.988\nIt's gonna be a recurring theme for us\nthroughout our conversations in all, and\n\n368\n00:18:35.988 --> 00:18:39.588\nacross all the domains of knowledge\nin the CISSP, all eight domains and\n\n369\n00:18:39.588 --> 00:18:43.000\nevery one of them in some way\nwill address and deal with risk.\n\n370\n00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.760\nIf we can't understand risk, if we don't\nknow what it is, even if it's staring\n\n371\n00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.940\nus in the face, if we're not aware of it,\nthen we're gonna have a problem.\n\n372\n00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.660\nWe're not managing it properly.\n\n373\n00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.550\nWe're not going to be able to identify\nit when it becomes an issue for us.\n\n374\n00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:59.020\nAnd we'll talk later on about\nvocabulary terms, like threat.\n\n375\n00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:04.990\nThreat actor, vector, vulnerability, risk\nexposure, this is the language of risk.\n\n376\n00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.380\nAnd we're gonna talk about these terms and\nidentify them.\n\n377\n00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.190\nBut we have to understand risk.\n\n378\n00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.950\nAnd risk ultimately, distilled down,\nbecomes the way we measure success or\n\n379\n00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:16.380\nfailure, within the thought process and\nthe business around security and\n\n380\n00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:17.560\nthe value it brings.\n\n381\n00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.420\nBut also, what security is\ndesigned to do and whether we've\n\n382\n00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:24.280\nbeen successful at achieving those end\nresults, or whatever they may look like.\n\n383\n00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.977\nAnd so, if you think about risks\nright now, it's kinda undefined,\n\n384\n00:19:27.977 --> 00:19:29.078\nunknown quantity.\n\n385\n00:19:29.078 --> 00:19:33.819\nOur goal with asking questions with\nasking who, what, when, where, why, and\n\n386\n00:19:33.819 --> 00:19:37.750\nhow, and walking through and\nexercise in identifying needs.\n\n387\n00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.370\nIt's really about starting\nto frame risks and\n\n388\n00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.540\nwe called it risk-framing for a reason.\n\n389\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.930\nWe identify the risks.\n\n390\n00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.108\nWe start to build the picture and\nframe out what that box looks like.\n\n391\n00:19:46.108 --> 00:19:49.879\nAnd as we put things into the box,\nwe're also leaving things outside the box.\n\n392\n00:19:49.879 --> 00:19:52.792\nSo the things that we kind of take,\npick up, and say, okay,\n\n393\n00:19:52.792 --> 00:19:54.750\nlet me put these three things in the box.\n\n394\n00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.630\nAnd whatever's in the box is here.\n\n395\n00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.960\nBut then all the other stuff\nthat exists out here is outside.\n\n396\n00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.730\nThen we can really start to\ntalk about what is important.\n\n397\n00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:04.300\nThings in the box become important.\n\n398\n00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.460\nWe focus on them.\n\n399\n00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:09.170\nThings that are outside of the box in\nthis other area, while they're important.\n\n400\n00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.050\nThey're not important right now in\nthe context of whatever risk we're\n\n401\n00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:12.980\nidentifying.\n\n402\n00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:16.010\nAnd, as a result of that,\nwe don't just totally ignore them.\n\n403\n00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:17.280\nWe don't forget about them.\n\n404\n00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.510\nBut we don't focus on them\nuntil they become necessary,\n\n405\n00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.268\nuntil they become important.\n\n406\n00:20:22.268 --> 00:20:26.460\nAnd when they do contextually, we take\nthem from outside, put them in the box,\n\n407\n00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.658\nand all of the sudden.\n\n408\n00:20:27.658 --> 00:20:29.880\nThey now become part of the conversation.\n\n409\n00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.700\nAnd by clearing segmenting, clearly\ndifferentiating, what things are inside,\n\n410\n00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:39.040\nor what things are outside, we can focus\nour energy, focus our resources, and\n\n411\n00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.740\nnot be distracted by things that may\nbe important, but are not timely.\n\n412\n00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.280\nAnd this is very big distinction for us.\n\n413\n00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.040\nBecause confidentiality, integrity, and\n\n414\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.890\navailability is something\nthat we can easily,\n\n415\n00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:54.580\neasily get wrong if we are distracted\nby things that are not appropriate\n\n416\n00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.270\nto the conversation contextually at\nthe time we try to apply controls.\n\n417\n00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.610\nAnd this has probably happened\nto all of us at some point.\n\n418\n00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:03.560\nYou'll think about your life just\ngenerically outside of class,\n\n419\n00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:08.070\noutside of this discussion, back at work,\nin your private life, whatever it is.\n\n420\n00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.990\nThink about a time where you had something\nyou had to do, but got distracted by\n\n421\n00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:16.010\nsomething else, and as a result of that,\nyou may have been taken off task.\n\n422\n00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:19.280\nAnd you may not have been able to\ncomplete that thing, whatever it was,\n\n423\n00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.440\nin a timely fashion.\n\n424\n00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.789\nMaybe you got to it, but maybe it\nwasn't as good as it could have been.\n\n425\n00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.310\nWe often refer to this as\nchasing purple squirrels or\n\n426\n00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.690\npurple unicorns, because they don't exist.\n\n427\n00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.810\nAnd the problem is while\nthese things outside the box,\n\n428\n00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:35.390\nright, that are not in the box, but\nthe things over here, they exist.\n\n429\n00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:36.948\nThey are real.\nYou're aware of them.\n\n430\n00:21:36.948 --> 00:21:40.488\nBut unless you put them in the box and\nunless you say I'm gonna focus on them.\n\n431\n00:21:40.488 --> 00:21:43.375\nThey don't exist for you at the moment\nin time when you're going through\n\n432\n00:21:43.375 --> 00:21:45.518\nthe exercise of dealing\nwith whatever's in the box.\n\n433\n00:21:45.518 --> 00:21:49.820\nAnd as a result, we have to be very\nfocused, very clear about what governance,\n\n434\n00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.238\nrisk, and compliance,\nwhat they call GRC activities, are.\n\n435\n00:21:53.238 --> 00:21:57.766\nAnd the focus that we have on them helps\nus to differentiate between what is\n\n436\n00:21:57.766 --> 00:21:58.578\nimportant.\n\n437\n00:21:58.578 --> 00:22:00.499\nBut not something we're taking on.\n\n438\n00:22:00.499 --> 00:22:02.598\nIn other words, nice to haves.\n\n439\n00:22:02.598 --> 00:22:04.298\nBut we don't need them right now.\n\n440\n00:22:04.298 --> 00:22:06.626\nAnd what's inside the box,\nwhat we're focused on and\n\n441\n00:22:06.626 --> 00:22:08.480\nwhat is gonna have to be dealt with.\n\n442\n00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.120\nThose are need to haves.\n\n443\n00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.950\nAnd the need to haves are things\nwe gotta deal with right away.\n\n444\n00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:15.550\nThe nice to haves are things that\nwe may bring in at some point,\n\n445\n00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.270\nwe may wanna deal with.\n\n446\n00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:19.510\nI may have four or five other needs.\n\n447\n00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.180\nIf I ask him,\nsure he's probably got a laundry list but\n\n448\n00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.560\nhe only said this is the one\nI wanna deal with right now.\n\n449\n00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.840\nSo for me,\nthat's gonna be the one I focus on.\n\n450\n00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.920\nThat goes in my box and\n\n451\n00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.940\nthat's what we as partners in this\nconversation ultimately deal with.\n\n452\n00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.560\nAnd then we exclude the others for\nthe moment,\n\n453\n00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.940\nthey don't become part of our focus,\nat least not right away, anyway.\n\n454\n00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.530\nAnd this is a really valuable exercise for\nyou to go through and think about.\n\n455\n00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:40.550\nThis is important.\n\n456\n00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:41.890\nIf you can nail this,\n\n457\n00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:46.390\nthen you can really focus in on some\nvery important thought processes.\n\n458\n00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:47.484\nFirst of all, IE.\n\n459\n00:22:47.484 --> 00:22:50.240\nThinking about identifying security\nroles and responsibilities.\n\n460\n00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:54.900\nWho's gonna be responsible for\nultimately implementing security.\n\n461\n00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.300\nIs it gonna be the stakeholder?\n\n462\n00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:59.520\nSomebody like Mike, who's gonna\ntell me what the business needs?\n\n463\n00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.320\nWell, they're gonna play a part.\n\n464\n00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.530\nWe're gonna partner, but\n\n465\n00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:05.890\nthey're not gonna be hands on every day\nin the trenches implementing security.\n\n466\n00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.390\nIs it gonna be me as\nthe security professional?\n\n467\n00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:11.470\nI'm gonna play a role, but there's\nalso gonna be other people as I said.\n\n468\n00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:13.570\nThere's gonna be security practitioners.\n\n469\n00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.640\nPeople that are pulling levers,\ndealing with firewalls,\n\n470\n00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.220\nin the trenches everyday hands on.\n\n471\n00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:22.110\nAnd there's gonna be different levels\nof actors in the security conversation.\n\n472\n00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:23.200\nPeople that are enforcing and\n\n473\n00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.700\ndealing with creating policy,\nthat are more strategic in focus.\n\n474\n00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.110\nA CISSP falls into this category.\n\n475\n00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:33.050\nPeople that are dealing with implementing\npolicy and taking procedures and\n\n476\n00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.540\nfollowing them everyday.\n\n477\n00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.200\nAnd people that are practitioners\nfall into this category.\n\n478\n00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.520\nSo somebody that may be a front\nline support professional.\n\n479\n00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.408\nSomebody who may be a systems engineer\nthat gets escalated up the chain for\n\n480\n00:23:44.408 --> 00:23:46.200\nsome problem resolution.\n\n481\n00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.088\nThose are gonna be practitioners.\n\n482\n00:23:48.088 --> 00:23:52.159\nSenior managers, people that are dealing\nwith policy, that are monitoring,\n\n483\n00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:55.926\nthat are implementing are going to be\nthe people optimally they oversee,\n\n484\n00:23:55.926 --> 00:23:58.980\nthat are the security managers,\nthe professionals.\n\n485\n00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.893\nThis is where the CISSP is\ngoing to focus their attention.\n\n486\n00:24:02.893 --> 00:24:07.237\nAnd to be clear, CISSPs may roll up their\nsleeves and go in and be practitioners.\n\n487\n00:24:07.237 --> 00:24:09.028\nThey may come from that background.\n\n488\n00:24:09.028 --> 00:24:12.023\nI've been a CISSP for a very long time.\n\n489\n00:24:12.023 --> 00:24:15.947\nAnd I started out life many, many years\nago, over 30 years ago in my IT career,\n\n490\n00:24:15.947 --> 00:24:17.103\nbeing a practitioner,\n\n491\n00:24:17.103 --> 00:24:20.820\nbecause that's how I learned how\nto do all the things that I do.\n\n492\n00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.900\nI got into the day-to-day activities.\n\n493\n00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.800\nAnd I rolled up my sleeves and I\nimplemented firewalls, and I put IDSs and\n\n494\n00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.630\nIPSs in place, intrusion detection,\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n495\n00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:34.200\nI went ahead and\nI learned how to read logs.\n\n496\n00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.390\nAnd I went ahead and\nlearned how to do network monitoring.\n\n497\n00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.200\nI learned how to do captures of\npackets and examine what they are.\n\n498\n00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.690\nAll the stuff that security\npractitioners do everyday.\n\n499\n00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:45.280\nBut when I got good at all that, I then\ndecided I had to be able to do more.\n\n500\n00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.210\nHow do I write policy?\n\n501\n00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:47.190\nHow do I identify need?\n\n502\n00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.690\nHow do I do those kind of things?\n\n503\n00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:51.540\nAnd those are things that I also learned\nhow to do and get better at, and\n\n504\n00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.850\nover time that becomes important.\n\n505\n00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.320\nWe talked about some control frameworks.\n\n506\n00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.520\nYou heard me mention ISO 27001 and\n27002 briefly with regards to the ISMS,\n\n507\n00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.530\nthe Information Security Management System\nthat we built.\n\n508\n00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.140\nAnd the idea of identifying\nconfidentiality, integrity and\n\n509\n00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.720\navailability is really about putting\nthose things into the proper areas, or\n\n510\n00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.620\nsilos inside the ISMS.\n\n511\n00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.870\nAnd using standards like ISO,\nusing NIST guidance,\n\n512\n00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.170\nwe'll talk about NIST over time as well.\n\n513\n00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:24.910\nAnd using other areas, maybe the OECD\neight guiding principles on privacy, for\n\n514\n00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:25.700\ninstance.\n\n515\n00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.230\nIf you're not familiar with them,\nstay tuned,\n\n516\n00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.810\nwe're going to talk about those in\none of our upcoming conversations.\n\n517\n00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:33.400\nYou may be familiar with things like\nthe Wassenaar Arrangement, you may not be.\n\n518\n00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.370\nIf you're not familiar with Wassenaar,\n\n519\n00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.920\nwe'll mention that in one of our\nupcoming discussions as well.\n\n520\n00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:42.200\nThese are all areas where IT security\nprofessionals can gain guidance about\n\n521\n00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.630\nwhether it's controls for IT systems\nin export, Wassenaar deals with that.\n\n522\n00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:49.650\nWhether it is guardians on\nhow to implement privacy and\n\n523\n00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.260\nmanage privacy which regards to\ndata security confidentiality.\n\n524\n00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.000\nAll things like we always see the guarded\nprinciples to deal with that.\n\n525\n00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.200\nWhether it's building the overall\narching framework in the ecosystem\n\n526\n00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.580\nof information security.\n\n527\n00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.372\nThe ISO 27000 one and\ntwo standards deal with that,\n\n528\n00:26:03.372 --> 00:26:06.140\nas to a lot of NIST\nguidance that's available.\n\n529\n00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:10.596\nNIST 800 and NIST SP 800 160,\nI always trip over that.\n\n530\n00:26:10.596 --> 00:26:13.670\nNIST SP 800 160 for\ninstance, one document.\n\n531\n00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:17.380\nYou may at some point want to go look up,\nis all about supply chain risk and\n\n532\n00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.540\nmanaging risk up and\ndown the supply chain.\n\n533\n00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:25.020\nNIST SP 800 39, 37 R1, 53R4,\nthese are all different\n\n534\n00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:30.030\ndocuments that deal with elements\nof risk and identification of risk.\n\n535\n00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.600\nBoth from a control perspective as well as\nfrom within the general framework of how\n\n536\n00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.670\nto implement risk management and\nrisk identification.\n\n537\n00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.460\nThese are all things that could be helpful\nto the information security management\n\n538\n00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.900\nprofessional, and\nthis is what a CISSP does.\n\n539\n00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.940\nThis is the bread and butter of the kind\nof things that we have to think about.\n\n540\n00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.960\nHow we measure and how we ultimately\nidentify value is all about how we measure\n\n541\n00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.490\nand identify concerns and needs, quantify\nthem, and then ultimately show whether or\n\n542\n00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:56.910\nnot we are able to be successful at\nmeasuring through that quantification,\n\n543\n00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.780\nthrough that measurement,\nultimately show success or\n\n544\n00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.570\nfailure in terms of our implementation and\n\n545\n00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:05.410\nultimately the value that brings in\nterms of the protection that we provide.\n\n546\n00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.310\nAnd to that end,\nwhat we also have to think about, so\n\n547\n00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:12.330\nwe have to make sure we think about\nthe ideas of due care and due diligence.\n\n548\n00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.190\nAnd the idea of due care is really\nsomething that's important,\n\n549\n00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.430\ndue diligence as well.\n\n550\n00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.660\nBut due care and due diligence are often\nthings that people get confused.\n\n551\n00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.850\nAnd they're not really sure or\nclear how to define them, right.\n\n552\n00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:24.100\nAnd I could put Mike on the spot and\n\n553\n00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:28.420\nask him to offer us a definition without\ngiving him the opportunity of studying and\n\n554\n00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:30.270\nlooking up one, but we're not going\nto do that because I like Mike.\n\n555\n00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.963\n>> Thank you.\n>> So what we're going to do, right,\n\n556\n00:27:31.963 --> 00:27:34.460\nis instead we're going just\njointly give you the definition,\n\n557\n00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:35.830\nkind of share it with you here.\n\n558\n00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.750\nBecause it is important to really\nunderstand these terms and get them right.\n\n559\n00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:42.600\nIf you can do that up front, all the other\nthings we talk about become real clear,\n\n560\n00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.890\nbecause you understand\nthe focus on the role.\n\n561\n00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:46.680\nIf you're not clear on due care and\ndue diligence,\n\n562\n00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.420\nit's a little bit harder to\nunderstand certain things right.\n\n563\n00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.075\nIf we think about due care, we often\ntalk about the care that are reason\n\n564\n00:27:53.075 --> 00:27:56.255\nperson would use in order to\napproach a problem or a concern.\n\n565\n00:27:56.255 --> 00:28:01.405\nSo you or I or Mike or anybody who is\nan IT professional, thinking about looking\n\n566\n00:28:01.405 --> 00:28:05.707\nat a problem and saying how am I going to\napproach this, what would I do, right?\n\n567\n00:28:05.707 --> 00:28:07.337\nThis is the idea of due care.\n\n568\n00:28:07.337 --> 00:28:11.157\nIt's that standard that reasonable\nperson's standard we talked about, right.\n\n569\n00:28:11.157 --> 00:28:14.117\nThe idea would be that under any\ngiven certain circumstances,\n\n570\n00:28:14.117 --> 00:28:15.919\nwhat are the actions I would engage in,\n\n571\n00:28:15.919 --> 00:28:19.157\nin order to deal with this concern\non this problem, that is due care.\n\n572\n00:28:20.167 --> 00:28:23.717\nFor instance, would I take a pair\nof scissors off the shelf and\n\n573\n00:28:23.717 --> 00:28:26.410\nwould I run around with them in my hands,\nright?\n\n574\n00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:29.400\nMom always said don't run with scissors,\nit's a bad thing, don't do that.\n\n575\n00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.050\nRight?\n\n576\n00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:31.800\nAnd if you did, you would get hurt.\n\n577\n00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.630\nRight?\nJust like don't play with fire, right?\n\n578\n00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:37.110\nSo the idea is that ultimately\ndue care is all about making sure\n\n579\n00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:38.840\nthat you don't run with scissors.\n\n580\n00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.850\nRight?\nAs an example.\n\n581\n00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:41.780\nThat would be an exercise in due care.\n\n582\n00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.700\nSo in the IT security world, due care\nwould be make sure we have defense and\n\n583\n00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.220\ndepth overlapping control\nelements to protect a system.\n\n584\n00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.570\nSo we don't rely on simply one\nsolution that potentially could, or\n\n585\n00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:55.955\ncould not be up to the task.\n\n586\n00:28:55.955 --> 00:28:57.900\nBecause somebody may\nbreach that control and\n\n587\n00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.770\nif they do, we don't have anything\nelse standing there behind it.\n\n588\n00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:02.130\nThen somebody's going to get in.\n\n589\n00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:04.080\nBack to Mike's need earlier, right?\n\n590\n00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.150\nKeep the bad actors,\n\n591\n00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:08.150\nthe people that don't belong seeking\nthe content, out of the library.\n\n592\n00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:12.280\nWell if all we did was use a username and\na password, single factor, a single access\n\n593\n00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:17.290\ncontrol factor, then due care may not be\nexercised properly, because the reality\n\n594\n00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:21.320\nis we probably needed to exercise\nmore then one control in that case.\n\n595\n00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:26.220\nWhen we think about due diligence, we\nthink about doing lots of different things\n\n596\n00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.150\nto make sure that we are implementing\npolicy, we're implementing procedure for\n\n597\n00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.510\nthings going, for\nbeing done the way they should be.\n\n598\n00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.990\nSo, due diligence is\nall about the oversight\n\n599\n00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.680\nmaking sure that we\nare implementing properly.\n\n600\n00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.310\nSo, for instance, if Mike is our\nstakeholder in our example and\n\n601\n00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:44.540\nhe says to me, Adam here's my need and\nwe've identified that.\n\n602\n00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.640\nFrom a due care perspective\nyou've identified five or\n\n603\n00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.850\nsix controls that will be helpful to\nmake sure we're doing those things.\n\n604\n00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:53.140\nDue diligence is all about making\nsure that we implement those and\n\n605\n00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:57.110\nwe spot check continuously to ensure that\nthey're actually being applied properly.\n\n606\n00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.760\nMike has a responsibility under\ndue diligence as a stake holder to\n\n607\n00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.920\nbe involved in that.\n\n608\n00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:05.490\nBut I do also as the professional to\nensure that they're being done correctly.\n\n609\n00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:08.630\nAnd I also have a due diligence\nresponsibility to Mike,\n\n610\n00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:11.480\nto the business as a stakeholder,\nto go back and report to him and\n\n611\n00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.170\nsay hey Mike, by the way,\nhere's what we're doing, right?\n\n612\n00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.840\nAnd here are the controls\nwe've put in place.\n\n613\n00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.890\nDue care and due diligence together\nare critical for us to understand,\n\n614\n00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:25.490\nbecause if we exercise both and we\nascribe the right level of focus to both,\n\n615\n00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.220\nwe're going to build a much\nmore secure solution.\n\n616\n00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.526\n>> Very good Adam,\nthat's a lot of great information.\n\n617\n00:30:30.526 --> 00:30:32.440\nI just want to thank you for\nnot putting me on the spot and\n\n618\n00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:36.630\ndifferentiating between due care and due\ndiligence, but I think we can do that now.\n\n619\n00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:39.700\nA really good look at some of those\nterminology that we're going to have to be\n\n620\n00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.840\nfamiliar with as a CISSP.\n\n621\n00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:44.750\nLearning about risk management and\n\n622\n00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:49.570\nthe triad there with confidentiality,\navailability, and integrity, and\n\n623\n00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:53.260\nreally showing us that we've got to\nbe the ones that get in there and\n\n624\n00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.830\nask those questions and sometimes\nthat first question isn't enough.\n\n625\n00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:01.090\nI like the way Adam puts it, we've got to\npeel back those layers to really find out\n\n626\n00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:06.625\nwhat the needs are in those different\nareas as we apply our different controls.\n\n627\n00:31:06.625 --> 00:31:09.435\nSo, fantastic stuff there,\nAdam, we appreciate that.\n\n628\n00:31:09.435 --> 00:31:11.575\nThat is going to do it for this episode.\n\n629\n00:31:11.575 --> 00:31:16.005\nRemember, if you want to attend\none of Adam's live classes,\n\n630\n00:31:16.005 --> 00:31:19.493\nshoot an email over to SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n631\n00:31:19.493 --> 00:31:22.835\nThat's going to do it for this episode,\nsigning off, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n632\n00:31:22.835 --> 00:31:23.850\n>> I'm not, I'm Adam.\n\n633\n00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.113\n>> [LAUGH] We'll see you next time.\n\n634\n00:31:25.113 --> 00:31:26.369\n>> See you later, guys.\n\n635\n00:31:26.369 -->

--> 00:00:20.186\nI'm your host Mike Roderick, and\ntoday we're going over CISSP.\n\n4\n00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:24.301\nAnd we're working in domain one\nsecurity and risk management.\n\n5\n00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:27.470\nAnd specifically,\nwe're gonna take a look at compliance.\n\n6\n00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.950\nAnd Adam, there's a lot of\ndifferent types of compliance.\n\n7\n00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.490\nWe've got legislative and\nprivacy requirements compliance.\n\n8\n00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.645\nAnd hopefully, you're here, you're gonna\nhelp us wade our way through this.\n\n9\n00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:40.363\n>> Well, we'll do our best,\nobviously, right?\n\n10\n00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:41.331\nAnd we'll try to figure that out.\n\n11\n00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:45.792\nSo when we think about compliance, what\nwe're ultimately thinking about Is this\n\n12\n00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:49.557\nidea of being able to go in and\ndecide what we have to focus on, right.\n\n13\n00:00:49.557 --> 00:00:54.507\nThe general thought process in information\nsecurity is that somebody somewhere has\n\n14\n00:00:54.507 --> 00:00:55.701\ncome up with a plan.\n\n15\n00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:57.140\nMay not be us, right.\n\n16\n00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.942\nBut ultimately, somebody somewhere has\ngiven us some of the called/ guidance.\n\n17\n00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:03.808\nAnd guidance is a really important\nterm when it comes to compliance.\n\n18\n00:01:03.808 --> 00:01:09.234\nBecause what guidance indicates is that\nsomebody has laid out a set of steps,\n\n19\n00:01:09.234 --> 00:01:11.748\nprocedures, thought processes.\n\n20\n00:01:11.748 --> 00:01:14.463\nWe confer to them different ways,\nbut, ultimately, a path.\n\n21\n00:01:14.463 --> 00:01:17.481\nAnd when we think about a path,\nwe have to know where it starts.\n\n22\n00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:21.582\nWe have to know what it looks like, how\nfar down the road we can get on that path,\n\n23\n00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:22.962\nand what the endpoint is.\n\n24\n00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:25.913\nAnd when we translate that\ninto information security,\n\n25\n00:01:25.913 --> 00:01:29.126\nwhat we're thinking about is\nhow we measure, ultimately.\n\n26\n00:01:29.126 --> 00:01:31.065\nMetrics are very important to do this.\n\n27\n00:01:31.065 --> 00:01:36.243\nHow we measure, ultimately, whether or not\nwe are successful at pursuing something.\n\n28\n00:01:36.243 --> 00:01:41.587\nAnd compliance is specifically about\naligning with whatever the requirements\n\n29\n00:01:41.587 --> 00:01:46.702\nare to ensure success, typically driven\nby legal or regulatory concerns.\n\n30\n00:01:46.702 --> 00:01:52.388\nSo, we may be compliant with the standard\nthat says that all of our information must\n\n31\n00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:57.682\nbe stored in encrypted fashion when\nit's at rest, what we call data at rest.\n\n32\n00:01:57.682 --> 00:01:59.903\nIf data at rest has to be encrypted,\n\n33\n00:01:59.903 --> 00:02:04.124\nthen the compliance issue is about\nwhether we are encrypting data,\n\n34\n00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:08.287\nunder what circumstances, at rest,\nso we have to validate that.\n\n35\n00:02:08.287 --> 00:02:11.406\nUsing what kind of encryption,\nis the encryption we're using up to\n\n36\n00:02:11.406 --> 00:02:13.941\nthe standard or\nstandards that have been stipulated.\n\n37\n00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:15.403\nThere may be more than one choice.\n\n38\n00:02:15.403 --> 00:02:17.104\nWe’d have to figure out what that is.\n\n39\n00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:22.184\nAnd as a result of that, do we have what\nwe call traceability, and do we have\n\n40\n00:02:22.184 --> 00:02:27.610\nvisibility as well as accountability\nassigned and described to this process.\n\n41\n00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.421\nCan we go in, in other words?\n\n42\n00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:33.356\nAnd can we validate, really at any\nmoment's time, at any point in time,\n\n43\n00:02:33.356 --> 00:02:36.224\nthat the data is indeed\nencrypted when it's at rest?\n\n44\n00:02:36.224 --> 00:02:38.069\nIs it encrypted at the proper strength?\n\n45\n00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.983\nDo we have the information surrounding\nthat encryption documented so\n\n46\n00:02:41.983 --> 00:02:43.653\nwe know how it's being done?\n\n47\n00:02:43.653 --> 00:02:47.055\nThese are the things that\ncompliance may require us to do.\n\n48\n00:02:47.055 --> 00:02:51.652\nCompliance is typically, as I said,\nlegally going to be driven by or\n\n49\n00:02:51.652 --> 00:02:54.682\naligned with regulatory or legal concerns.\n\n50\n00:02:54.682 --> 00:02:58.443\nSo when we often hear people talk\nabout compliance, when you, security\n\n51\n00:02:58.443 --> 00:03:02.824\nprofessionals, have conversations about\ncompliance, what we should be thinking\n\n52\n00:03:02.824 --> 00:03:06.670\nabout is whether or not there is a\nstandard that we have to be aligned with.\n\n53\n00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.688\nSome sort of law that we\nmay have to be aware of.\n\n54\n00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:13.078\nAnd how we then will go through and\nthink about what those things may be.\n\n55\n00:03:13.078 --> 00:03:16.462\nSo, for instance, in the United States,\nin North America,\n\n56\n00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:20.890\nspecifically within the U.S., we have\ncertain legislative requirements for\n\n57\n00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.900\nthe protection and\nconfidentiality of information.\n\n58\n00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.754\nWe have HIPPA,\n\n59\n00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:28.911\nwhich is going to deal with information\nin the healthcare sector, right?\n\n60\n00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:32.913\nSo we're gonna focus on patient's privacy\nand their electronic records are,\n\n61\n00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:35.492\nelectronic medical records and\nthe focus on that.\n\n62\n00:03:35.492 --> 00:03:37.367\nIf we're thinking about\nGramm Leach Bliley,\n\n63\n00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:39.203\nwe're thinking about the Bank Secrecy Act.\n\n64\n00:03:39.203 --> 00:03:42.025\nWe're thinking about financial\ninformation being safeguarded.\n\n65\n00:03:42.025 --> 00:03:45.074\nIf we think about FERPA we're\nthinking about standards for\n\n66\n00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:48.429\nthe federal education space and\nthe safeguarding of students and\n\n67\n00:03:48.429 --> 00:03:50.932\ntheir records when\nthey're attending school.\n\n68\n00:03:50.932 --> 00:03:53.277\nThere's all these things\nwe have to be aligned with.\n\n69\n00:03:53.277 --> 00:03:57.172\nCompliance could take a very different\napproach under any one of these regulatory\n\n70\n00:03:57.172 --> 00:04:00.747\nregimes, although there's probably\nsome standard baseline elements.\n\n71\n00:04:00.747 --> 00:04:05.114\nInformation has to be identified,\nhas to be categorized, and ultimately,\n\n72\n00:04:05.114 --> 00:04:08.675\nsome sort of protection has to be\napplied to that information so\n\n73\n00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:10.643\nthat information is kept secure.\n\n74\n00:04:10.643 --> 00:04:15.974\nWe define what secure and private may mean\nunder the terms of that compliance regime.\n\n75\n00:04:15.974 --> 00:04:21.122\nSo when we think about dealing with\ndata that comes from another place, for\n\n76\n00:04:21.122 --> 00:04:26.430\ninstance, we are a business, ITpro TV,\nand we exist in the United States but\n\n77\n00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.011\nwe sell content to customers overseas,\nin Europe, in Latin America, in Asia.\n\n78\n00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:34.182\nWe're worldwide as Pitbull says, right.\n\n79\n00:04:34.182 --> 00:04:37.833\nSo if we're all over the world and\nwe're selling content everywhere.\n\n80\n00:04:37.833 --> 00:04:39.992\nWell you know I'm from Miami,\nI gotta work in that whole Pitbull thing.\n\n81\n00:04:39.992 --> 00:04:44.763\nSo when we do all that, right, we have\nto worry about the information that is\n\n82\n00:04:44.763 --> 00:04:49.690\ngonna be stored in our CRM system,\nour Customer Relation Management System,\n\n83\n00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.592\nfor customers coming from Europe\nin particular in this case.\n\n84\n00:04:53.592 --> 00:04:58.030\nBecause European customers, European\npeople, that are in the European union\n\n85\n00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.807\nare going to be subjecting their\nthought process around privacy and\n\n86\n00:05:01.807 --> 00:05:05.850\nfiltering their thought process\naround privacy of their information,\n\n87\n00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.254\nthrough the European Privacy Directive.\n\n88\n00:05:08.254 --> 00:05:13.594\nEU9546 or EC9546 is the number and\nname of the directive.\n\n89\n00:05:13.594 --> 00:05:17.943\nAs a result of that, if as a business\nwe are not aligning with the general\n\n90\n00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:22.224\nprotection requirements under a safe\nharbor provision of some kind,\n\n91\n00:05:22.224 --> 00:05:26.721\na provision that allows a North American\nspecifically a US based entity,\n\n92\n00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:28.998\na business, to maintain that data.\n\n93\n00:05:28.998 --> 00:05:34.137\nTo be able to safeguard it using general\nstandards that align with the EC 9546\n\n94\n00:05:34.137 --> 00:05:39.204\ndirective although may not be as specific\nas the 9546 directive protection\n\n95\n00:05:39.204 --> 00:05:43.986\nrequirements are, then we're not going\nto be able to maintain that data.\n\n96\n00:05:43.986 --> 00:05:46.732\nThe courts in Europe and\nthe European Union will say,\n\n97\n00:05:46.732 --> 00:05:49.244\nyou know,\nthat data is not being held properly.\n\n98\n00:05:49.244 --> 00:05:50.475\nIt's not being protected.\n\n99\n00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:51.636\nYou're not aligned.\n\n100\n00:05:51.636 --> 00:05:53.797\nAnd as a result of that,\nthere is an issue, and\n\n101\n00:05:53.797 --> 00:05:57.346\nyou may not be able to keep those records\nand do business with our nationals,\n\n102\n00:05:57.346 --> 00:05:59.562\nbecause that's an issue for\nyou, Mr. or Mrs.\n\n103\n00:05:59.562 --> 00:06:02.912\ncorporate entity who's looking to\ndo business in the European Union.\n\n104\n00:06:02.912 --> 00:06:05.140\nAnd they may block us from doing so.\n\n105\n00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.172\nAnd this has happened to other companies.\n\n106\n00:06:07.172 --> 00:06:10.930\nNow, there's been a wave of kind\nof retrenchment around safe\n\n107\n00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.926\nharbor over the last, let's say,\n12 months approximately.\n\n108\n00:06:14.926 --> 00:06:19.763\nWe're at the end of a cycle now with\nthe discussion about privacy where\n\n109\n00:06:19.763 --> 00:06:24.191\nthe European courts have pushed\nus to rethink what alignment and\n\n110\n00:06:24.191 --> 00:06:29.524\nultimately being able to say, you\nare following those requirements means.\n\n111\n00:06:29.524 --> 00:06:31.010\nThey're redefining them in other words.\n\n112\n00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.144\nAnd so the traditional thought\nprocess around safe harbor,\n\n113\n00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:36.548\nis actually changing and\nis being redefined.\n\n114\n00:06:36.548 --> 00:06:39.729\nAnd as a result of that,\nit may mean something in the future.\n\n115\n00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.719\nBut the general idea behind safe harbor,\nregardless of what it may mean in\n\n116\n00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:50.033\nthe specific case or the specificity of\nthe European Union and their version,\n\n117\n00:06:50.033 --> 00:06:54.300\ntheir vision of safe harbor with\nregards to the United States,\n\n118\n00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.270\nwill change and\nindeed it is undergoing change right now.\n\n119\n00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.345\nBut ultimately generic concept to safe\nharbor is really a more broad topic.\n\n120\n00:07:02.345 --> 00:07:05.553\nIt's the idea of being able to\nalign with the legislative or\n\n121\n00:07:05.553 --> 00:07:09.405\nregulatory requirements for compliance\nin such a way that the people or\n\n122\n00:07:09.405 --> 00:07:13.706\nthe entity that is stipulated with those\nrequirements are feel you are honoring\n\n123\n00:07:13.706 --> 00:07:17.040\nthe spirit of the law and\nthe compliance even though you may not\n\n124\n00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.650\nfollow the letter of\nthe compliance of the law.\n\n125\n00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.530\nAnd, as a result of that, you are then\nallowed to exist to do business,\n\n126\n00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:26.069\nto interact, under that regulatory regime.\n\n127\n00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:29.971\nThis is a very important concept\ngenerically, the idea of safe harbor.\n\n128\n00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:33.761\nAnd it's one you should definitely\nfocus on as you look to prepare for and\n\n129\n00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:38.240\ngo through the material in this particular\nsection overall in domain one Security and\n\n130\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.062\nrisk management within\nthe CISSP body of knowledge.\n\n131\n00:07:41.062 --> 00:07:44.711\nWhen we think about GRC activities,\nGovernance Risk and\n\n132\n00:07:44.711 --> 00:07:47.005\nCompliance is what GRC stands for.\n\n133\n00:07:47.005 --> 00:07:50.123\nYou'll often hear us use,\nyou'll hear me use,\n\n134\n00:07:50.123 --> 00:07:53.936\na lot of acronyms when we talk\nabout information security.\n\n135\n00:07:53.936 --> 00:07:58.348\nIt's a language in and of itself and\nunto itself, and information security is.\n\n136\n00:07:58.348 --> 00:08:00.750\nAnd we speak in shorthand\na lot of the time.\n\n137\n00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.545\nAnd a lot of you, probably just like\nmyself and Mike, and the rest of us that\n\n138\n00:08:04.545 --> 00:08:08.716\nhave been doing this a long time, Are used\nto what a IP address is and you know that.\n\n139\n00:08:08.716 --> 00:08:12.600\nYou know what TCPIP is,\nthat's a suite of protocols and tools.\n\n140\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.500\nYou may or may not know what GRC is,\neven though I just defined it for\n\n141\n00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.690\nyou, but what I want to make sure you're\naware of with regards to preparing for\n\n142\n00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:23.330\nthe ISC2 CISSP exam,\nthe IC squared, CISSP exam.\n\n143\n00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:28.530\nAnd for any of the any exams that go\nunder the ISE squared banner, SSCP, CCSP,\n\n144\n00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.870\nwhatever it may be,\n\n145\n00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.420\nall the other certifications as well\nas CISSP, we focus on acronyms, but\n\n146\n00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:38.580\nwe never use them on the exam without\nspelling them out, and so as a result what\n\n147\n00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:42.630\nI don't want you to do is spend a whole\nbunch of time memorizing the acronym name.\n\n148\n00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:45.560\nWhat I want you to do is learn the content\nand learn the understanding or\n\n149\n00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.280\nhave the understanding make\nit your own of the concept.\n\n150\n00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:52.800\nMake sure you can apply the concept, but\ndon't worry about IP equals internet\n\n151\n00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.140\nprotocol, TCP/IP equals transmission\ncontrol slash internet protocol.\n\n152\n00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.830\nWe'll spell those out all right and\nthat's going to be an important\n\n153\n00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.620\nknowledge item for you, so your optimizing\nyour time, if you go to study and\n\n154\n00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.220\nultimately learn what we're talking about.\n\n155\n00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:09.000\nWith regards to GRC,\nwe're focusing on a suite of activities,\n\n156\n00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.740\na system that we build\ninside the organization\n\n157\n00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.030\nto help us identify as we've talked about\nother discussions and manage risks, and\n\n158\n00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:18.320\nreally focus on risks from\ndifferent perspectives.\n\n159\n00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.320\nWhat are the governess?\n\n160\n00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.790\nWhat are the risk management?\n\n161\n00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:24.460\nWhat are the compliant perspectives\nassociated with Information security?\n\n162\n00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.060\nThis is what GRC activities\nhave to deal with, right?\n\n163\n00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.920\nSo, when we think about not just GRC,\ngenerically.\n\n164\n00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.840\nLet's give you a practical example\nof GRC related frameworks.\n\n165\n00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.210\nYou may or may not have heard\nof something called COBIT.\n\n166\n00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.850\nCOBIT is a IT governance framework.\n\n167\n00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.580\nComes from an entity called ISACA,\nI-S-A-C-A, ISACA.org.\n\n168\n00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.260\nThey have other certifications and\nmarkets.\n\n169\n00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.590\nYou may or may not have heard of them.\n\n170\n00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.810\nYou can obviously go check\nthem out at some point.\n\n171\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:50.530\nBut ISACA,\n\n172\n00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.960\namong the many things that they do,\nthey've come up with the COBIT framework.\n\n173\n00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.230\nIt's currently in version five, I believe.\n\n174\n00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:00.030\nAnd as a result of that, the idea of\nthe COBIT framework allows us to frame\n\n175\n00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:04.200\nthe concepts and the conversation within\nthe business around IT governance and\n\n176\n00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.200\nwhat governance risk and\ncompliance activities mean.\n\n177\n00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.970\nIt's a practical, real world distilled\nexample of how you put your hands on\n\n178\n00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.050\nGRC activities and\nframe them within the business.\n\n179\n00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:18.460\nAnd, we use conversations like this\nwith a framework like COBIT, to go and\n\n180\n00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:22.280\nhave conversations with stakeholders in\nthe business, to help them understand and\n\n181\n00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.710\nidentify what we need to be\naware of security professionals.\n\n182\n00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.630\nAnd ultimately, what the business\nneeds to do to be aligned with risk,\n\n183\n00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:34.240\nrisk management, governance which is\nthe application of the management\n\n184\n00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.500\nof risk activities to the business.\n\n185\n00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.510\nHow we do that day to day and compliance\nwhich is the Saturday check to make\n\n186\n00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:44.920\nsure were learning with the regulatory and\nlegal requirements that whoever is in\n\n187\n00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.950\ncharge has said these are the things\nthat we have to show that we can do.\n\n188\n00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.490\nThese are the activities and\nthis is how we define them.\n\n189\n00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:52.720\nIt's very important when you\nthink about those things, right?\n\n190\n00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.550\nKnowing what they are, how they come\nabout, what we can do with them,\n\n191\n00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.280\nhow we define them, becomes very important\nfor us ultimately, to think through and\n\n192\n00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.740\nultimately understand.\n\n193\n00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.580\nWhen we think about,\nas I mentioned, the European Union,\n\n194\n00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:09.940\nspecifically the Data Protection\nDirective, the EU discussion about privacy\n\n195\n00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:15.490\nhas really been engaged in a very,\nvery long discussion over many years.\n\n196\n00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.030\nAnd the thought process around\nthe development of privacy in\n\n197\n00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.200\nthe European Union is\nreally more advanced.\n\n198\n00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.760\nIt's really gone further down the road.\n\n199\n00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.700\nThat in many other countries in the world,\nor entities or geographic\n\n200\n00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:29.250\nassociations in the world today, they\nreally stand at the forefront in many ways\n\n201\n00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.510\nof the drive to secure and create\nprivacy protections for the individual.\n\n202\n00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.835\nThere is something called the right to be\nforgotten within the European Union today,\n\n203\n00:11:37.835 --> 00:11:40.895\nthat allows individuals to request\nthat their data be removed\n\n204\n00:11:40.895 --> 00:11:42.655\nfrom online databases.\n\n205\n00:11:42.655 --> 00:11:47.355\nSo things like Google, like YouTube,\nor Facebook, or places like that.\n\n206\n00:11:47.355 --> 00:11:49.105\nIf you are a member of the European Union,\n\n207\n00:11:49.105 --> 00:11:53.325\nas a citizen you have the right to claim\na right to be forgotten under law, and you\n\n208\n00:11:53.325 --> 00:11:57.400\nactually can request that your information\nbe removed from those online systems.\n\n209\n00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.940\nThere was recently a very\nbig move to do that,\n\n210\n00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.880\nand one of the big first cases that tested\nthat whole right came up in Europe,\n\n211\n00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.420\nand was actually\nsuccessfully pushed through.\n\n212\n00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.670\nAnd Facebook had to remove a bunch of\ndata, as did Twitter, from online systems,\n\n213\n00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.100\nwith regards to people that\nrequested that they be removed.\n\n214\n00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:16.350\nSo this is a really important thing.\n\n215\n00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:20.340\nIn the United States, while we do\ncertainly have very detailed legislation\n\n216\n00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.970\naround privacy in some\nareas like I mentioned.\n\n217\n00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.920\nWith HIPAA, with bank secrecy, laws and\n\n218\n00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.450\nthings of that nature, in the education\nspace, federal education space.\n\n219\n00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:33.660\nWe don't have as much overarching\nthought process around the privacy of\n\n220\n00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:36.650\nthe individual as some of the other\nareas of the world do today.\n\n221\n00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:38.720\nAnd that's not to say that's a good or\nbad thing,\n\n222\n00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.140\nthat's just to say that's a reality for\nwhere we find ourselves today.\n\n223\n00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.990\nWe have to acknowledge that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n224\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.450\nBut most countries do have privacy laws.\n\n225\n00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.620\nMost countries will have some form of\nprivacy regulation on their books that\n\n226\n00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.210\nas security professions, we would have\nto have knowledge of and be aware of.\n\n227\n00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.800\nSo for instance, Mike,\never been to Australia?\n\n228\n00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.840\n>> I have not.\n\n229\n00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.050\n>> Mike's never been to Australia.\n\n230\n00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.565\nHave you ever been to Australia, right?\n\n231\n00:12:59.565 --> 00:13:01.220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I've never been myself, but\n\n232\n00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.490\nas a security professional, and\nMike as well, if Mike and I,\n\n233\n00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.742\nwe're going to be dealing with a customer\nin Australia, because Mike certainly does\n\n234\n00:13:07.742 --> 00:13:10.950\nwant to go and dive the Barrier Reef,\nyou just won't admit that in public.\n\n235\n00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.250\nBut if Mike and I go to Australia and\n\n236\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.120\ndo some work down there for a customer,\nMike's going to have to do a little\n\n237\n00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.020\nreading on what\nthe Australian Privacy Act is.\n\n238\n00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:23.480\nAnd Australia has a legislative act called\nthe Privacy Act that focuses on privacy\n\n239\n00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.410\nand rights of the individual, and business\nresponsibility with regards to that.\n\n240\n00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.920\nAs a professional acting in that space,\nit's my responsibility to know\n\n241\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.610\nwhat the requirements are so\nthat my customer is compliant, and\n\n242\n00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:40.330\nthey don't face risk associated with being\nnot compliant when they manage data.\n\n243\n00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.820\nNow, my customer may be a business\noutside of Australia, but\n\n244\n00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.040\ndoing business with Australian citizens,\nor seeking to open an office in Australia,\n\n245\n00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.900\nor some combination of that.\n\n246\n00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.040\nOr I may be dealing with an Australian\nbusiness that is going to buy and\n\n247\n00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.710\nsell my goods and\nservices and re-brand them.\n\n248\n00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.870\nBut because of the Privacy Act there, I\nhave to understand the legal implications\n\n249\n00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.940\nof allowing them to manage data, because\nthey're going to do it a different way\n\n250\n00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.960\nthan what the legal requirements\nmay be here in the United States.\n\n251\n00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.920\nAnd so I have to be really\nthinking through the implications\n\n252\n00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.670\nof what it means to be secure today.\n\n253\n00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:16.130\nAnd what that could mean for me,\nbut also for my business, and for\n\n254\n00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.370\nmy business broadly in\nthe global space today.\n\n255\n00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.440\nWe don't just exist in one area anymore.\n\n256\n00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.850\nI mean in theory we do, right?\n\n257\n00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:26.550\nWe may not be a global company, but that\ndoesn't mean that we don't have exposure\n\n258\n00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.490\nbeyond the geographic\nboundary where we live.\n\n259\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:29.700\nWhere is our data?\n\n260\n00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.800\nOur data may be moving through\nsystems around the world\n\n261\n00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.510\nas it's accessed by customers.\n\n262\n00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:38.860\nThat data can be subject to regular\nthorough compliance in governance and\n\n263\n00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.910\nrisk management concerns by law,\nin the countries where transits,\n\n264\n00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:48.610\nif the data is stopped, interdicted or\nexamined, by a legal processor.\n\n265\n00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:49.520\nWait a second.\n\n266\n00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.430\nYou've got data moving through our pipes.\n\n267\n00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:55.420\nThat data is subjective to legal\nrequirements of our jurisdiction.\n\n268\n00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.150\nWe're putting a hold on that data.\n\n269\n00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.720\nWe've got a piece of paper here,\n\n270\n00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.730\nright, that says we are entitled to see\nthat data, that internet service provider.\n\n271\n00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:06.030\nThat cloud provider right may\nactually have to show that data\n\n272\n00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:08.640\nto a legal representative\nof the government or\n\n273\n00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.610\na government agency, because the data\nis moving through France or Germany or\n\n274\n00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.660\nthe UK or Poland or Romania,\nwho knows where right.\n\n275\n00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.640\nIt can be anywhere in the world.\n\n276\n00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.790\nBut the point is your data doesn't\njust go from your computer\n\n277\n00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:22.050\nout to this mythical thing\nwe called the cloud and\n\n278\n00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:26.120\nback again without crossing national\ngeographies and national boundaries.\n\n279\n00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.990\nCabling that runs that data around\nthe world runs through geographies,\n\n280\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:31.350\nruns underneath them, right?\n\n281\n00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:34.030\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe have a problem, we have a concern,\n\n282\n00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.980\nand this is a really big one today for\nsecurity professionals.\n\n283\n00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:40.770\nGone are the days when\nyour data are yours.\n\n284\n00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:45.070\nYour data belongs to you, but it also\nmay potentially be seen by other people.\n\n285\n00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:46.690\nAnd this is something you\nhave to be aware of and\n\n286\n00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.720\nreally think about as a security\nprofessional, as a CISSB.\n\n287\n00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.420\nHow are you going to safeguard that data?\n\n288\n00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.270\nWhat are you going to do?\n\n289\n00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.580\nWhat are the laws and the regulatory\nrequirements that you need to be aware of?\n\n290\n00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.436\nIn Argentina, as another example,\npersonal data protection law.\n\n291\n00:15:59.436 --> 00:16:03.796\nAgain, if I do business, not just in Latin\nAmerica, Not just in Central America,\n\n292\n00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:07.770\nnot just in South America, but\nspecifically in that one country.\n\n293\n00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.610\nI have to understand that legal\nrequirement or those legal requirements\n\n294\n00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.530\nbased on the personal data protection\nlaw that's on the books in Argentina.\n\n295\n00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.500\nIt may be very different and indeed it\nis from other laws in other countries.\n\n296\n00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.790\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n297\n00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.600\nI have to be subject to\nthat if my data is there.\n\n298\n00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.910\nAnd so it's really, today,\nabout understanding those concerns.\n\n299\n00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:30.230\nCanada has a law called PIPEDA,\nP-I-P-E-D-A,\n\n300\n00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:33.330\nPersonal Information Protection\non Electronic Documents Act.\n\n301\n00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.740\nThere's numerous examples of these.\n\n302\n00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.710\nI could pull out 45 different ones and\nrattle them off for\n\n303\n00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.250\nyou here in the next five minutes.\n\n304\n00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:43.110\nThat's not important, you don't need\nto know all of them specifically for\n\n305\n00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.520\nthe CISSP exam.\n\n306\n00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.850\nWhat you need to know more broadly is\nthe idea that as a security professional\n\n307\n00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.010\ntoday, you are responsible.\n\n308\n00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.820\nRemember we've talked about due care and\ndue diligence.\n\n309\n00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.420\nGreat way to bring that\nback into our conversation.\n\n310\n00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:00.130\nYou are responsible for understanding what\nthe requirements are to ensure governance,\n\n311\n00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:05.110\nrisk management and compliance as being\napplied to your entity, to the company and\n\n312\n00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:08.270\nthrough your company, aligning those\nrequirements that stakeholders have.\n\n313\n00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:13.040\nIt's your due diligence and due care\nresponsibility ultimately that we rest on,\n\n314\n00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.350\nand if the security professional\ngets it wrong they're on the hook,\n\n315\n00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:17.630\nthey could be legally liable.\n\n316\n00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.480\nYou could be legally liable.\n\n317\n00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.280\nWe can blame Mike and\nsay it's Mike's fault.\n\n318\n00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:26.440\nAnd Mike could be responsible to my case,\nMike's just that kind of a guy.\n\n319\n00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.480\nBut the reality is, Mike's not\nthe one that's gonna go to jail.\n\n320\n00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.210\nIt's gonna be you,\nyour name is on that recommendation.\n\n321\n00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.590\nYour name is on that agreement,\nyour name is on that org chart.\n\n322\n00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:40.030\nOr it says security professional\nthat should be know better.\n\n323\n00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:41.840\nAnd they insert your name and\npicture right.\n\n324\n00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:45.040\nIf that's you, then you bear\nresponsibility ultimately, and\n\n325\n00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.760\ndepending on the law you may\nbear legal responsibility.\n\n326\n00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.650\nAnd you may actually get\ndragged into court and\n\n327\n00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.900\npotentially could go to jail\nif things go horribly wrong.\n\n328\n00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:57.730\nAnd I'm not suggesting they will, and I'm\nnot suggesting you would be on the hook.\n\n329\n00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:02.150\nI'm simply pointing out that under certain\nlaws in certain places in the world today\n\n330\n00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.110\nyou may be the name that we come back and\ntalk to.\n\n331\n00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.100\nAnd you also have to be aware of\nthat as a security professional.\n\n332\n00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.420\nIt's very important.\n\n333\n00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:14.230\nWhen we think about the thought\nprocess behind protecting information.\n\n334\n00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:17.730\nWe've talked a lot about confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability already, right.\n\n335\n00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.400\nAnd we think about information.\n\n336\n00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.680\nYou know information can\nexist in many forms.\n\n337\n00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.750\nWe often think about\ndigital information today.\n\n338\n00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.480\nWe think about bits and bytes.\n\n339\n00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.860\nRight, we talk about data as a thing,\nand entity that exists, and it does,\n\n340\n00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.190\nhas a life of its own.\n\n341\n00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.960\nIt's managed as a specific\nthought process or\n\n342\n00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.620\nwhat specific though processes\nwe've talked about them.\n\n343\n00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.210\nBut generically the idea behind it\nis that we have a set of laws and\n\n344\n00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.480\na set of though processes\nthat we apply to data,\n\n345\n00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.000\nspecifically called influential\nproperty laws or IP law.\n\n346\n00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.990\nNot IP as in the protocol but\nintellectual property IP.\n\n347\n00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:52.240\nThis is a whole area of law.\n\n348\n00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.070\nAnd this is an area\nthat's well-established.\n\n349\n00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:55.650\nBeen around for many, many years.\n\n350\n00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.510\nIn some cases going all the way\nback to the 1800s depending on\n\n351\n00:18:58.510 --> 00:18:59.910\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n352\n00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.500\nAnd as a result of that we really\nhave to identify some terms.\n\n353\n00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.550\nIntellectual property, very important.\n\n354\n00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.780\nWhat is a patent?\n\n355\n00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.700\nWhat is a copyright?\n\n356\n00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.210\nWhat is a trademark?\n\n357\n00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.640\nWe need to understand those terms and\n\n358\n00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.360\nwhat they are because if we understand\nthose concepts, we understand\n\n359\n00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.410\nhow to provide safeguards and protection\nfor information in different categories.\n\n360\n00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:22.750\nSo, hypothetically, right, let's talk\nabout ITProTV for just a moment.\n\n361\n00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.130\nSo ITProTV has this awesome logo.\n\n362\n00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.670\nYou can see it right here on my shirt,\n\n363\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.410\nyou can see it on Mike's\nwhenever we zoom in on one of us.\n\n364\n00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:33.270\nAnd you probably whenever you log into\nthe site in order to be able to watch\n\n365\n00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.000\none of our episodes.\n\n366\n00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.720\nYou're seeing it all over the place,\nright?\n\n367\n00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.420\nSo that logo, the ITProTV logo,\nbelongs to the entity.\n\n368\n00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.840\nRight?\nThat's behind ITProTV.\n\n369\n00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.990\nIt's their intellectual property.\n\n370\n00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.770\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n371\n00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:48.870\nthey wanna protect it because obviously\nit's part of the brand of ITProTV.\n\n372\n00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:49.670\nMakes a lot of sense.\n\n373\n00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:51.120\nIt's recognizable anywhere.\n\n374\n00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.810\nMakes for great logos on t-shirts.\n\n375\n00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.250\nRight?\nPeople come up to you on the street.\n\n376\n00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:54.770\nHey, that's cool.\n\n377\n00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:55.280\nI want that.\n\n378\n00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.860\nRight?\nSo it's important for them to have\n\n379\n00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.930\nthe protection that goes with the idea\nof being able to say this is ours.\n\n380\n00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.360\nNobody else can use this unless\nthey pay us for the right to do so.\n\n381\n00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.080\nSo, you could go out and\nprovide different property\n\n382\n00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:11.630\nprotection under the guise of a patent,\na trademark, or a copyright.\n\n383\n00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:13.115\nLet's talk about what those are.\n\n384\n00:20:13.115 --> 00:20:16.150\nSo, when we think about a patent Mike,\nright?\n\n385\n00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:19.590\nWe often think about the idea that\na patent is an exclusive right or\n\n386\n00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.630\nan exclusive grant for use.\n\n387\n00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:25.170\nBut specifically an exclusive right or\nuse for the grant of an invention.\n\n388\n00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.670\nSo you have to go out and\ncreate something, right.\n\n389\n00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:31.830\nYou can't just say, hey, you know what,\nthis thing I'm holding in my hand here,\n\n390\n00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.020\nthis pen, yeah,\nI wanna get a patent on that.\n\n391\n00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.380\nWell, you know, if you're not Pilot,\nPilot company, cuz it's a Pilot pen,\n\n392\n00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:41.550\nif you're not Pilot, and you didn't\ncreate the concept of the ballpoint pen,\n\n393\n00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:46.190\nthen we're not giving you a patent on this\nnovel writing instrument called the pen,\n\n394\n00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.550\nbecause that is somebody elses invention.\n\n395\n00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.440\nSomebody else holds a patent in other\nwords, and they have the right to it.\n\n396\n00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:54.260\nYou get to pay in effect to use that.\n\n397\n00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.830\nAnd a patent gives\nthe inventor an exclusive lock\n\n398\n00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:00.240\non the use of that technology for\na period of time.\n\n399\n00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.580\nThey get to decide who gets to use it,\nunder what terms, and\n\n400\n00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.310\nas a result they can charge for it.\n\n401\n00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.990\nYou often hear tell of this, and this has\nbeen in the news again recently as well\n\n402\n00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:12.910\nwith regards to things like the biopharma\nsector, where drugs for instance,\n\n403\n00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:16.180\nthe development of medicine and things\nlike that tends to be talked with regards\n\n404\n00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.270\nto patents because you get the rights\nto patent a drug when you invent it,\n\n405\n00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:24.160\nif it's a novel and a new concept is\nreally what the definition of a patent\n\n406\n00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.830\nfrom a perceptive of being\nan invention needs to be.\n\n407\n00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.740\nYou may invent a pen but\nif you invent a novel, a new\n\n408\n00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.280\nway of dealing with dealing with the idea\nof a pen you can go out and patent that,\n\n409\n00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.090\neven though Pilot may have the patent for\ntheir version of a pen, right?\n\n410\n00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.420\nIf our version has something new\nthat's never been tried before,\n\n411\n00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.170\nI can gain a patent for\nthat new and novel invention.\n\n412\n00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.650\nAnd so, in the bio pharma space you\noften hear about drugs being patented\n\n413\n00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.200\nbecause they are new and novel.\n\n414\n00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.190\nSomebody comes up with a new\ndrug that treats cancer,\n\n415\n00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.670\na new drug that treats the flu,\nor who knows, whatever it may be.\n\n416\n00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.060\nAnd if that's new,\nwe can get a patent for that.\n\n417\n00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:02.000\nThat patent is worth tremendous amounts\nof money, probably billions of dollars\n\n418\n00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.230\nin that space but the problem is for the\ndrug manufacturers that it may have taken\n\n419\n00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.990\nthem billions of dollars to figure\nout how to make that drug so\n\n420\n00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:12.420\nthey need their protection in order to\neffectively recoup their investment.\n\n421\n00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:13.640\nSo patents are very important.\n\n422\n00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:15.970\nTrademarks, a word, a name,\n\n423\n00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.520\nis similar device that used\ncould be trademark, right.\n\n424\n00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:24.600\nFor instance, the ITProTV logo can be\ntrademarked because it is a symbol.\n\n425\n00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:28.290\nAnd we can trademark that in order to\nbe able to say hey, this is protected.\n\n426\n00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.890\nIt belongs to whoever owns the trademark.\n\n427\n00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.420\nSo think of the Nike swoosh, right.\n\n428\n00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:35.910\nThink of Just Do It with the Nike swoosh.\n\n429\n00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.510\nTheir logo and\ntheir corporate identification.\n\n430\n00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:41.320\nThat is something that's trademarked,\nit belongs to Nike.\n\n431\n00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:46.170\nOn the concept of the UPS brown color,\nyou hear about people say UPS brown.\n\n432\n00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:47.080\nThat's trademarked.\n\n433\n00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.230\nThat's something that's unique to them,\nto that particular entity.\n\n434\n00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:54.630\nWhen you think about American Express'\ncatchphrase from a few years ago,\n\n435\n00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:56.100\nwhere do you want to go today.\n\n436\n00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.820\nThat's a trademarkable slogan or\ncapture or something like that.\n\n437\n00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.130\nAll those things, corporate logos without\nexception today are all trademarked.\n\n438\n00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.650\nMany of them may be copyrighted as well.\n\n439\n00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:08.580\nWe'll talk about copyrights in a second.\n\n440\n00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:12.190\nBut the idea is that ultimately, this is\nhow we provide protection to something\n\n441\n00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.800\nthat people use everyday and see everyday.\n\n442\n00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.865\nYou ever play that, we have an app for\neverything today, right.\n\n443\n00:23:16.865 --> 00:23:19.035\nYou ever play that logo game?\n\n444\n00:23:19.035 --> 00:23:22.800\nThat's on, you know they have an app for,\nyou can get the corporate logos and\n\n445\n00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.205\nthey come up,\nyou've got to identify what they are?\n\n446\n00:23:25.205 --> 00:23:25.825\nI suck at that.\n\n447\n00:23:25.825 --> 00:23:28.345\nI'm just, I'm like the horrible,\nhorrible player for that.\n\n448\n00:23:28.345 --> 00:23:31.105\nBut I always sit and I do that especially\nif I'm traveling, I'm on the plane,\n\n449\n00:23:31.105 --> 00:23:32.245\nI've got nothing to do.\n\n450\n00:23:32.245 --> 00:23:34.235\nSo I'm playing that all\nthe time on my tablet.\n\n451\n00:23:34.235 --> 00:23:36.895\nAnd that's a great example of\napplying this thought process.\n\n452\n00:23:36.895 --> 00:23:40.420\nBecause all the logos that come up\nare trademarked and or copyrighted, right.\n\n453\n00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.710\nAll of them probably are trademarked,\na lot of them may be copyrighted as well,\n\n454\n00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.190\ndepending on what they are.\n\n455\n00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:49.513\nCopyright is a form of protection\nthat may also provide protection for\n\n456\n00:23:49.513 --> 00:23:52.011\noriginal works of authorship, right.\n\n457\n00:23:52.011 --> 00:23:55.739\nSo the idea is that if I write a book,\nhypothetically,\n\n458\n00:23:55.739 --> 00:24:00.940\nlike the CIS's PCBK, the guide to\nknowledge, right, that's out there.\n\n459\n00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:04.357\nThe current one that's out there for\nthe for the CISSP.\n\n460\n00:24:04.357 --> 00:24:07.895\nIf you go and get that book,\nyou will see it is copyrighted, right?\n\n461\n00:24:07.895 --> 00:24:12.590\nISC squared owns the copyright to that\nbook because the intellectual property\n\n462\n00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.680\nis their intellectual property.\n\n463\n00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.590\nSo it's unique work that has\nnever existed before in that way.\n\n464\n00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:23.950\nNow up until let's say maybe 15,\n20 years ago, software was kind of out in\n\n465\n00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:28.300\nthe cold because we really didn't extend\nthe protection of a copyright to software.\n\n466\n00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.650\nIt was in the digital demand.\n\n467\n00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:34.470\nIt was a digital work but\nit was not clear based on copyright law\n\n468\n00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:37.910\nthat software could indeed be afforded\nthe protection of copyrights.\n\n469\n00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.280\nIt is now and has been for\na fair amount of time, but\n\n470\n00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.220\ncopyrights can be extended to software and\nindeed they are.\n\n471\n00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.690\nAnd so\nthings like the Windows Operating System.\n\n472\n00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:49.460\nVMware's ESXi Operating System.\n\n473\n00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.330\nThe favorite operating system\nof Mike on his laptop,\n\n474\n00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.160\nthe Macintosh Operating System.\n\n475\n00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.450\nAll of those are copyrighted as well.\n\n476\n00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:57.840\nIf you go to use those and\n\n477\n00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.700\nyou use them without paying a fee,\nwe call that a licensing fee,\n\n478\n00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.480\nyou're effectively violating\nthe usage terms of the copyright.\n\n479\n00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.370\nAnd the owner, Apple, Microsoft, VMWare,\n\n480\n00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.740\nwhoever, has the right in theory to come\nsue you and get their money back and\n\n481\n00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.860\nwhatever damages they may say they\nincurred along the way, right?\n\n482\n00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:15.670\nSo copyrights are very important as well.\n\n483\n00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.850\nWant to make sure we know the difference\nbetween a patent, a trademark, and\n\n484\n00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:19.460\na copyright.\n\n485\n00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:20.840\nThey are very important.\n\n486\n00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.370\nWant to have a good working definition of\nthem as we think about the different ways\n\n487\n00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.730\nin which we can apply\nintellectual property controls.\n\n488\n00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.610\nWhen we also think about electro property.\n\n489\n00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:33.580\nWe're not just thinking\nabout hey it's out there,\n\n490\n00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.490\nwe've got these things called trademarks,\npatents, copyrights.\n\n491\n00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:41.390\nWhat about laws beyond the realm of just\nthat protection actual govern the use and\n\n492\n00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.520\nconsumption, and trade, and\nselling or goods and services?\n\n493\n00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:45.820\nWe have those as well.\n\n494\n00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.840\nSo those things I just mentioned-\ntrademarks, patents, and copyrights\n\n495\n00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.530\ndo all those things but we also have\nlegal agreements that countries sign or\n\n496\n00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:56.110\nbuy into that also fall\ninto this category.\n\n497\n00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:57.840\nWe have something known as ITAR.\n\n498\n00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:02.040\nITAR is an acronym that stands for\nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations.\n\n499\n00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.900\nThe ITAR arrangements are a group of\nagreements that countries can effectively\n\n500\n00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:11.310\nsign on for, that govern the use of\nwhat we would call dual use goods.\n\n501\n00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.640\nAnd you may be thinking,\n\n502\n00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.180\nwhy are we talking arms regulation in\nan information security course, right?\n\n503\n00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:18.180\nWe're not selling arms.\n\n504\n00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.490\nNo, we're not but\nunderneath ITAR, underneath\n\n505\n00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:25.230\nEAR which is the Export Administration\nRegulations in the United States as well,\n\n506\n00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:28.133\nand underneath something known as\nthe Wassenaar arrangement, and\n\n507\n00:26:28.133 --> 00:26:32.720\nWassenaar is also going to be one\nof these international agreements.\n\n508\n00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.820\nAll three of these classify technology\n\n509\n00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.660\nspecifically computer\ntechnology as dual use goods.\n\n510\n00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.990\nAnd so they are gonna be constrained and\n\n511\n00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.300\ngoverned underneath these agreements\nbecause we can use computers and\n\n512\n00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:49.120\nencryption algorithms items in particular\nto create not only secure environments but\n\n513\n00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.820\npotentially to hide activities\nthat may be nefarious.\n\n514\n00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:54.640\nRight, people get up to no good, and\nthey can use computers to build weapons\n\n515\n00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.320\nsystems, and they could use computers to\ncreate weapons of mass destruction and\n\n516\n00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.240\nall sorts of stuff that\nobviously is regulated by other,\n\n517\n00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.400\nmore overarching legal requirements and\nlegal agreements.\n\n518\n00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:08.350\nSo we have these agreements when we\nclassify technology form a computer space\n\n519\n00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:11.880\nin them, because they are, or\nit is considered to be dual use, and\n\n520\n00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.890\nas a result,\nwe have to just be aware of that, as well.\n\n521\n00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.750\nWassenaar is really\nprobably the biggest one,\n\n522\n00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.320\none that you would want to be aware of.\n\n523\n00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.760\nWassenaar.org, if you're\ninterested is where you can\n\n524\n00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.952\nfind more information about it.\n\n525\n00:27:22.952 --> 00:27:26.050\nThe Wassenaar arrangement, it's been\naround for sometime, and it's fairly\n\n526\n00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:30.250\npopular, and it is one that at least just\nin passing you should know and know about.\n\n527\n00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:31.530\nThat's gonna be important.\n\n528\n00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:35.070\nGenerically, when we think about\nprivacy as we've been talking about\n\n529\n00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.560\nthe management of information,\nthe governance of it.\n\n530\n00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.170\nThe association of copyrights,\ntrademarks, and patents.\n\n531\n00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:44.400\nWe wanna think about privacy from\na slightly different perspective.\n\n532\n00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.810\nthe guidelines that help us to\ndefine policy are very important.\n\n533\n00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:52.050\nThe OECD guidelines specifically which\nare gonna be the guidelines that\n\n534\n00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.190\nthe Organization of Economic or\nfor Economic Cooperation and\n\n535\n00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:56.790\nDevelopment's has put out.\n\n536\n00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.640\nThey're called\nthe OECD Eight Core Principles\n\n537\n00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.090\nare also very important when we think\nabout and when it comes to privacy.\n\n538\n00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:06.300\nWe think about the idea\nof collection limitation.\n\n539\n00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.170\nWe think about data quality.\n\n540\n00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:10.350\nWe think about purpose specification.\n\n541\n00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.410\nWe think about use limitation.\n\n542\n00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.060\nWe think about security\nsafeguards that's five.\n\n543\n00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:20.030\nOpenness, individual participation,\nand data controller accountability.\n\n544\n00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.560\nThese are the eight core principals.\n\n545\n00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:26.925\nYou can find them at OECD website,\nOecd.org is where you would find these.\n\n546\n00:28:26.925 --> 00:28:29.045\nAnd these all speak to and\nhelp us to govern and\n\n547\n00:28:29.045 --> 00:28:34.105\nreally think through the focusing on the\nideas about how we capture information,\n\n548\n00:28:34.105 --> 00:28:36.395\nhow we manage it and\nultimately what we do with it.\n\n549\n00:28:36.395 --> 00:28:40.655\nSo for instance when you think about\npurpose specification and use limitation\n\n550\n00:28:40.655 --> 00:28:44.935\nwe're thinking about what we're capturing\ndata for and narrowly defining that need,\n\n551\n00:28:44.935 --> 00:28:48.660\nso that we don't capture more data than\nwe need and as a result expose data\n\n552\n00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:51.900\nfrom a confidentiality perspective\nwhen its not supposed to be.\n\n553\n00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:56.067\nIts one example of how the core guidelines\nor the core guiding principles are applied\n\n554\n00:28:56.067 --> 00:28:59.970\nwhen we think about the principles\nof privacy and what they stand for.\n\n555\n00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.340\nAnd finally as we wrap up our\nconversations in this area,\n\n556\n00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.270\njust some quick definitions, right?\n\n557\n00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.460\nData breach terminology.\n\n558\n00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.930\nIt's always fun to say, terminology,\nit's a fun word, right?\n\n559\n00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:12.110\nWhat we're thinking about is just\nvocabulary, and so we wanna think about\n\n560\n00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.080\nthe difference between incident,\nthe difference between breach.\n\n561\n00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.160\nThese two are very similar in definition,\nalmost identical in fact.\n\n562\n00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.460\nWe want to just differentiate\nbetween the focus.\n\n563\n00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.990\nIncident is an event of some kind,\nwhatever it is.\n\n564\n00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.280\nObviously security focused in this case,\nright?\n\n565\n00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.520\nThat has a potential to do harm to one or\n\n566\n00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.140\nmore of the elements of confidentiality,\nintegrity and/or availability.\n\n567\n00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:36.470\nSo then, it's something that's happened\nand it has the potential to negatively\n\n568\n00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.870\nimpact confidentiality,\nintegrity and/or availability.\n\n569\n00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:43.400\nWhereas, a breach is an incident\nthat has not only happened, but\n\n570\n00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:48.030\nnow we've classified as clearly impacting\none or more of those three elements, and\n\n571\n00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:53.750\nas a result of that has somehow disclosed\nor modified or rendered data unavailable.\n\n572\n00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.400\nAnd as a result of that, the data,\n\n573\n00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.508\nthe target of the breach,\nhas been compromised as well we would say.\n\n574\n00:29:58.508 --> 00:30:01.750\nAnd so and\nbreach are two very important terms,\n\n575\n00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.300\nas we think about not only\ninformation security but\n\n576\n00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:08.360\nspecifically privacy, governance,\nrisk and compliance based activities.\n\n577\n00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.630\n>> That's a lot of great\ninformation there, Adam help.\n\n578\n00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:14.980\nWe got to see about compliance and how we\nhave different areas that we're gonna have\n\n579\n00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.840\nto be compliant in, and\nunderstanding in a global complex.\n\n580\n00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.460\nEven companies that might not\nthink they're global, we see that,\n\n581\n00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:26.520\nthat data might be travelling across\nthose geographical boundaries,\n\n582\n00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.070\nand as a CISSP we've\ngotta be aware of that.\n\n583\n00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:32.400\nWe've gotta understand what that means and\nhow that impacts\n\n584\n00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.850\nthe decisions we're making when\nit comes to protecting that data.\n\n585\n00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.500\nThanks again Adam for\nall that information.\n\n586\n00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.967\nRemember, if you wanna attend\none of Adam's live classes,\n\n587\n00:30:41.967 --> 00:30:45.218\nshoot an email over to SeeAdamWitpro.tv.\n\n588\n00:30:45.218 --> 00:30:46.570\nThat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n589\n00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:48.360\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n590\n00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.040\n>> I'm Adam Gordan.\n\n591\n00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:49.700\nSee you soon.\n\n592\n00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:50.762\n>>

--> 00:00:20.210\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're working on our CISSP, and\n\n4\n00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.620\nspecifically we're gonna be\ntaking a look at code of ethics,\n\n5\n00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.005\nunderstanding what the heck ethics is, how\nthat applies to us as a CISSP, as well as\n\n6\n00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:33.780\nwe're gonna take a look at differentiating\nbetween policies and procedures.\n\n7\n00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.020\nAnd here to help us with all this is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.810\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.565\n>> It's going good.\n\n10\n00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:39.690\ngood I'm excited to talk about ethics.\n\n11\n00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.600\nSo ethics is actually really interesting,\nright.\n\n12\n00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.600\nIt's one of the things that\nas a security professional\n\n13\n00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.730\nsometimes we struggle with it.\n\n14\n00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.980\nAnd the reason we\nstruggle with it is that,\n\n15\n00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.140\nit's hard sometimes to figure\nout the correct thing to do.\n\n16\n00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.850\nRight.\nAnd this is not just in security,\n\n17\n00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.050\nthis is generically in the real world.\n\n18\n00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.210\nWe sometimes struggle with knowing what is\nor is not, not acceptable, not necessarily\n\n19\n00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.650\ncorrect, but what is appropriate and\nright given the circumstance.\n\n20\n00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.510\nAnd Ethics helps us to figure out\nhow to guide through this and\n\n21\n00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.700\ndo what we need to do as\nsecurity professionals\n\n22\n00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.330\nto figure out how to navigate those waters\nthat sometimes can be a little unsure.\n\n23\n00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.860\n(ISC)2 has a code of ethics.\n\n24\n00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.180\nSo we're gonna take a look at that\nright now, actually, on the screen.\n\n25\n00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.400\nWe're gonna put that up for you.\n\n26\n00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.510\nIt's gonna be important for\n\n27\n00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.230\nyou as a CISSP candidate to be\naware of the code of ethics.\n\n28\n00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.790\nWe're gonna zoom in a little bit here and\ntake a look at.\n\n29\n00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.550\nThe Code.\n\n30\n00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.770\nAnd, yeah, we're just gonna\ncenter it on the screen there.\n\n31\n00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.560\nAnd the Code of Ethics is gonna be\nsomething you're gonna wanna go out and\n\n32\n00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.080\ntake a look at.\n\n33\n00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.050\nYou're gonna wanna go\nto the (ISC)2 website.\n\n34\n00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.470\nSpecifically, when you go out to (ISC)2.\n\n35\n00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.980\nIf you just either search on\nthe website for code of ethics, or\n\n36\n00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.780\nif you just wanna generically use Google,\nand just in the Google search engine,\n\n37\n00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.570\nput in (ISC)2 Code of Ethics,\nit will take you right to\n\n38\n00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.000\nthe link you spring the Code of Ethics up,\nto be able to read it.\n\n39\n00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.630\nShould definitely read it at least once or\ntwice, before you take the (ISC)2 exam,\n\n40\n00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.990\nfor the CISSP.\n\n41\n00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.340\nWanna make sure we know\nwhat's called the preamble.\n\n42\n00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.250\nAnd the preamble is down towards\nthe bottom of the screen, we'll move down\n\n43\n00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.860\na little bit and we'll be able to zoom in\njust a little more hopefully and be able\n\n44\n00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.540\nto see that and the idea basically, I'll\njust read it off to you generically so\n\n45\n00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.920\nyou can kinda have\na sense to what it says.\n\n46\n00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.610\nThe Safety of the common wealth, duty to\nour principles and to each other requires\n\n47\n00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.160\nthat we adhere and be seen to adhere, to\nthe highest ethical standards of behavior.\n\n48\n00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.690\nTherefore strict adherence to this Code,\nthe Code of Ethics,\n\n49\n00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.650\nis a condition of certification.\n\n50\n00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.820\nIn other words,\nas a candidate to become a CISSP,\n\n51\n00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.500\nyou must understand or\ndescribe to the Code of Ethics.\n\n52\n00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.460\nAnd as a matter of fact When you apply to\nbecome a CISSP, you actually sign your\n\n53\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.980\napplication and part of that is signing\noff on the fact that you will uphold and\n\n54\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.160\nabide by the Code of Ethics\nas a certified professional.\n\n55\n00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.300\nSo all of the people worldwide.\n\n56\n00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.210\nThat are certified by ISC and\nany certification.\n\n57\n00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.815\nNot just CISSP.\n\n58\n00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:57.390\nAre gonna ascribe to, and hold up,\nor uphold the code of ethics.\n\n59\n00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.240\nAnd the code of ethics,\nas you can see, although the preamble,\n\n60\n00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.270\nis made of what's called\nthe code of ethics cannons.\n\n61\n00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.710\nThese are all the main points that\nspecify what kind of behavior is accepted\n\n62\n00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.670\nby those, and those expected from those\nthat act on behalf of the organization.\n\n63\n00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.520\nThe first bullet point there I know\nit may be a little tough to see,\n\n64\n00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.860\nwe'll zoom in a little more so\nwe can try to see that.\n\n65\n00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.730\nMake that just a little bit bigger for\nyou.\n\n66\n00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.510\nLet me just go ahead and read that\noff to you while we're zooming in.\n\n67\n00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.550\nSo, protects society, the common wealth,\nand the infrastructure.\n\n68\n00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.150\nIn other words, making sure that we\nare focused on the greater good for\n\n69\n00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.240\neverybody, right.\n\n70\n00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.840\nEverybody has to be safe,\neverybody has to be secure.\n\n71\n00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.810\nWe have to make sure that people as\nwell as infrastructure are safe guarded.\n\n72\n00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.130\nWanna make sure we know that it is very\nimportant to safe guard information but\n\n73\n00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.260\neven more important to safe guard life.\n\n74\n00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.570\nWe always put life safety\nabove anything else.\n\n75\n00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.210\nSo if, for instance, there was a scenario\nwhere you were given a problem and\n\n76\n00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.620\nthere was a choice between\nsaving a person and\n\n77\n00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.860\nsaving information,\nyou always want to save the person.\n\n78\n00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.096\nEven if you don't like them very much.\n\n79\n00:04:01.096 --> 00:04:03.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You always want to save the person\n\n80\n00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.570\nbefore we save the information.\n\n81\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.960\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n82\n00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.460\nBe aware of that.\n\n83\n00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.390\nThe second bullet point down,\nact honorably, act justly,\n\n84\n00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.510\nact honestly, responsibly and legally.\n\n85\n00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.820\nIn other words at all times.\n\n86\n00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.150\nAlways make sure you are aligned with\nwhatever the legal requirements, and\n\n87\n00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.540\nwhatever the specifications around\nacting legally are going to be.\n\n88\n00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.330\nIf the law of the land says you're not\nsupposed to do or engage in this behavior.\n\n89\n00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.430\nThen the code of ethics says hey,\nyou're not supposed to do that, right.\n\n90\n00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.440\nWe follow that,\n\n91\n00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.280\nwe take our lead from whatever\nthe standing legal requirements may be.\n\n92\n00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.930\nAnd remember, as we've talked about\nin one of our other segments, right.\n\n93\n00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.350\nThe idea is that there may be different\nlegal requirements in different\n\n94\n00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.860\ngeographies around the world.\n\n95\n00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.470\nWhat is legal in the United States,\nwhat may be legal to do here and engage in\n\n96\n00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.650\nas behavior may not be acceptable in\nother places for a variety of reasons.\n\n97\n00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.580\nThe reasons are really obviously very\nimportant for us to be aware of,\n\n98\n00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.230\nto acknowledge, to understand.\n\n99\n00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.340\nBut what's equally important is to\nunderstand what the letter of the law\n\n100\n00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.930\nstipulates and act accordingly.\n\n101\n00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.550\nAnd that's what the Code\nof Ethics tries to imply.\n\n102\n00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.730\nThird bullet point down,\nprovide diligent and competent service.\n\n103\n00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.580\nTwo principles, making sure that we\ndo our job that we show up every day\n\n104\n00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.580\nwe do the things that\nwe're supposed to do.\n\n105\n00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.300\nIf we have a job that involves making sure\nwe understand how to manage the firewalls\n\n106\n00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.350\nthen we have to be trained and\n\n107\n00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.080\nwe have to be up the task and\nmake sure we do those things.\n\n108\n00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.810\nIf we don't know how to manage\nthe firewall then obviously making sure\n\n109\n00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.650\nthat we get that training is part of\nmaking sure that we are diligent and that\n\n110\n00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.360\nwe are carrying out and acting competently\nwith regards to our service to principles.\n\n111\n00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.070\nAnd finally the last bullet point.\n\n112\n00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.130\nAdvance and protect the profession.\n\n113\n00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.420\nMaking sure that we act honorably\n\n114\n00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.370\nis not just about making sure\nthat we do the right thing.\n\n115\n00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.960\nIt's about making sure that we\nnever put ourselves, our company,\n\n116\n00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.510\nour customers, and\nultimately our profession in a bad light.\n\n117\n00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.740\nSo we often talk about,\nalthough we don't talk too much about it\n\n118\n00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.660\nin this particular body of knowledge,\nbut generically.\n\n119\n00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.630\nYou often hear many security professionals\ntalk about ethical hacking and\n\n120\n00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:07.180\nthe ability to be able to understand\nhow to take on the mindset\n\n121\n00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.030\nof a bad actor in order to become better\nat protecting the infrastructure and\n\n122\n00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.500\nthe information that we're charged\nwith making sure it's secure.\n\n123\n00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.580\nAnd this is acceptable behavior.\n\n124\n00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.430\nGiven very broad parameters\nabout knowledge acquisition,\n\n125\n00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.970\ngiven very specific behavioral\nprescriptions about what we can and\n\n126\n00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.740\nwe cannot do with regards\nto ethical hacking.\n\n127\n00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.310\nThis is a kind of thing that is going\nto fall into this category, advance and\n\n128\n00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.510\nprotect the profession.\n\n129\n00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.310\nIt's perfectly acceptable\nto act in that way.\n\n130\n00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.210\nBut to do so, following all\nthe other guidance, the other three\n\n131\n00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.640\nparts of the Code of Ethics Canons\nprovide to make sure we don't go off and\n\n132\n00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.020\nhack into systems without permission,\nwithout the knowledge of the stakeholders,\n\n133\n00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.745\nwithout written authorization to do so.\n\n134\n00:06:47.745 --> 00:06:52.425\nAnd to always do so in a way that never\nputs the information, the confidentiality,\n\n135\n00:06:52.425 --> 00:06:56.095\nintegrity and availability of that\ninformation in any way, shape or\n\n136\n00:06:56.095 --> 00:06:59.325\nform at odds with the mission\nobjectives of the organization.\n\n137\n00:06:59.325 --> 00:07:02.540\nIn other words, you should never\nhack into production systems\n\n138\n00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.130\nExecute denial of service attacks\nto validate invulnerability and\n\n139\n00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.820\ntherefore render the system inoperable.\n\n140\n00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.960\nThat would be unacceptable and\ninexcusable, even for\n\n141\n00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.080\nan ethical hacker to do.\n\n142\n00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.230\nAnd that would be not advancing and\nprotecting the profession.\n\n143\n00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:17.405\nSo, we wanna make sure we\nunderstand the Code of Ethics.\n\n144\n00:07:17.405 --> 00:07:22.140\nWanna to make sure we understand what the\nthought process behind acting honorably\n\n145\n00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.340\nis because as I said at the beginning\nof our conversation you\n\n146\n00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.040\nknow sometimes it's hard to\nknow it's not clear, right?\n\n147\n00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.950\nAnd if we're not sure,\nwe have to have something to fall back on.\n\n148\n00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.420\nSome sort of moral compass if you will\n\n149\n00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.700\nthat helps us to understand how to act in\nthe proper way and if we're not quite sure\n\n150\n00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.950\nthere may be a little ambiguity\nthere gives us the guidance and\n\n151\n00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:44.810\nboundaries broadly to say Hey,\nthis may be acceptable, but you know what?\n\n152\n00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.740\nI may wanna step back and\nthink about this.\n\n153\n00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.260\nWhereas this other stuff,\nprobably not acceptable.\n\n154\n00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.113\nI shouldn't be engaging in those\nactivities more often than not.\n\n155\n00:07:52.113 --> 00:07:55.758\nSo this is very important for\nyou to think about, to understand.\n\n156\n00:07:55.758 --> 00:07:59.518\nI will offer you following\nguidance in regards to this.\n\n157\n00:07:59.518 --> 00:08:02.428\nI would say that it is\nincredibly important for\n\n158\n00:08:02.428 --> 00:08:04.750\nyou to be aware of the Code of Ethics.\n\n159\n00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.250\nI would say that as I indicated\nas we started the conversation,\n\n160\n00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:13.510\nthat every member of the IFC squared or\nIFC2 community has to subscribe to and\n\n161\n00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.500\nindeed agree to uphold the Code of Ethics,\nas part of their application in order to\n\n162\n00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.950\nbe able to become a certified professional\nunder any of our certifications.\n\n163\n00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.690\nAnd if you are not familiar with the Code\nof Ethics, you're doing yourself,\n\n164\n00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.510\nthe profession, and\nall of us that do understand and\n\n165\n00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.540\nuphold the Code of Ethics, a disservice\nwhen you represent us to your customers.\n\n166\n00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.630\nSo it is very important for\nyou to be aware of them and\n\n167\n00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.030\nto obviously act\nappropriately as a result.\n\n168\n00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:38.270\nSo think about that.\n\n169\n00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.630\nAs we continue our conversation,\n\n170\n00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.260\nit's not just about acting ethically,\nacting honorably, acting justly.\n\n171\n00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.860\nBut using some information\nwithin the organization\n\n172\n00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.570\nto help us to zero in on what that means,\nwe have to define some additional terms.\n\n173\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.580\nWe're back to that idea\nof terminology again.\n\n174\n00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.720\nFun to say, even more fun to talk about.\n\n175\n00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.160\nSo when we think about terminology, right,\nwe're really thinking about vocabulary.\n\n176\n00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.100\nAnd what we're talking about here\nis the idea of understanding and\n\n177\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.530\ndocumenting in our minds\nwhat information is.\n\n178\n00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.170\nAnd let's talk about that briefly for\na second, and broadly.\n\n179\n00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.570\nWe've talked a lot about confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability.\n\n180\n00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.280\nBut how we apply that is gonna\ndiffer in certain situations,\n\n181\n00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:19.070\nmeaning availability of a system, a\ncomputer, this laptop that I'm using here.\n\n182\n00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.980\nThe infrastructure we're using to be\nable to broadcast this signal to you, so\n\n183\n00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:26.195\nyou can watch us talk about this,\nand interact with us in this regard,\n\n184\n00:09:26.195 --> 00:09:31.070\nis gonna be different in terms of\nsafeguarding that providing availability,\n\n185\n00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.280\nthan it is when we talk about making sure\nthat a piece of data is available to\n\n186\n00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.760\nusers using a proper access control\nlist and a user account control.\n\n187\n00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.880\nOr some sort of factor of authentication.\n\n188\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.955\nSo while they both mean availability,\nthere are different mechanisms and\n\n189\n00:09:43.955 --> 00:09:45.632\ndifferent tools and approaches we use.\n\n190\n00:09:45.632 --> 00:09:50.226\nSo documentation generically of what they\nare, how that documentation is written,\n\n191\n00:09:50.226 --> 00:09:53.870\nis it accessible, is it available,\nis it easily understood?\n\n192\n00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:56.400\nThese are all things that\ndocumentation has to match up to,\n\n193\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.880\nin other words be measured by.\n\n194\n00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.174\nBut the general concept of\ndocumentation is important.\n\n195\n00:10:00.174 --> 00:10:01.786\nI often meet with customers,\n\n196\n00:10:01.786 --> 00:10:04.880\nI spend a lot of time working with them,\nwhen I'm training them, when I'm\n\n197\n00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.800\nconsulting with them to figure out how\nto do the things they need to do, right?\n\n198\n00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:10.710\nAnd when I spend time working with them,\n\n199\n00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.520\none of the key things we focus on\nis how good is their documentation.\n\n200\n00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.180\nIs it up to speed, does it encompass all\nthe things that they need to be aware of,\n\n201\n00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.400\nthey need to know about?\n\n202\n00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.370\nIf it does, great.\n\n203\n00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:22.980\nIf it doesn't,\nwhat can we do to improve that.\n\n204\n00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.893\nOne of the most important areas that\nan information security professional\n\n205\n00:10:26.893 --> 00:10:29.636\ninteracts with and\nfocuses on, is documentation.\n\n206\n00:10:29.636 --> 00:10:33.591\nOne of the areas that's in the most need\nultimately, more often than not in most\n\n207\n00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:37.622\nbusinesses, of some love, care, and\nattention, is documentation, right.\n\n208\n00:10:37.622 --> 00:10:39.660\nIn other words we all\nknow it could be better.\n\n209\n00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.720\nWe all agree without fail,\nwe could do a better job, yet\n\n210\n00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.720\nit's the one area that knowing all\nthat we tend to still not focus on.\n\n211\n00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.530\nAnd this is, I think, an endemic issue.\n\n212\n00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:50.700\nIt's systemic in other words.\n\n213\n00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.277\nIt is broadly based, I think,\n\n214\n00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:55.321\non the culture of what we call\ninformation security today.\n\n215\n00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:59.527\nAnd without getting up on my soapbox,\ngenerically I will say that all of us,\n\n216\n00:10:59.527 --> 00:11:04.261\nmyself, Mike, all of you, anybody that's\ninteracting with us in any avenue across\n\n217\n00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:06.825\nany system here as we\ntalk about these things,\n\n218\n00:11:06.825 --> 00:11:10.638\nwhether it's with a customer,\nwhether it's you learning from us,\n\n219\n00:11:10.638 --> 00:11:15.030\nwhether it's you ultimately going out and\ntalking to your customers.\n\n220\n00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:20.220\nI think all of us would be able\nto stand with, and ultimately\n\n221\n00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.190\nagree with the thought process and the\nstatement, that our documentation can be\n\n222\n00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.520\na little bit better, little bit tighter,\na little bit more focused, and as a result\n\n223\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.200\ncould ultimately do us a better service by\nrepresenting our information more clearly.\n\n224\n00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.980\nWith that in mind, there are some things\nthat help documentation become more\n\n225\n00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.050\nnarrowly defined, more narrowly focused.\n\n226\n00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.590\nThere are terms that we\nhave to understand besides\n\n227\n00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.540\nthe general concept of documentation.\n\n228\n00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.830\nBut first, let's play a little game.\n\n229\n00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.920\nThis is for\nyou guys out there listening to us.\n\n230\n00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.530\nMike and I played this game\nbefore we got started today.\n\n231\n00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:49.724\nI won't tell you what he scored.\n\n232\n00:11:49.724 --> 00:11:52.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It was really low, really low, zero.\n\n233\n00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.030\nSo I'm gonna ask you to self assess.\n\n234\n00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.310\nI'm gonna ask you to self assess.\n\n235\n00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.786\nAll kidding aside, what I'd like you to\nthink about for a minute is the following.\n\n236\n00:11:58.786 --> 00:12:01.473\nOn a scale of one to ten,\nright, one being the lowest,\n\n237\n00:12:01.473 --> 00:12:05.055\nten being the absolute highest,\ncouldn't get any better if you tried.\n\n238\n00:12:05.055 --> 00:12:06.620\nYou're all lying,\nby the way, if you say ten.\n\n239\n00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just thought I'd\n\n240\n00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.550\nthrow that out there for you.\n\n241\n00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.300\nSo on a scale of one to ten,\n\n242\n00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.090\nhow good do you think your documentation\ninside your business is today?\n\n243\n00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.900\nWhatever documentation you have,\nwhatever you know of, cuz there may be\n\n244\n00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.500\na lot of documentation you don't see and\nyou're not interacting with.\n\n245\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.230\nBut, generically,\nhow good do you think it is?\n\n246\n00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.050\nWhen I ask my students this question\nin class, typically, on average,\n\n247\n00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.080\nI get somewhere between a five, anywhere\nfrom let's say maybe a four to a six.\n\n248\n00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.550\nFive on average is about\nthe rating they give themselves.\n\n249\n00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:35.680\nWhen I ask customers,\n\n250\n00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:39.540\nI'm sitting across from C level\nexecutives having these conversations.\n\n251\n00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.670\nWhen I ask them,\nif it's just them in the room and\n\n252\n00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.530\nthey're being honest with me, the score's\nsubstantially lower more often than not.\n\n253\n00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.850\nBecause they know that there's\na lot of work to be done, and\n\n254\n00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.330\nthey understand that although\ndocumentation is very critical\n\n255\n00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.820\nto what we do, it's effectively literally,\nthe story book, the playbook,\n\n256\n00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.440\nthat tells the story of the business and\nwhat the do's and don'ts are.\n\n257\n00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.310\nThey also understand that unfortunately,\n\n258\n00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:05.970\njust because of the frenetic\npace of business today,\n\n259\n00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.190\nwe can't spend enough time focusing\non it even though we know we need to.\n\n260\n00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.200\nAnd this is one of those must haves,\n\n261\n00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.410\nI often talk about nice to haves,\nneed to haves.\n\n262\n00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.268\nThis is not a need to have, this is well\nbeyond need to have, this is a must have.\n\n263\n00:13:17.268 --> 00:13:20.630\nMust haves are that extra super\nspecial category of need to haves,\n\n264\n00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:23.468\nthat you just really can't\nrun your business without.\n\n265\n00:13:23.468 --> 00:13:28.470\nAnd documentation today is probably the\nbiggest sore point, the biggest Achilles\n\n266\n00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:33.260\nheel, that the average organization\nsuffers with and has to deal with today.\n\n267\n00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:34.530\nSo wanna think about that.\n\n268\n00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:39.210\nWhen we think about documentation, we\nthink broadly about some terms, policies,\n\n269\n00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.960\nstandards, guidelines,\nand processes, right.\n\n270\n00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.180\nSo policy, standards,\nguidelines, and processes.\n\n271\n00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.320\nLet's define those four terms,\nlet's talk about what they are.\n\n272\n00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.610\nWhen we think about policy, right?\n\n273\n00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.290\nAnd we think about what policy is.\n\n274\n00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:57.100\nWe think generically about policy\nbeing a high level strategy,\n\n275\n00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.600\na high level statement of intent.\n\n276\n00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.880\nIt is a 50,000 foot view of the world.\n\n277\n00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.670\nIt is not gonna be very specific but\nrather broad in its scope and coverage.\n\n278\n00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:11.229\nAnd as a result, it's gonna give\ndirection in terms of where we wanna go,\n\n279\n00:14:11.229 --> 00:14:16.167\nbut not the specificity of how to approach\nthe actual steps needed to get there.\n\n280\n00:14:16.167 --> 00:14:19.827\nAnd so what I would say, for instance, and\nwe probably all have examples of these in\n\n281\n00:14:19.827 --> 00:14:22.370\nour workplace,\nat least most of us do, anyway.\n\n282\n00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:27.420\nWe may have a usage policy that tells\nus how to be able to plug in and\n\n283\n00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.600\nuse the Internet through\nour business computers.\n\n284\n00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.730\nSo we have some sort of usage policy for\nthe Internet.\n\n285\n00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.280\nWe may have a mobile device management\npolicy, that tells us how to manage\n\n286\n00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.770\ncell phones, or tablets, or\nthings like that, whatever they may be.\n\n287\n00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:44.330\nWe may have, as I hit the bottom of my\nlaptop, and knock my key off to the side.\n\n288\n00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:48.780\nWe may have policies that deal with how to\nremotely access information, from outside,\n\n289\n00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:51.490\nif you're a telecommuter, or\na worker that works remotely.\n\n290\n00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:52.928\nSo these are examples of policies.\n\n291\n00:14:52.928 --> 00:14:55.410\nProbably one or\nmore of which you may be familiar with,\n\n292\n00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.200\nand we tend to see a lot of those.\n\n293\n00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.060\nOn average, security professionals\nprobably have anywhere from ten to maybe\n\n294\n00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:05.040\nit's 30 or 45, maybe as many as 30 to\n40 policies they may be responsible for\n\n295\n00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.510\nmanaging in dealing with today\nin the average organization.\n\n296\n00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.340\nAs a CISSP,\nyou're gonna be ask to write policies,\n\n297\n00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.130\nyou're gonna be expected to understand\nwhat they are, how to frame them.\n\n298\n00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.120\nIf you're not familiar with how to do\nthat, if you don't have a good working\n\n299\n00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.680\nexample of that, this may be a good\nidea for you to take a look at.\n\n300\n00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.690\nI'm gonna give you a URL.\n\n301\n00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.740\nYou can go to sans.org.\n\n302\n00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.380\nWe may wanna bring up\nthe SANS web page and\n\n303\n00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.802\nwe'll do that in just a second for you.\n\n304\n00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:30.120\nS-A-N-S.org, sans.org.\n\n305\n00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.190\nAnd at the sans.org website,\nwhat we're gonna find is that they have\n\n306\n00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.590\na documentation program that\nwe can actually go into.\n\n307\n00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:39.325\nThey have a documentation library.\n\n308\n00:15:39.325 --> 00:15:42.831\nAnd when we do that, or when we go,\nwe take a look there, we can see that they\n\n309\n00:15:42.831 --> 00:15:46.415\nhave all sorts of templates that we can\ndownload from the document library.\n\n310\n00:15:46.415 --> 00:15:51.213\nSo if you're struggling with trying to\nfind a policy template for an email usage\n\n311\n00:15:51.213 --> 00:15:56.097\npolicy or a web server management, or\nwhatever it may be, those kind of things.\n\n312\n00:15:56.097 --> 00:16:00.456\nWe can go out to the document policy\nlibrary and we can go ahead and\n\n313\n00:16:00.456 --> 00:16:04.390\nwe can actually download any or\nall of those documents.\n\n314\n00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.110\nThey're going to be available for you and\n\n315\n00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.900\nas a result of that we\nactually then can use them.\n\n316\n00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:13.160\nThe nice thing about them is they come in\nin both Word and, there we go right there,\n\n317\n00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.650\nwe come in in Word, or they come\nin rather, in Word and PDF format.\n\n318\n00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.370\nAnd you could simply download them\nas you're looking at the screen and\n\n319\n00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.960\nwe're scrolling down there for you.\n\n320\n00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.120\nYou can just click on one of the links,\nwhichever one it is,\n\n321\n00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.050\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n322\n00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.840\nThey're broken up by\ncategory as you can see,\n\n323\n00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.460\nand when you do that they've got\na listing of all the policies.\n\n324\n00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.510\nYou can see them there, and we can click\non either the PDF or the doc link.\n\n325\n00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:36.600\nShows up, takes just a minute to load,\nit's got kind of a search interface,\n\n326\n00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.800\nyou can go in and say, where it says where\nyou may have to put in your information.\n\n327\n00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.770\nYou know, insert company name here or\nsomething like that, all you do is cut and\n\n328\n00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.970\npaste, put your information in, and\n\n329\n00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.210\nthen you're able to use those\npolicies free of charge.\n\n330\n00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:49.610\nWe like free, free is good.\n\n331\n00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.880\nYou obviously give credit\nwhere credit is due, right?\n\n332\n00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.030\nSomebody lets you use something for free,\nyou make sure you tell people where you\n\n333\n00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:59.320\ngot it from, so make sure that you let\nthem know that you got it or were able to\n\n334\n00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.210\ndownload the policy from the Sans Reading\nRoom, but the point is, ultimately, they\n\n335\n00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.090\nprovide about 30 to 40 policy templates\nthat are out there for you to start with.\n\n336\n00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:11.340\nAnd, this is a great way to kickstart\nthat thought process about developing\n\n337\n00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:15.700\nproperties cuz one of the challenges a lot\nof information security professionals have\n\n338\n00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.280\nis ultimately that they're not\nquite sure how to write one.\n\n339\n00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.210\nYou know as you saw as we just quickly\nscrolled through the policy template\n\n340\n00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.190\nit was a couple of pages in length,\nmaybe two to three pages on average, but\n\n341\n00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:25.720\nthere's a lot of language in there.\n\n342\n00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.860\nThere's a lot of stuff\ndocumented in there,\n\n343\n00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.020\nit may be hard to understand\nwhat to put in there.\n\n344\n00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.530\nWhen we think about policy remember\nwe're thinking about this high level\n\n345\n00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:33.750\nstatement of intent.\n\n346\n00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:38.040\nWe're translating our strategy of\nthe business, the business requirements,\n\n347\n00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.940\ninto an actionable document\nthat people can go out and\n\n348\n00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:45.270\nactually create opportunity to be able to\nthen consume goods and services through.\n\n349\n00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:49.490\nAnd so policy may be tough to graph\nat the right level, is it too high,\n\n350\n00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:53.870\nis it too general, is it too low,\ntoo specific, too much detail?\n\n351\n00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:58.520\nFor instance, we wouldn't mention\nthe name of a specific messaging platform\n\n352\n00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.850\nin an email usage policy, but rather say\ngenerically, we have an email system.\n\n353\n00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.340\nWe're gonna give access to that\nemail system through both the web,\n\n354\n00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.930\nas well as on mobile and\nhandheld devices and\n\n355\n00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.180\ndesktop and desk-bound devices\nwithin the organization.\n\n356\n00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.220\nThat's the right level for policy.\n\n357\n00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.950\nNot we're gonna use a Microsoft Exchange\nor Google Gmail system, web only,\n\n358\n00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.400\nin order to access mail.\n\n359\n00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.500\nThat is not going to be\nstipulated in the policy.\n\n360\n00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.090\nPolicies should be broad in scope,\nand broad in coverage, and\n\n361\n00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:29.230\nthen the detail comes from some of\nthe supporting documents that we'll\n\n362\n00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.600\ninteract with and\nwe will ultimately slip in below that.\n\n363\n00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.400\nSo want to make sure we understand\nthe right level for policy.\n\n364\n00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.490\nWhen we think about standards, we think\nabout the ability to be able to look\n\n365\n00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:45.150\nto external guidance, perhaps regulatory\nor legal guidance, that somebody or\n\n366\n00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.830\nsome entity, or some group, a country,\nor whoever it may be, is offering us.\n\n367\n00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:52.480\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe need align with and support them.\n\n368\n00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.875\nSo for instance, We may have as we said\nsomething like in the United States,\n\n369\n00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:57.800\nHIPAA.\n\n370\n00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.680\nOr we may have Sarbanes–Oxley,\nwhat's commonly called SARBOX in the US.\n\n371\n00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.550\nWhich is a financial services set of\nstandards that detail for publicly held\n\n372\n00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:10.430\ncompanies that are traded on the Stock\nExchange what the financial reporting and\n\n373\n00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.660\nfinancial regulatory requirements may be.\n\n374\n00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.400\nSo that we understand,\nhave the visibility into their action and\n\n375\n00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.840\nunderstand that they're\nacting honorably and justly.\n\n376\n00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.300\nReference the code of ethics we\ntalked about earlier, right?\n\n377\n00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.940\nSo that would be a set of\nstandards that we could reference,\n\n378\n00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.070\nin the healthcare industry, as we said,\nin the United States, it would be HIPAA.\n\n379\n00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:29.260\nAnd there are others as well, but\nHIPAA is the main one we talk about.\n\n380\n00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.860\nOverseas we talked in one of prior\nconversations about privacy and\n\n381\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.800\nthe role of the law with\nregards to privacy.\n\n382\n00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:40.370\nWe will look at the EU Privacy Directive\n95/46 as an example of a standard\n\n383\n00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.720\nright a law that is in place that we\nhave to be aligned with and follow.\n\n384\n00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:47.820\nWhen we think about procedures we think\nabout specific tactical guidance.\n\n385\n00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:51.320\nStep by step how do I break\ndown what I need to do and\n\n386\n00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.230\nas a result of breaking that down how\ndo I then have the guidance necessary\n\n387\n00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:59.110\nto be able to go out and execute\ntactically on the strategy divisions.\n\n388\n00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:03.700\nSo, for instance,\nif we stick with our email example and\n\n389\n00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.805\nour usage policy is all about email, In\nthe policy we would stipulate high level,\n\n390\n00:20:07.805 --> 00:20:10.435\nwe want to have a messaging system,\nan email system.\n\n391\n00:20:10.435 --> 00:20:15.045\nWe want to give both web access, and\nmobile device access remotely for\n\n392\n00:20:15.045 --> 00:20:18.655\nteleworkers as well as fixed desktop\naccess within the organization.\n\n393\n00:20:18.655 --> 00:20:23.200\nThree different ways we will provide\nemail support and email interaction.\n\n394\n00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.873\nIn the procedures we will have detailed\ndocumentary guidance that allows us to\n\n395\n00:20:27.873 --> 00:20:31.625\nstipulate exactly how somebody\nlogs on through a web browser,\n\n396\n00:20:31.625 --> 00:20:33.678\nwhat web browsers are supported,\n\n397\n00:20:33.678 --> 00:20:38.321\nwhat is the URL, what level of access do\nthey need in order to be able to log in.\n\n398\n00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:41.631\nAre they an authorized user,\ndo they need special permission,\n\n399\n00:20:41.631 --> 00:20:43.670\nis there more than one access control?\n\n400\n00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.420\nIf so\nhow do they gain access to that system?\n\n401\n00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.560\nDo they need both a user name and\n\n402\n00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.240\na password as well as\na secondary factor of control?\n\n403\n00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.000\nA biometric scan of some sort or\nperhaps a pin or\n\n404\n00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.020\nsomething along with a smart card,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n405\n00:20:58.020 --> 00:21:01.500\nWill provide all that guidance and\nall of that\n\n406\n00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:05.220\nis gonna be stipulated step by step in\nalmost like a cookbook fashion right?\n\n407\n00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.840\nAnd it's gonna literally be the step\nby step process that we go through\n\n408\n00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.250\nto execute that request,\n\n409\n00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:14.670\nin this case to gain external access\nvia the web to an email platform.\n\n410\n00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.150\nThat will be the procedure in question.\n\n411\n00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:18.540\nAnd we think about guidelines,\n\n412\n00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:21.370\nwe're thinking about something\nthat is optional right.\n\n413\n00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:24.554\nGuidance, guidelines are optional\nthings that we can look at.\n\n414\n00:21:24.554 --> 00:21:28.633\nThey may be beneficial, maybe it's\na set of best practices from a vendor,\n\n415\n00:21:28.633 --> 00:21:33.038\nmaybe it is something that people that are\nknowledgeable have come up and with and\n\n416\n00:21:33.038 --> 00:21:34.944\nsay this will be good for you to do.\n\n417\n00:21:34.944 --> 00:21:37.739\nBut it's not gonna carry\nthe force of a regulation,\n\n418\n00:21:37.739 --> 00:21:41.470\nthe force of law that we must\ncomply with or there are penalties.\n\n419\n00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.570\nIt's a hey, if you wanna do this,\nthis is good, but\n\n420\n00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:46.920\nif you don't wanna do this,\nthat's okay as well.\n\n421\n00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.508\nRight?\nSo\n\n422\n00:21:47.508 --> 00:21:49.819\nwe would say a guideline is optional,\nright?\n\n423\n00:21:49.819 --> 00:21:52.562\nIt's gonna be typically best\npractice recommendations but\n\n424\n00:21:52.562 --> 00:21:55.090\nyou're not gonna be forced\nto follow them or else.\n\n425\n00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:57.110\nBe very important for us to think about.\n\n426\n00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.500\n>> Very good information there Adam.\n\n427\n00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.880\nThat was a lot of information\nto try to digest.\n\n428\n00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:04.620\nWe went over ethics and the code of\nethics, we talked about ISC squares\n\n429\n00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:09.210\ncode of ethics very important for us if\nwe're gonna be taking the CISSP exam or\n\n430\n00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:12.800\nany of the ISC squared exams that\nwe understand what that means and\n\n431\n00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.880\nwhat we have to do to\nuphold that code of ethics.\n\n432\n00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.130\nAnd we also saw to\ndifferentiate between policies,\n\n433\n00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.820\nprocedures, standards and guidelines.\n\n434\n00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.480\nSome people try to use those terms\ninterchangeably, and as Adam has shown us,\n\n435\n00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.960\nthey're definitely not the same.\n\n436\n00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:31.810\nEach one has a specific purpose,\nwhat it should be covering,\n\n437\n00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.470\nand if we're expected to write those,\nwhich we will be as a CISSP,\n\n438\n00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:38.690\nmaybe to lay that framework for\nsome of those policies and\n\n439\n00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.710\nprocedures we need to understand\nwhat should be in there.\n\n440\n00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:45.700\nAnd we've got to look at sans.org a great\nplace to start if you're new to writing\n\n441\n00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.510\nsome of those policies and procedures,\nyou don't even know where to start.\n\n442\n00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.330\nGo there, they've got some\ntemplates they can get you started\n\n443\n00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.900\ndown the road to writing really good\npolicies, procedures and guidelines.\n\n444\n00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.630\nSo Adam we thank you for all that\ninformation, remember if you wanna attend\n\n445\n00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:04.060\none of Adam's classes live,\ndrop us an email at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n446\n00:23:04.060

--> 00:00:20.481\nI’m your host Mike Roderick, and\ntoday we're doing our CISSP and specially\n\n4\n00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:25.429\nwe're going to be looking at business\nimpact analysis and business continuity.\n\n5\n00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.539\nWe need to see how we can go about\nunderstanding what kind of requirements we\n\n6\n00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.378\nhave with business continuity.\n\n7\n00:00:31.378 --> 00:00:33.997\nAnd who better can help us with\nthat than Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:35.136\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:35.878\n>> Awesome.\n\n10\n00:00:35.878 --> 00:00:39.525\nI'm feeling very continuous, so this\nshould be a great, great conversation.\n\n11\n00:00:39.525 --> 00:00:42.577\nAll right, so let's think about what\nMike was just talking about, right?\n\n12\n00:00:42.577 --> 00:00:46.048\nWe were talking about, or\nMike was introducing us to the idea,\n\n13\n00:00:46.048 --> 00:00:49.399\nof thinking about ultimately\nwhat is business continuity?\n\n14\n00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.613\nHow do we ensure that operations are gonna\ncontinue in the face of adversity?\n\n15\n00:00:53.613 --> 00:00:57.525\nBut before we get to that, what we have\nto think about is what is an operation?\n\n16\n00:00:57.525 --> 00:00:58.338\nWhat is important?\n\n17\n00:00:58.338 --> 00:01:01.672\nIn other words, do we have things\nthat have to happen no matter what?\n\n18\n00:01:01.672 --> 00:01:05.664\nAnd do we have things that would be nice\nto have happen, but if they don't, may or\n\n19\n00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:07.209\nmay not be all that important.\n\n20\n00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:10.517\nSo for instance,\nwe may have color printing capabilities.\n\n21\n00:01:10.517 --> 00:01:14.878\nSo I have framed this conversation\nwith my customers in this way.\n\n22\n00:01:14.878 --> 00:01:17.336\nYou may have color printing\nin the organization.\n\n23\n00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:18.950\nAnd that's a nice to have, right?\n\n24\n00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.793\nYou've heard me talk about nice to haves,\nneed to haves, and must haves.\n\n25\n00:01:21.793 --> 00:01:23.864\nI often talk about things in that regard,\n\n26\n00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:27.007\ncuz I think it helps to simplify\nthe conversation and focus us.\n\n27\n00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:31.642\nColor printing may be a nice to have, but\nthe reality we ask ourselves about in\n\n28\n00:01:31.642 --> 00:01:36.348\nregards to continuity and recovery, is if\nI could focus on all the systems in my\n\n29\n00:01:36.348 --> 00:01:40.984\norganization, is color printing one of\nthe ones I have to spend resources and\n\n30\n00:01:40.984 --> 00:01:44.156\ntime recovering right now\nin the face of adversity?\n\n31\n00:01:44.156 --> 00:01:47.855\nOr is that something I can get to later,\nwhen everything else is okay and\n\n32\n00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:49.096\nwe're back to normal.\n\n33\n00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:53.853\nIf we're a marketing organization,\nif we are gonna make our living selling\n\n34\n00:01:53.853 --> 00:01:58.461\ncolor printed goods and services to\nindividuals, if we are at Kinko's,\n\n35\n00:01:58.461 --> 00:02:00.936\nthen we probably need color printing.\n\n36\n00:02:00.936 --> 00:02:03.958\nThat's pretty systemic\nin part of what we do.\n\n37\n00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:07.951\nBut if we are not in the color printing\nbusiness, it's a nice to have,\n\n38\n00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:09.789\nnot a need have or a must to have.\n\n39\n00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.772\nAnd so what we need to start thinking\nabout as we begin these conversations,\n\n40\n00:02:13.772 --> 00:02:15.467\nis what's gonna be important.\n\n41\n00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:19.358\nAnd Mike's gonna help us figure out how\nwe get to what's important as we have our\n\n42\n00:02:19.358 --> 00:02:20.182\nconversation.\n\n43\n00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:23.941\nBut ultimately as he keeps me honest,\nand as he keeps me on target,\n\n44\n00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:28.529\nwhat we wanna think about is is this core,\nis this central, is this what we want?\n\n45\n00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.249\nIf it is,\nthen let's focus on it a certain way.\n\n46\n00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.729\nIf it's not let's put it off to the side,\nand we'll talk about that as we go.\n\n47\n00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:38.569\nSo, in order to begin our conversations in\nthis area, we really have to start with\n\n48\n00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.022\nthis thinking about developing, and\ndocumenting a project plan that's\n\n49\n00:02:42.022 --> 00:02:44.940\ngonna help us understand how\nto manage business continuity.\n\n50\n00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.869\nBCP, business continuity planning is all\nabout what we do to get back to normal.\n\n51\n00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.527\nHow do we ensure\ncontinuity of our systems?\n\n52\n00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:56.690\nHow do we ensure that things are running\nthe way they're supposed to.\n\n53\n00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.486\nMike, when you showed up to work\nthis morning, did we have email?\n\n54\n00:02:59.486 --> 00:03:00.021\n>> We did.\n\n55\n00:03:00.021 --> 00:03:01.982\n>> We did, right, so email's working.\n\n56\n00:03:01.982 --> 00:03:05.054\nNow, email working is probably\nthe normal state of affairs, right,\n\n57\n00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:05.999\nmore often than not.\n\n58\n00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:07.707\nSo, Mike comes into work, email's working.\n\n59\n00:03:07.707 --> 00:03:11.157\nI said more often than not, it doesn't\nalways, but more often than not, right?\n\n60\n00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:12.831\nEmail's working, so that's good.\n\n61\n00:03:12.831 --> 00:03:14.451\nBut what if email wasn't working?\n\n62\n00:03:14.451 --> 00:03:15.416\nWhat would we do then?\n\n63\n00:03:15.416 --> 00:03:17.075\nAll right, what are we gonna\ndo if email's not working?\n\n64\n00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:19.744\nWhat we'd have to figure\nout is number one,\n\n65\n00:03:19.744 --> 00:03:22.857\nwe would have to know what\nemail not working means.\n\n66\n00:03:22.857 --> 00:03:26.961\nAnd then we would have to understand\nwhen email doesn't work is that there\n\n67\n00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:31.330\nare certain things we probably have to go\nthrough and a prioritized list of some\n\n68\n00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.962\nsort in terms of responses, activities,\nunderstanding the things that are going\n\n69\n00:03:35.962 --> 00:03:40.461\non in order to ensure that we work through\nthe cycle of what not working means to get\n\n70\n00:03:40.461 --> 00:03:43.274\nto a resolution with\na reasonable amount of time.\n\n71\n00:03:43.274 --> 00:03:47.594\nBut also, a reasonable amount of assurance\nthat the solution we provide is gonna\n\n72\n00:03:47.594 --> 00:03:49.639\nrestore continuity to that service.\n\n73\n00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.442\nAnd these are important\nthings to consider.\n\n74\n00:03:51.442 --> 00:03:55.976\nSo, the way we get there is we first have\nto identify that we need a BCP program,\n\n75\n00:03:55.976 --> 00:03:57.927\na business continuity program.\n\n76\n00:03:57.927 --> 00:04:01.236\nAnd then, we have to plan out or sketch\nout the parameters of what that means.\n\n77\n00:04:01.236 --> 00:04:06.212\nSo, when we think about BCP planning, what\nwe think about is one or more individuals,\n\n78\n00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:10.714\ntypically representatives from different\nareas of the organization that get\n\n79\n00:04:10.714 --> 00:04:13.670\ntogether and\nare gonna jointly come up with a plan.\n\n80\n00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.108\nAnd a plan can be many things.\n\n81\n00:04:15.108 --> 00:04:19.020\nA plan can be a set of requirements\nwritten down in a document.\n\n82\n00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.870\nA plan can be a very detailed,\nvery,very specific\n\n83\n00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.717\naction-oriented capability that\nwe develop in the business.\n\n84\n00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:31.699\nA plan could be a story, a narrative about\nwhat we should be thinking about doing if\n\n85\n00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:34.949\nsomething isn't working or\nsomething doesn't go the right way.\n\n86\n00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.701\nSo Mike, when we came in to a work today.\n\n87\n00:04:37.701 --> 00:04:38.258\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n88\n00:04:38.258 --> 00:04:40.722\n>> Did you and I have a plan for\nwhat we're gonna do and\n\n89\n00:04:40.722 --> 00:04:43.435\ntalk about with our lovely\nstudio audience out there?\n\n90\n00:04:43.435 --> 00:04:44.793\n>> We did.\n>> We had a plan, right?\n\n91\n00:04:44.793 --> 00:04:47.668\nAnd in order to have and\nput on a show like this, and\n\n92\n00:04:47.668 --> 00:04:51.571\nput on all the work that we do that\ngoes to putting in a show like this,\n\n93\n00:04:51.571 --> 00:04:53.850\nyou don't see that behind the scenes.\n\n94\n00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.159\nAnd it actually would maybe be\ninteresting at some point of the show,\n\n95\n00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:58.826\neverybody what we do to get ready.\n\n96\n00:04:58.826 --> 00:05:02.357\nThere's a lot of work that goes\ninto putting on a small segment for\n\n97\n00:05:02.357 --> 00:05:04.613\nyou let alone an entire course in the end.\n\n98\n00:05:04.613 --> 00:05:07.550\nAnd that's part of all the things that\nwe have to do ahead of time, right?\n\n99\n00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.677\nIf we just showed up and\nwinged it, so to speak,\n\n100\n00:05:09.677 --> 00:05:12.938\neven though it may look like we're\ndoing that at certain points in time.\n\n101\n00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:14.730\nRest assured, we have a plan.\n\n102\n00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.017\nThings have been worked out.\n\n103\n00:05:16.017 --> 00:05:17.746\nSo, if we make it look effortless,\n\n104\n00:05:17.746 --> 00:05:21.668\nif we make it look like we're just ad\nlibbing but it's all coming together well,\n\n105\n00:05:21.668 --> 00:05:24.513\nthen Mike and I have really\ndone our job exceedingly well.\n\n106\n00:05:24.513 --> 00:05:25.662\nWe have planned so well,\n\n107\n00:05:25.662 --> 00:05:28.471\nin other words that we know\nexactly what's going to happen.\n\n108\n00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:31.678\nWe can anticipate all the things\nthat potentially will come up, and\n\n109\n00:05:31.678 --> 00:05:34.558\nwe know how to deal with them\nin the flow of the conversation.\n\n110\n00:05:34.558 --> 00:05:36.090\nThat's a good plan.\n\n111\n00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.684\nA bad plan would be we're talking to you,\nand you start to see things falling behind\n\n112\n00:05:40.684 --> 00:05:43.779\nme here and\nthe stage comes apart while we're talking.\n\n113\n00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:46.429\nYou see people running around behind\nthe scenes trying to fix things.\n\n114\n00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:47.614\nThat would not be a good plan.\n\n115\n00:05:47.614 --> 00:05:48.658\nThat would be a problem.\n\n116\n00:05:48.658 --> 00:05:53.596\nAnd so having a plan involves anticipating\nand identifying things that indeed\n\n117\n00:05:53.596 --> 00:05:57.727\nneed to happen and understand what\ngoes into making them happen.\n\n118\n00:05:57.727 --> 00:06:01.093\nSo Mike and I have to spend time talking\nto each other about how we're gonna\n\n119\n00:06:01.093 --> 00:06:02.189\npresent the material.\n\n120\n00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:05.604\nI have to come up with an outline and we\nhave to share that outline with you by way\n\n121\n00:06:05.604 --> 00:06:09.039\nof telling you what's gonna happen,\nas Mike does when we get started right?\n\n122\n00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.423\nAnd then I gotta have something coherent\nto say for 15 or 20 or 30 minutes right,\n\n123\n00:06:12.423 --> 00:06:14.025\nand make the whole thing come together.\n\n124\n00:06:14.025 --> 00:06:17.844\nAnd we may throw some graphics up on the\nscreen from time to time as we're gonna do\n\n125\n00:06:17.844 --> 00:06:18.588\nhere shortly.\n\n126\n00:06:18.588 --> 00:06:21.362\nNot just yet, but shortly,\nto show you some things.\n\n127\n00:06:21.362 --> 00:06:24.727\nSo when we think about business\ncontinuity planning in the context of\n\n128\n00:06:24.727 --> 00:06:28.103\nthe organization, we have to\nidentify systems that are important.\n\n129\n00:06:28.103 --> 00:06:30.836\nWe have to identify things\nthat have to be available.\n\n130\n00:06:30.836 --> 00:06:32.922\nBut we also need to know\nwhat we can do without, and\n\n131\n00:06:32.922 --> 00:06:35.671\nthis becomes very important for\nus to have a conversation about.\n\n132\n00:06:35.671 --> 00:06:39.661\nSo the very first thing we do before we do\nany of that, any of that has to happen.\n\n133\n00:06:39.661 --> 00:06:41.901\nAll that has to happen before\nwe do any of that right?\n\n134\n00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.517\nWe have to go out and\ntalk to senior management.\n\n135\n00:06:44.517 --> 00:06:47.214\nAnd we have to get senior\nmanagement's buy-in and approval.\n\n136\n00:06:47.214 --> 00:06:50.776\nAnd they have to say yeah,\nAdam, it's real important.\n\n137\n00:06:50.776 --> 00:06:54.786\nWe gotta focus on business continuity, we\ngotta understand how to recover if things\n\n138\n00:06:54.786 --> 00:06:57.228\ndon't go well, and\nwe have to have a plan for that.\n\n139\n00:06:57.228 --> 00:06:58.784\nYou're right to bring\nthat to our attention.\n\n140\n00:06:58.784 --> 00:07:02.193\nIt's important for us to do, and\nyou've got to help us work through that.\n\n141\n00:07:02.193 --> 00:07:03.948\nOkay, I could do that, no problem.\n\n142\n00:07:03.948 --> 00:07:08.106\nBut what you're telling me, just to\nbe clear, Mr. or Mrs. Senior Manager,\n\n143\n00:07:08.106 --> 00:07:11.949\nis you believe it's important enough\nthat you're gonna invest time and\n\n144\n00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:13.913\nresources into this project right?\n\n145\n00:07:13.913 --> 00:07:16.892\nAnd we would talk about that and\nhopefully the answer would be yes.\n\n146\n00:07:16.892 --> 00:07:18.663\nAnd then I would be very smart about this.\n\n147\n00:07:18.663 --> 00:07:20.288\nI would get that in writing right?\n\n148\n00:07:20.288 --> 00:07:23.345\nBecause oftentimes we'll\ntalk about something, and\n\n149\n00:07:23.345 --> 00:07:28.139\nI'm not saying this ever happens, but on\noccasion, people may change their minds.\n\n150\n00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:31.113\nPeople may say, well, I said that,\nbut I really thought about it and\n\n151\n00:07:31.113 --> 00:07:33.027\nI'm thinking about something else right?\n\n152\n00:07:33.027 --> 00:07:34.351\nAnd so we wanna have that in writing.\n\n153\n00:07:34.351 --> 00:07:37.687\nBecause if everybody agrees, then there\nshould be no problem with putting into\n\n154\n00:07:37.687 --> 00:07:39.446\nwriting and have everybody agreed to it.\n\n155\n00:07:39.446 --> 00:07:41.843\nAnd then, we can always go back and\nreview that and say,\n\n156\n00:07:41.843 --> 00:07:45.223\nmaybe it's time to change to update that,\nthere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n157\n00:07:45.223 --> 00:07:48.153\nBut unless we do that,\nwe're not gonna ultimately,\n\n158\n00:07:48.153 --> 00:07:52.773\npotentially have the ability to concur and\ncome together and say, in the 30 days or\n\n159\n00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:57.090\n30 months or three years or whatever,\nthis is still what we're focused on.\n\n160\n00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.087\nBecause we know technology changes.\n\n161\n00:07:59.087 --> 00:08:02.389\nAnd we know that what is important\ntoday may not be important tomorrow, or\n\n162\n00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:05.906\nmay have been important yesterday but\nnow may be even more important because of\n\n163\n00:08:05.906 --> 00:08:08.218\nthe shift that we're\nundergoing in the business.\n\n164\n00:08:08.218 --> 00:08:09.858\nAnd if you think about what\ngoes on in your world.\n\n165\n00:08:09.858 --> 00:08:12.458\nYou think about the services\nyour businesses provide.\n\n166\n00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:16.748\nYou think about the things that a CISSP\ncandidate and ultimately, once you test\n\n167\n00:08:16.748 --> 00:08:21.568\nand are successful at CISSPs that you're\ninvolved with, and you're responsible for.\n\n168\n00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:24.498\nHow many of you five years ago\nwere dealing with the cloud?\n\n169\n00:08:24.498 --> 00:08:27.658\nHow many of you five years ago were\ndealing with mobile device management?\n\n170\n00:08:27.658 --> 00:08:31.999\nHow many of you five years ago were\ndealing with converged technologies, and\n\n171\n00:08:31.999 --> 00:08:33.348\nwith virtualization?\n\n172\n00:08:33.348 --> 00:08:35.463\nOf the four or\nfive things I've just mentioned,\n\n173\n00:08:35.463 --> 00:08:37.328\nyou may have had knowledge\nof some of them.\n\n174\n00:08:37.328 --> 00:08:39.873\nYou probably were dealing with\nvirtualization at some level.\n\n175\n00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:41.253\nIt’s been around for some time.\n\n176\n00:08:41.253 --> 00:08:44.519\nBut convergence,\nconvergence based technologies, cloud,\n\n177\n00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:48.658\nmobile device management, these are new\nphenomenon, relatively speaking.\n\n178\n00:08:48.658 --> 00:08:51.403\nAnd you may have had all of them\nfive years ago in your business, but\n\n179\n00:08:51.403 --> 00:08:52.738\nyou may not have had any of them.\n\n180\n00:08:52.738 --> 00:08:56.449\nToday, it will be very hard for you to\ndo business continuity planning without\n\n181\n00:08:56.449 --> 00:08:58.362\ndiscussing all of those technologies,\n\n182\n00:08:58.362 --> 00:09:01.808\nI would hazard a guess to say in most\nof our businesses, quite honestly.\n\n183\n00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:03.658\nSo we wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n184\n00:09:03.658 --> 00:09:07.979\nWe then, once we get senior management\nbuy-in, have to define the scope,\n\n185\n00:09:07.979 --> 00:09:11.708\nthe coverage of what we're gonna entail or\nultimately focus on.\n\n186\n00:09:11.708 --> 00:09:15.707\nIn other words, what will be inside of\nthe plan that we have to think about\n\n187\n00:09:15.707 --> 00:09:18.540\nrecovering and focusing on,\nand what is outside.\n\n188\n00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.701\nI mentioned color printing as an example,\nright?\n\n189\n00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:24.088\nIs color printing gonna be central and\ncore to what we're gonna do every day?\n\n190\n00:09:24.088 --> 00:09:27.480\nThen it should be within the project\nscope for a business continuity plan.\n\n191\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.028\nIf it's not,\nit should be outside the scope.\n\n192\n00:09:29.028 --> 00:09:33.328\nOutside scope means we're not gonna\ncover it, we're not gonna focus on it,\n\n193\n00:09:33.328 --> 00:09:35.458\nat least not in this plan, not today.\n\n194\n00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:37.098\nWe have to estimate project resources.\n\n195\n00:09:37.098 --> 00:09:38.798\nVery important to do that.\n\n196\n00:09:38.798 --> 00:09:39.918\nHow much is it gonna cost?\n\n197\n00:09:39.918 --> 00:09:41.398\nWhat do we have available?\n\n198\n00:09:41.398 --> 00:09:43.563\nWhat can we do given the constraints and\n\n199\n00:09:43.563 --> 00:09:47.308\nthe resources on the operational\nparameters of the organization.\n\n200\n00:09:47.308 --> 00:09:48.968\nMike, do we have unlimited resources?\n\n201\n00:09:48.968 --> 00:09:50.246\n>> Definitely not.\n>> Do anything right?\n\n202\n00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:51.266\nIt would be nice if we did right?\n\n203\n00:09:51.266 --> 00:09:52.086\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n204\n00:09:52.086 --> 00:09:55.437\nIf somebody walked in with a blank check,\nand just came in and\n\n205\n00:09:55.437 --> 00:09:59.658\nit was signed and had it maybe this amount\nof space for zeros to be added to it.\n\n206\n00:09:59.658 --> 00:10:00.982\nMike and I could do a lot of really\n\n207\n00:10:00.982 --> 00:10:01.858\ncool things\n>> Absolutely\n\n208\n00:10:01.858 --> 00:10:02.558\n>> We'd have a lot of\n\n209\n00:10:02.558 --> 00:10:03.778\nanimation by the way, right.\n\n210\n00:10:03.778 --> 00:10:06.018\nWe’d be running around look\nlike cartoon characters.\n\n211\n00:10:06.018 --> 00:10:07.705\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the reality is,\n\n212\n00:10:07.705 --> 00:10:09.748\nit's very expensive to do those things.\n\n213\n00:10:09.748 --> 00:10:12.830\nAnd it's very expensive to control\nsystems and to maintain them and\n\n214\n00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.188\nultimately to recover them.\n\n215\n00:10:14.188 --> 00:10:18.520\nAnd so we have to think about the fact\nthat while we may have unlimited desire to\n\n216\n00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.052\ndo those things, we have a constrained\nreality of the tools and\n\n217\n00:10:22.052 --> 00:10:25.338\nthe techniques and the capabilities,\nwe have to do them.\n\n218\n00:10:25.338 --> 00:10:28.158\nWhat people often forget about\nby the way in this regard,\n\n219\n00:10:28.158 --> 00:10:31.288\nis that knowledge falls into\nthis overarching conversation.\n\n220\n00:10:31.288 --> 00:10:35.068\nKnowledge, the capability to do\nthese things is also a resource.\n\n221\n00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:37.308\nWe may have a constraint on knowledge.\n\n222\n00:10:37.308 --> 00:10:40.543\nMaybe we don't have the qualified people\nin the organization that need to do all\n\n223\n00:10:40.543 --> 00:10:41.568\nthe things we want done.\n\n224\n00:10:41.568 --> 00:10:43.678\nAnd maybe we can't go out and\nafford to hire them.\n\n225\n00:10:43.678 --> 00:10:46.130\nThat can also be a problem\nwith regards to continuity.\n\n226\n00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:49.948\nBut we to define a timeline that all\nthis is gonna take place within.\n\n227\n00:10:49.948 --> 00:10:52.878\nThese are the four broad steps,\nvery, very broad.\n\n228\n00:10:52.878 --> 00:10:57.321\nBut steps we need to take to get ready\nto then engage in a business continuity\n\n229\n00:10:57.321 --> 00:10:58.036\nexercise.\n\n230\n00:10:58.036 --> 00:11:00.256\nSo, just to recap before we continue.\n\n231\n00:11:00.256 --> 00:11:02.856\nObtain senior management buy-in,\nvery important.\n\n232\n00:11:02.856 --> 00:11:06.450\nDefine the project scope, the objectives\nthat will be and will be covered and\n\n233\n00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.338\nwill be within the scope and\nthen things that are not in scope.\n\n234\n00:11:09.338 --> 00:11:12.764\nEstimate project resources, what do\nwe have, what are the capabilities,\n\n235\n00:11:12.764 --> 00:11:15.938\nwhat are the things that we want to\nfocus on and what can we accomplish.\n\n236\n00:11:15.938 --> 00:11:18.178\nAnd then what's the timeline\nassociated with those.\n\n237\n00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:22.093\nThose four things help us to frame and\ndevelop the documentation and set up\n\n238\n00:11:22.093 --> 00:11:26.148\nthe project scope that we're looking\nto then ultimately operate against.\n\n239\n00:11:26.148 --> 00:11:28.429\nOnce we've done all that,\nwe then can go out and\n\n240\n00:11:28.429 --> 00:11:30.314\ndo a business organization analysis,\n\n241\n00:11:30.314 --> 00:11:33.928\nwhat we typically call a business\nimpact analysis, what's called a BIA.\n\n242\n00:11:33.928 --> 00:11:38.887\nAnd by doing that, we're then gonna be\nable to engage in the conversation about\n\n243\n00:11:38.887 --> 00:11:42.678\nultimately how we're gonna\nfigure out what's important.\n\n244\n00:11:42.678 --> 00:11:44.933\nAnd when we think about\nwhat's important Mike, and\n\n245\n00:11:44.933 --> 00:11:48.416\nwe think about why it's important to know\nthose things right, we wanna make sure\n\n246\n00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:51.878\nwe understand what's important, but\nclearly there's a reason why, right?\n\n247\n00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:53.238\nSo help me understand\nwhat the reason why is.\n\n248\n00:11:53.238 --> 00:11:54.918\nWhy do we have to understand\nwhat's important?\n\n249\n00:11:54.918 --> 00:11:59.093\n>> Well, my first thought is we've\ngot a limited number of resources and\n\n250\n00:11:59.093 --> 00:12:02.798\nnot everything warrants the same\nlevel of protection maybe.\n\n251\n00:12:02.798 --> 00:12:03.598\n>> Absolutely, right?\n\n252\n00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:07.598\nSo, not everything is gonna be\nas important as everything else.\n\n253\n00:12:07.598 --> 00:12:09.698\nSo the color printing may be important,\nbut\n\n254\n00:12:09.698 --> 00:12:13.518\nthe email system most people would say\nmost likely is probably more important.\n\n255\n00:12:13.518 --> 00:12:17.940\nWe could say it's prioritized higher up\nin the pantheon of important things or\n\n256\n00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.018\nin the listing of important things.\n\n257\n00:12:20.018 --> 00:12:22.393\nAnd so when we think about\nbusiness impact analysis,\n\n258\n00:12:22.393 --> 00:12:26.258\nwhat we're thinking about ultimately,\nis how do we rank what's important, right?\n\n259\n00:12:26.258 --> 00:12:27.058\nHow do we know?\n\n260\n00:12:27.058 --> 00:12:29.812\nAnd if we know that email is more\nimportant than color printing,\n\n261\n00:12:29.812 --> 00:12:31.548\nwho's gonna help us to figure that out?\n\n262\n00:12:31.548 --> 00:12:34.148\nIs it Mike and\nI sitting in the table talking?\n\n263\n00:12:34.148 --> 00:12:38.116\nAre we flipping over pieces of paper with\nnumbers them, and if I say email and\n\n264\n00:12:38.116 --> 00:12:41.726\nMike flips over a five,\nthat's now the fifth most important thing?\n\n265\n00:12:41.726 --> 00:12:46.391\nThat may work, but that's probably not the\nrecommended methodology that we want to\n\n266\n00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.558\nengage in, at least,\nnot in most organizations today.\n\n267\n00:12:49.558 --> 00:12:51.501\nSo, the reality is we have to have a plan,\nand\n\n268\n00:12:51.501 --> 00:12:55.098\nthe plan involves conducting what's known\nas a BIA, a business impact analysis.\n\n269\n00:12:55.098 --> 00:12:57.938\nSo, what we want to do is walk\nyou through the logic of that.\n\n270\n00:12:57.938 --> 00:12:58.779\nWe want to show, and\n\n271\n00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:01.658\nI think it's a good time to throw\nup first graphic we have, exactly.\n\n272\n00:13:01.658 --> 00:13:06.218\nRight there, the goals and the process,\nthe four step process for BIA.\n\n273\n00:13:06.218 --> 00:13:10.238\nLet's start by defining what business\nimpact analysis, or BIA, actually is.\n\n274\n00:13:10.238 --> 00:13:13.698\nThe goals of what a BIA represent\nhelp us to understand this.\n\n275\n00:13:13.698 --> 00:13:15.102\nAnd when you look at the screen,\n\n276\n00:13:15.102 --> 00:13:17.818\nwe're thinking about being\nable to determine criticality.\n\n277\n00:13:17.818 --> 00:13:20.328\nWe're thinking about being able\nto estimate maximum downtime.\n\n278\n00:13:20.328 --> 00:13:23.598\nWe're gonna define downtime and\nwhat that is here as we go through.\n\n279\n00:13:23.598 --> 00:13:25.258\nWe'll throw some terms at you.\n\n280\n00:13:25.258 --> 00:13:28.816\nWe'll talk about RPO, we'll talk\nabout RTO, we'll talk about MTD,\n\n281\n00:13:28.816 --> 00:13:32.098\nwe'll define all those terms for\nyou in just a couple of minutes.\n\n282\n00:13:32.098 --> 00:13:35.318\nWe're gonna evaluate internal and\nexternal resource requirements.\n\n283\n00:13:35.318 --> 00:13:40.027\nSo the goal of the BIA, the goal of\nthe business impact assessment or\n\n284\n00:13:40.027 --> 00:13:44.157\nbusiness impact analysis is to\nlook at all the services that\n\n285\n00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:46.323\nwe offer in the organization.\n\n286\n00:13:46.323 --> 00:13:49.010\nE-mail, color printing, web access,\n\n287\n00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:53.541\nremote access to internal resources,\nfile and print, non-color,\n\n288\n00:13:53.541 --> 00:13:58.178\njust generic file and print,\ndirectory services, all these things.\n\n289\n00:13:58.178 --> 00:14:02.051\nWe're gonna look at all of them, and\nwe're gonna determine their criticality on\n\n290\n00:14:02.051 --> 00:14:04.588\na scale of one to ten,\nhow important is this service.\n\n291\n00:14:04.588 --> 00:14:05.988\nLet's rank that service.\n\n292\n00:14:05.988 --> 00:14:08.168\nTen being the highest,\none being the lowest.\n\n293\n00:14:08.168 --> 00:14:12.440\nWe're gonna give everything a numerical\nquantity of some kind we can measure.\n\n294\n00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.490\nAnd then we're gonna calculate who\nhas the highest set of rankings and\n\n295\n00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.706\nwho therefore or what services\ntherefore have the highest criticality.\n\n296\n00:14:18.706 --> 00:14:20.466\nYou may say,\nwell everything's a ten, Adam.\n\n297\n00:14:20.466 --> 00:14:22.786\nI'm going to say, okay, but you know what?\n\n298\n00:14:22.786 --> 00:14:25.148\nWhile that may in you world make sense,\nlet's step back and\n\n299\n00:14:25.148 --> 00:14:28.268\nre-think about that because we can't\nsay everything is equally important,\n\n300\n00:14:28.268 --> 00:14:30.458\nbecause we're not gonna be\nable to cover everything.\n\n301\n00:14:30.458 --> 00:14:33.898\nThat's just the brutal reality of\nwhat happens when we have a problem.\n\n302\n00:14:33.898 --> 00:14:35.858\nSo if everything is equally important,\nI get that.\n\n303\n00:14:35.858 --> 00:14:38.962\nBut what is more important within\neverything being equally important is what\n\n304\n00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:40.164\nwe're trying to figure out.\n\n305\n00:14:40.164 --> 00:14:42.353\nI'm not saying that color\nprinting isn't important.\n\n306\n00:14:42.353 --> 00:14:46.984\nI’m saying that, as we look at being out\nof services, things are not working.\n\n307\n00:14:46.984 --> 00:14:50.900\nWe look at a situation where we have\ndown time staring us in the face,\n\n308\n00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.505\nwhat we wanna understand is, what is\ngonna be most critical or more important,\n\n309\n00:14:55.505 --> 00:14:59.902\nright, for us to be able to recover,\nand which things are not as important,\n\n310\n00:14:59.902 --> 00:15:04.068\ntherefore, perhaps things that we\ndon't need to recover right away.\n\n311\n00:15:04.068 --> 00:15:05.836\nOr at least have a sense of what they are,\n\n312\n00:15:05.836 --> 00:15:09.218\nwhether we choose to recover them right\naway or not is open for conversation.\n\n313\n00:15:09.218 --> 00:15:12.008\nSo I wanna estimate what\nthe criticality is or determine it.\n\n314\n00:15:12.008 --> 00:15:13.988\nAlso estimate maximum downtime.\n\n315\n00:15:13.988 --> 00:15:17.008\nHow long can we live without that service?\n\n316\n00:15:17.008 --> 00:15:19.448\nHow long can color printing\nactually not be available?\n\n317\n00:15:19.448 --> 00:15:23.088\nIt could be minutes, days, hours,\nweeks, months, I don't know.\n\n318\n00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:27.298\nWell, we have to say, if color printing\nnever ever came back, would we be okay?\n\n319\n00:15:27.298 --> 00:15:31.123\nAnd that may or may not be a good\nthing for the organization.\n\n320\n00:15:31.123 --> 00:15:32.363\nWe want to estimate downtime.\n\n321\n00:15:32.363 --> 00:15:34.768\nAgain, downtime is a measure of time.\n\n322\n00:15:34.768 --> 00:15:39.277\nSeconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks,\nmonths, any or all those are acceptable\n\n323\n00:15:39.277 --> 00:15:42.798\nmeasures depending on the kind of\ndown time we're talking about.\n\n324\n00:15:42.798 --> 00:15:46.338\nAnd then evaluate internal and\nexternal resource requirements.\n\n325\n00:15:46.338 --> 00:15:47.998\nWho needs the service?\n\n326\n00:15:47.998 --> 00:15:52.677\nWho is consuming it, so who is effectively\nthe audience that we're looking at?\n\n327\n00:15:52.677 --> 00:15:56.834\nIs it senior management, because\nemail is a everybody kind of service.\n\n328\n00:15:56.834 --> 00:16:00.406\nBut clearly, senior management is really\nfocused on the use of it as well.\n\n329\n00:16:00.406 --> 00:16:02.778\nAnd so, that's gonna be something\nwe have to think about,\n\n330\n00:16:02.778 --> 00:16:06.204\nwhereas color printing may be a very small\nsubset of people within the organization.\n\n331\n00:16:06.204 --> 00:16:09.198\nMaybe just the sales or maybe\nthe sales and marketing department and\n\n332\n00:16:09.198 --> 00:16:12.102\nwe're not suggesting for\na minute that they're not important.\n\n333\n00:16:12.102 --> 00:16:15.756\nWhat we're simply saying is that if\nthere's only five or ten people in that\n\n334\n00:16:15.756 --> 00:16:19.178\ndepartment, it may not be as important\nto recover service only five or\n\n335\n00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:23.075\nten people use as opposed to email,\nwhich everybody uses in the organization.\n\n336\n00:16:23.075 --> 00:16:26.550\nEven the sales and marketing people,\nwhich may encompass a thousand people\n\n337\n00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.950\nhypothetically, if we have\na large organization.\n\n338\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:31.931\n>> Now as a CISSP,\nare we typically involved in coming up\n\n339\n00:16:31.931 --> 00:16:36.252\nwith these numbers or are we gathering\nthis information from the higher ups?\n\n340\n00:16:36.252 --> 00:16:41.268\nIs there something that we should know or\nwe're gonna just ask the right questions?\n\n341\n00:16:41.268 --> 00:16:44.266\n>> So typically, what we wanna think\nabout is that we're gonna ask and\n\n342\n00:16:44.266 --> 00:16:46.063\nit's a great question that Mike asked.\n\n343\n00:16:46.063 --> 00:16:49.046\nIt's a great thought process for\nhim to drag us into thinking about,\n\n344\n00:16:49.046 --> 00:16:50.904\nbecause it's the exact place we wanna be.\n\n345\n00:16:50.904 --> 00:16:52.872\nWe have to bring in the senior leaders,\n\n346\n00:16:52.872 --> 00:16:56.105\nthe stakeholders as we often refer\nto them in the organization.\n\n347\n00:16:56.105 --> 00:17:00.087\nWe have to get them to help us\nunderstand what is critical, but\n\n348\n00:17:00.087 --> 00:17:03.547\nit's not just the stakeholders\nat the senior level.\n\n349\n00:17:03.547 --> 00:17:05.871\nIt has to be the people that\nare managing those services also,\n\n350\n00:17:05.871 --> 00:17:07.356\nbecause they're also stakeholders.\n\n351\n00:17:07.356 --> 00:17:11.001\nSo the people in charge of email have to\nchime in, because they may say, well, no,\n\n352\n00:17:11.001 --> 00:17:12.161\nit's really important.\n\n353\n00:17:12.161 --> 00:17:15.266\nAnd then other people may say, well yeah,\nbut so's color printing and so\n\n354\n00:17:15.266 --> 00:17:17.236\nwe need to hear from a lot\nof different people.\n\n355\n00:17:17.236 --> 00:17:19.441\nWe need to hear from\nusers of the services,\n\n356\n00:17:19.441 --> 00:17:22.832\nwe need to hear from managers that\nprovide and provision access.\n\n357\n00:17:22.832 --> 00:17:23.809\nAnd from the owners,\n\n358\n00:17:23.809 --> 00:17:27.568\nthe stakeholders of the business and those\nrequirements all have to be rolled in.\n\n359\n00:17:27.568 --> 00:17:29.239\nSo we're definitely gonna\ndo some fact finding.\n\n360\n00:17:29.239 --> 00:17:30.661\nWe have talked about how to do or\n\n361\n00:17:30.661 --> 00:17:34.022\nengage in requirements gathering in\none of our earlier conversations.\n\n362\n00:17:34.022 --> 00:17:35.661\nSo we're gonna bring that to bare here.\n\n363\n00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:37.310\nIs this impact analysis?\n\n364\n00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.772\nIt's all about requirements gathering.\n\n365\n00:17:38.772 --> 00:17:40.189\nWho's using the service?\n\n366\n00:17:40.189 --> 00:17:41.071\nWhat is the service?\n\n367\n00:17:41.071 --> 00:17:42.186\nWhy is it critical?\n\n368\n00:17:42.186 --> 00:17:43.289\nHow do we measure it?\n\n369\n00:17:43.289 --> 00:17:44.810\nHow long can we do without it?\n\n370\n00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:46.932\nPlease don't ask me to repeat\nthose things, but there are five.\n\n371\n00:17:46.932 --> 00:17:48.512\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We have a rewind button for\n\n372\n00:17:48.512 --> 00:17:49.300\nthat exact reason.\n\n373\n00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:52.039\nSo you can go back and you can listen,\nbut all kidding aside.\n\n374\n00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:55.743\nThose things are super critical for\nus to understand and to interview, to walk\n\n375\n00:17:55.743 --> 00:17:59.575\nthrough the processes Mike was helping us\nto understand about that as we engage.\n\n376\n00:17:59.575 --> 00:18:00.679\nSo we have our three goals,\n\n377\n00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:02.941\nif we can go back and\ntake a look at our purposes, right?\n\n378\n00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:07.017\nSo the BIA Goals are up there, now let's\nlook at the processes and the BIA process.\n\n379\n00:18:07.017 --> 00:18:09.698\nWhat are the four steps involved\nwith BIA in other words?\n\n380\n00:18:09.698 --> 00:18:12.101\nHow do we engage in the BIA activity?\n\n381\n00:18:12.101 --> 00:18:13.623\nWe gather information.\n\n382\n00:18:13.623 --> 00:18:14.299\nAs I've said,\n\n383\n00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:17.373\nwe have to go through a fact-finding\nsolution as we just heard about.\n\n384\n00:18:17.373 --> 00:18:18.940\nWe have to take that information.\n\n385\n00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.342\nWe don't have to analyze,\ncuz gathering the facts is okay.\n\n386\n00:18:22.342 --> 00:18:25.250\nBut unless we understand what they're\ntelling us, we get a lot of stuff and\n\n387\n00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:26.742\nwe barely understand what's there.\n\n388\n00:18:26.742 --> 00:18:28.622\nSo gather, first.\n\n389\n00:18:28.622 --> 00:18:30.120\nAnalyze, second.\n\n390\n00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.699\nPerform a threat analysis.\n\n391\n00:18:31.699 --> 00:18:35.884\nThreat analysis helps us to understand\nwhat the potential impact of that service\n\n392\n00:18:35.884 --> 00:18:38.048\nor that offering not being available is.\n\n393\n00:18:38.048 --> 00:18:41.912\nIf we make our living by using our\nemail as well as our phone system,\n\n394\n00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:44.672\nour void system to be able\nto reach customers and\n\n395\n00:18:44.672 --> 00:18:49.364\nwe don't have access to either of those\nplatforms as a result of a system outage,\n\n396\n00:18:49.364 --> 00:18:53.932\nthat's probably the most critical thing\nwe have to focus on being able to fix.\n\n397\n00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:57.327\nBecause without that, our customers don't\nknow we're alive and we can't talk to\n\n398\n00:18:57.327 --> 00:19:00.283\nthem and they're gonna start thinking\nmaybe something's happened and\n\n399\n00:19:00.283 --> 00:19:01.899\nmaybe they can't do business with us.\n\n400\n00:19:01.899 --> 00:19:05.104\nAnd that's a significant stretch,\nour ability to run the business and\n\n401\n00:19:05.104 --> 00:19:07.777\nto, obviously,\nmaintain our customer relationships and\n\n402\n00:19:07.777 --> 00:19:10.246\nthen document results and\npresent recommendations.\n\n403\n00:19:10.246 --> 00:19:14.427\nWhat most people forget to do in\nthe BIA process is step number four.\n\n404\n00:19:14.427 --> 00:19:16.244\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They forget they have to document\n\n405\n00:19:16.244 --> 00:19:19.483\nresults and present those findings and\nthe question is present recommendations or\n\n406\n00:19:19.483 --> 00:19:20.185\nfindings to who?\n\n407\n00:19:20.185 --> 00:19:24.101\nBack to the business,\nto senior leadership, to the stakeholders,\n\n408\n00:19:24.101 --> 00:19:28.758\nto make sure that what we figured out from\nour analysis aligns with what they feel is\n\n409\n00:19:28.758 --> 00:19:30.734\nactually the story we wanna tell.\n\n410\n00:19:30.734 --> 00:19:35.203\nMeaning, yes, recover email before you\nrecover color printing or you know what?\n\n411\n00:19:35.203 --> 00:19:38.547\nI don't care what you found, color\nprinting is the thing we do no matter\n\n412\n00:19:38.547 --> 00:19:40.741\nwhat, everything else\nis secondary to that.\n\n413\n00:19:40.741 --> 00:19:44.942\nThe stakeholders may say that even though\nwe've figured out something different and\n\n414\n00:19:44.942 --> 00:19:48.498\nnow that becomes a negotiation,\nbecause now we have to agree before we go\n\n415\n00:19:48.498 --> 00:19:51.902\nforward on what we're gonna do in\norder to figure out how to recover.\n\n416\n00:19:51.902 --> 00:19:52.924\nIt becomes very important.\n\n417\n00:19:52.924 --> 00:19:56.406\nSo we have the BIA process\nas a CIS' big candidate.\n\n418\n00:19:56.406 --> 00:19:58.473\nLet me be clear, I may be unequivocal.\n\n419\n00:19:58.473 --> 00:20:02.106\nYou must understand what the four\nsteps of the BIA process are.\n\n420\n00:20:02.106 --> 00:20:05.860\nIn other words, in general, it's safe to\nsay whenever we talk about a process,\n\n421\n00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.143\nyou should always know\nthe steps of the process.\n\n422\n00:20:08.143 --> 00:20:10.105\nWe don't go to the trouble\nof explaining it to you,\n\n423\n00:20:10.105 --> 00:20:11.939\nif we don't want you to\nunderstand it clearly.\n\n424\n00:20:11.939 --> 00:20:15.210\nWell, we want you to make sure\nyou're comfortable with it, so\n\n425\n00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:19.221\nthat you can apply the process if asked\nin any order it may come up to a problem,\n\n426\n00:20:19.221 --> 00:20:23.571\na scenario, anything we ask you to talk\nabout, so you can derive the right answer.\n\n427\n00:20:23.571 --> 00:20:26.822\nSo it's very important for\nyou to focus on the steps in the process.\n\n428\n00:20:26.822 --> 00:20:27.982\nVery, very critical,\n\n429\n00:20:27.982 --> 00:20:29.759\nknowledge item as we say-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n430\n00:20:29.759 --> 00:20:30.839\n>> That you wanna be aware of.\n\n431\n00:20:30.839 --> 00:20:32.792\nWe've talked about the steps\nto go through this.\n\n432\n00:20:32.792 --> 00:20:33.687\nI didn't mean to cut you off, sorry.\n\n433\n00:20:33.687 --> 00:20:36.044\nWe've talked about the steps\nin order in the process.\n\n434\n00:20:36.044 --> 00:20:38.321\nSteps here, you'll see them on the screen.\n\n435\n00:20:38.321 --> 00:20:41.340\nThey are effectively step one,\ntwo, three and four in order.\n\n436\n00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.640\nPlease know them that way.\n\n437\n00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.053\nPlease understand what happens as\na result of each of those process steps.\n\n438\n00:20:46.053 --> 00:20:47.446\n>> So hint, hint.\n\n439\n00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:49.466\nMake sure you know those steps well.\n\n440\n00:20:49.466 --> 00:20:50.163\nRight, Adam?\n\n441\n00:20:50.163 --> 00:20:52.183\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes, that's very important.\n\n442\n00:20:52.183 --> 00:20:53.506\nMake sure you focus on those steps.\n\n443\n00:20:53.506 --> 00:20:54.901\nCan't make that hint big enough.\n\n444\n00:20:54.901 --> 00:20:57.061\nBig asterisk,\nwanna make sure we know what those are.\n\n445\n00:20:57.061 --> 00:21:01.496\nSo as we're talking about the steps in\nthe BIA, the process steps, what they are.\n\n446\n00:21:01.496 --> 00:21:03.899\nWe also wanna talk about\nmeasurement of time.\n\n447\n00:21:03.899 --> 00:21:07.344\nWe talked about the fact that we would\ntalk about what is acceptable in terms of\n\n448\n00:21:07.344 --> 00:21:09.042\nthese system outage or the downtime.\n\n449\n00:21:09.042 --> 00:21:13.159\nNow having said that, the reality\nis zero downtime is what we want.\n\n450\n00:21:13.159 --> 00:21:16.374\nBut we also know that we have to be\ncritical about the fact that we may not be\n\n451\n00:21:16.374 --> 00:21:19.329\nable to get to a zero downtime solution,\nbecause our technology or\n\n452\n00:21:19.329 --> 00:21:21.204\nthe problem may prevent us from doing so.\n\n453\n00:21:21.204 --> 00:21:24.718\nSo if we assume there may be a certain\namount of downtime, we have to then figure\n\n454\n00:21:24.718 --> 00:21:27.775\nout how to measure how much of that\ndowntime is gonna be acceptable.\n\n455\n00:21:27.775 --> 00:21:30.271\nHow do we operate within\nthe downtime parameters?\n\n456\n00:21:30.271 --> 00:21:34.303\nHow do we understand how to manipulate\nthat, so we can recover as quickly\n\n457\n00:21:34.303 --> 00:21:38.532\nas possible, but also state unequivocally\nwhat our goal is for recovery and\n\n458\n00:21:38.532 --> 00:21:40.204\ndraw a clear line in the sand.\n\n459\n00:21:40.204 --> 00:21:44.200\nSo that we know that if we go past\nthis line is referred to as MTD and\n\n460\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.460\nwe're going to define what\nthis is in just a minute.\n\n461\n00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.884\nIf we don't understand what that line\nin the sand is and we go past it,\n\n462\n00:21:50.884 --> 00:21:53.081\nwe don't understand that we've shifted.\n\n463\n00:21:53.081 --> 00:21:56.058\nThen all of the sudden, we now have\nsomething called a disaster that we have\n\n464\n00:21:56.058 --> 00:21:57.957\nto think through and\nunderstand how to manage.\n\n465\n00:21:57.957 --> 00:21:59.880\nBecause if we bypass that line and\n\n466\n00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.245\nwe cannot recover our systems\nwithin that amount of time,\n\n467\n00:22:03.245 --> 00:22:07.161\nthen what ultimately happens is we\nnow have to go into a whole process\n\n468\n00:22:07.161 --> 00:22:11.980\naround trying to figure out how to get\nback that system and bring it back online.\n\n469\n00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.170\nWe have to take additional steps,\n\n470\n00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.080\nbecause the one's we've been engaging in,\nhaven't worked up until now.\n\n471\n00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.604\nSo let's take a look at\nthat pretty picture.\n\n472\n00:22:17.604 --> 00:22:18.638\nThere we go.\n\n473\n00:22:18.638 --> 00:22:23.096\nSo Mike was the artist to put this\ntogether for us, so props to him.\n\n474\n00:22:23.096 --> 00:22:26.300\nHe's actually Vincent Van Mike\nbehind the scenes here.\n\n475\n00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.457\nSo what we have is a timeline.\n\n476\n00:22:29.457 --> 00:22:33.698\nWe often use picture like this to\ntalk about the three terms that\n\n477\n00:22:33.698 --> 00:22:36.992\nare in white text items,\nthe acronyms up at top.\n\n478\n00:22:36.992 --> 00:22:42.100\nRPO, RTO and MTD and\nlet's define what these terms are.\n\n479\n00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:47.336\nRPO, recovery point objective,\nvery important term for us to be aware of.\n\n480\n00:22:47.336 --> 00:22:52.673\nRecovery point objective, it's gonna be\nthe point at which we can effectively\n\n481\n00:22:52.673 --> 00:22:57.550\nspecify and we say, this is the point for\nan application that we look at.\n\n482\n00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:59.628\nSo we think about RPO's\nbuyout application.\n\n483\n00:22:59.628 --> 00:23:02.966\nSo let's say,\nwe're thinking about this for a email or\n\n484\n00:23:02.966 --> 00:23:06.813\nwe're thinking about this for\na database program of some kind.\n\n485\n00:23:06.813 --> 00:23:10.308\nPick an application, it doesn't matter\nwhat it is for the application.\n\n486\n00:23:10.308 --> 00:23:13.208\nThis refers to the point in time\nto which data must be restored, so\n\n487\n00:23:13.208 --> 00:23:15.288\nthat we can successfully\nresume processing.\n\n488\n00:23:15.288 --> 00:23:19.677\nSo in other words, if we are backing up,\nhypothetically, our data from our email\n\n489\n00:23:19.677 --> 00:23:24.209\nsystem and we say that we're replicating\nin that backed up data every 15 minutes.\n\n490\n00:23:24.209 --> 00:23:28.648\nSo we're backing it up and we have 15\nminutes worth of data that we've backed up\n\n491\n00:23:28.648 --> 00:23:32.633\nand we move that off the system and\nnow we start the clock ticking again and\n\n492\n00:23:32.633 --> 00:23:35.071\nthen 15 minutes later, we back up again.\n\n493\n00:23:35.071 --> 00:23:37.509\nWe have a 15 minute RPO window.\n\n494\n00:23:37.509 --> 00:23:41.370\nSo what that means in effect is\nthat we may, if we have a problem,\n\n495\n00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:42.524\nwe have an outage.\n\n496\n00:23:42.524 --> 00:23:47.257\nWe may be able to recover within a 15\nminute window, but there may be up to 15\n\n497\n00:23:47.257 --> 00:23:51.592\nminutes of transactional data that\nin effect may actually disappear.\n\n498\n00:23:51.592 --> 00:23:56.271\nWe've set, in other words, the RPO, the\nwindow for recoverability at 15 minutes.\n\n499\n00:23:56.271 --> 00:24:00.069\nIf we want a smaller window, we have\nto shorten That backup cycle, and so\n\n500\n00:24:00.069 --> 00:24:03.388\nwe're going to backup and\nreplicate data every five minutes.\n\n501\n00:24:03.388 --> 00:24:05.615\nAnd then the RPO,\nthe recovery point objective,\n\n502\n00:24:05.615 --> 00:24:08.230\nbecomes a five minute window for\nloss of data.\n\n503\n00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:13.310\nSo RPO signifies the amount of data that,\nin effect, we're willing to\n\n504\n00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:17.250\nlose to say we are successful at\nrestoring, whatever that window is.\n\n505\n00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:21.950\nNow, many businesses\nwill set RPOs very low,\n\n506\n00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.970\nbecause they wanna have a very\nsmall window for loss of data.\n\n507\n00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.820\nThey may say, we want a,\neffectively a zero RPO.\n\n508\n00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.370\nWe want no loss of data.\n\n509\n00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.940\nSo we may have to use\nfault tolerant technology.\n\n510\n00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.330\nWe may have to do something\nlike hot mirroring,\n\n511\n00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:37.870\nwhere we're writing data to two places\nthrough replication simultaneously.\n\n512\n00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:39.720\nBut we have technologies to do that.\n\n513\n00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:42.050\nThen the RPO effectively is set to zero.\n\n514\n00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:43.304\nWe should not lose data,\n\n515\n00:24:43.304 --> 00:24:46.965\nbecause we are effectively putting\ndata live into both systems at once.\n\n516\n00:24:46.965 --> 00:24:51.830\nAnd if one system fails, the other\nsystem can then actually be used.\n\n517\n00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.460\nMakes a lot of sense\nwhen we think about it.\n\n518\n00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.850\n>> So\nwhy wouldn't everybody want a zero RPO?\n\n519\n00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.000\n>> Well, good question.\n\n520\n00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.240\nSo the question then becomes,\n\n521\n00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.540\nhow much money are you willing\nto spend on recovery, right?\n\n522\n00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.780\nBecause to get to a zero RPO,\n\n523\n00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.560\nwe have to look at the fact that\nwe're gonna have to spend money.\n\n524\n00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:10.490\nAnd, obviously, invest resources,\nto be able to achieve a system\n\n525\n00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.310\nthat can do whatever those things\nare that would get us to a zero RPO.\n\n526\n00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:15.650\nSo hypothetically, and\n\n527\n00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.420\nactually in the real world, let's give\nyou a real practical example of this.\n\n528\n00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.800\nSo if you use virtualization technology,\n\n529\n00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.470\nif you're familiar with either VMWare,\nZSXI product or\n\n530\n00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:29.190\nyou're familiar with Microsoft's Hyper-V\nproduct, or Citrix's XenServer, XenCenter,\n\n531\n00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:32.440\netc., all these are major\nvirtualization vendors today.\n\n532\n00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:38.050\nThey all offer some form of replication\nproduct ,whether it's a virtual appliance,\n\n533\n00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:42.420\nor some sort of third party solution we\ncan use, that allows us to measure and\n\n534\n00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.030\neffectively set an RPO for\nvirtual data, or\n\n535\n00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:50.150\nvitalized data that has to be replicated\nfor us to engage in recovery.\n\n536\n00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:54.541\nThat RPO typically, using a built-in\nfunction, is about 15 minutes.\n\n537\n00:25:54.541 --> 00:25:58.047\nYou can't get below that using\nthe current built-in technology in most\n\n538\n00:25:58.047 --> 00:25:59.090\nof those platforms.\n\n539\n00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:02.920\nIf you go out and spend extra money and\nlicense another product for\n\n540\n00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.940\nseveral additional dollars,\nyou can then get a much lower RPO.\n\n541\n00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:09.770\nBut that's going to involve\nan additional investment of resources.\n\n542\n00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.200\nSo it's really a question of what you want\nto spend, ultimately, more often than not.\n\n543\n00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.922\nSo you can make those checks\nout to Adam and Mike.\n\n544\n00:26:14.922 --> 00:26:16.975\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Care of IT Pro TV.\n\n545\n00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:18.320\n[LAUGH] Just kidding.\n\n546\n00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.238\n>> Most organizations,\nwhile they might strive for a zero RPO,\n\n547\n00:26:21.238 --> 00:26:24.562\nare gonna find that, realistically,\nwe're not going to get there.\n\n548\n00:26:24.562 --> 00:26:27.830\nAnd we've got to figure out what we\ncan afford to lose as a business.\n\n549\n00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.550\n>> Right, because what we have to be\nrealistic about as security professionals\n\n550\n00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:33.040\nis helping the business to\nmove to the understanding\n\n551\n00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.620\nthat not all data may be recoverable.\n\n552\n00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.750\nAnd that's just a fact,\nit's just a statement.\n\n553\n00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.190\nWe can strive to get there, but\n\n554\n00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.260\nyou're gonna have to spend a lot of\nmoney to make all data recoverable.\n\n555\n00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.170\nAnd the business,\n\n556\n00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.890\nwhen it finds out what that costs,\nmay not want to spend the money.\n\n557\n00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.289\nThey may say, you know what Adam,\ntha's okay, but you know what?\n\n558\n00:26:48.289 --> 00:26:52.780\nI'd rather not spend $150,000 a year\nto make all of our date recoverable.\n\n559\n00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.052\nI'dd rather spend $15,000 a year and\n\n560\n00:26:55.052 --> 00:26:58.470\nlive with a loss of 15 minutes\nof transactional data.\n\n561\n00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.040\nWe can make that happen, no problem,\nbut you gotta tell me that.\n\n562\n00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.310\nYou and I have to agree.\n\n563\n00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:03.830\nIt's gonna be very important.\n\n564\n00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.440\nAll right, so\nlet's go back to the graphic if we could.\n\n565\n00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:10.100\nSo we have RPO, let's talk about RTO,\nrecovery time objective.\n\n566\n00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:16.110\nRTO allows us to be able to focus on\nthe idea that we have to come up with,\n\n567\n00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:21.690\nultimately, a measure of\ntime that we will recover\n\n568\n00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:25.470\nbefore we can say, you know what,\nwe're back and everything is good.\n\n569\n00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:29.985\nSo RTO, recovery time objective,\nis a flag we put in the ground.\n\n570\n00:27:29.985 --> 00:27:34.325\nThat is the point that we strive to\nbring the system back online by.\n\n571\n00:27:34.325 --> 00:27:35.801\nIt's a time measure, right?\n\n572\n00:27:35.801 --> 00:27:39.645\nOur RPO, remember, is a time measure as\nwell, but RPO says we may lose up to,\n\n573\n00:27:39.645 --> 00:27:43.065\nlet's say 15 minutes, in our example,\nof transactional data.\n\n574\n00:27:43.065 --> 00:27:46.397\nSo, that's fine, but\nRTO is also a measure of time.\n\n575\n00:27:46.397 --> 00:27:52.315\nRTO says, we wanna recover that system\nwithin one hour of it being offline.\n\n576\n00:27:52.315 --> 00:27:57.390\nNow we may not be losing data as a result\nof meeting the RTO objective, or we may.\n\n577\n00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:02.220\nThe RPO may say 15 minutes, but if we\nhave a backup that runs every 15 minutes,\n\n578\n00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.400\nwe can recover up to\nthe last 15 minutes of data.\n\n579\n00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.080\nBut it may take us an hour to\nbring the system back online,\n\n580\n00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.770\nin order to put that data back in and\nhave it operational.\n\n581\n00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:14.350\nRTO is the measure of that time it\ntakes to bring the system back up and\n\n582\n00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:15.460\nmake it operational.\n\n583\n00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:20.168\nThe earliest, very, very clear, very\nimportant here, earliest time that we can\n\n584\n00:28:20.168 --> 00:28:24.219\nstrive to get that system recovered\nis what RTO typically represents.\n\n585\n00:28:24.219 --> 00:28:27.975\nSo, if RTO is our target under everything\nworking the right way, that set of\n\n586\n00:28:27.975 --> 00:28:32.219\ncircumstances, everything, all the magic\nhappens, everything comes together.\n\n587\n00:28:32.219 --> 00:28:36.925\nRTO indicates that earliest time\nwindow where we could successfully\n\n588\n00:28:36.925 --> 00:28:40.270\nrecover the system and\nexpect to be back online.\n\n589\n00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:43.576\nThat's the measure of time it takes\nto recover and put everything back.\n\n590\n00:28:43.576 --> 00:28:48.497\nNow we also have something that's called\nMTD, which is kind of bracket or a brace,\n\n591\n00:28:48.497 --> 00:28:52.670\nor whatever we would call it at\nthe top there, A parenthesis perhaps.\n\n592\n00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:56.881\nAnd at the top you'll notice that goes\nfrom the left hand side of RTO, all\n\n593\n00:28:56.881 --> 00:29:02.220\nthe way across to the far right hand side,\nright, where it says resume production.\n\n594\n00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.330\nNow, MTD incorporates, or\nencompasses, that whole window.\n\n595\n00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.861\nAnd what we say,\n\n596\n00:29:05.861 --> 00:29:10.770\nand what you need to understand is\nthat RTO needs to be always set less.\n\n597\n00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:16.720\nIt needs to be shorter, or it needs to be\na time value that is lower than the MTD.\n\n598\n00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:20.080\nMTD, maximum tolerable downtime,\n\n599\n00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:25.080\nis gonna be the maximum time amount that\nwe will spend trying to recover a system.\n\n600\n00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.220\nWe say RTO should be less,\nbecause if RTO is less and\n\n601\n00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:32.190\nwe miss the RTO window, we still have\na buffer that we can recover within,\n\n602\n00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.530\nbefore we have to declare a disaster.\n\n603\n00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:39.509\nIf we hit the MTD barrier, which is\nthe right-hand side of that diagram,\n\n604\n00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:43.706\nand we have not recovered by then,\nthen everything changes.\n\n605\n00:29:43.706 --> 00:29:46.826\nBecause at that point,\nwe have to declare a disaster and say,\n\n606\n00:29:46.826 --> 00:29:49.960\nwe no longer have any more time,\nsomething's gotta change.\n\n607\n00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:51.660\nWhat we're doing isn't working.\n\n608\n00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.130\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe now have a disaster.\n\n609\n00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:57.270\nWe have to go into what's known as\ndisaster recovery planning, DRP,\n\n610\n00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:59.810\nand execute our disaster recovery plan.\n\n611\n00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.990\nWe'll talk more about DRP later in\none of our other conversations.\n\n612\n00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:07.948\nBut MTD, the MTD barrier is the line\nin the sand that we must absolutely\n\n613\n00:30:07.948 --> 00:30:09.892\nrecover by no matter what.\n\n614\n00:30:09.892 --> 00:30:13.210\nAnd if we can't recover by then,\nwe have to declare disaster.\n\n615\n00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.420\nNow, before we wrap up, cuz I know Mike\nis looking at me expectantly, waiting on\n\n616\n00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:20.450\nme to finish, and I am going to right now,\nbut before we do, one quick thing.\n\n617\n00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.430\nIf you need, and\nyou do need rather, I should say,\n\n618\n00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.430\nto understand the following,\nas I mentioned.\n\n619\n00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.930\nWe do say that RTO should be, and\n\n620\n00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:31.220\nindeed more often than not is,\nset to be less than MTD.\n\n621\n00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.010\nHowever, that's not a hard fast rule,\n\n622\n00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:36.340\nin a sense that if you don't do\nit that way, things don't work.\n\n623\n00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.710\nThe recommendation simply is that\nyou want to have a buffer, so\n\n624\n00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:43.710\nif you miss the RTO window for recovery,\nyou still have time to figure out\n\n625\n00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:47.060\nhow to do something else,\nbefore you have to declare disaster.\n\n626\n00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:50.944\nThis is why we say RTO should\ntypically be less than MTD.\n\n627\n00:30:50.944 --> 00:30:52.830\nBut I wanna be clear that this is not,\n\n628\n00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.530\nif you don't do it this way,\neverything breaks.\n\n629\n00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.410\nThis is simply a recommendation.\n\n630\n00:30:57.410 --> 00:31:00.560\nAnd this is the best practice\nrecommendation we often follow.\n\n631\n00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.340\n>> All right, Adam,\nlot of great information there.\n\n632\n00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:06.050\nLooking at that business continuity and\nbusiness impact analysis.\n\n633\n00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.740\nA lot of important terms in there,\nas well.\n\n634\n00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.870\nWe've got our recovery point objective,\nour recovery time objective, and\n\n635\n00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:14.060\nthat maximum tolerable downtime.\n\n636\n00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:18.100\nAnd seeing how they all fit together in\nbuilding that timeline, so we can make\n\n637\n00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:23.920\nthe appropriate plans and get our systems\nback online, and keep our business going.\n\n638\n00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.310\nAll right, well, Adam,\nwe appreciate that, great stuff.\n\n639\n00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:30.080\nRemember, if you wanna see Adam and\nwanna attend one of his live classes,\n\n640\n00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:33.610\nshoot an email over there\nto SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n641\n00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.357\nBut for this episode,\nsigning out, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n642\n00:31:36.357 --> 00:31:38.960\n>> I'm Adam, and remember,\nrecover early and recover often.\n\n643\n00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.066\nWe'll see you soon.\n\n644\n00:31:40.066 -->

--> 00:00:17.497\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.497 --> 00:00:18.216\n>> Exciting.\n\n5\n00:00:18.216 --> 00:00:20.631\n>> That would make it much\nmore exciting wouldn't it?\n\n6\n00:00:20.631 --> 00:00:22.671\nAnd today we're going over CISSP.\n\n7\n00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:27.715\nAnd specifically, we're gonna be focusing\nin on personnel security policies.\n\n8\n00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:29.940\nRight?\nWe've gotta deal with people that work for\n\n9\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.940\nour organization, and some of the security\nis obviously gonna focus on that.\n\n10\n00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.555\nAnd Mr Adam Gordon is back with\nus to help us work through this.\n\n11\n00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:37.815\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:37.815 --> 00:00:39.235\n>> I'm good.\nI'm feeling very secure, Mike.\n\n13\n00:00:39.235 --> 00:00:40.395\nSo, you're making me feel comfortable,\n\n14\n00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:43.375\nwhich is important when we talk\nabout personnel security, right?\n\n15\n00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:45.535\nSo, when we think about\npersonnel security, and\n\n16\n00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:48.035\nwe think about what's involved\nin personnel security, well,\n\n17\n00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:51.655\nwe have to think about is,what\nhappens when we focus on people?\n\n18\n00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:54.375\nRight up until now we've really been\ntalking about how do we focus on\n\n19\n00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:55.225\ninformation?\n\n20\n00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:56.365\nWhat is information?\n\n21\n00:00:56.365 --> 00:00:57.515\nHow do we secure it?\n\n22\n00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:00.720\nWhat are the services that\nare important to the organization?\n\n23\n00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.080\nHow do we know we have to recover them,\nin what order?\n\n24\n00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.490\nHow do we know they are important?\n\n25\n00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.050\nHow long does it take to recover them?\n\n26\n00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.660\nWe've had all those conversations.\n\n27\n00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.930\nWhat is confidentiality?\n\n28\n00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.960\nWhy do we need integrity?\n\n29\n00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.660\nWhy is availability important?\n\n30\n00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.120\nAll that stuff is good, but\nit all pertains to data.\n\n31\n00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.260\nNow, data's important.\n\n32\n00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.360\nInformation's important.\n\n33\n00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.370\nBut information's not the whole story\nwhen it comes to information security.\n\n34\n00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.510\nAnd we probably should think\nabout relabeling that.\n\n35\n00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.300\nWe are focusing on information.\n\n36\n00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.340\nBut more broadly, when we think about\nsecurity, infrastructure security,\n\n37\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.370\npersonnel security as Mike was alluding\nto in his introductory comments,\n\n38\n00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.890\nwe're thinking about the security of\nthings that support the use of, and\n\n39\n00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.500\nindeed, consume data but are lateral and\nin some cases ancillary to it.\n\n40\n00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.390\nAnd so,\nwhen we think about personnel security,\n\n41\n00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.110\nwhat we're thinking about\nis how do we hire people?\n\n42\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.610\nAnd what do we do to make sure we\nknow we're not hiring strangers\n\n43\n00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.710\nthat actually are going\nto look to do us harm?\n\n44\n00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.210\nHow do we know the people\nthat come to work for\n\n45\n00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.520\nus are indeed gonna act honorably,\ngonna have integrity,\n\n46\n00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.410\nare gonna do the things that the business\nsays are important to be able to focus on?\n\n47\n00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.460\nWe have to screen them, right?\n\n48\n00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.380\nIn some way,\nwe have to know who we're dealing with.\n\n49\n00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.110\nSo, we may look at hiring practices.\n\n50\n00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.120\nWe may be thinking about doing\nbackground checks, for instance.\n\n51\n00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.074\nRight?\nAnd most of us,\n\n52\n00:02:09.074 --> 00:02:11.762\nI know in my professional life,\neven though you look at me and\n\n53\n00:02:11.762 --> 00:02:14.770\nsay, who the hell would hire\nsomebody looking him, right?\n\n54\n00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.230\nBut the reality is, look at me and\nyou say, okay, well,\n\n55\n00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.840\nmaybe a bit of a scary individual, right?\n\n56\n00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.900\nLooks a little crazy,\ngot the long hair and got all the jewelry.\n\n57\n00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.222\nI was in the music business\nat one point early on.\n\n58\n00:02:26.222 --> 00:02:28.730\nYou would never know that by\nlooking at me, but I was.\n\n59\n00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.494\n>> [LAUGH] Never.\n\n60\n00:02:29.494 --> 00:02:32.267\n>> Well, when you think about that,\nyou think about, okay, well,\n\n61\n00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:33.963\nI wanna know who this person is, right?\n\n62\n00:02:33.963 --> 00:02:35.381\nSo, you wanna background screen.\n\n63\n00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:39.007\nYou wanna be able to ask questions during\nan interview that indicate where somebody\n\n64\n00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:41.230\nhas been, what have they done,\nwhat do they know,\n\n65\n00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.180\nwhat kind of skills do\nthey bring to a table?\n\n66\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.565\nSo, we ask for a resume typically, right?\n\n67\n00:02:45.565 --> 00:02:47.060\nAnd we want to see information.\n\n68\n00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.170\nWe want to see references.\n\n69\n00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.605\nThe standard stuff we think about are the\nthings that we focus on in this area.\n\n70\n00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:52.880\nRight?\nA lot of it, and\n\n71\n00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.580\nI often talk to my customers and\nmy students about this in classes and\n\n72\n00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.030\nwhen I have meetings, a lot of what\nwe do in information security,\n\n73\n00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.930\ngenerically, is really not surprising.\n\n74\n00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.425\nI mean,\nyou break it down it's common sense.\n\n75\n00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:04.300\nRight?\nDon't hire\n\n76\n00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.110\npeople that are strangers unless we\nknow where they're coming from and\n\n77\n00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.586\nwhat they're about to do because mommy\nalways said don't talk to strangers.\n\n78\n00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:13.025\nRight?\nYou talk to strangers, bad things happen.\n\n79\n00:03:13.025 --> 00:03:15.030\nRight?\nStranger danger, you've heard about that?\n\n80\n00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.680\nDon't take candy from strange people?\n\n81\n00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.557\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n82\n00:03:17.557 --> 00:03:18.740\nIt's very important.\n\n83\n00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.820\nSo, if a stranger is gonna present\nthemselves and wanna come to work for\n\n84\n00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.240\nme, I wanna interview them.\n\n85\n00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.070\nI wanna know more about them.\n\n86\n00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.500\nI wanna know where they're coming from.\n\n87\n00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.350\nI wanna know who they know.\n\n88\n00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.310\nI wanna know what they've done\nprofessionally cuz I wanna make sure\n\n89\n00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.510\nthey're gonna be a good fit for\nour organization.\n\n90\n00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.260\nNow, this brings up an interesting issue\nwhich is, as an organization, do we\n\n91\n00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.020\nactually have a way of measuring whether\nor not that person's gonna be a good fit?\n\n92\n00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.490\nSo, for instance,\ndo we have a culture of security?\n\n93\n00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.770\nDo we have awareness of security in the\norganization that we can look to and say,\n\n94\n00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:56.410\nwell, based on our culture of security, we\nhave things that we measure everybody by.\n\n95\n00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.670\nAnd we say our values, our missions,\nmission statements, our objectives,\n\n96\n00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.374\nour purposes, these are the things that\nare important to the organization.\n\n97\n00:04:03.374 --> 00:04:04.150\nThey're common.\n\n98\n00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.670\nThey're shared by everybody.\n\n99\n00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.750\nAnd Mr or Mrs candidate,\nwe want you to be aware of them.\n\n100\n00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.980\nAnd if you're gonna come work for\nus, you have to share them and\n\n101\n00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.140\nyou have to be a part of that.\n\n102\n00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.530\nAnd if you're willing to, we can talk\nabout whether or not it's a good fit.\n\n103\n00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.620\nIf you're not,\nprobably not gonna be a good fit for us.\n\n104\n00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.520\nMaybe we should talk about what you\ncould do outside the organization or\n\n105\n00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.760\nin a different area, because you're\nnot gonna be a good fit for us here.\n\n106\n00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.940\nSo, it's really incumbent on\nus as security professionals\n\n107\n00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.370\nto be able to think about,\nnot just what security equals, but\n\n108\n00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.980\nhow do we communicate that broadly and\nwidely in the organization and\n\n109\n00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.230\ncreate a security awareness solution,\nbut also a culture of security.\n\n110\n00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.480\nAs I look around the ITProTV landscape,\nright?\n\n111\n00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.170\nAnd I think about the students that\nare gonna be obviously listening to us.\n\n112\n00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.530\nBut more broadly are just members, and\nobviously are communicating with us about\n\n113\n00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.330\nthe things they wanna see, content they're\ninterested in, things of that nature.\n\n114\n00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.650\nI think about the care we take in order\nto reach out to our customers and\n\n115\n00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.310\nmake sure we understand\nwhat their needs are.\n\n116\n00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.450\nBut I also think about the mission policy,\nthe purpose, the values,\n\n117\n00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.660\nthe objectives of the organization that\nwe've put forward to service all of you\n\n118\n00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.880\nthat are listening to the content and\ntaking part in our conversations.\n\n119\n00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.980\nAnd the care and the purpose and\nthe mission that Mike and\n\n120\n00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.450\nI have as we present this content.\n\n121\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.920\nAnd more broadly, as any of our\npresenters, present content for\n\n122\n00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.000\nyou and\nany of the classes you may be engaged in.\n\n123\n00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.790\nWe have a purpose.\n\n124\n00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.870\nWe have a shared purpose.\n\n125\n00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:21.760\nYou wanna learn.\n\n126\n00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.250\nWe wanna, obviously,\nhelp you to do that and educate you.\n\n127\n00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.310\nWe have really important and\ninvaluable stuff we wanna communicate.\n\n128\n00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.100\nA lot of it is very relevant\nto the obvious topics and\n\n129\n00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.300\nthings you wanna be involved with.\n\n130\n00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.260\nAnd you, as students, wanna come in and\ngain the experience and the value of that.\n\n131\n00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.460\nSo, we have a shared purposed.\n\n132\n00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.470\nWe have context.\n\n133\n00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.070\nAnd we have the ability to be\nable to communicate broadly, but\n\n134\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.770\nalso with specificity about\nthe things that are important to us.\n\n135\n00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.950\nYou gives us feedback, and\nwe obviously adjust and\n\n136\n00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.060\npresent things in a matter\nthat makes sense to you.\n\n137\n00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.773\nThis is all about the way in\nwhich we create common ground.\n\n138\n00:05:50.773 --> 00:05:53.150\nAnd common ground's very important\nwhen we talk about about,\n\n139\n00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.890\nnot just information security,\nbut more broadly,\n\n140\n00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.170\nthis idea of how do we communicate\ninformation securely, effectively\n\n141\n00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.310\nto those people that we are charged with\nand responsible with for taking care of.\n\n142\n00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.910\nIn an organization as the CISSP,\n\n143\n00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.580\nyou're going to be a mid level\nto senior level manager.\n\n144\n00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.560\nYou are gonna have purview, perspective\nand, obviously, responsibility ultimately\n\n145\n00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.220\nfor the security policy of one or\nmore areas of the organization.\n\n146\n00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.810\nMaybe the whole organization.\n\n147\n00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.770\nYou have to think about what that\nmeans to your organization, and\n\n148\n00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.040\nhow the people in that organization\nare gonna be told what the relevant things\n\n149\n00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.440\nthey have to be involved with are.\n\n150\n00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.440\nAre you gonna write them down?\n\n151\n00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.510\nYou gonna put them on the wall?\n\n152\n00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.970\nAre you gonna create an interactive\nsecurity awareness training campaign?\n\n153\n00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.440\nThese are things you could do, and\nthings that you may already do.\n\n154\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.140\nHow many of you in your organizations\nhave security awareness training?\n\n155\n00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.580\nHopefully, a lot of us would raise\nour hands and say, yes, we do.\n\n156\n00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.580\nBut is it a one dimensional video\nthat you may watch once a year?\n\n157\n00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.350\nWe've all gone through that\ncheck off the box exercise for\n\n158\n00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.665\nHR at the end of the year.\n\n159\n00:06:52.665 --> 00:06:54.880\nRight?\nIt's that time again.\n\n160\n00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.057\nRight?\nAnd you have to go and\n\n161\n00:06:56.057 --> 00:06:58.000\ndo the security awareness training.\n\n162\n00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.150\nThat's okay.\n\n163\n00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.040\nBut once a year for 30 minutes and\nthen a couple of questions,\n\n164\n00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.930\nand everybody's going to go forward and\nsay, okay, success.\n\n165\n00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:05.710\nRight?\n\n166\n00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.200\nThat's probably not a really\ngood way to deal with security.\n\n167\n00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.330\nIt is better than nothing,\ndon't get me wrong.\n\n168\n00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.930\nBut it's not probably the best way.\n\n169\n00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:16.200\nA much better way would be a monthly\ncampaign that involves interactive\n\n170\n00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.240\nsolutions, themed presentations.\n\n171\n00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.700\nFor instance, I'll share one example with\nyou from customers of mine that are doing\n\n172\n00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.490\nsomething similar.\n\n173\n00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.890\nI did a security awareness two day\nworkshop a couple of times this year.\n\n174\n00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.670\nOne of the times I presented it was\nat ISC squared security congress.\n\n175\n00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.840\nAnd there's an annual security congress\nISC squared puts on every year.\n\n176\n00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.970\nThis year's was in California, in Anaheim.\n\n177\n00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.050\nAs in Disney.\n\n178\n00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.800\nYay, right?\n\n179\n00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.710\nDisney.\nSo, right down the road from Disney.\n\n180\n00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.880\nSo, we spent a week out there.\n\n181\n00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.960\nIt's cohabitated with\nthe ASIS Conference every year,\n\n182\n00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.296\nwhich is the world's largest\nphysical security conference.\n\n183\n00:07:51.296 --> 00:07:55.135\nAnd so, we put on our security congress\nthere, IC Squared does, and I presented.\n\n184\n00:07:55.135 --> 00:07:58.478\nI did a two day workshop with some of the\nother people that I work with at IC Square\n\n185\n00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.197\nwhen I present.\n\n186\n00:07:59.197 --> 00:08:01.666\nAnd we did a two day solution\non security awareness.\n\n187\n00:08:01.666 --> 00:08:05.318\nOne of the things we heard from some of\nour people that were participating is that\n\n188\n00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:07.130\nthey do a variety of different things.\n\n189\n00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.030\nBut one of them did\nsomething really innovative.\n\n190\n00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.300\nThey do a phishing campaign, and\n\n191\n00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:15.090\nnot just a, hey, let's remind people that\nemails that are not solicited may be bad.\n\n192\n00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:19.380\nBut they actually go out and purposely\nphish the internal the organization.\n\n193\n00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.070\nSo they go out and\n\n194\n00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.220\nthey send crafted phishing emails to\ndifferent levels of the organization,\n\n195\n00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.000\nseeing who they're gonna catch after\nthey do the awareness training.\n\n196\n00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.200\nSo, it will be the equivalent of me saying\nto Mike, hey Mike, it's a bad idea for\n\n197\n00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.700\nyou to do these things.\n\n198\n00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.860\nPlease remember that.\n\n199\n00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.860\nAnd then I come along and\nset Mike up, right?\n\n200\n00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.690\nAnd try to trick him and to getting\nhim to do that, to reinforce that.\n\n201\n00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.760\nSo they do this but\nhere's the really cool part.\n\n202\n00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.080\nThey don't just do that, what they do is\nthey turn it into a campaign and a game.\n\n203\n00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.850\nThey give out trophies to everybody.\n\n204\n00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.990\nSo if you catch the email and identify it\nfor what it is and you submit it back to\n\n205\n00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.610\nthe IT security group,\nthey give you a trophy and depending on\n\n206\n00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:57.020\nwho you are in the organization, and\nwhat kind of email they sent you.\n\n207\n00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.900\nThey have different trophies with little\nguppies like goldfish, little marlins,\n\n208\n00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.360\nbig, huge like whales, get big trophies.\n\n209\n00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.280\nSo it's this whole thing they turned it\ninto and everybody now competes to try to\n\n210\n00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.400\nget trophies cuz, for them,\nit's a badge of honor.\n\n211\n00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.690\nIf you have a trophy, put it on your desk,\nand everybody walks by and\n\n212\n00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:12.750\nsays oh wow, that's cool.\n\n213\n00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.390\nYou did that right?\n\n214\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.460\nYou figured it out.\n\n215\n00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.500\nAnd so they turned it into a thing\nthat everybody wants to buy into.\n\n216\n00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.880\nAnd as a result of doing that,\n\n217\n00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.450\nit's actually become something\neverybody participates in.\n\n218\n00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.480\nAnd the incidences of people actually\ngetting caught with phishing emails,\n\n219\n00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.500\nboth the fake ones internally,\nand the external ones,\n\n220\n00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.600\nmore importantly, have done way down.\n\n221\n00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.290\nAnd so it's a great way to think\nabout getting people in security.\n\n222\n00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.540\nInnovative and new.\n\n223\n00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.380\n>> Absolutely, it's always\na challenge to get the employees,\n\n224\n00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.210\nthe people not part of security to take\nit seriously, to be interested in it.\n\n225\n00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:43.230\nYou do something like that and\n\n226\n00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.040\nthey're going to be paying attention\nat these meetings because they want\n\n227\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.690\nto get that trophy when it's all over.\n\n228\n00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.770\nSo they're going to listen\nto what you have to say.\n\n229\n00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.950\nAnd, it's really gonna make it stick,\nwhereas,\n\n230\n00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.160\nsometimes with those meetings you don't\nknow if you sit there for 30 minutes and\n\n231\n00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.660\nyou've forgotten everything the person's\nsaid as soon as you walk out the door.\n\n232\n00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.630\nSo, that's a fantastic approach.\n\n233\n00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.026\n>> What did you just say?\n\n234\n00:10:01.026 --> 00:10:01.843\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Pretty much.\n\n235\n00:10:01.843 --> 00:10:03.130\n>> [LAUGH] Just kidding.\n\n236\n00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:04.520\nBut no,\nyou're making an excellent point, right?\n\n237\n00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.280\nIt's a very good point.\n\n238\n00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.820\nJust really,\nhow do we create the stickiness, right?\n\n239\n00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.920\nThe glue is what I often\ntalk about with customers.\n\n240\n00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.530\nHow do we create the stickiness of\nthe glue that helps us to bind information\n\n241\n00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.900\nsecurity right to the mind of\neverybody in the organization?\n\n242\n00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.580\nBecause the front line information workers\nright that are picking up the phone,\n\n243\n00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.630\ntalking to customers\nthat are writing emails,\n\n244\n00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:26.150\nthat are just doing the things\nthat they need to do.\n\n245\n00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:28.440\nThey are going to observe and\n\n246\n00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:32.060\ninteract with information differently\nThan a senior leader that's looking at\n\n247\n00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.750\nspreadsheets with financials and\nall sorts of strategic information.\n\n248\n00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.950\nAnd we have to make security\nrelevant to everybody.\n\n249\n00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.590\nI think it's very, very important,\nand the key to really doing this\n\n250\n00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.990\nis to figure out how to create\nrelevancy in the mind of our audience.\n\n251\n00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.220\nWe got a great comment in the chat that\ncame up just a couple of minutes ago.\n\n252\n00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.070\nWe didn't get to it but I wanna mention\nactually, it's an excellent point.\n\n253\n00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.890\nWhich is we were talking about hey, how\ndo we know who's coming to work, right?\n\n254\n00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.960\nAnd are they strangers, and do we do\nbackground checks and things like that.\n\n255\n00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.470\nAnd somebody chimed in and\nsaid well a lot of times organizations\n\n256\n00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:04.080\nwill hire from certain areas with\ncertain people or profiles in mind\n\n257\n00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.430\nbecause they know in theory that\nthey already have the background,\n\n258\n00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.120\nthey can be trusted and\nthey mentioned specifically veterans and\n\n259\n00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.320\ncalled out the fact that If\nwe looked to hire veterans.\n\n260\n00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.490\nA, they come with security\nclearances in most cases,\n\n261\n00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.710\ncuz if they've been serving\nin the military and\n\n262\n00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.140\nnot just in the United States but anywhere\nin the world in theory, they've already\n\n263\n00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.630\nbeen security cleared more often than\nnot to do the work that they're doing.\n\n264\n00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.200\nSo they are gonna obviously\ncome with that benefit and\n\n265\n00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.030\nthat capability already enhanced for\nus, in terms of adding them to the mix.\n\n266\n00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.910\nBut they're also gonna\nbring a lot of skills, and\n\n267\n00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.820\nmost importantly,\nalthough the comment didn't call this out,\n\n268\n00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.090\nthey bring with them an understanding of\nthe importance of information management,\n\n269\n00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.330\nsecurity controls, and\nthe need to follow procedure.\n\n270\n00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.040\nI can't stress this enough because\nwhat often happens in the organization\n\n271\n00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:49.830\nthat leads to information being\ncompromised is not that people act\n\n272\n00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.880\npurposefully to go out and\nto purposefully expose information.\n\n273\n00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:57.240\nBut they act without understanding what\nthe implications of their actions are.\n\n274\n00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.060\nAnd as a result of that they take actions\nthat ultimately lead to exposure.\n\n275\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.840\nAnd people that have been in these\nbackgrounds or rather have these\n\n276\n00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.840\nbackgrounds that have been in these\nareas like veterans is one example.\n\n277\n00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.580\nThat are trained to understand\nhow to operate in environments\n\n278\n00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:13.010\nwhere they must follow\nthe prescribed procedures.\n\n279\n00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:14.520\nRight?\nWe could call it following orders in\n\n280\n00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.190\nthe military.\n\n281\n00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:16.230\nThat's what it is.\n\n282\n00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.390\nBut we really outside in the private\nsector refer to it that way, but\n\n283\n00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.830\nwe do talk about having procedures and\nprocess and if they understand how to be\n\n284\n00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:26.860\naligned, they're really gonna help us\nto institute that culture of security.\n\n285\n00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.060\nAnd it's such a critical\nobservation to make.\n\n286\n00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.880\nAnd the comment that as made I think\nreally speaks volumes to the fact that we\n\n287\n00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.040\nhave to call that out.\n\n288\n00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.440\nAnd as security professionals,\n\n289\n00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.600\nwe have to be thinking about how do\nwe create security awareness and\n\n290\n00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.110\none way to do that is to hire people\nthat already have that built in.\n\n291\n00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.460\nThat's a great way to obviously not just\ndo that, but to help a group of people\n\n292\n00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.530\nthat are gonna be looking to do\nsomething different in their career and\n\n293\n00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.850\nin their job trajectory\nas they transition.\n\n294\n00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.620\nI think that's a double win for\neverybody, right?\n\n295\n00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.650\nSo it's a really good thing to do.\n\n296\n00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:53.670\nSo I want to call that out and\n\n297\n00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:56.310\nmake sure we're aware of that\nas part of this conversation.\n\n298\n00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.850\n>> Another thing, so\nwe go through background checks,\n\n299\n00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:02.445\nwe do the verification through\nthat employment process,\n\n300\n00:13:02.445 --> 00:13:07.080\n[COUGH] we really need to ensure that they\nunderstand and agree to our policies.\n\n301\n00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.790\nDo we get that in writing or\n>> Sure, so\n\n302\n00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.810\nthey being obviously the people\nthat we're focusing on.\n\n303\n00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:12.260\nWe never want to have a generic group.\n\n304\n00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.650\nThey being the employees, right?\n\n305\n00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.370\nThe people that we're\npotentially gonna hire.\n\n306\n00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.250\nWe want to think about employment\nagreements and policies.\n\n307\n00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.010\nIt's very important to call that out.\n\n308\n00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.350\nAnd the ideas that we'd wanna have.\n\n309\n00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.590\nAnd we talked earlier,\nif you remember about the ISC, or\n\n310\n00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.140\nISC Squared code of conduct, right?\n\n311\n00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.980\nThe code of ethics and\nthe conduct that we expect from\n\n312\n00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.650\ncertified professionals is important and\nexpect that kind of conduct.\n\n313\n00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.810\nIt may not be those exact words, but\nwe expect that kind of honorable conduct\n\n314\n00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.170\nfrom everybody that works\nin an organization, right?\n\n315\n00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:41.120\nAct honorably, do the right things.\n\n316\n00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.020\nFollow the rules and make sure you do\nthings that don't put both our information\n\n317\n00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.220\nand our people in harms way,\nthat's just generically a good base line.\n\n318\n00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.380\nSo we want to have employment agreements\nand policies that stipulate this.\n\n319\n00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:53.460\nYet we often see these coming out of HR.\n\n320\n00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.860\nKind of this name was faceless policies.\n\n321\n00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:59.400\nWe have typically a employee\nhandbook ro a team member handbook.\n\n322\n00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.140\nYou may call people different\nthings in your organization.\n\n323\n00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:06.110\nIn my organization outside my TV,\nand ProTv and my day job,\n\n324\n00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:09.790\nthe company I work for outside,\nwe refer to our employees as team members.\n\n325\n00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.390\nThat's how we call ourselves, and that's\nhow we refer to everybody that's with us.\n\n326\n00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.570\nSo, for our team and our team members.\n\n327\n00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.000\nWe have a team member conduct handbook.\n\n328\n00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.670\nRight, a code of conduct if you will.\n\n329\n00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:21.000\nAnd it's like a rule book, right?\n\n330\n00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.070\nThis is what you do,\nthese are the rules you follow.\n\n331\n00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.620\nWe have everybody sign off on\nit when they get hired, and\n\n332\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.940\nwe review it with them yearly to ensure\nthat they understand if there are changes,\n\n333\n00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:29.880\nwhat those changes may be.\n\n334\n00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.020\nIt's very, very important for\nus to be thinking about that.\n\n335\n00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:36.650\nSo codes of conduct, acceptable usage\npolicies, things like non-disclosure\n\n336\n00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:39.600\nagreements may be thrown in there\ndepending on the kind of work we do.\n\n337\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.000\nI am subject to non disclosure agreements\nwith all sorts of customers for\n\n338\n00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.050\nall sorts of work that I\ndo in various industries.\n\n339\n00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.180\nAs a result of that,\nI have nothing else to say.\n\n340\n00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.710\nI can't talk about anything else.\n\n341\n00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.240\nI'm just kidding.\n\n342\n00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.030\n>> It's been a great show.\n\n343\n00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.970\n>> It's been a great show.\n\n344\n00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:53.280\nSorry that's all we're allowed to say.\n\n345\n00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.490\nBut the reality is that when we talk about\na non disclosure agreements these often\n\n346\n00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.600\nare also going to be part of potentially\nemployment agreements and policies.\n\n347\n00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.200\nBecause you're typically\ngonna be exposed to a lot of\n\n348\n00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.600\nproprietary information\ninside the organization.\n\n349\n00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.430\nYou have to sign an agreement that\nbasically says you're not gonna take that\n\n350\n00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:11.670\nand give it to a competitor\noutside the organization or,\n\n351\n00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:15.780\nobviously, we're gonna expose the\nintellectual property, and as a result,\n\n352\n00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.190\nwe may do damage to the organization,\nright?\n\n353\n00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.410\nSo this is gonna be a problem as well.\n\n354\n00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.040\nSo, definitely employment agreements,\n\n355\n00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.040\nand employment policies\nare all very important.\n\n356\n00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.590\nBur we also think about things\nlike job rotation, right?\n\n357\n00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.260\nSo, for instance while Mike and\nI are in effect presenters and\n\n358\n00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:29.770\nhosts for you today, right?\n\n359\n00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:34.390\nWouldn't it be cool if we got to go behind\nthe scenes, and act as the audio and\n\n360\n00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:35.810\nvideo engineers for the program.\n\n361\n00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.640\nAnd we brought those talented people that\nput on this show and do all the work\n\n362\n00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:42.121\nbehind the scenes and probably cringing in\ntheir seats while I'm saying this, right?\n\n363\n00:15:42.121 --> 00:15:42.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We brought them\n\n364\n00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.860\nout in front of the camera, and said,\nhey, why don't you guy present and\n\n365\n00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.820\nMike and I will go run the control board.\n\n366\n00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.620\nBe probably equally hard for both of us.\n\n367\n00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.120\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n368\n00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.110\n>> Because Mike and\n\n369\n00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.830\nI probably don't know a lot about what\nthey do because that's not what we do.\n\n370\n00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.651\nAnd they probably are not gonna be\nreally comfortable coming out here in\n\n371\n00:15:56.651 --> 00:15:57.215\nfront here and\n\n372\n00:15:57.215 --> 00:16:00.660\nspeaking because they may not know as much\nabout the topics that we're talking about.\n\n373\n00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.659\nSo rest assured,\nwe're not going to do that.\n\n374\n00:16:02.659 --> 00:16:05.540\nBut having said that,\nthat would be an example of job rotation.\n\n375\n00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.412\nThe idea would be that, we wanna do\ncommonly what's called cross-training.\n\n376\n00:16:09.412 --> 00:16:13.119\nWanna be able to have people trained\non these capabilities and skills.\n\n377\n00:16:13.119 --> 00:16:15.711\nSo if your primary mission\nis firewall management and\n\n378\n00:16:15.711 --> 00:16:19.454\nwe have to have somebody cover for you,\nbecause you may wanna go on vacation or\n\n379\n00:16:19.454 --> 00:16:23.275\nsomething like that, we gotta have\nsomebody else trained up on the firewall.\n\n380\n00:16:23.275 --> 00:16:27.105\nThat way if something comes up and you\nget called out you gotta go do something,\n\n381\n00:16:27.105 --> 00:16:28.625\nwe can have that person cover.\n\n382\n00:16:28.625 --> 00:16:31.824\nAnd job rotation not just get for\nthat, but it's also good,\n\n383\n00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:35.966\nbecause it allows us to move you around\nin the organization as well as others and\n\n384\n00:16:35.966 --> 00:16:39.456\nallows us to see what you're doing\nby having somebody else do it.\n\n385\n00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:43.293\nSo we can see if it's being done the right\nway, we can see if there's some sort of\n\n386\n00:16:43.293 --> 00:16:47.362\nthing that's going on that may actually be\na problem that we're just not seeing it,\n\n387\n00:16:47.362 --> 00:16:50.573\nbecause maybe you're covering\nthat incident or that concern up,\n\n388\n00:16:50.573 --> 00:16:52.959\nbecause you just understand\nhow to deal with it.\n\n389\n00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:56.096\nSo it's just second nature to for you to\nsay, oh yeah, I'll just reboot the file\n\n390\n00:16:56.096 --> 00:16:59.445\nevery morning, because I come in and it's\nlocked up and that's what I've got to do.\n\n391\n00:16:59.445 --> 00:17:02.296\nAnd so I go off and I do that, but the\nreality is we gotta find the root cause of\n\n392\n00:17:02.296 --> 00:17:04.081\nthe problem why\nthe firewall's not working.\n\n393\n00:17:04.081 --> 00:17:07.508\n[LAUGH] And so by you covering up for\nthat, not on purpose, but just by you\n\n394\n00:17:07.508 --> 00:17:11.761\ncompensating, you're effectively causing\na concern for us that we're not aware of.\n\n395\n00:17:11.761 --> 00:17:14.560\nBecause now we have a problem with the\narchitecture and we have to address that.\n\n396\n00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.276\nSo job rotation helps us to look at a lot\nof different aspects of what's going on in\n\n397\n00:17:18.276 --> 00:17:21.791\nthe organization and focus in at those\nareas that are really very critical.\n\n398\n00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:23.882\nSo obviously, very important as well.\n\n399\n00:17:23.882 --> 00:17:28.462\n>> And then we don't always use\npeople from within our organization.\n\n400\n00:17:28.462 --> 00:17:32.131\nSometimes, we bring in specialized\nskill sets from the outside.\n\n401\n00:17:32.131 --> 00:17:32.966\n>> Sure.\n\n402\n00:17:32.966 --> 00:17:37.652\nFor instance, we may either today,\nwe'll be call outsource.\n\n403\n00:17:37.652 --> 00:17:40.407\nSo generically, we'll bring in\nour higher external talent and\n\n404\n00:17:40.407 --> 00:17:42.099\nask them to come in and fill gaps for us.\n\n405\n00:17:42.099 --> 00:17:45.223\nIt's still a very common thought\nprocess and the reality is we're\n\n406\n00:17:45.223 --> 00:17:48.584\nnot gonna necessarily have expertise\non everything that we have to do.\n\n407\n00:17:48.584 --> 00:17:51.784\nSome of us may know a lot about cloud\ntechnologies, for instance, but\n\n408\n00:17:51.784 --> 00:17:52.551\nothers may not.\n\n409\n00:17:52.551 --> 00:17:55.344\nAnd if our business is moving into\nthe cloud, we may need people that\n\n410\n00:17:55.344 --> 00:17:58.243\nare knowledgeable about the cloud\nto help us to make that transition.\n\n411\n00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:01.157\nWe may go out and hire them or\nwe may borrow them in effect, just pay for\n\n412\n00:18:01.157 --> 00:18:03.380\ntheir services for\na period of time as consultants.\n\n413\n00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.475\nSo we definitely could see that happening.\n\n414\n00:18:05.475 --> 00:18:09.196\nBut when we think about that, we then\nwanna incorporate along with that thought\n\n415\n00:18:09.196 --> 00:18:11.706\nprocess is something known\nas separation of duties.\n\n416\n00:18:11.706 --> 00:18:15.847\nAre we then gonna be able to clearly\ndefine what roles this person is expected\n\n417\n00:18:15.847 --> 00:18:16.567\nto fulfill?\n\n418\n00:18:16.567 --> 00:18:18.285\nWhat responsibilities they have?\n\n419\n00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:21.530\nAnd as a result of that,\nhow are we then, gonna deal with that?\n\n420\n00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.340\nSo for instance, just using Mike and\nI as an example.\n\n421\n00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:29.161\nYou see that I'm doing more talking in\nthis particular episode than Mike is and\n\n422\n00:18:29.161 --> 00:18:31.949\nthe reality is we agree\nkind of ahead of time.\n\n423\n00:18:31.949 --> 00:18:33.765\nHey, I'm gonna present\ncertain information.\n\n424\n00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:36.397\nMike's gonna throw some commentary\nin there every and so often and\n\n425\n00:18:36.397 --> 00:18:39.511\nguide us to certain points, we have to\nmake sure we cover and we both have a job.\n\n426\n00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:42.093\nIt's very important for us both to\ndo those things that we're doing.\n\n427\n00:18:42.093 --> 00:18:45.358\nThat way, we get to the end point, the end\nof the segment that we wanna make sure\n\n428\n00:18:45.358 --> 00:18:48.548\nwe've communicated to you effectively\nwith and we hit all the highlights.\n\n429\n00:18:48.548 --> 00:18:49.838\nAnd if we forget anything,\nthen it's Mike's fault and\n\n430\n00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:50.945\nwe're gonna make sure\nthat we'll blame Mike.\n\n431\n00:18:50.945 --> 00:18:53.651\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we both have responsibilities,\n\n432\n00:18:53.651 --> 00:18:56.363\nseparation of duties helps\nus to understand that.\n\n433\n00:18:56.363 --> 00:19:00.417\nAnd the IT security world,\nwe may look at that and say, for instance,\n\n434\n00:19:00.417 --> 00:19:04.886\nif somebody is responsible for backing\nup data, do we want that same person to\n\n435\n00:19:04.886 --> 00:19:08.776\nhave responsibilities and\nindeed capabilities to restore data?\n\n436\n00:19:08.776 --> 00:19:11.800\nBecause if they can both back up and\nrestore in theory,\n\n437\n00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.258\nthey can get up to no good.\n\n438\n00:19:13.258 --> 00:19:14.814\nThey could somehow modify data.\n\n439\n00:19:14.814 --> 00:19:17.843\nRemember, we're thinking about\nconfidentiality and integrity.\n\n440\n00:19:17.843 --> 00:19:20.088\nThey may modify the integrity of the data.\n\n441\n00:19:20.088 --> 00:19:22.634\nThey could then cover that\nup by restoring the data and\n\n442\n00:19:22.634 --> 00:19:24.399\nwe would never know the difference.\n\n443\n00:19:24.399 --> 00:19:26.561\nIn theory, anyway,\nit would be very hard for us to know.\n\n444\n00:19:26.561 --> 00:19:30.069\nAnd as a result of that,\nthey could actually create a compromise.\n\n445\n00:19:30.069 --> 00:19:33.693\nAnd potentially, get up with some\nsort of no good activity and\n\n446\n00:19:33.693 --> 00:19:37.330\nwe may actually never understand or\nindeed comprehend that.\n\n447\n00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:40.082\nSo we wanna separate duties, specifically.\n\n448\n00:19:40.082 --> 00:19:44.350\nCall out and say, backup and\nrestore, let's make those separate.\n\n449\n00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.546\nKinda like peanut butter and jelly.\n\n450\n00:19:45.546 --> 00:19:48.669\nWell, they go good together,\nit's better if we keep them apart.\n\n451\n00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:51.686\nAnd that way,\nwe can clearly see what is peanut butter?\n\n452\n00:19:51.686 --> 00:19:53.067\nWhat is jelly?\n\n453\n00:19:53.067 --> 00:19:55.332\nOr what is Nutella,\nif you wanna put them in the middle.\n\n454\n00:19:55.332 --> 00:19:56.191\n>> Makes me hungry.\n\n455\n00:19:56.191 --> 00:19:57.739\n[LAUGH]\n>> My girls are all up in\n\n456\n00:19:57.739 --> 00:19:59.166\nnutella these days.\n\n457\n00:19:59.166 --> 00:20:01.266\nThey both love it, so\nthat's the whole idea with that, but\n\n458\n00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:02.695\nyou get the separation of duties thing.\n\n459\n00:20:02.695 --> 00:20:03.913\nIt's really important.\n\n460\n00:20:03.913 --> 00:20:05.596\nWhat about need to know?\n\n461\n00:20:05.596 --> 00:20:09.193\nDo I need to know everything\nthat I'm responsible for,\n\n462\n00:20:09.193 --> 00:20:13.337\nthat I have purview of in my\norganization with regards to my job?\n\n463\n00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:16.590\nAbsolutely, but do I need to know\neverything Mike's responsible for?\n\n464\n00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.762\nI mean, I may or may not,\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n465\n00:20:18.762 --> 00:20:21.633\nMike's probably under separation\nof duties, gonna know and\n\n466\n00:20:21.633 --> 00:20:24.348\ndo certain things that I don't\nhave responsibility for.\n\n467\n00:20:24.348 --> 00:20:27.484\nI should not have knowledge of them in\ntheory unless they belong to me and\n\n468\n00:20:27.484 --> 00:20:29.639\nI'm responsible for\nmaking sure they get done.\n\n469\n00:20:29.639 --> 00:20:34.135\nAs a CISSP,\nI've to make sure that I am managing.\n\n470\n00:20:34.135 --> 00:20:34.984\nBut remember,\n\n471\n00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:39.426\nmanaging is not the same thing as having\ndirect intimate knowledge of doing and so\n\n472\n00:20:39.426 --> 00:20:43.301\nI may have a team under me that is\nresponsible for actually executing.\n\n473\n00:20:43.301 --> 00:20:46.830\nI have to manage them, but\nI may not manage what they do tactically\n\n474\n00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:51.340\nmoment-to-moment, minute-to-minute,\nday-to-day, hour-to-hour.\n\n475\n00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.367\nBut rather I may say,\n\n476\n00:20:52.367 --> 00:20:55.518\nthese are our objectives,\nthis is what you need to go execute on.\n\n477\n00:20:55.518 --> 00:20:57.735\nI need to be told when you're\ndone that it was done.\n\n478\n00:20:57.735 --> 00:21:01.076\nI don't necessarily need to know\nexactly what you did to do it, but\n\n479\n00:21:01.076 --> 00:21:04.788\nI need you to be prepared to tell me if\nI ask and so need to know is important.\n\n480\n00:21:04.788 --> 00:21:08.040\nWe think about the idea of lease privilege\nwhen we think about need to know.\n\n481\n00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.914\nIf I am an over arching\nadministrator in the organization.\n\n482\n00:21:11.914 --> 00:21:14.955\nIn other words,\nI have direct IT control of everything.\n\n483\n00:21:14.955 --> 00:21:18.315\nMy need to know is that I should\nunderstand everything and\n\n484\n00:21:18.315 --> 00:21:22.175\nleast privilege for\nme is probably full administrative rights.\n\n485\n00:21:22.175 --> 00:21:24.254\nFull control,\nwhatever we think of that as.\n\n486\n00:21:24.254 --> 00:21:26.899\nBut if I am only responsible for\nfirewalls,\n\n487\n00:21:26.899 --> 00:21:31.053\nmy need to know is specific to\nfirewalls and things relating to them.\n\n488\n00:21:31.053 --> 00:21:34.515\nThe least privileged permission I would\nbe given would be related to firewalls.\n\n489\n00:21:34.515 --> 00:21:36.011\nI would not be able to see or do or\n\n490\n00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:38.960\ninteract with anything that\ndoesn't relate to firewalls.\n\n491\n00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:40.952\nAnd you may say well,\nAdam that's good, but\n\n492\n00:21:40.952 --> 00:21:43.218\nreality is a lot of stuff\nflows through firewalls.\n\n493\n00:21:43.218 --> 00:21:47.333\nDoes that mean in effect you're being\nproxy, given access to all that data.\n\n494\n00:21:47.333 --> 00:21:50.063\nIt means I can see the process\nof the firewall working, but\n\n495\n00:21:50.063 --> 00:21:53.632\nI'm not directly responsible for\nthe configuration of the mail system even\n\n496\n00:21:53.632 --> 00:21:56.664\nthough email flows through it,\nthat belongs to somebody else.\n\n497\n00:21:56.664 --> 00:22:00.438\nAnd so I have to really focus on what I'm\ncharged with, what I'm responsible for.\n\n498\n00:22:00.438 --> 00:22:02.424\nIf everybody on the team does their part,\n\n499\n00:22:02.424 --> 00:22:06.058\nleast privilege allows us to really\nspecify what you're going to focus on,\n\n500\n00:22:06.058 --> 00:22:09.038\nexcluding you from other things\nthat you don't need to know.\n\n501\n00:22:09.038 --> 00:22:12.458\nAnd by using that thought process\nalong with separation of duties,\n\n502\n00:22:12.458 --> 00:22:16.239\nwe build a very secure and very robust\narchitecture that allows people to do\n\n503\n00:22:16.239 --> 00:22:18.939\ntheir jobs, but\ndoesn't expose the information and\n\n504\n00:22:18.939 --> 00:22:23.039\nthe organization to them unnecessarily to\nthem unless they have a need to see it.\n\n505\n00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:24.653\nThis is very as thought process.\n\n506\n00:22:24.653 --> 00:22:25.598\n>> Absolutely.\n\n507\n00:22:25.598 --> 00:22:28.725\nWe go through our reference\nchecks during the hiring process,\n\n508\n00:22:28.725 --> 00:22:30.204\nwe do our background checks.\n\n509\n00:22:30.204 --> 00:22:33.766\nWe do our principal of least\nprivileged and our need to know and\n\n510\n00:22:33.766 --> 00:22:36.313\nour job rotation or our separation duties.\n\n511\n00:22:36.313 --> 00:22:40.018\nAt some point, we're probably going\nto have to let somebody go and\n\n512\n00:22:40.018 --> 00:22:42.879\nI know that's a big fear\nin information security.\n\n513\n00:22:42.879 --> 00:22:46.079\n>> It is and so what we wanna think\nabout is the fact that if somebody,\n\n514\n00:22:46.079 --> 00:22:49.472\nif it comes that time, whenever that\ntime is and we have to part ways.\n\n515\n00:22:49.472 --> 00:22:53.226\nHopefully, and we all hope at the end of\nthe day that those kind of things go well.\n\n516\n00:22:53.226 --> 00:22:55.014\nThere's not a lot of stress,\nlot of anxiety.\n\n517\n00:22:55.014 --> 00:22:57.720\nBut reality is look, you're gonna let\nsomebody go it's stressful for them,\n\n518\n00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.120\nit's stressful for the organization.\n\n519\n00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.759\nAnd even if they leave on good terms,\nyou still never know what could happen.\n\n520\n00:23:02.759 --> 00:23:06.856\nAnd so focusing on safety and security\nboth for the individuals in the business\n\n521\n00:23:06.856 --> 00:23:10.468\nthat remain, for the safety and\nsecurity for the data that remains.\n\n522\n00:23:10.468 --> 00:23:13.720\nAnd for that persons own safety and\nsecurity, so that they're not gonna be\n\n523\n00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.988\nfalsely accused of doing something\nthat they didn't do after they leave.\n\n524\n00:23:16.988 --> 00:23:19.561\nWe have to really think\nabout how do we respond.\n\n525\n00:23:19.561 --> 00:23:21.752\nNot only do we have to respond\nif something goes wrong, but\n\n526\n00:23:21.752 --> 00:23:23.285\nwhat does that conversation look like?\n\n527\n00:23:23.285 --> 00:23:25.790\nWe never want to have somebody\nin an office with a closed door,\n\n528\n00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:29.326\ntelling them they're fired, they're gonna\nbe like, oh, without a witness there.\n\n529\n00:23:29.326 --> 00:23:32.446\nSo we always talk about when you're\na manager, and you go through training on\n\n530\n00:23:32.446 --> 00:23:35.042\nhow do you talk with people,\nhow do you do this or that with them.\n\n531\n00:23:35.042 --> 00:23:37.629\nThere's always gotta be\na second person involved, so\n\n532\n00:23:37.629 --> 00:23:41.341\nthat there's an unbiased opinion as to\nwhat happened in that conversation and\n\n533\n00:23:41.341 --> 00:23:42.765\nso we wanna think about that.\n\n534\n00:23:42.765 --> 00:23:45.648\nWe may have somebody come in\nfrom the security function,\n\n535\n00:23:45.648 --> 00:23:49.975\nbecause there may be paperwork they have\nto sign, systems that have to, basically,\n\n536\n00:23:49.975 --> 00:23:52.763\ngive access back to with card keys,\nthings like that.\n\n537\n00:23:52.763 --> 00:23:55.605\nWe should have a check list that\nallows us to go through what's called\n\n538\n00:23:55.605 --> 00:23:58.459\nthe off-boarding process,\nwhich is the inverse of on-boarding.\n\n539\n00:23:58.459 --> 00:24:00.025\nOn-boarding's when we hire somebody,\n\n540\n00:24:00.025 --> 00:24:03.380\noff-boarding is when we're gonna let\nthem go at least that's the formal term.\n\n541\n00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:03.979\nThat we use.\n\n542\n00:24:03.979 --> 00:24:06.740\nWe're gonna off-board them,\nwe should have a checklist.\n\n543\n00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.760\nRight?\nWhat systems do they have access to?\n\n544\n00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:11.780\nWhat resources of the organization\ndo they still possess?\n\n545\n00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.575\nThat could be a mobile device, it could\nbe a phone, it could be a computer.\n\n546\n00:24:14.575 --> 00:24:18.167\nDo they have any authentication\nmechanisms, like a smart card or\n\n547\n00:24:18.167 --> 00:24:20.010\na key fibe or a token or whatever?\n\n548\n00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:21.790\nWe have to get those back from them.\n\n549\n00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.710\nDo they have any information\nin their possession physically\n\n550\n00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:26.010\nthat we need to take possession of?\n\n551\n00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:28.760\nThey may have documents,\nbooks, who knows what.\n\n552\n00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.580\nToday most things are electronic but that\ndoesn't mean people don't print stuff out.\n\n553\n00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.850\nSo we wanna go through all that, right?\n\n554\n00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.840\nAnd make sure we understand how\nto make sure they're leaving\n\n555\n00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.670\nwith the proper information\ngiven back to the organization.\n\n556\n00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:41.910\nWe also just don't wanna think\nabout how we let somebody go, but\n\n557\n00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:43.535\nwhat about when somebody goes on vacation?\n\n558\n00:24:43.535 --> 00:24:44.450\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n559\n00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.040\nIt's not a matter of them saying hey,\nthey're leaving it.\n\n560\n00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.030\nI'm gonna be out for two weeks, or\nI maybe going on maternity leave.\n\n561\n00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.770\nSo, maybe I'll be out for\na month or six weeks or whatever.\n\n562\n00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:56.270\nAnd as a result of that while I\nmay check in from time to time.\n\n563\n00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.000\nI'm not gonna be in the office every day.\n\n564\n00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.240\nI'm probably not gonna be using\nthe systems the way I normally would.\n\n565\n00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.020\nAnd IT has to be alerted to that.\n\n566\n00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.560\nWe have to have a process for that,\nbecause we may not delete the account but\n\n567\n00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.540\nwe may actually disable the account for\na period of time so\n\n568\n00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.620\nthat it's not gonna be used.\n\n569\n00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:15.119\nSo that way we know nobody's gonna\neffectively masquerade as that person, or\n\n570\n00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:17.370\npretend to be them when they're not.\n\n571\n00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:20.540\nIf Mary goes out on maternity leave,\nfor let's say, six weeks.\n\n572\n00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.510\nMary may not be checking email,\nmay not actually be in the system.\n\n573\n00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:24.270\nMay not be doing anything.\n\n574\n00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:26.710\nShe's caring for her newborn child.\n\n575\n00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:28.350\nWe expect her to focus on that.\n\n576\n00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:31.655\nSo we're going to disable Mary's account\nso that nobody can use it to log in and\n\n577\n00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:34.007\npretend to be Mary but\nwe may actually then have a need for\n\n578\n00:25:34.007 --> 00:25:36.310\nsomebody to look at Mary's email for\nsix weeks.\n\n579\n00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.820\nSo we would make exceptions to that.\n\n580\n00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.300\nRight?\nWe would say that normally\n\n581\n00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.660\nthe account will be under normal use,\nused only by Mary.\n\n582\n00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.055\nNow instead of disabling it and\n\n583\n00:25:44.055 --> 00:25:46.920\nnot having Mary use it,\nwe're going to delegate it to somebody.\n\n584\n00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.650\nWe could then give someone the rights\nto monitor Mary's account.\n\n585\n00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:50.510\nFor a period of time.\n\n586\n00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:53.540\nAnd then when Mary gets back, we give it\nback to her and everything is normal.\n\n587\n00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:55.290\nNo issue, no concern at all.\n\n588\n00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:56.810\nSo, I want to make sure we're\nthinking about that and\n\n589\n00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.700\nwe're also focused in that area.\n\n590\n00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.180\nWe talked about terminations, just\nreminding you the terminology we use is,\n\n591\n00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.760\nas I said is offboarding,\nwhen we think about voluntary and\n\n592\n00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.720\ninvoluntary terminations, specifically.\n\n593\n00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.820\nYou know, somebody may come to us and\nsay, hey, I think it's time I move on,\n\n594\n00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.270\nI got a better opportunity.\n\n595\n00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.241\nLet's go through the process\nof winding down and\n\n596\n00:26:13.241 --> 00:26:16.010\nyou know, they're leaving on good terms,\nthey're coming and they're telling you.\n\n597\n00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:18.850\nInvoluntary use invite\nthem to go somewhere else.\n\n598\n00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:22.680\nAnd obviously those conversations may\nnot go as well, [LAUGH] right, so\n\n599\n00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:24.240\nwe just want to think about that.\n\n600\n00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.360\nWhat about third parties?\n\n601\n00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.380\nWhat about vendors?\n\n602\n00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.650\nWhat about consultants?\n\n603\n00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:31.460\nWhat about people that don't work for\nthe organization formally and fully but\n\n604\n00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:35.580\nrather are, as Mike indicated early on\nwhen he talked about maybe outsourcing or\n\n605\n00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.380\nbringing in special expertise.\n\n606\n00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:38.170\nHow do we do that?\n\n607\n00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.340\nWell we have to have contracts and\nagreements in place.\n\n608\n00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.100\nWe have to think about those people,\nthink about their skills,\n\n609\n00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:47.130\nwhere they're coming from, who they are,\nand do they represent a reputable company.\n\n610\n00:26:47.130 --> 00:26:48.550\nDo we have a relationship with them?\n\n611\n00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.300\nDo we know anything about them?\n\n612\n00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:53.230\nAll the things we've talked about are\ngonna be important, reference checks and\n\n613\n00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.350\nthings of that nature.\n\n614\n00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:59.260\nBut even then, right we really at the end\nof the day don't know who they are.\n\n615\n00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.520\nI mean if you think about we do\na background check on anybody, but\n\n616\n00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.800\nthat doesn't mean you really know who\nthat person is and what they're up to.\n\n617\n00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.718\nYou just simply know what you\nsee in the background check.\n\n618\n00:27:07.718 --> 00:27:11.698\nIf that person's very successful at hiding\nthe bad activities they've been up to up\n\n619\n00:27:11.698 --> 00:27:13.994\nuntil now,\nyou many not find out about them, and\n\n620\n00:27:13.994 --> 00:27:16.025\nyou may not really know\nwho that person is.\n\n621\n00:27:16.025 --> 00:27:20.309\nAnd so you have to do multiple things, not\njust one thing to really understand it,\n\n622\n00:27:20.309 --> 00:27:24.570\nultimately see who's coming to work for\nyou and what they're capable of.\n\n623\n00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:26.790\nIt's not just about hey,\nlet's do a background check.\n\n624\n00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:29.310\nLet's sign a contract,\nlet's do all that stuff.\n\n625\n00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.680\nYou have to have active monitoring\nin place inside the organization.\n\n626\n00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.470\nYou know, the though process we\noften use when we think about\n\n627\n00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.270\nis an old Russian proverb\nwhich is trust but verify.\n\n628\n00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.450\nSo the idea is you know, I trust you but\n\n629\n00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.890\nI want to make sure that\nmy trust is well placed.\n\n630\n00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:45.510\nRight?\nSo I'm not just going to take\n\n631\n00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.970\nyou at face value and I don't want you\nto take for granted that I trust you.\n\n632\n00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:52.510\nI you to feel that I trust you but\nI also want to prove that I can.\n\n633\n00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.970\nAnd so\nas a result I'm gonna look at what you do.\n\n634\n00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.220\nWe're gonna monitor systems\nyou have access to.\n\n635\n00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.120\nGonna look at information\nyou're accessing.\n\n636\n00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:02.920\nAnd if you're not supposed to see\nthe spreadsheet in the file that says\n\n637\n00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.820\ndon't open up under any circumstances and\nyou go look at it.\n\n638\n00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.020\nI'm gonna wanna know why.\n\n639\n00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.860\nBecause clearly you weren't\nsupposed to be there.\n\n640\n00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.100\nNow you may have a perfectly\nplausible explanation for that, but\n\n641\n00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:14.678\nwe're gonna talk about what that is and\nwhy that happened.\n\n642\n00:28:14.678 --> 00:28:18.140\nAnd depending on what you tell me,\nI may or may not trust you anymore, right.\n\n643\n00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.590\nSo trust but verify becomes a really\nimportant operational criteria\n\n644\n00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.270\nof how we frame this conversation,\nwhat we think about as well.\n\n645\n00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:28.265\nAnd we've talked a lot about\nprivacy in prior conversations,\n\n646\n00:28:28.265 --> 00:28:31.280\nit's a theme we carry forward\nmany of the things we do.\n\n647\n00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.770\nPrivacy is really at the heart of\nwhat we're talking about here.\n\n648\n00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:37.010\nIt's the idea of safeguarding\nconfidentiality as well as integrity\n\n649\n00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:41.100\nof information, that we focus on when we\nthink about anything having to do with not\n\n650\n00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.140\njust personnel security, but information\nsecurity more broadly as I said,\n\n651\n00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:47.280\nthat we can classify\nsecurity in many ways.\n\n652\n00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.480\nAnd any of those things we\nput in front of security.\n\n653\n00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.970\nHardware, software, identity and\naccess, management and\n\n654\n00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.390\nsecurity as a result of that\npersonnel security, all those things,\n\n655\n00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.890\nall are focused on the ability\nto understand how to safeguard\n\n656\n00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:04.920\nthe resources of the organization and\nensure only qualified and\n\n657\n00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.580\nauthorized individuals are accessed to\nthem under the terms that we've laid out.\n\n658\n00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.780\nThese are all very important things for\nus to think about.\n\n659\n00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.000\nAnd to be aware of, right?\n\n660\n00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.550\nSo just make sure that we're\nthinking about those things and\n\n661\n00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:16.780\nwhat they mean at the end of\nthe day is really the message.\n\n662\n00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:18.220\n>> Fantastic information there Adam.\n\n663\n00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.430\nIt's one of those things\nthat maybe sometimes,\n\n664\n00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:23.760\nI almost wanna say gets overlooked,\nbut we don't focus on it as much.\n\n665\n00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.690\nWe see data.\n\n666\n00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:28.090\nWe wanna protect data, personnel,\nbig part of it as well.\n\n667\n00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.760\nIt's going to be a big\npart of being a CISSB.\n\n668\n00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.140\nAll right,well thanks Adam for\nall that information.\n\n669\n00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.520\nThat is going to do it for this episode.\n\n670\n00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.855\nRemember, if you want to attend\none of Adam's classes

--> 00:00:17.700\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.820\nAnd today,\nwe're continuing on with our CISSP, and\n\n5\n00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.300\nspecifically we're gonna be diving\ninto the world of risk management.\n\n6\n00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.220\nThere's a lot of things to talk\nabout with risk management,\n\n7\n00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.940\nand who better to talk about\nit with than Mr. Adam Gordon?\n\n8\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.778\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:30.778 --> 00:00:31.755\n>> Just call me Mr. Risky.\n\n10\n00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:33.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm doing good, how are you guys?\n\n11\n00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.839\nHopefully everybody's well.\n\n12\n00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:36.500\nSo, let's talk about risk.\n\n13\n00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.275\nMike was saying nothing better than\nto talk about risk on a lovely day.\n\n14\n00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:43.460\nAnd I often think about risk when I\ntalk to customers and I work with them.\n\n15\n00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.006\nAnd one of the things we have to think\nabout with risk, and I think setting\n\n16\n00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:50.496\nthe tone right up front is important,\nis that while risk is critical for\n\n17\n00:00:50.496 --> 00:00:53.134\nus to understand, to identify,\nand to appreciate.\n\n18\n00:00:53.134 --> 00:00:54.811\nWe have to really have knowledge of it,\nbut\n\n19\n00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:57.450\nwe also have to keep in mind\nthat not all risks are bad.\n\n20\n00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.740\nWe'll come back to that theme as we\ngo when we talk more about this,\n\n21\n00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.440\nbut while we often frame the conversation\nabout risk from an information security\n\n22\n00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.700\nperspective, as being a negative, right?\n\n23\n00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.670\nIt's about the bad\nthings that will happen.\n\n24\n00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.180\nIt's about keeping the bad actors out.\n\n25\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.640\nIt's about making sure the good people\nget to see data and the bad people don't.\n\n26\n00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.510\nThose are all things we have to consider.\n\n27\n00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.120\nUltimately, what we have to understand\nis that not all risk is negative.\n\n28\n00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.230\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n29\n00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.440\nwe have to understand that if we don't\nclearly articulate and understand and\n\n30\n00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.980\nidentify risk, we run,\nunfortunately, into a problem.\n\n31\n00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.268\nThe problem is we may take\nthe wrong action or, in theory,\n\n32\n00:01:30.268 --> 00:01:34.109\ngo after the wrong concern because\nthe risk is not well understood.\n\n33\n00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:36.250\nAnd so we have to think about that and\nunderstand that.\n\n34\n00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.660\nTo that end, let's go ahead and\n\n35\n00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.500\njust blow that graphic up a little more if\nwe could and get rid of the, there we go.\n\n36\n00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.053\nSo, you'll hear me talking but\n\n37\n00:01:43.053 --> 00:01:44.730\nnot see my smiling face-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n38\n00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.649\n>> Which is probably better for\n\n39\n00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:46.170\nyou-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n40\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.710\n>> As opposed to seeing me and\n\n41\n00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.530\nnot seeing half the graphics.\n\n42\n00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.874\nSo when you look on\nthe screen in front of you,\n\n43\n00:01:51.874 --> 00:01:55.913\nwhat you're gonna see is this screen\ncapture from one of the NIST documents.\n\n44\n00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:58.477\nThis is gonna be from NIST 80030R1,\n\n45\n00:01:58.477 --> 00:02:02.980\nwhich is going to be the discussion\nthat we have about just the vocabulary.\n\n46\n00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.417\nWe talked about terminology, and you'll\nsee we have definitional criteria, or\n\n47\n00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:11.613\nat least boxes that help us to understand\nterminology with regards to risks.\n\n48\n00:02:11.613 --> 00:02:13.101\nWe're gonna discuss risk.\n\n49\n00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:14.726\nWe're gonna discuss threat source.\n\n50\n00:02:14.726 --> 00:02:17.280\nWe're gonna discuss threat event.\n\n51\n00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.861\nWe're gonna discuss vulnerability.\n\n52\n00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:22.269\nWe're gonna discuss those terms on\nthe screen that are gonna help us to\n\n53\n00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.082\nultimately get to the bottom on the right,\nwhere we see organizational risk,\n\n54\n00:02:26.082 --> 00:02:29.320\nand we can understand what risk is and\nwhy it's important.\n\n55\n00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.910\nSo let's go ahead and let's start by\ntalking about some of these terms.\n\n56\n00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.464\nThey're obviously very critical for us.\n\n57\n00:02:34.464 --> 00:02:37.800\nAnd we wanna make sure we\nunderstand what they are.\n\n58\n00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.470\nAnd when we start thinking about risk, we\nhave to start about what a threat is and\n\n59\n00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.980\nspecifically threat source.\n\n60\n00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.110\nAnd so when we think about threat source,\n\n61\n00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.130\nwe're think about something that is going\nto bring a threat into the organization.\n\n62\n00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.140\nThis is where threats come from.\n\n63\n00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.796\nAnd so threat sources can also\nbe thought of as threat actors.\n\n64\n00:02:56.796 --> 00:03:00.935\nThese are the bad people and\nthe bad software, the malware, for\n\n65\n00:03:00.935 --> 00:03:03.320\ninstance things like that.\n\n66\n00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.240\nAnd the bad websites,\nwhere we get that stuff from.\n\n67\n00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.550\nAnd all the things that can potentially\nlead us down the road of having a concern\n\n68\n00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.680\nor problem.\n\n69\n00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.750\nAnd threat sources are where\nthings that can potentially\n\n70\n00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.130\nwould underscore the work potentially\ndo us harm, may come from.\n\n71\n00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.370\nAnd so, again, this could be\na variety of different things.\n\n72\n00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.760\nCould be a bad actor,\nit could be a piece of bad software,\n\n73\n00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.050\nit could be a bad configuration.\n\n74\n00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.910\nSo, in other words, we may have a system\nthat has to be configured a certain way.\n\n75\n00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.990\nAnd if it is misconfigured,\neither purposely or\n\n76\n00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.930\naccidentally, we may have a threat\nsource as a result of that.\n\n77\n00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.770\nBecause the misconfiguration may\nactually lead us to have a complication\n\n78\n00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.980\nthat can expose the system or\npotentially information in that system and\n\n79\n00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.700\nbreak confidentiality or\nimpact availability.\n\n80\n00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.090\nSo these are things we wanna think about.\n\n81\n00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.010\nSo when we think about threat sources,\nwe think about where the potential\n\n82\n00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.010\nthat this particular issue or\nconcern is arising from.\n\n83\n00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.840\nWhere's it coming from?\n\n84\n00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.400\nAnd that's what the threat source is.\n\n85\n00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.565\nThreat sources initiate threat events,\nas you see the flow in the diagram.\n\n86\n00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:09.310\nThreat events are going to be things that\nwhen carried out in a certain sequence,\n\n87\n00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.130\nas we say there with sequence of actions,\nactivities, or scenarios.\n\n88\n00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.110\nWhen certain things are done\na certain way, as a result of that,\n\n89\n00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.120\nit is more likely, as we say,\n\n90\n00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.920\nexploiting with likelihood of success,\nthat something is going to occur.\n\n91\n00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.584\nThat something, as we said,\nis traditionally seen as being negative,\n\n92\n00:04:27.584 --> 00:04:28.853\nbut not always, right?\n\n93\n00:04:28.853 --> 00:04:32.439\nThreat events talk about things that\npotentially are gonna be bad outcomes.\n\n94\n00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:36.405\nBut we can talk about the fact that if we\ninterdict and we stop the threat source\n\n95\n00:04:36.405 --> 00:04:40.280\nand the threat event from occurring,\nthen we have been successful.\n\n96\n00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.400\nAnd so not all risks, not all threats\nthat are realized necessarily end badly.\n\n97\n00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.690\nWe just wanna keep that in mind and\nconsider that.\n\n98\n00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.572\nSo threat events are the sequence\nof actions, activities,\n\n99\n00:04:51.572 --> 00:04:56.365\nwhatever those things may be, that when\ndone or executed in a certain way,\n\n100\n00:04:56.365 --> 00:05:00.041\nlead us to be able to exploit,\nexploit is an action word.\n\n101\n00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:02.980\nI'm gonna take action of some\nsort to exploit something.\n\n102\n00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.150\nThat something is called\nthe vulnerability.\n\n103\n00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.640\nA vulnerability is\na going to be a weakness,\n\n104\n00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.860\ntypically that's how vulnerabilities\nare described their weaknesses.\n\n105\n00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.350\nA weakness in the system.\n\n106\n00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.510\nIt could be because of\na misconfiguration as we said.\n\n107\n00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.730\nIt could be because of some\nsort of unknown bug or\n\n108\n00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.780\nsome sort of unknown concern in\nthe software, in the code of the system.\n\n109\n00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.210\nAnd we find that by probing and\npeople doing things to the system.\n\n110\n00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.959\nWe suddenly discover that\nthere's this hole over here.\n\n111\n00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.279\nAnd if we execute this\nsequence of keystrokes,\n\n112\n00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.723\nthen all of a sudden we can\ntake advantage of that.\n\n113\n00:05:35.723 --> 00:05:38.480\nAnd so that vulnerability,\nthat weakness is discovered, and\n\n114\n00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.640\nsomebody or something is gonna\nlook to take advantage of it.\n\n115\n00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.930\nWhatever that is right?\n\n116\n00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.460\nSo that's a vulnerability.\n\n117\n00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.640\nA vulnerability is gonna be\nmeasured in terms of severity.\n\n118\n00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.080\nIs it a vulnerability\nthat is catastrophic,\n\n119\n00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.020\nsomething that if it's executed on and\nsomebody takes advantage of,\n\n120\n00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.340\nwill just immediately\ntake down our system?\n\n121\n00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.688\nIs it something that's minor?\n\n122\n00:05:57.688 --> 00:06:00.014\nIt's gonna be nuisance,\nwe don't want it to happen, but\n\n123\n00:06:00.014 --> 00:06:01.420\nif it does we can live with it.\n\n124\n00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.206\nWe can deal with it relatively easily.\n\n125\n00:06:03.206 --> 00:06:07.228\nVulnerabilities have effectively\na scale associated with them for\n\n126\n00:06:07.228 --> 00:06:10.520\nus to measure how impactful\nthey're going to be.\n\n127\n00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.780\nThis is going to be vulnerability causing,\nas we look to the right and\n\n128\n00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:17.460\nthe arrow moves over, with some\nsort of degree of adverse impact.\n\n129\n00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.570\nHow impactful is the vulnerability?\n\n130\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.510\nAgain, is it a high level vulnerability,\n\n131\n00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.702\nwhat we would call\na critical vulnerability?\n\n132\n00:06:23.702 --> 00:06:24.970\nIs it Is it a medium level?\n\n133\n00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.350\nIt is gonna be important but not severe.\n\n134\n00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.920\nIs it a low level vulnerability?\n\n135\n00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.120\nOne that we can live with,\nand if there is an exploit,\n\n136\n00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.130\nwe're not gonna necessarily have an issue,\nright?\n\n137\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.240\nOr at least not one that\nwe can't recover easily.\n\n138\n00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.656\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n139\n00:06:37.656 --> 00:06:39.687\nAdverse impact, in other words,\n\n140\n00:06:39.687 --> 00:06:43.900\nis gonna measure what that vulnerability\nmeans to us if it is realized.\n\n141\n00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.050\nSomebody's able to execute some\nkind of attack against that\n\n142\n00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.010\nweakness that we have uncovered.\n\n143\n00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.640\nAnd then based on that, adverse impact\nproduces, arrow going down on the right\n\n144\n00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.090\nhand side, towards the lower right-hand\nof the diagram, organizational risk.\n\n145\n00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.079\nOrganizational risk, or generically\njust risk, is going to be the idea, or\n\n146\n00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:07.839\nfrom our perspective, is going to be\nthe probability or the likelihood,\n\n147\n00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:08.946\nas we often say.\n\n148\n00:07:08.946 --> 00:07:11.496\nThat a given threat source,\na given threat actor,\n\n149\n00:07:11.496 --> 00:07:13.950\nwill exercise a particular vulnerability.\n\n150\n00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.020\nWill be able to through threat events,\nexploit some sort of weakness, and\n\n151\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.890\nthe resulting impact that will occur.\n\n152\n00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.450\nThat is what risk is.\n\n153\n00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.323\nSo it's the distillation down of\na threat source taking on actions or\n\n154\n00:07:26.323 --> 00:07:30.131\nactivities, or engaging in actions and\nactivities that are called\n\n155\n00:07:30.131 --> 00:07:34.380\nthreat events that are exploiting\nvulnerabilities or weaknesses.\n\n156\n00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.464\nThat lead to some sort of negative impact.\n\n157\n00:07:36.464 --> 00:07:41.019\nThat adverse impact is gonna be measured\nwith some sort of degree as being\n\n158\n00:07:41.019 --> 00:07:46.240\nultimately the accumulation of all\nthat ultimately, is what we call risk.\n\n159\n00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.313\nNow as I said, risk generically\nis framed in the negative.\n\n160\n00:07:49.313 --> 00:07:52.758\nHey, there's this risk over here,\nthat if I do these things,\n\n161\n00:07:52.758 --> 00:07:57.184\nthat that system's gonna blue screen or\nstop working, or whatever that may be.\n\n162\n00:07:57.184 --> 00:08:01.432\nBut not all risk is bad, sometimes we\ntake a chance, and we And entertain or\n\n163\n00:08:01.432 --> 00:08:03.927\nengage the idea that there may be a risk,\nbut\n\n164\n00:08:03.927 --> 00:08:07.330\nultimately the outcome\nmay actually be positive.\n\n165\n00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:11.640\nSo while we have to understand risk is\nbeing negative with regards to security.\n\n166\n00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.094\nAnd information security management of\nrisk is about dealing with the negative\n\n167\n00:08:16.094 --> 00:08:20.830\nconsequences, the adverse impacts\nof vulnerabilities being exploited.\n\n168\n00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.310\nWe have to also understand that if we\nare successful at dealing with it and\n\n169\n00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.980\nwe mitigate, we minimize the risk and\nwe try to take steps,\n\n170\n00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.050\nwhatever those may be, we call them\ncountermeasures traditionally.\n\n171\n00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:35.730\nAnd we use what are called controls to\nactually implement solutions that will\n\n172\n00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:41.020\nminimize risk If we apply countermeasures\nand use controls we may be successful\n\n173\n00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.860\nat forestalling or even navigating\naway from the risk overall.\n\n174\n00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.730\nIn so\ndoing that risk is no longer realized or\n\n175\n00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.620\nrecognized in the organization.\n\n176\n00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.320\nBecause of that we can say that the risk\nhas effectively been dealt with.\n\n177\n00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.100\nIt has been pushed off to the side and\nno longer poses an adverse impact to us.\n\n178\n00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.710\nSo we just wanna make sure we're\naware of the language of risk.\n\n179\n00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.480\nThe language of risk is very critical,\nvery important.\n\n180\n00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.270\nAll right, so just to recap, right,\nwe were just talking about the flow,\n\n181\n00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:07.780\nthe logic of how we deal with risks.\n\n182\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.950\nJust to recap the vocabulary.\n\n183\n00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:11.670\nIt's important for\nus to understand the following terms.\n\n184\n00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.000\nThreat source right?\n\n185\n00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.840\nThreat events,\nwant to understand vulnerability, wanna\n\n186\n00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.010\nunderstand likelihood, wanna understand\nimpact we just talked about all that.\n\n187\n00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.190\nI mentioned countermeasures,\n\n188\n00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.170\nthat's how we actually deal with the risk\nlikelihood that it will be a negative\n\n189\n00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.140\noutcome, we apply countermeasures\nto try to offset that.\n\n190\n00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.740\nAnd we wanna then also, although I didn't\nmention it wanna throw out a new term\n\n191\n00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.880\nWhich is something known as residual risk.\n\n192\n00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.000\nResidual risk is the risk that is\nleft over after we go through that\n\n193\n00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.850\nwhole activity cycle, and\nwhatever ultimately does occur.\n\n194\n00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:41.880\nWhat the risk is and\n\n195\n00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.100\nhow we deal with that is the risk\nthat is left over in the system.\n\n196\n00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.590\nCuz we can counteract so much risk, but\n\n197\n00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.000\nat that point,\nthere's always gonna be something left.\n\n198\n00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.580\nMaybe it's an unknown risk.\n\n199\n00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.280\nThat we're not familiar with today,\nwe would call that a zero day exploit.\n\n200\n00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.070\nOr something that's unknown at some\npoint that will become known to us.\n\n201\n00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.650\nWhen that does,\nwe then have to deal with it.\n\n202\n00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.340\nAnd we may walk it through that process.\n\n203\n00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.420\nBut until we identify it and\n\n204\n00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.780\nstart figuring it out,\nit's called residual risk.\n\n205\n00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.050\nOr referred to as residual risk.\n\n206\n00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:12.140\nSo The point is there's always some\nrisk left in the system somewhere,\n\n207\n00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.870\nsomething that may be unknown, or\nunqualified, or uncategorized, or\n\n208\n00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.280\nundetermined until a later date.\n\n209\n00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.250\nAnd whatever that is,\nthat's what we call residual risk.\n\n210\n00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.690\nSo I just wanna make sure\nwe're familiar with that.\n\n211\n00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:26.540\nHaving said that, what we then wanna do\nis zero in on, and we're gonna go in and\n\n212\n00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.600\nlook at a new graphic here.\n\n213\n00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.240\nWe wanna go in and we wanna take\na look at one specific process.\n\n214\n00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.830\nThat is laid out along the lines from\nthe same document than this document\n\n215\n00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:37.070\nthat we've been talking about.\n\n216\n00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:40.560\nThere is a four step process, you can\nsee it on the screen in front of you.\n\n217\n00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.160\nWe want to go through and\ntalk about what the steps are for\n\n218\n00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.540\nthe risk assessment process.\n\n219\n00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.880\nIn other words, how do we actually\nfigure out what a risk is?\n\n220\n00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:49.180\nWe've got all this great language.\n\n221\n00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.970\nWe have a threat source, we have\na threat event, we have likelihood,\n\n222\n00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:54.355\nwe have vulnerability.\n\n223\n00:10:54.355 --> 00:10:55.850\nRight, we have impact,\n\n224\n00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:00.550\nwe have potentially as we distill all\nthat down we have organizational risk.\n\n225\n00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.810\nBut how do we actually\nknow what the risk is?\n\n226\n00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.310\nIn other words, how do we figure out what\ncomes out the back end of that process\n\n227\n00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.990\nfalls into the risk or\norganizational risk bucket?\n\n228\n00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.210\nWhat we have to do is access risks and\n\n229\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.880\nunderstand how impactful they\nmay be to the organization.\n\n230\n00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.480\nAnd we have a methodology for that.\n\n231\n00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.444\nAnd the methodology, at least the accepted\none that most security individuals or\n\n232\n00:11:19.444 --> 00:11:23.532\nsecurity professionals will be thinking of\nand using today, comes to us from NIST.\n\n233\n00:11:23.532 --> 00:11:24.700\nIt's one of several.\n\n234\n00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.450\nIt's not the only one, I wanna be clear.\n\n235\n00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:29.310\nBut it's one that more and more people\nare looking at and starting to standardize\n\n236\n00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:32.720\non using which means it's one\nthat you should be familiar with.\n\n237\n00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.650\nAnd so step one is at the top at the 12\no'clock position if we're looking at\n\n238\n00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.950\nthe diagram in the vertical there,\nright in the middle.\n\n239\n00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.260\nIt say Step 1: Prepare for Assessment,\nand so when we think about preparing for\n\n240\n00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.910\nassessment, we're thinking about making\nsure that we understand what activities\n\n241\n00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.140\nneed to occur for us to go in and\n\n242\n00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:56.830\nto ultimately look at risk and\nassess risk in the organization.\n\n243\n00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:57.810\nWhat is that gonna mean?\n\n244\n00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.400\nIt could mean several things.\n\n245\n00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.300\nIt may mean ultimately that\nwe are gonna go in and\n\n246\n00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.860\nwe are going to have a risk inventory.\n\n247\n00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.585\nWe're gonna have documented a bunch\nof risks that have to be laid out.\n\n248\n00:12:08.585 --> 00:12:10.794\nAnd now, we have to be thinking about, so\n\n249\n00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:14.700\nwe have effectively the catalog\nof risks that we want to examine.\n\n250\n00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.390\nIt could also be that we're\ndoing the fact finding and\n\n251\n00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.260\nthe assessment,\nin order to understand what the risks are.\n\n252\n00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.750\nWe're going out and\ngathering requirements about risks.\n\n253\n00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.300\nSo this could mean lots of things but\nultimately what it distills down to\n\n254\n00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.710\nis a list of risks,\na risk catalog, or a risk listing.\n\n255\n00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:34.620\nThat we then want to take into Step 2,\nwhich is Conduct Assessment.\n\n256\n00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.390\nWe want to effectively go in and\n\n257\n00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:41.710\nif you looked at the sub grey\nrectangular boxes that flow below\n\n258\n00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.640\nStep 2 in priority order, we're gonna\nidentify threat sources and events,\n\n259\n00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.670\nwe're gonna identify vulnerabilities and\nany predisposing conditions.\n\n260\n00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.850\nWe're gonna determine likelihood\nthat they will occur.\n\n261\n00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.850\nWe're then gonna determine\nmagnitude of impact.\n\n262\n00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.600\nThis is the whole process\nwe just walked through.\n\n263\n00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.330\nAnd then ultimately determine\nrisk as a result of that.\n\n264\n00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:03.570\nSo what we're gonna do is, we're gonna\nlook at the landscape of the business.\n\n265\n00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.820\nWe're gonna do a assessment\nof the current state.\n\n266\n00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.030\nAnd we're gonna figure out what\nrisks may live there as a result,\n\n267\n00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.920\nhow likely they are to be acted on.\n\n268\n00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.910\nHow badly they can hurt us if they are\nrealized and what that ultimately means,\n\n269\n00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.990\nthat's all part of Step 2 or stage two.\n\n270\n00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:23.070\nStep 3 is off to the left, Step 3,\ncommunicate risks, this is very important.\n\n271\n00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.540\nWe have to communicate risks broadly and\nwidely in the organization\n\n272\n00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.880\nto senior decision makers to help\nthem understand what's going on,\n\n273\n00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.340\nand to all of the people that are gonna\nbe involved in managing risk.\n\n274\n00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.700\nAnd then we move over to\nthe right hand side to Step 4,\n\n275\n00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.920\nthat is gonna be to\nmaintain the assessment.\n\n276\n00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.000\nOver time, in other words, we have to go\nthrough and look at the assessment and\n\n277\n00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.580\nupdate it.\n\n278\n00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.760\nWhere most security practitioners,\nmost security professionals miss and\n\n279\n00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.970\nfail when it comes to risk, is that they\ngo through this whole activity once, and\n\n280\n00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:52.970\nthey do it the right way.\n\n281\n00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:55.920\nThey get it all knocked down and\nset up, and\n\n282\n00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:01.300\nthen they forget that risk is an ongoing\ndynamic issue or a concern for us.\n\n283\n00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.260\nAs a result of that,\nthey forget they've got to circle back and\n\n284\n00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.110\nassess risk six months later.\n\n285\n00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.420\nFigure out what's new and\nadd it to the mix, right?\n\n286\n00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.820\n>> Yeah, your threat sources\ncould potentially change.\n\n287\n00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:14.100\nThe things that you have to use against\nthe risks could possibly change.\n\n288\n00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.600\nThe technologies you implement.\n\n289\n00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.610\n>> Your counter measures.\n\n290\n00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:17.920\n>> The budget that we have available.\n\n291\n00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.520\n>> And your budget,\nof course, all of that.\n\n292\n00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.010\nSo we have to constantly be reassessing.\n\n293\n00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.550\nAnd this is what Step 4 is,\nyou can think of it an iterative process\n\n294\n00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:28.040\nthat takes us back up to step one,\nin effect.\n\n295\n00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.590\nAnd asks us, hey have we anything\nnew that we want to add to the mix?\n\n296\n00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.380\nSo let's prepare and let's go back\nthrough, and let's make sure so\n\n297\n00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.380\nwhen you bring the new technology online\nit'll start offering new services.\n\n298\n00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.680\nYou gotta think about that.\n\n299\n00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.390\nThat would be one thing to consider.\n\n300\n00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:44.060\nSo while NIST offers us\na risk assessment framework,\n\n301\n00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:45.550\nthey are not the only game in town.\n\n302\n00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.610\nThey are not the only\nway to talk about risk.\n\n303\n00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.230\nThey are not the only\nway to think about risk.\n\n304\n00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.790\nWe wanna throw some other\nthings out there for you, and\n\n305\n00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.060\nwanna be able to understand\nwhat that may look like.\n\n306\n00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.740\nSo let's just talk about some\nadditional frameworks or\n\n307\n00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.950\nthought processes that help us to\nbroaden the conversation around risk.\n\n308\n00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.820\nThere is something known as Coso.\n\n309\n00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.610\nCoso is an organization\nthat has a risk framework,\n\n310\n00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.270\nthat always is going to talk about\nthe control elements around risk and\n\n311\n00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.840\nhow we set risk up,\nmanage, and control it.\n\n312\n00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.130\nSo we think about the control environment,\nwe think about risk assessments and\n\n313\n00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:19.340\ncontrol activities that go into managing\nrisks, when we think about five areas of\n\n314\n00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:24.790\ninternal control, which is what Coso is\nreally thinking about and focusing on.\n\n315\n00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.470\nThe five risk areas or\nthe internal areas for\n\n316\n00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.560\ncontrol necessary to help us identify and\nmanage risk.\n\n317\n00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.740\nI mentioned three already, but\nlet's just bullet them out.\n\n318\n00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.980\nControl environments, what they are.\n\n319\n00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.350\nRisk assessment,\nthe process for doing that.\n\n320\n00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:41.380\nThe control activities, how we're going\nto actually engage in controls and\n\n321\n00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.870\nstipulate what they will be and\nwalk through them.\n\n322\n00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:46.287\nInformation and communication mechanisms.\n\n323\n00:15:46.287 --> 00:15:50.427\nAnd monitoring that wraps all that around\nto be able to understand how to get\n\n324\n00:15:50.427 --> 00:15:52.209\na handle on all of these things.\n\n325\n00:15:52.209 --> 00:15:55.576\nSo Coso talks about five\nareas of internal control.\n\n326\n00:15:55.576 --> 00:15:57.666\nThat's what the framework\nreally is focused on.\n\n327\n00:15:57.666 --> 00:15:59.542\nWe have ITIL, or what's known as ITIL,\n\n328\n00:15:59.542 --> 00:16:03.090\ndepending on where you come from in\nthe world, IT Infrastructure Library.\n\n329\n00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.620\nIT stands for Information\nTechnology Infrastructure Library.\n\n330\n00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.910\nITIL is really focusing\non best practices and\n\n331\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:15.580\ncore practises around service provisioning\nfor IT services within the organization.\n\n332\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.160\nThere is a security element to that and\nan awareness of risk associated with that,\n\n333\n00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.530\nand the current version\nof the ITIL framework.\n\n334\n00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:25.620\nWe want to be aware of the fact we\ncan focus on the five areas, or\n\n335\n00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:30.000\nthe five process thought\nareas that ITIL lays out.\n\n336\n00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.330\nThey are service strategy, service design,\n\n337\n00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:37.670\nservice transition, service operation,\nand what's known as CSI or\n\n338\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.340\nContinual Service Improvement\nwhich wraps around all the others.\n\n339\n00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:45.320\nAgain, interactively asking us to\nexamine them and to cycle-path\n\n340\n00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:50.130\nas we go through a whole cycle\nstrategy design transition operation.\n\n341\n00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.360\nSo thinking about ideas,\nkinda laying them out, sketching them out,\n\n342\n00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.440\ncoming up with what they are in designs.\n\n343\n00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.840\nBuilding them and then making them\ninto something we can manage and\n\n344\n00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.050\ntransition, handing them off\nto operation to go live.\n\n345\n00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:05.320\nWhen we've done that, we then\niterate back through CSI looking for\n\n346\n00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.900\nways to improve, but\nalso looking for new technologies and\n\n347\n00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.150\nnew services we have to then go\nthrough and do the same process with.\n\n348\n00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:17.030\nSo ITIL is all about customer service,\nand IT focused, IT centric\n\n349\n00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:21.210\ncustomer service with a security thought\nprocess that comes to bare there, as well.\n\n350\n00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.720\nThis is one of several frameworks that we\nas IT security professionals would have to\n\n351\n00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.570\nbe aware of.\n\n352\n00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:27.200\nI'd mentioned COBIT already.\n\n353\n00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.210\nCOBIT is an IT governance framework.\n\n354\n00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.400\nIt is focused on what we know as GRC.\n\n355\n00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.490\nGovernance Risk and Compliance activities.\n\n356\n00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:37.810\nThere are other frameworks like risk IT,\nthat Asaka has in market,\n\n357\n00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:40.630\nwhat's known at ITAF,\nthe IT Assurance Framework.\n\n358\n00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:44.230\nThere are lots of different frameworks\nthat COBIT is gonna pair with and\n\n359\n00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.630\ncan also be with, and\n\n360\n00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:50.120\nagain as a security professional we will\nwanna have general knowledge of these.\n\n361\n00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.950\nShould you be spending time running out\nand learning everything there is to know\n\n362\n00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.800\nabout every one of the frameworks\nto prepare to become a CISSP?\n\n363\n00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.980\nThe answer is not necessarily.\n\n364\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:04.580\nWhat we often talk about with people\nwith being able to prepare for\n\n365\n00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.540\nthe CISSP is the following.\n\n366\n00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.930\nI have marbles in my mouth.\n\n367\n00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.030\nWhat we often talk about and\n\n368\n00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.020\nprepare you to think about as\na student is the following.\n\n369\n00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.570\nWe talk about knowledge acquisition\nfrom the perspective of mile wide and\n\n370\n00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:16.530\ninch deep knowledge.\n\n371\n00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.440\nWhat we mean about that ultimately,\nor we mean by that,\n\n372\n00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:23.670\nis that we want you to be very\nbroadly aware of all the themes,\n\n373\n00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.650\nthe theories,\nthe terminology that we're discussing.\n\n374\n00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:29.390\nBut we don't want you to go down\nthe rabbit hole in any one area.\n\n375\n00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.240\nThis is not a vendor specific exam.\n\n376\n00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:35.590\nThis is not a standard specific exam.\n\n377\n00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:38.170\nYou're not being certified\nas a ITIL practitioner.\n\n378\n00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.810\nYou could go take classes and figure out\nhow to do that, but that's not this exam.\n\n379\n00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:45.760\nYou're not being specified or\nbeing certified on ISO compliance.\n\n380\n00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.480\nYou're just using that as a touch\nstone to be able to understand how to\n\n381\n00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.650\napply this knowledge.\n\n382\n00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:53.320\nSo when we talk about COBIT,\nwe talk about COSO, we talk about ITIL,\n\n383\n00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.490\nwe're about to talk about some ISO\nstandards, we talk about NIST.\n\n384\n00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:57.460\nFive things.\n\n385\n00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:59.890\nAll of them are important to\nthe security professional.\n\n386\n00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:03.700\nAll of them are part of the tool kit that\nas a working professional in this industry\n\n387\n00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:07.080\nyou should bring to bare in\nconversations internally and\n\n388\n00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.940\nwith customers externally about\nhow you just find and manage risk.\n\n389\n00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:14.310\nBut any one of them may not be\nappropriate at any given moment and\n\n390\n00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:17.320\nyou have to understand how to use\nthe ones that are to your advantage.\n\n391\n00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.470\nYou should be aware,\nin other words, of these but\n\n392\n00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.790\nthis is not an exam about these in depth.\n\n393\n00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.870\nWe put them into perspective is my point.\n\n394\n00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.740\nSo ISO,\nwe talked about ISO standards already.\n\n395\n00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.850\nISO 27001 and 27002 are two information\nsecurity standards that you,\n\n396\n00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:35.180\namong the many that are out there,\nwould want to be aware of generically and\n\n397\n00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.770\nbroadly for the information security\nmanagement system framework and\n\n398\n00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.520\ncontrol associated with them.\n\n399\n00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.880\nAnd ISO31000 specific to\nthe discussion about risk\n\n400\n00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.580\nare all very important standards that\nagain, a security practitioner and\n\n401\n00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.370\na professional would want\nto have some knowledge of.\n\n402\n00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.580\nWhen we think about risk,\nwe have to categorize risk.\n\n403\n00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.160\nWe talked about how we\nget from a threat actor,\n\n404\n00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.850\na threat source,\nto ultimately deriving risks.\n\n405\n00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:00.780\nWell we haven't talked about what\nhappens when we drop risks, undefined,\n\n406\n00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:01.980\ninto that bucket.\n\n407\n00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.260\nWe call them risks, but\nwhat does that really mean?\n\n408\n00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.350\nDoes it mean that they're bad?\n\n409\n00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.580\nAs I said, it could mean they are.\n\n410\n00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.510\nDoes it mean they're good?\n\n411\n00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.490\nMay or may not.\n\n412\n00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:09.840\nBut how do we measure them?\n\n413\n00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.660\nThere's two ways to measure risk\nto qualify or quantify risk,\n\n414\n00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.799\nin other words,\nwe have to take different approaches.\n\n415\n00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.430\nSo when we think about qualifying risk,\nwhat we call a qualitative risk\n\n416\n00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.520\nassessment, we're thinking about\nsomething that is not numerical-based,\n\n417\n00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.540\nis not a metric-bases measure, but\nrather, is going to use softer measures.\n\n418\n00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:33.007\nSo for instance, we may think about\nthe brand reputation of a company and\n\n419\n00:20:33.007 --> 00:20:36.523\nthe impact that a risk may have\nif there's a data breach or\n\n420\n00:20:36.523 --> 00:20:39.395\nsome sort of a hacking\nsolution that happens.\n\n421\n00:20:39.395 --> 00:20:42.620\nOr somebody breaches that company and\ntakes data away from them.\n\n422\n00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.170\nWe want to think about\nthe fact that the impact to\n\n423\n00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:50.150\nthat particular company's reputation\nmay be negatively perceived, right?\n\n424\n00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:52.670\nCompany may have a problem,\nthey may have an image concern.\n\n425\n00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.460\nTheir customers may say we\ndon't trust you any more.\n\n426\n00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.260\nWell, what does,\nwe don't trust you really mean?\n\n427\n00:20:57.260 --> 00:20:58.040\nCan you measure that?\n\n428\n00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:59.530\nHow much don't you trust me?\n\n429\n00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:00.910\nOn a scale of one to five.\n\n430\n00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.720\nMaybe I was five before and\nnow I'm a three?\n\n431\n00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.990\nDoes that mean you're still\ngoing to do business with me?\n\n432\n00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.850\nI don't know.\n\n433\n00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:06.930\nBut it's hard to measure.\n\n434\n00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.470\nSo some things are not easy to quantify.\n\n435\n00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:14.520\nQuantifiable risk assessment is a measured\nassessment and that measured assessment\n\n436\n00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:19.500\nis going to be something that we can show\nand illustrate for you with a formula.\n\n437\n00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:22.270\nWe're gonna show you that formula and\ntake a look at what that is.\n\n438\n00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:24.980\nBecause when we measure risk,\nwhat we can do\n\n439\n00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:29.775\nis we can use the formula on the screen\nin front of you to be able to quantify.\n\n440\n00:21:29.775 --> 00:21:33.835\nTo measure a acyclic down is something we\ncan hold in our hands and actually assess.\n\n441\n00:21:33.835 --> 00:21:36.605\nThe formula has acronyms\nassociated with it.\n\n442\n00:21:36.605 --> 00:21:40.445\nYou'll see them in the parenthesis at\nthe end of the line after each statement.\n\n443\n00:21:40.445 --> 00:21:42.545\nWe just spelled them out for\nyou so you know what they are.\n\n444\n00:21:43.765 --> 00:21:48.160\nThe formula is\nAnnualized Loss Expectancy or ALE.\n\n445\n00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.650\nIs equal to is made up of two things.\n\n446\n00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:55.960\nIs equal to Sing Loss Expectancy (SLE),\nmultiplied by that little asterisk,\n\n447\n00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.190\nor star or snowflake is actually\ngoing to be a multiplication sign.\n\n448\n00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:04.320\nSingle Loss Expectancy multiplied by\nAnnual Rate of Occurrence or ARO.\n\n449\n00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.226\nSo we say the formula is\nactually ALE = SLE x ARO.\n\n450\n00:22:09.226 --> 00:22:14.030\nALE = SLE * ARO is\nthe formula that we use.\n\n451\n00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:17.900\nAnd so Mike's gonna be kind enough to be\nable to just type that out for us, and\n\n452\n00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:22.540\nthen is gonna just show it to you in a\nrepresentation that's easily consumable so\n\n453\n00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:24.360\nwe can talk about it for just a minute.\n\n454\n00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.700\nSo let's go through just\na practical example of this,\n\n455\n00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.710\nlet's apply this to the real world for\na minute.\n\n456\n00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:34.330\nLet's say that we have a firewall\nthat we've gone ahead and\n\n457\n00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:35.870\ninstalled recently in our company.\n\n458\n00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:43.040\nAnd that firewall cost us $5,000 to buy,\nright, to set up.\n\n459\n00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.636\nCost is $5,000.\n\n460\n00:22:44.636 --> 00:22:49.100\nNow, the $5,000 expense that we laid\nout for the firewall has to be measured\n\n461\n00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.990\nbecause we have to understand whether\nthat was a good or a bad investment.\n\n462\n00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:55.718\nAnd this is what ALE = SLE x\nARO helps us to figure out.\n\n463\n00:22:55.718 --> 00:23:00.400\nIs that $5,000 expense actually\ngonna be a good investment,\n\n464\n00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.180\nis it neutral, or is it negative?\n\n465\n00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.940\nSo, we're gonna walk through how\nto figure that out right now.\n\n466\n00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.780\nThat firewall that cost us\n5,000 was really designed\n\n467\n00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.430\nto be able to address a concern.\n\n468\n00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.840\nIn effect, an exploit that happens to us,\nwe can call it a breach.\n\n469\n00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.660\nAnd we're gonna say that it\nhappens six times a year, so\n\n470\n00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:23.140\nthe Annualized Loss Expectancy is gonna\nbe 12 months, or one year, right?\n\n471\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.130\nSo the number, the numerical value for\n\n472\n00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.910\nALE is always usually 12\nmonths which equals one year.\n\n473\n00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:32.720\nWhat we're then gonna say is that\nthe value for ARO, the Annualized Rate of\n\n474\n00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.210\nOccurrence, is gonna be six, happen six\ntimes a year or once every two months.\n\n475\n00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.380\nThe single loss expectancy\nvalue in this equation\n\n476\n00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.150\nis gonna be what it costs us\nevery time that breach occurs.\n\n477\n00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:49.895\nIf we say that breach costs us a $1,000,\nevery time it happens, right?\n\n478\n00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:54.618\nThen what we have to understand is,\nthat the annual loss expectancy,\n\n479\n00:23:54.618 --> 00:23:58.636\nwhich is a Measures a value\nover a 12 month cycle, right?\n\n480\n00:23:58.636 --> 00:24:02.384\nBut the reality is, the Annualized\nLoss Expectancy is really going to\n\n481\n00:24:02.384 --> 00:24:06.400\nbe the dollar value of what it'd cost\nus when we multiply out SLE times ARO.\n\n482\n00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:06.950\nAll right?\n\n483\n00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.020\nSo we don't know what that is yet,\nwe got to do the math.\n\n484\n00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.390\nBut what we do know is that\nSLE is going to be equal to,\n\n485\n00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:15.240\nI said,\na $1,000 every time it happens, right?\n\n486\n00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.079\nAnd we're going to multiply that,\ntimes six times a year.\n\n487\n00:24:18.079 --> 00:24:21.617\nSo 1,000 times 6 = $6,000.\n\n488\n00:24:21.617 --> 00:24:26.470\nSo what we would say is that\nthe single loss expectancy is 1,000,\n\n489\n00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.870\nthe annual rate of\noccurrence is six times.\n\n490\n00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.990\nThat means the Annualized Loss Expectancy\nwe measure it over a year,\n\n491\n00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.631\nis gonna be $6,000.\n\n492\n00:24:35.631 --> 00:24:39.151\nWhich means if we spend 5,000\nto buy the firewall and\n\n493\n00:24:39.151 --> 00:24:44.400\nthe negative impact from those six\noccurrences throughout the year is 6,000.\n\n494\n00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.190\nWhat that actually tells us is that we\nmade a good investment because we spent\n\n495\n00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:53.510\nless money than we actually are losing\nif we allow the attacks to continue.\n\n496\n00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:59.020\nBut if we only measure that for\nsix months instead of for a year, right?\n\n497\n00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:03.080\nAnd we say that the attacks occur every\ntwo months so then the attacks would occur\n\n498\n00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.820\nthree times instead of six in over\nthe course of a sixth month period.\n\n499\n00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:11.230\nThen it would be a $3,000 Annual Rate\nof Occurrence would be right $3,000.\n\n500\n00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.220\nAs a result of that.\n\n501\n00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:13.770\nRight?\n\n502\n00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:17.740\nWe would wind up saying, or excuse me,\nAnnual Loss Expectancy would be 3,000.\n\n503\n00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:22.100\nI'm looking at the formula, and looking at\nyour numbers and reading them backwards.\n\n504\n00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.210\nSo we would say if we only measured it\nover six months, it wouldn't really be\n\n505\n00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.900\nAnnualized Loss Expectancy, it would\njust be loss expectancy at that point.\n\n506\n00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.280\nBut if we did that, we would say you know,\nit's probably not a good investment,\n\n507\n00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.040\ncuz we spent more money\non the countermeasure.\n\n508\n00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.740\nThat we actually are saving.\n\n509\n00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:40.660\nSo we have to understand what\nthe potential impact of the loss is,\n\n510\n00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.520\nand then what the potential\nfix will cost us.\n\n511\n00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.700\nAs we examine these things, we can then\nquantify, we can measure in dollar value,\n\n512\n00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.030\nhard numbers, whether or\nnot it's a good investment.\n\n513\n00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:55.460\nIf something costs as much or\nless than what it will cost us to allow\n\n514\n00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:58.760\nthe attacks to continue,\nit's typically seen as a good investment.\n\n515\n00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.010\nIf it costs more than that,\nit still may be a good investment, but\n\n516\n00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:06.220\nwe have to extend the timeline to recoup\nthat investment and see the return.\n\n517\n00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.250\nInstead of 12 months,\nmaybe we say it's over 24 months.\n\n518\n00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:13.990\nBecause on average, most IT investments\nare amortized or examined and\n\n519\n00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:17.670\nlooked at and depreciated over\na three to five year lifecycle.\n\n520\n00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:20.370\nWhich means it may be anywhere\nfrom 36 months to 60 months.\n\n521\n00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:24.410\nAnd if we look at in a long term view,\nthree to five years,\n\n522\n00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.720\nwe may actually say that in the second\nyear we're recouping that money and\n\n523\n00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:30.850\nit's still a good investment if we keep\nit for at least two or three years.\n\n524\n00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:35.439\nSo you wanna understand how to\nquantitatively, quantitatively,\n\n525\n00:26:35.439 --> 00:26:36.750\nexamine risk.\n\n526\n00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:41.480\nAnnualized loss expectancy equaling single\nloss times annual rate of occurrence, or\n\n527\n00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.030\nALE equals SLE times ARO.\n\n528\n00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.760\nThat's how we quantify\nthe measure of risk.\n\n529\n00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:50.100\nQualitatively excessive risk is\nlooking at things like reputation, or\n\n530\n00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:53.580\nsoft factors that cannot be measured\nwith dollars and with numbers.\n\n531\n00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.160\nThis is the key difference\nbetween the two.\n\n532\n00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.315\nIn addition to qualitative and\nquantitative assessments, we wanna also,\n\n533\n00:27:00.315 --> 00:27:01.535\nunderstand or\n\n534\n00:27:01.535 --> 00:27:06.855\nat least just think about the fact that we\nhave to think about how we deal with risk.\n\n535\n00:27:06.855 --> 00:27:09.005\nRight?\nThere are accepted ways of\n\n536\n00:27:09.005 --> 00:27:09.835\ndealing with risk.\n\n537\n00:27:09.835 --> 00:27:13.255\nIn this case,\nas we magically scroll down on the screen,\n\n538\n00:27:13.255 --> 00:27:15.845\nyou'll see that our four risk\nresponse approaches are.\n\n539\n00:27:15.845 --> 00:27:18.350\nWe just wanna throw out there,\nmake sure you're comfortable with.\n\n540\n00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:21.350\nThese are the four classic ways\nin which we deal with risk.\n\n541\n00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:25.340\nBy the way, no particular order meaning\nthere's no importance in saying Avoidance\n\n542\n00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.190\nis number one verses\nMitigation being number four.\n\n543\n00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.530\nWe just listed them for you.\n\n544\n00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:32.080\nYou can list them in any order\nit doesn't matter what they are.\n\n545\n00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.530\nJust want to know what they are.\n\n546\n00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.140\nSo, Avoidance, Transference,\nAcceptance, Mitigation.\n\n547\n00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:39.650\nLet's just quickly give you and example\nof each as we wrap up our conversation.\n\n548\n00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:42.180\nSo Avoidance is about\ngetting out of the way.\n\n549\n00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.400\nYou may decide not to engage in\nthat behavior and simply avoid\n\n550\n00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:49.210\nthe risk altogether by not doing by\nwhatever could lead to the risk, right?\n\n551\n00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:50.010\nSo that's one way.\n\n552\n00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:52.840\nIt may not always be practical,\nbut it's one way to do it.\n\n553\n00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.690\nTransference.\n\n554\n00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:57.130\nThe classic example of\ntransference is insurance.\n\n555\n00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:59.850\nYou pay somebody to take on the risk.\n\n556\n00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.340\nIn exchange for money,\nthey'll manage it on your behalf, right?\n\n557\n00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.270\nSo that would be a classic\nexample of transference.\n\n558\n00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:09.870\nAnother example of transference today is\nthe move to the cloud through a SASS,\n\n559\n00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.360\nPASS, or IS model.\n\n560\n00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.630\nWe'll talk more about cloud\nat some point later, but\n\n561\n00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:17.520\nthe idea of renting infrastructure\non a monthly basis for a fee.\n\n562\n00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.010\nGiving somebody else the liability\nof managing it for you.\n\n563\n00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.820\nThat's another good example\nof transference risk.\n\n564\n00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.310\nAcceptance a risk.\n\n565\n00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:27.120\nWe're effectively gonna engage in\nthe behavior even though in the maybe\n\n566\n00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.750\na downside.\n\n567\n00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.790\nThere could be issue with risk we're\ngonna accept this as the calls to\n\n568\n00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:31.450\ndoing business.\n\n569\n00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:33.150\nThat's what you often hear people say.\n\n570\n00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.260\nAnd then Mitigation.\n\n571\n00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.100\nMitigation is to minimize the risk.\n\n572\n00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.920\nEngage in behavior.\n\n573\n00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.660\nExecute countermeasures.\n\n574\n00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:42.730\nRight?\nMeasure risk and\n\n575\n00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:46.450\ntry to minimize it at every corner,\nevery turn, every opportunity,\n\n576\n00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:51.520\nthat way it is gonna be as low in terms of\nthe likelihood to impact us as possible.\n\n577\n00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.990\nBut remember we always have residual risk.\n\n578\n00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.580\nThere's always some risk left over in\nthe organization even after we mitigate.\n\n579\n00:28:57.580 --> 00:28:59.380\n>> All right, Adam,\na lot of great information.\n\n580\n00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.480\nJust a ton of information\non risk management,\n\n581\n00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.150\ndefining a lot of the important\nterms that we're gonna need\n\n582\n00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:08.080\nas we continue to discuss risk\nmanagement cuz we're not done yet.\n\n583\n00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.860\nWe still have quite a bit to go.\n\n584\n00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:10.710\nRisk management.\n\n585\n00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:13.620\nPretty big topic but\nwe're out of time for this episode,\n\n586\n00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.350\nso we're going to have to come back and\ndo it again.\n\n587\n00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:16.980\nSo make sure you come back and join us.\n\n588\n00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.455\nRemember, you want to attend one of\nAdam's classes live, shoot us an email,\n\n589\n00:29:20.455 -->

--> 00:00:19.530\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're going over CISSP,\n\n4\n00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.390\nand specifically we're\nlooking at risk management.\n\n5\n00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.148\nPrevious episode we've got the basic\nconcepts of risk management down.\n\n6\n00:00:27.148 --> 00:00:31.220\nA lot of the terminology that's gonna\nmake going through risk management,\n\n7\n00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.950\nrisk analysis a little bit easier for\nus to talk about, to understand and\n\n8\n00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.960\nto prepare for that exam.\n\n9\n00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.080\nBut there's more to it.\n\n10\n00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.360\nWe did not get through all of it.\n\n11\n00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.440\nSo Adam Gordon is here with me to help us\nwork our way through risk management, so\n\n12\n00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.686\nwhere do we go next Adam?\n\n13\n00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:46.369\n>> So I was thinking we would do\na vocabulary review and that Mike-\n\n14\n00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:47.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n15\n00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.740\n>> while standing on one foot\n\n16\n00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.916\nwould recite for us all the definitions of\nall the risk terms that we went through.\n\n17\n00:00:52.916 --> 00:00:55.130\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How many of you wanna see that?\n\n18\n00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.730\nThat would be awesome personally,\nI think that would be good.\n\n19\n00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.800\nWe're not going to subject you to that,\nhowever.\n\n20\n00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.910\nWhat we are gonna do is just quickly\nremind you of a couple of things,\n\n21\n00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.610\nall kidding aside.\n\n22\n00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.200\nAnd then we're gonna jump back in and\n\n23\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.830\ntalk about some of the stuff that we have\non the agenda for this particular episode.\n\n24\n00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.170\nSo we have talked a lot about not just how\nto quantify and qualitatively assess risk.\n\n25\n00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.140\n>> But generically, what risk is and we\nspent a lot of time developing the thought\n\n26\n00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.000\nprocess about what all the moving parts,\nthe vocabulary of risk is, and\n\n27\n00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.880\nI would encourage you to go back and\nreview the language discussion.\n\n28\n00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.340\nMake sure you know what\na threat source is.\n\n29\n00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.340\nMake sure you understand\nwhat a vulnerability is.\n\n30\n00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.850\nMake sure we know what a threat event is\nand how a vulnerability being exploited\n\n31\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.860\nleads to a likelihood of impact that could\nbe measured either quantitatively or\n\n32\n00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.210\nqualitatively the two methods we use to\nassess risks and the four mechanisms or\n\n33\n00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.380\nways in which we use to address risks.\n\n34\n00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.820\nThey are going to be risk acceptance,\nagain no particular order,\n\n35\n00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.520\nrisk acceptance, risk avoidance,\nrisk transference and risk mitigation.\n\n36\n00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.690\nI want to make sure we remember those four\nthings as we begin our conversation here.\n\n37\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.280\nWe also want to make sure that we\nunderstand and we remember that when we\n\n38\n00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.170\nare dealing with risk, however we deal\nwith it, we accept it, we mitigate it,\n\n39\n00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.650\nwe transfer it, we avoid it,\nthere's always something left over, right?\n\n40\n00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.090\nMy grandmother would always tell me,\n\n41\n00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.270\nhey, always leave something on the table,\nright?\n\n42\n00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.900\nDon't eat everything there.\n\n43\n00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.550\nSo as a result,\nyou always leave something behind.\n\n44\n00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.490\nRisk Whatever condition it's in, however\nwe deal with it, ultimately whatever we\n\n45\n00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.840\ncall it is gonna be left over if\nwe quantify that leftover risk,\n\n46\n00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.500\nwe call it risk, what,\nwhat kinda risk do we call it?\n\n47\n00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.490\n>> Risk leftovers.\n\n48\n00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.500\n>> Risk leftovers, right.\n\n49\n00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.160\nWarm them up, 300 degrees, little bit\nof water so they're a little tender.\n\n50\n00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.300\n>> Residual risk.\n\n51\n00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.675\n>> We call them, exactly, we call them\nresidual risk, wanna make sure we know\n\n52\n00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:38.860\nthat residual risks are gonna be\nthe leftover risks, right very important.\n\n53\n00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.330\nThis is why, gentlemen and ladies,\n\n54\n00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.030\nyou never practice information\nsecurity without a next, right.\n\n55\n00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.005\nBecause it is live when we do this for\nyou.\n\n56\n00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:45.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n57\n00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.920\nas a result sometimes it works well and\nother times well,\n\n58\n00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.250\nyou know, throw the ball in the air and\nguess what happens?\n\n59\n00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.750\nYou get leftovers.\n\n60\n00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.990\n>> Whoops.\n>> That's how it works.\n\n61\n00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.500\nAll right so residual risk, very\nimportant as a terminology item as well.\n\n62\n00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.780\nSo risk assignment, right.\n\n63\n00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.440\nLet's talk about now that we know,\n\n64\n00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.150\nwe remind ourselves of the fact that\nwe always have something left over.\n\n65\n00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.770\nSo we have risk, we've identified it.\n\n66\n00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.960\nWe're trying to deal with it, we have\nsomething there that we have to deal with.\n\n67\n00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.800\nHow are we gonna do that?\n\n68\n00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.550\nDo I just say, hey somebody\nshould go deal with that risk.\n\n69\n00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.770\nDo I give it to somebody?\n\n70\n00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.828\nI usually am in the habit of,\nat least I am, and most of us should be,\n\n71\n00:03:13.828 --> 00:03:18.140\nthe habit of assigning risk to somebody\nand saying, Mike this is your risk.\n\n72\n00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.100\nI need you to deal with this.\n\n73\n00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.290\nThis is gonna be something you\nultimately are gonna be responsible for.\n\n74\n00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.820\nSo risk assignment becomes very important,\nit's a central theme\n\n75\n00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.160\ninside of how we deal with risk in\nthe conversation, in the organization.\n\n76\n00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.990\nUltimately, the organization owns risk,\nbut the reality is somebody\n\n77\n00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.600\nhas to represent the organization,\nstep up and say, guess what.\n\n78\n00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.800\nI am the person,\n\n79\n00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.740\nI am the entity that's gonna manage\nthis risk on behalf of the organization.\n\n80\n00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.320\nAnd when we say the organization\nultimately owns risk, let's be clear,\n\n81\n00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.630\nwhat do we really mean?\n\n82\n00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.540\nWe really are saying, right, without\ncoming right out and saying it, and\n\n83\n00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.580\nI'm about to come right out and say it.\n\n84\n00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.228\nBut what we are saying and implying is not\nthat the nameless, faceless entity called\n\n85\n00:03:56.228 --> 00:04:00.746\nthe organization owns risk, not that an\nindividual named Mike or Adam owns risk on\n\n86\n00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:04.478\nbehalf of the organization, but\nspecifically, that a nameless,\n\n87\n00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:09.340\nfaceless entity called the organization\nis represented by senior management.\n\n88\n00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.880\nAnd senior management owns\nthe responsibility of the risk and\n\n89\n00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.780\nthey assign that risk, responsibility,\nto one or more individuals,\n\n90\n00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.880\ntypically a CISSP or some sort of manager,\non behalf of them that will walk through\n\n91\n00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.370\nthe process of figuring out how to address\nthe risk on behalf of the organization.\n\n92\n00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.330\nBut let's be clear, let's be unequivocal.\n\n93\n00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.320\nSenior management ultimately\nbears responsibility for risk.\n\n94\n00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.880\nSomething goes wrong, we're gonna come\nback and talk to senior management.\n\n95\n00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.480\nIf there is ultimately financial\nliability associated with risk,\n\n96\n00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.000\nwe're gonna lay that at the feet of senior\nmanagement on behalf of the organization.\n\n97\n00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.680\nSo we wanna make sure we understand that.\n\n98\n00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.890\nEverything begins and\nends with senior management.\n\n99\n00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.005\nStill want to be a CISSP?\n\n100\n00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:51.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just asking, that's all.\n\n101\n00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.620\nSo anyway, please make sure we understand\nthat, and that we're aware of that.\n\n102\n00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.040\nSenior management is\nwhere accountability and\n\n103\n00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.850\nresponsibility lie with regards\nto risk and risk assignment.\n\n104\n00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.990\nHowever, they will devolve that\nright down in the organization,\n\n105\n00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.950\npush it down broadly and laterally and\n\n106\n00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.150\nask other individuals to take that\non on behalf of the organization.\n\n107\n00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.120\nThis is where due care and\ndue diligence come back in.\n\n108\n00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.950\nBecause this is how we then ultimately see\nthe matter of risk evolving over time.\n\n109\n00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.120\nTo that end, we've talked already,\nand I'll remind you yet\n\n110\n00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.630\nagain about enterprise risk management\nguidelines and standards that exist.\n\n111\n00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.810\nAnd when we talk about\nsomething more than once,\n\n112\n00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.230\nright, it's a good hint that\nthere's probably value there.\n\n113\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.050\nI did make clear to you that we\ndon't expect you to go out and\n\n114\n00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.980\nbecome an expert on ISO 31,000, but\nthat you should have passing familiarity,\n\n115\n00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.930\npassing awareness of the fact that there\nare ISO standards dealing with risk.\n\n116\n00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.130\nI talked to you about iTill, we talked\nabout Cobid, we talked about Coso,\n\n117\n00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.220\nthese are all risk frameworks in one\nform or another, in one way or another.\n\n118\n00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.100\nWe talked about the NIST\nrisk assessment process and\n\n119\n00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.310\na business impact analysis with regards\nto measuring the importance of services\n\n120\n00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.260\nin our prior conversation, that then\nhelps us to identify and frame risks.\n\n121\n00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.350\nAll these things are important but\nremember we've often talked about\n\n122\n00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.790\nmile wide and inch deep on the idea\nthat you have to master knowledge at\n\n123\n00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.870\nthe appropriate level in\norder to become a CISSP.\n\n124\n00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:14.400\nSo when we talk about enterprise\nrisk management guidelines,\n\n125\n00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.550\nreminding you about the fact that Coso,\nthat Cobid, that ISO, or\n\n126\n00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:27.330\nISO 31000 or 27005 which one of\nthe earlier risk standards exist.\n\n127\n00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.190\nJust doing that off the top of my head.\n\n128\n00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:31.670\nWhen all of those come out,\nwe want to remember those.\n\n129\n00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.740\nWant to be aware of them.\n\n130\n00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.186\nBut are you gonna be asked questions\nspecifically about what's in ISO 31000,\n\n131\n00:06:37.186 --> 00:06:38.670\nabsolutely not.\n\n132\n00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.968\nUnless you pay for the standard, number\none, you're not gonna be able to read it.\n\n133\n00:06:41.968 --> 00:06:45.700\nNumber two, nobody said go out and buy\nthe standard so you can then go out and\n\n134\n00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.800\ntake the exam.\n\n135\n00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.200\nBut should you be familiar with\nthe fact that ISO addresses risk?\n\n136\n00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.028\nAbsolutely.\n\n137\n00:06:51.028 --> 00:06:53.610\nAs a CISSP we definitely\nhave to understand and\n\n138\n00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.670\nabide by that particular level\nof information and knowledge.\n\n139\n00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.930\nSo when we think about enterprise risk\nmanagement guidance, we think about\n\n140\n00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.970\nframeworks that are available to us as\npractitioners and as policy managers.\n\n141\n00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.540\nWe wanna reference those and\nmake sure we are aware of them.\n\n142\n00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.920\nWhen we think about these different\ncomponents coming together,\n\n143\n00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.640\nwe have to think about how they're\ngonna help us to manage risk.\n\n144\n00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.760\nSo, when we think about identifying risk,\nright.\n\n145\n00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.510\nWe've walked through this.\n\n146\n00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.690\nWe've talked about business requirements\ngathering, and requirements analysis and\n\n147\n00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.620\nall the things that go on.\n\n148\n00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.928\nWe have to think about risk from\na lot of different perspectives.\n\n149\n00:07:21.928 --> 00:07:25.190\nWhen I talk to customers\nabout identifying risk,\n\n150\n00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.500\nit's easy to talk about\nthe things they know.\n\n151\n00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.870\nHey, what are the risks you\nface in your business today?\n\n152\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.210\nOh, we're worried about people\nhacking into our customer database and\n\n153\n00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.000\nstealing our account information.\n\n154\n00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.200\nOkay, we hear about that all\nthe time on the news, right?\n\n155\n00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.090\nPeople talk about that.\n\n156\n00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.050\nThat happens to big and small companies.\n\n157\n00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.730\nAnd so that's one that's pretty common,\nright?\n\n158\n00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.870\nPeople know about that.\n\n159\n00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.480\nSo that's an important one,\nthat's an obvious one.\n\n160\n00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.930\nWhat about the ones that aren't so\nobvious,\n\n161\n00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.990\nwhat about what are they gonna do with\nthat data once they take it from you?\n\n162\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.175\nCuz let's assume hypothetically that\nthey're gonna be able to take the data.\n\n163\n00:07:53.175 --> 00:07:55.612\nIs that the end of the risk and\nare you done and you get to go home?\n\n164\n00:07:55.612 --> 00:07:57.389\nI mean that would be nice in theory right?\n\n165\n00:07:57.389 --> 00:07:59.490\nWe're done, didn't end well, but you know.\n\n166\n00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.627\nHey, come back tomorrow,\nwe'll try again, right.\n\n167\n00:08:01.627 --> 00:08:05.170\nIt's not a game show, so\nyou don't get to come back and try again.\n\n168\n00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.800\nSo if somebody takes the data from you,\nthe next risk is,\n\n169\n00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.110\ncan they access the data and use it.\n\n170\n00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.170\nSo we may have controls in place\nthat will encrypt the data.\n\n171\n00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.200\nAnd so even though the access controls to\nthe data may not have been very sound,\n\n172\n00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.020\nvery robust, very good, and they may\nhave fallen prey to an attack that\n\n173\n00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.000\nallowed the data to become compromised.\n\n174\n00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.900\nIf somebody can't access the data\nbecause it's encrypted, and\n\n175\n00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:32.300\nthey can't break the encryption because we\nused a very strong encryption solution,\n\n176\n00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.250\nthen we still done our job.\n\n177\n00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.000\nI don't mind if somebody takes my data\nif they can't do anything with it.\n\n178\n00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.570\nNow I do mind, let me be clear.\n\n179\n00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:43.620\nMy customers mind, I mind, because the\nimpact of that is that you're not gonna\n\n180\n00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.480\ntrust us as a customer,\nas a business to host your data.\n\n181\n00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.670\nAnd that sword of Damocles that we\ntalked about is always hanging over\n\n182\n00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.650\nyour head, right?\n\n183\n00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.130\nWill they be able to get into the data?\n\n184\n00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.580\nCan they compromise the data\nif they break the encryption?\n\n185\n00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.780\nI don't wanna put that to the test\nunless absolutely necessary.\n\n186\n00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.550\nBut if it comes down to, hey took\nthe data but can't use it, I'd rather it\n\n187\n00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.620\nbe on that side of the conversation\nsaying, yeah you took it but oh well.\n\n188\n00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:09.830\nSo you got it, you can't use it,\nso, who cares?\n\n189\n00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.090\nI'd rather be able to tell my customers\nthat, and work on damage control with\n\n190\n00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:17.014\nthem, and figure out how to help them\ntell their customers things will be okay,\n\n191\n00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:20.880\nthan worry about whether that data\nis gonna be taken and then used.\n\n192\n00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.170\nSo my point is we come\nback to a very basic but\n\n193\n00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:27.050\nincredibly important concept here,\ndefense in depth, right.\n\n194\n00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:31.320\nWe come back to the idea of overlapping,\nmutually reinforcing controls.\n\n195\n00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.250\nRisk management, in other words,\nis not about getting it right one time.\n\n196\n00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.570\nIt's about a continuous thought process\nthat evolves with the information,\n\n197\n00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.070\nwith the protection needs.\n\n198\n00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:44.910\nAnd as we continuously evolve,\nwe continuously are probing, monitoring,\n\n199\n00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.750\ntesting, but\n\n200\n00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.280\nwe're also building additional layers\nof protection into our system.\n\n201\n00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.570\nSo when you think about, and\nwe didn't draw a graphic for this, and\n\n202\n00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.470\nwe don't need one, but\nyou can kinda see it off\n\n203\n00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.625\non the above my shoulder off to\nthe one side of the camera there.\n\n204\n00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:03.710\nWhere you see the concentric rings, or the\nedge of the concentric circles that are,\n\n205\n00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:05.486\nlet me point that way,\nthat are over there.\n\n206\n00:10:05.486 --> 00:10:08.980\nTotally counter intuitive pointing when\nI'm on camera going the opposite way, but\n\n207\n00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.650\nif you got to see it right over there.\n\n208\n00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.475\nWhat I'm pointing to is a kinda\na half shot, a quarter,\n\n209\n00:10:13.475 --> 00:10:17.792\na pie kind of outtake of that, but\nit's a set of concentric rings or circles.\n\n210\n00:10:17.792 --> 00:10:21.770\nRight, that form a graphic on\nthe back end of the station, right.\n\n211\n00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.070\nSo the idea will be simply that we're\nalmost looking at like a bullseye, or\n\n212\n00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.210\nthe logo from Target.\n\n213\n00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:28.200\nYou could think of that if you\nhave a mental image for that.\n\n214\n00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.160\nIt's just a set of concentric rings.\n\n215\n00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.490\nThe idea behind defense and depth is just\nthis, it's a series of concentric rings.\n\n216\n00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.960\nAnd when we go and we try to get into\nas a bad actor, the first level or\n\n217\n00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.850\nfirst area of ring of controls,\nwe may bypass that, right.\n\n218\n00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.330\nWe may get around that,\nwe may get into the second layer.\n\n219\n00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.830\nAnd ultimately, if I do it this way,\nand we kind of continue to move down,\n\n220\n00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.945\nif I can penetrate all the layers,\nI may get to the data down below right.\n\n221\n00:10:51.945 --> 00:10:56.045\nBut if I get stop somewhere in the middle,\nand I never get below to the data,\n\n222\n00:10:56.045 --> 00:10:59.045\nthen I've been successful in\nterms of the architecture.\n\n223\n00:10:59.045 --> 00:11:01.435\nYo, one of the most important\nquotes I've ever read and\n\n224\n00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:04.552\never heard about with regards to data and\ndata security and risk, and\n\n225\n00:11:04.552 --> 00:11:06.202\nit stuck with me all these years.\n\n226\n00:11:06.202 --> 00:11:09.852\nIs not about the fact that you need\nto build these control layers,\n\n227\n00:11:09.852 --> 00:11:11.602\nthese defense in depth mechanisms, and\n\n228\n00:11:11.602 --> 00:11:13.332\nyou have to be great at architecture and\nall these things.\n\n229\n00:11:13.332 --> 00:11:14.952\nAll that's good, gotta do all that.\n\n230\n00:11:14.952 --> 00:11:19.992\nBut the reality is, we have to do that\nbecause controls are bypassed, right?\n\n231\n00:11:19.992 --> 00:11:22.100\nThey're not attacked,\npeople just go around them.\n\n232\n00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.270\nReality is we build these\nfixed environmental controls,\n\n233\n00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:28.220\nwe put doors in place,\nwe put locks on them, right?\n\n234\n00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.230\nWe put alarms on doors,\nwe use bulletproof or\n\n235\n00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:35.920\ncrash resistant barriers in the front\nof our data centers, bollards and\n\n236\n00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.280\nthings like that to prevent\npeople from getting in.\n\n237\n00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.488\nWe do all that, so what people do?\n\n238\n00:11:40.488 --> 00:11:42.860\nThey come around the back of the building,\nthey find an open window, they crawl in,\n\n239\n00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.840\nand they go take our data\nwhen nobody's looking.\n\n240\n00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.670\nSo the reality is that for\nall the planning we do up front,\n\n241\n00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.640\nit's still gonna be the weakest\nlink in the chain, and\n\n242\n00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.780\nthat's what the conversation and\nthe quote is about.\n\n243\n00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:56.427\nIt's about you do all this work up front\nbut if you don't really have a complete\n\n244\n00:11:56.427 --> 00:12:00.632\nencompassing set of environmental logical\nand technical and administrative controls,\n\n245\n00:12:00.632 --> 00:12:04.302\nall the control elements, we'll talk\nabout in one of our upcoming episodes.\n\n246\n00:12:04.302 --> 00:12:08.437\nIf you don't have all of those,\nyou might as well do nothing.\n\n247\n00:12:08.437 --> 00:12:11.284\nYou got nothing because the reality is\nsomebody's gonna figure out a way to come\n\n248\n00:12:11.284 --> 00:12:12.570\nalong and take it from you, right.\n\n249\n00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.174\nAnd so this is really important,\nall these frameworks we're talking about,\n\n250\n00:12:15.174 --> 00:12:16.160\nthey're all good.\n\n251\n00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.740\nBut if you use all of them, and at the end\nof the day you put them all in place and\n\n252\n00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.790\nsay I'm just gonna throw everything up\non the wall, something's gonna work.\n\n253\n00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.070\nYou're gonna have a hodge podge,\n\n254\n00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:27.590\nthat's an official information\nsecurity term by the way, hodge podge.\n\n255\n00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.750\nYou can use that, but\nonly after you're certified.\n\n256\n00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.960\nDon't use it until then.\n\n257\n00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.730\nBut you have a hodge\npodge of all this stuff.\n\n258\n00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:34.560\nBut do you really have a plan?\n\n259\n00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.470\nDo you have a holistic solution?\n\n260\n00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.600\nDo you have controls that are mutually\nreinforcing, overlapping, and\n\n261\n00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.330\nare gonna provide additional\nlayers of security?\n\n262\n00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.450\nYou may or may not.\n\n263\n00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:46.090\nMy teenage daughters call it a hot mess.\n\n264\n00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.990\nI think that's what the proper\nterminology is today.\n\n265\n00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.250\nYou have a hot mess, right,\nand that's what you have.\n\n266\n00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.370\nYou don't have, in other words,\na holistic solution.\n\n267\n00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.850\nYou don't have a security eco system, what\nyou have is a bunch of garbage that may or\n\n268\n00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.490\nmay not be related to each other.\n\n269\n00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:00.280\nAnd as a result,\nit's not really very strong.\n\n270\n00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.340\nAnd the first strong attack that\ncomes across is probably gonna take\n\n271\n00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:05.780\nthat system away from you,\nthat's gonna be an issue.\n\n272\n00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:08.830\nSo when we think about countermeasure\nselection, what we have to think about is,\n\n273\n00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.620\nwhat are the things that are gonna make\ncountermeasures meaningful to us, right?\n\n274\n00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.500\nSo, if I say to Mike, Mike,\nyou've got a problem, right.\n\n275\n00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.490\nAnd we gotta figure out\nhow to solve that problem.\n\n276\n00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.230\nSo, we have to first identify the problem,\n\n277\n00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.050\nwe've walked through that\nexercise in a prior episode.\n\n278\n00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:25.530\nMike was kind enough to help me figure\nout how to do requirements analysis and\n\n279\n00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.250\nhe said, hey,\nmy problem is I wanna keep people\n\n280\n00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:33.078\nthat aren't authorized from seeing the\ncontent in the content library at ITProTV,\n\n281\n00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:35.560\ncuz we want the people that\nbelong there seeing it, but\n\n282\n00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.550\nwe don't want the people that\ndon't belong there seeing it.\n\n283\n00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:40.090\nOkay, no problem, we've got a requirement,\nwe understand that.\n\n284\n00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.410\nSo how are we going to prevent that\nfrom happening is the conversation.\n\n285\n00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.190\nCountermeasure selection is about\nthe things we will do in order to prevent\n\n286\n00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.200\nthe bad people that don't belong here\nfrom getting access to the system.\n\n287\n00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.461\nSo we talked about the fact\nwe may use a dual or\n\n288\n00:13:53.461 --> 00:13:55.960\nmulti factor authentication solution.\n\n289\n00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.900\nNot just a username and a password, but\n\n290\n00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.330\nwe will require people that\nare authorized to come in and\n\n291\n00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.840\nsee the content to have that but also\nuse some other form of authentication.\n\n292\n00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:09.530\nMaybe we will communicate with you out of\nband and send you a code of some kind,\n\n293\n00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:13.100\na pin that you have to then put into\nthe system along with your username.\n\n294\n00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.870\nA lot of banks,\nfinancial institutions do this today.\n\n295\n00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:20.050\nAs a use of dual factor authentication, so\nthat they can validate not just you, but\n\n296\n00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.160\nthe fact that you have a piece of\nknowledge that only you should have if\n\n297\n00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.500\nthey communicate with you.\n\n298\n00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.920\nAnd you have your email address or\n\n299\n00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.540\nyour phone number or\nwhatever on file ahead of time.\n\n300\n00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:32.810\nThen when we send it to you via SMS text,\nin theory its going to your number,\n\n301\n00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.870\nif your number hasn't been compromised.\n\n302\n00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:38.100\nYou may have the username as a bad actor,\nyou may have the password, but\n\n303\n00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.180\nif you don't have the pin\nyou can't get in.\n\n304\n00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.510\nMike's already scheming and thinking-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n305\n00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.179\n>> We should do that.\n\n306\n00:14:43.179 --> 00:14:44.930\nSo then we're going to start doing, right?\n\n307\n00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.870\nSo we may have dual factor authentication,\n\n308\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:49.410\nthat may be a good counter\nmeasure selection for us.\n\n309\n00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.559\nWe may also decide we wanna implement\nsomething known as biometrics.\n\n310\n00:14:52.559 --> 00:14:56.619\nWe may actually have everybody implement\nsome sort of a fingerprint scan, or\n\n311\n00:14:56.619 --> 00:15:01.360\na voice scan, or any number of things that\nwould involve something you are, right?\n\n312\n00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.590\nAnother factor of authentication,\nso we might do a retina scan or\n\n313\n00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.060\nan iris scan, who knows what.\n\n314\n00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.890\nPoint is, if we implement that,\nthat's gonna be even tougher for\n\n315\n00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.870\nsomebody to hack into and fool.\n\n316\n00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.020\nBecause they would have to have\na copy of your fingerprints.\n\n317\n00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.652\nOr if you ever saw the movie\nthe Minority Report, you would,\n\n318\n00:15:15.652 --> 00:15:17.159\nnot gonna go into graphic detail.\n\n319\n00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:18.466\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But just remember the baggy\n\n320\n00:15:18.466 --> 00:15:19.360\nepisode, right?\n\n321\n00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.310\nThat's the whole thing with the bag,\nright?\n\n322\n00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.970\nSo you would have the ability to be able\nto present yourself to somebody by being\n\n323\n00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.680\nable to effectively scam the system\ninto pretending that it's really you and\n\n324\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.800\nbelieving you, so you'd have to present\nsome sort of physical evidence that shows\n\n325\n00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.390\nthat you're really that person.\n\n326\n00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.303\nWhether it's an eyeball or a finger.\n\n327\n00:15:35.303 --> 00:15:36.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Whatever it is, you get the idea.\n\n328\n00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.000\nSo when we think about counter measures,\nright,\n\n329\n00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.510\nwe're thinking about the way in which\nwe want to offset the risk, right?\n\n330\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.620\nCome up with a plan,\na mechanism, a control,\n\n331\n00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:47.480\none or more, that's gonna help us\nto prevent the risk from occurring.\n\n332\n00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.307\nSo we wanna think about, when we\nthink about countermeasure selection,\n\n333\n00:15:50.307 --> 00:15:53.145\nwant to think about accountability,\nwant to think about auditability.\n\n334\n00:15:53.145 --> 00:15:55.557\nIs the countermeasure we're\ngonna choose auditable?\n\n335\n00:15:55.557 --> 00:15:59.077\nCan we look at it, can we measure it,\ncan we tell how good it is over time?\n\n336\n00:15:59.077 --> 00:16:02.244\nCuz we can't audit it, how do we know\nit's being implemented correctly?\n\n337\n00:16:02.244 --> 00:16:02.882\nThink about that.\n\n338\n00:16:02.882 --> 00:16:04.600\nThat could be an issue, right?\n\n339\n00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.690\nWhether we trust the source\nit's coming from or not.\n\n340\n00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.910\nSo if we say to everybody, hey,\nyou're gonna give us a fingerprint\n\n341\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.270\nas part of the application process and\nwe're gonna use that fingerprint,\n\n342\n00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:16.140\nstore it in the database, and\nthen when you become a member, you're\n\n343\n00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.840\ngonna have to provide that fingerprint\nthrough a fingerprint reader we send you.\n\n344\n00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.767\nRight?\n\n345\n00:16:20.767 --> 00:16:22.048\nFingerprint reader, 1995.\n\n346\n00:16:22.048 --> 00:16:23.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Only today.\n\n347\n00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.050\nSo if you have to provide\nthat scan in order to\n\n348\n00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.450\nvalidate your identity along with your\nusername and password, do we trust you?\n\n349\n00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:31.310\nWe have to establish that.\n\n350\n00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.810\nWhat level of trust do we have?\n\n351\n00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:33.970\nIs it cost effective for\n\n352\n00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:38.300\nus to send you fingerprint readers and for\nyou to provide a fingerprint scan to us?\n\n353\n00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.290\nProbably not very cost effective, right?\n\n354\n00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.140\nHow secure is it?\n\n355\n00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.740\nCan we manage the fingerprints?\n\n356\n00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.340\nCan you provide them securely, can we\nvalidate it's really you providing it,\n\n357\n00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.870\nnot somebody that's provided\nit on behalf of you?\n\n358\n00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.040\nNow these are all things that\nyou want to think about.\n\n359\n00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.530\nMy youngest one, my little daughter,\nso she has a new iPhone.\n\n360\n00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.780\nAnd the new iPhone has the fingerprint\nreader technology on it.\n\n361\n00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:01.000\nWhich is important,\nI guess, in some circles.\n\n362\n00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.230\nIn theory, for certain things.\n\n363\n00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:06.010\nI don't buy into the whole idea of\nconsumer electronics that have that\n\n364\n00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.370\nkind of authentication,\nI think that's just a gimmick and a waste.\n\n365\n00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:10.440\nBut you know, that's me.\n\n366\n00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.380\nI'm a Blackberry person.\n\n367\n00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.430\nSo take from that what you will.\n\n368\n00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.240\nBut having said that, she has\na fingerprint scanner on her phone.\n\n369\n00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.730\nSo she enabled it right,\nand we set it all up.\n\n370\n00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:20.750\nAnd she said, Daddy,\nlet me show you how this works.\n\n371\n00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.430\nWhich is important when you have\nthe twelve year old showing you\n\n372\n00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.770\nhow technology works.\n\n373\n00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.880\nAnd she got it right which\nwas even more impressive.\n\n374\n00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.680\nShe set it all up.\n\n375\n00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.880\nSo she turned it on,\nit was working for like a day.\n\n376\n00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.220\nComes to me the day after\nwe gave her the phone.\n\n377\n00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.160\nSays to me, hey by the way,\nit's not working any more.\n\n378\n00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.280\nWhat's wrong with it?\n\n379\n00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.840\nSo I now realized what I'm good for.\n\n380\n00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.285\nNot for setting things up, but\nfor fixing them when they break.\n\n381\n00:17:40.285 --> 00:17:40.860\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n382\n00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.170\nThis is what 30 years in\nIT security gets you.\n\n383\n00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.841\nThe ability to troubleshoot\nan iPhone when it breaks.\n\n384\n00:17:44.841 --> 00:17:47.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, she says hey it's not working.\n\n385\n00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.547\nWhy is it not working?\n\n386\n00:17:48.547 --> 00:17:49.847\nI said I don't know, I use Blackberries.\n\n387\n00:17:49.847 --> 00:17:52.080\nI don't use Apple so I don't know!\n\n388\n00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:52.926\nBut let's figure it out.\n\n389\n00:17:52.926 --> 00:17:56.610\nSo we looked and what we ultimately found\nis that it wasn't that it was not working,\n\n390\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.720\nit was that her uncle had turned it\noff doing something else to help her\n\n391\n00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.570\nsetup another feature in the phone and\nforgot to turn it back on or\n\n392\n00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:04.070\nforgot to tell her to turn it on.\n\n393\n00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:07.970\nAnd so the ability to use that was\nstill perfectly fine, it was intact,\n\n394\n00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.660\nit was working in the system, it just\nwas turned off for a period of time.\n\n395\n00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.270\nSometimes countermeasures\ncan be easy to disable.\n\n396\n00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.570\nAnd maybe that's not a good thing.\n\n397\n00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.520\nMaybe if you can turn it off\neasily when you're updating\n\n398\n00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.490\nsome other feature in the phone, then\nthat's not such a good countermeasure.\n\n399\n00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.770\nIt's not such a good\nauthentication mechanism.\n\n400\n00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:24.920\nIn her case,\nit really turned out to be not so\n\n401\n00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.940\ngood because she wasn't able to use it.\n\n402\n00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.140\nLuckily, she had her passcode and\n\n403\n00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.610\nwhatever other garbage they make\nyou use to log on to the phone.\n\n404\n00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.980\nAnyway, so we have all that.\n\n405\n00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.510\nSo does the control leave, or\nthe countermeasure, rather,\n\n406\n00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.090\nleave residual data behind?\n\n407\n00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:37.700\nImplementing a control or\n\n408\n00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.640\na countermeasure can actually lead to\nother exposure if we're not careful.\n\n409\n00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.580\nSo for instance, let's say that we\nuse a network-capable print device,\n\n410\n00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:47.850\none of those multifunctional\nin one devices.\n\n411\n00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.250\nSo we now send all of our data\nto the multifunction printer\n\n412\n00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.250\ninstead of the printer that was\nattached to our computer on the desk.\n\n413\n00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.460\nCuz that's now the new standard and\n\n414\n00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.220\nthat's what we do, well that's okay,\nnothing wrong with that.\n\n415\n00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.200\nWe get up, we get a little exercise, we\nwalk over to the printer, we have a chat,\n\n416\n00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:01.910\nwe get some coffee,\n\n417\n00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:06.060\nthat's all good but what happens with\nthe data that's sent to the device?\n\n418\n00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:09.030\nIs it stored there\nresidually after we print?\n\n419\n00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.990\nIn most cases in these devices today,\nthey have onboard hard drives.\n\n420\n00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:15.240\nThey will render that information,\nstore it in the hard drive and\n\n421\n00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.720\nthen we have to think about, as a security\nprofessional, whether we are encrypting\n\n422\n00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.420\nthat data or whether we are wiping it\nafter the transaction, and what about when\n\n423\n00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:26.190\nsomebody comes to maintain that device and\ntakes the drive out to put a new drive in?\n\n424\n00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.040\nThe vendor.\nWhat happens to all that data\n\n425\n00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.620\nthat's sitting on that drive?\n\n426\n00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.960\nThat may be confidential,\ncompany proprietary information\n\n427\n00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.690\nthat is stored encrypted in the file\nsystems where it's kept, but\n\n428\n00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:40.190\nnot store encrypted in the printer\nwhere we actually printed it.\n\n429\n00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.470\nThat could be a huge issue.\n\n430\n00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.000\nThese are things we have to think about.\n\n431\n00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.162\nResidual data can be a major,\nmajor problem for\n\n432\n00:19:45.162 --> 00:19:47.658\nus in terms of countermeasures and\nhow we select them.\n\n433\n00:19:47.658 --> 00:19:51.303\nThese are all things that unfortunately,\nor fortunately for us, if we think about\n\n434\n00:19:51.303 --> 00:19:55.018\nthem ahead of time, but unfortunately if\nwe don't, it could come back to haunt us.\n\n435\n00:19:55.018 --> 00:19:58.390\nAs CISSPs, we gotta master a lot of stuff.\n\n436\n00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.140\nWe gotta think about a lot of stuff.\n\n437\n00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.590\nEvery time somebody touches a system,\nevery time they do something, there's\n\n438\n00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.790\npotentially a liability, potentially\na risk associated with that action.\n\n439\n00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:10.660\nIt's our job to ensure that they\ncan do those things safely and\n\n440\n00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.810\nsecurely, providing confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability along the way.\n\n441\n00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.620\nBut if we're not up to that task,\nwe have a problem.\n\n442\n00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.460\nI often say to my students and\nmy customers when I talk with them\n\n443\n00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.680\nabout this and they ask me,\nhow do we get good at security?\n\n444\n00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.670\nThis is a conversation\nI have all the time.\n\n445\n00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:26.990\nHow do I get good at security?\n\n446\n00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.770\nWell, there's a long answer and\na short answer to that.\n\n447\n00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:34.580\nThe long answer involves you becoming,\nbasically a multi-year veteran of\n\n448\n00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.580\nthis environment and being able to master\nthose skills by doing them over time.\n\n449\n00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.300\nBut most people want the short anser,\nthe easy path, right?\n\n450\n00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.320\nAnd so what I say is, well if you don't\nwant that, then here's the other answer\n\n451\n00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.600\nthe short answer is, you've got to be\nable to be, this much better, right?\n\n452\n00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.998\nAnd what I'm showing is\nthat there's a very,\n\n453\n00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:52.712\nvery small space between\nmy two fingers right here.\n\n454\n00:20:52.712 --> 00:20:55.720\nThis much better than the person\nthat's coming to attack you.\n\n455\n00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.200\nAnd everyone says,\nthat's not hard, I can do that.\n\n456\n00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.340\nThat much better when they're attacking,\nI can do that, right, that's easy.\n\n457\n00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.060\nThat's all you do, right?\n\n458\n00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:03.930\nI mean, that's it?\n\n459\n00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.090\nYeah, I do a little bit more than that,\nhere's why.\n\n460\n00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.180\nBecause you gotta be this much better, but\n\n461\n00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:12.480\nthe trick is you gotta be\nthis much better 24/7.\n\n462\n00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.080\nRight?\n\n463\n00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.660\nNow it maybe easier to be this much\nbetter every so often, and get lucky.\n\n464\n00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.180\nRight?\n\n465\n00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.790\nBut if you're that lucky\nyou're not listening to this,\n\n466\n00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:22.620\nyou're out winning the lottery, and\nyou're living on an island somewhere, and\n\n467\n00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.080\nyou own a really big ship.\n\n468\n00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:24.810\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n469\n00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:25.670\n>> And you should hire me and\n\n470\n00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:26.810\nMike to come do security for you.\n\n471\n00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.210\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely.\n>> Because that's our dream.\n\n472\n00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.380\nWe want to go do that.\n\n473\n00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.030\nBut if you are not that person.\n\n474\n00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.158\nAnd most of us are not,\nthe exception of that guy.\n\n475\n00:21:34.158 --> 00:21:36.017\nYou heard about that guy\nwho won the lottery twice?\n\n476\n00:21:36.017 --> 00:21:36.829\n>> No, twice?\n\n477\n00:21:36.829 --> 00:21:38.082\n>> Twice.\n\n478\n00:21:38.082 --> 00:21:43.353\nSo not just twice, he won the lottery,\n30 minutes later won another lottery.\n\n479\n00:21:43.353 --> 00:21:44.026\n>> Holy cow.\n\n480\n00:21:44.026 --> 00:21:48.044\n>> Holy cow, that's the right thing we\nhave to say, this is a family environment,\n\n481\n00:21:48.044 --> 00:21:50.800\nright, family fun,\nfamily clean environment.\n\n482\n00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.840\nHe won the lottery twice\nwithin 30 minutes.\n\n483\n00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.710\nIf you're not that guy, I'm not that guy,\nif you're not that guy,\n\n484\n00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.080\nthen you want to make sure that you\ndon't use luck as your methodology for\n\n485\n00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.850\nmanaging risk is what I'm saying to you.\n\n486\n00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:04.880\nCuz the reality is most of\nus are not that lucky, and\n\n487\n00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.340\neven if we are,\nreality is at some point luck runs out.\n\n488\n00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.860\nIf our methodology for managing risk is\nI'm gonna use luck, I got news for you.\n\n489\n00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.320\nYou're not gonna be doing this very long.\n\n490\n00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.860\nThis is not a good career choice for you.\n\n491\n00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:21.130\nYou need to rethink your options and this\nmay not be a good solution for you, right.\n\n492\n00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:22.060\nAnd I know you know that.\n\n493\n00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.150\nI'm only being facetious.\n\n494\n00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.180\nMy point is,\n\n495\n00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:28.420\nwe've got a plan to be this much\nbetter than the people that attack us.\n\n496\n00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.040\nWe gotta work incredibly hard to do this.\n\n497\n00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.900\nBecause by doing this, they go and\nthey attack somebody else down the road.\n\n498\n00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.540\nThat sucks for them but guess what?\n\n499\n00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.805\nYou're not them.\n\n500\n00:22:37.805 --> 00:22:38.305\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n501\n00:22:38.305 --> 00:22:39.260\nIf they don't get it and\n\n502\n00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:42.150\nthey're not this good,\nthen that's bad for them.\n\n503\n00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:46.770\nTell them to come watch this show and tell\nthem to learn how to be this much better\n\n504\n00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.890\nand then it'll be somebody else's problem.\n\n505\n00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:49.490\nRight?\n\n506\n00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.700\nIf we all pay it forward,\n\n507\n00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.220\nin other words, we're only ultimately\ngoing to be a more secure place.\n\n508\n00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.630\nMike and I will start having to\ntalk about other stuff right?\n\n509\n00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:01.410\nI make a really good cup of espresso and\na really mean gin and tonic.\n\n510\n00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:02.795\nWe can talk about that some other time.\n\n511\n00:23:02.795 --> 00:23:03.350\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> All right so\n\n512\n00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.160\ncounter measure selections right.\n\n513\n00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.470\nThis is important stuff.\n\n514\n00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.700\nWhy is this important?\n\n515\n00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.410\nBecause if you don't know\nthe questions to ask,\n\n516\n00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:12.630\nif you don't understand how\nto measure the value and\n\n517\n00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.220\nunderstand the value of the counter\nmeasures you are implementing.\n\n518\n00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.830\nHow can you possibly tell me that\nthey're gonna be successful?\n\n519\n00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.320\nAnd more importantly,\nhow can you possibly tell me\n\n520\n00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.390\nthey're going to address the requirements\nI have to fix my security problems?\n\n521\n00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.720\nI don't know and neither do you,\nand that's the problem.\n\n522\n00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.150\nSo you gotta ask these questions,\nyou gotta understand what you're doing.\n\n523\n00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:30.270\nDesign considerations,\n\n524\n00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:34.300\nin other words for architecting\nsecure solutions are complicated.\n\n525\n00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:39.260\nYou gotta think about the entire system as\nwell as all the parts that make it up, yet\n\n526\n00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.370\nwe often say that the solution\nis not just the parts but\n\n527\n00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.220\nit's greater than the sum of the parts and\nthat's very true.\n\n528\n00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.005\nIt's especially true here.\n\n529\n00:23:47.005 --> 00:23:51.925\nSecurity is not about getting the firewall\nin place and putting in the denial rule.\n\n530\n00:23:51.925 --> 00:23:52.607\nThat's easy.\n\n531\n00:23:52.607 --> 00:23:54.348\nWhat about if I go around the firewall.\n\n532\n00:23:54.348 --> 00:23:57.600\nThen the firewall has absolutely no\nbearing on this conversation and\n\n533\n00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.177\nwhile it is denying everything.\n\n534\n00:23:59.177 --> 00:24:01.813\nI'm not putting anything through it,\nso it's got nothing to do.\n\n535\n00:24:01.813 --> 00:24:04.193\nIf I don't have another control\nmechanism somewhere else,\n\n536\n00:24:04.193 --> 00:24:07.120\nthat firewall's irrelevant,\nit's not helping me.\n\n537\n00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.800\nAnd if I use defense in depth and\nwe say, \"Okay Adam, but you told me so\n\n538\n00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.730\nI got the firewall but I also got\nthe IDS and the IPS and they're in line.\n\n539\n00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.080\nGreat, I'm gonna go\naround all three of them.\n\n540\n00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:16.400\nWhat do you got for me next\"?\n\n541\n00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.620\nThis is the conversation we're\ngonna talk about, right,?\n\n542\n00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.960\nAnd this is how it evolves.\n\n543\n00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.233\nFor everything we put in place as\na counter measure a determined hacker\n\n544\n00:24:23.233 --> 00:24:24.685\nhas a solution to bypass that.\n\n545\n00:24:24.685 --> 00:24:25.862\nThat's the problem, right?\n\n546\n00:24:25.862 --> 00:24:30.238\nThat's when I talk about being this\nmuch better why it's so tough.\n\n547\n00:24:30.238 --> 00:24:33.837\nBecause for every solution,\nwe counter measure.\n\n548\n00:24:33.837 --> 00:24:36.690\nThere's an equally effective\ncounter to the counter measure.\n\n549\n00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:40.350\nSomebody's that determined, they're\ngonna come take things away from you.\n\n550\n00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:41.750\nGood security professionals,\n\n551\n00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:46.080\nsmart people that become CISSPs that\nknow how to do this the right way.\n\n552\n00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.910\nUnderstand you have to\ninvest a lot of time and\n\n553\n00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:54.080\nenergy up front to ensure that you\nbuild as secure a solution as possible.\n\n554\n00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:58.260\nArchitecture is important, and\ngood architecture is paramount to success.\n\n555\n00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:01.490\nYou also need to understand that good\narchitecture only gets you so far.\n\n556\n00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.130\nAnd at the end of the day\nwhile the design is important,\n\n557\n00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:05.810\nthe design is not always\ngonna win the day.\n\n558\n00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.000\nLet me show a quick anecdote\nabout good and bad design.\n\n559\n00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.310\nSo without naming names there's\na very famous car manufacturer\n\n560\n00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.670\nsome of you may buy and\nused their products.\n\n561\n00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:19.050\nThey are the pinnacle of\nthe driving experience if you will.\n\n562\n00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:23.070\nSo that car manufacturer, along with other\ncar manufacturers to be fair enough,\n\n563\n00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:24.270\nnot just this one I'm thinking about.\n\n564\n00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.820\nBut the story happened\nto be about this one.\n\n565\n00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.660\nHave recently over the last\nseveral years with convergence and\n\n566\n00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.720\nthe idea of converging IP technology\ninto things like automobiles,\n\n567\n00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.150\nhave put USB ports into\ntheir cars to allow for\n\n568\n00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:42.170\nenhanced not only diagnostics to be run\non the car, but to IP enabled cars.\n\n569\n00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:46.320\nTesla for instance is IP enabling,\nwireless enabling their cars for\n\n570\n00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.830\nsoftware updates and\nfirmware and things like that.\n\n571\n00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:51.440\nMany of the car manufacturers\nat that end of the market are.\n\n572\n00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.300\nMercedes does, BMW does,\nthings like that are fairly common today.\n\n573\n00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:59.870\nSo this particular car manufacturer had a\nmaintenance port, a USB port installed on\n\n574\n00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:05.040\nthe inside of their cars that would allow\nfor you to plug in as a diagnostic tool.\n\n575\n00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.490\nA special tool that would run diagnostics\non the car, examine the whole system of\n\n576\n00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:12.055\nthe car including the, you ready for\nthis drum roll, security system.\n\n577\n00:26:12.055 --> 00:26:13.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> See where I'm going with this?\n\n578\n00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.520\nSo big huge couple of years ago.\n\n579\n00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.510\nBig huge rash of auto thefts started\nhappening in Europe because of the fact\n\n580\n00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:23.710\nthat somebody figured out that if\nthey could gain access to this port,\n\n581\n00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:27.390\nthey could disable the security systems\nin the car and drive the cars away.\n\n582\n00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:28.070\nSo what would they do?\n\n583\n00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:32.170\nGet a wire coat hanger or\nslim Jim, pop the lock on the car.\n\n584\n00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.400\nAll they had to do was insert a thumb\ndrive with a very specific piece of\n\n585\n00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.660\nmalware, and\na program that would execute and\n\n586\n00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.680\ndisable the security routines of the car.\n\n587\n00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.090\nNow I'm making it seem incredibly\nsimple there's more to it than that.\n\n588\n00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.300\nYou always have to know what\nyou're doing to do this but\n\n589\n00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:48.020\nthe point is, it obviously wasn't that\nhard because they stole a whole bunch of\n\n590\n00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:49.980\nthese cars in a very short amount of time.\n\n591\n00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.720\nSo sometimes good design with the best of\nintentions can actually not turn out well.\n\n592\n00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.590\nAnd there's no substitute for\ncommon sense as we often say.\n\n593\n00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.680\nAnd we talk about this\nwith regards to security.\n\n594\n00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.510\nWhen we think about securing and\nbuilding counter measures and\n\n595\n00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.790\nbeing able to deal with risk and\nall things we're talking about.\n\n596\n00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:10.020\nWe often talk about making sure that we\nsecure early and secure often meaning\n\n597\n00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.660\nfrom the very beginning of the process\nwith everything you're involved with.\n\n598\n00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.580\nAlways be thinking about\nwhat can we do better and\n\n599\n00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.510\ndifferently to make this\na more robust solution?\n\n600\n00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:20.910\nAnd if we test that and push\nthe boundaries of that thought process,\n\n601\n00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.900\nwe're going to find things\nthat don't make sense.\n\n602\n00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:26.470\nThe challenge for the CISSP is\nfeeling confident enough to challenge\n\n603\n00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.990\nthe assumptions in the business, and point\nout the fact that maybe some of the things\n\n604\n00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:34.230\nwe're doing are not really all that\nsensical, and maybe there is a better way.\n\n605\n00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.480\nAnd if we can do that and\nhave the dialogue about them, and\n\n606\n00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.800\nagain let me be clear.\n\n607\n00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.540\nIn positive terms, you don't walk in and\n\n608\n00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.580\nsay \"Hey,\nthis is stupid what are you doing\"?\n\n609\n00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.790\nBut you have to have a positive dialog\nabout the fact there may be a better way\n\n610\n00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:46.360\nto achieve the same end result.\n\n611\n00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.630\nAnd have we looked at or\ntried this or that.\n\n612\n00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.980\nIf we do that, I'm not suggesting\nevery time that dialog ends well, but\n\n613\n00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.390\nI'm suggesting that you have to be willing\nto push that dialog up to the upper levels\n\n614\n00:27:56.390 --> 00:28:00.740\nof the organization, to have that\ndialog exposed so we can identify risk.\n\n615\n00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.450\nAnd as a result of that,\ndeal with it in a proactive way.\n\n616\n00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.340\nThis becomes very important when\nwe're thinking of about all of these\n\n617\n00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.090\nconcerns that we have if you\nwill think about those things.\n\n618\n00:28:09.090 --> 00:28:12.660\nAnd think about what security actors and\ngood actors have to do.\n\n619\n00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.320\nSo think about this for just a moment.\n\n620\n00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:19.020\nThink about the biggest security problem\nyou currently face in the workplace today.\n\n621\n00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:22.300\nWhatever it is, physical, logical,\ndoesn't matter what it is.\n\n622\n00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:26.560\nIf it's a personal issue,\nif it's a software security issue,\n\n623\n00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.220\nif it's a hacking concern, take your pick.\n\n624\n00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.370\nI don't know what it is.\n\n625\n00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:33.390\nDoesn't really matter,\nwe're just asking what that is.\n\n626\n00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:36.500\nThink about then from that perspective\nif we have identified what that is,\n\n627\n00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.860\nwhat would be the most\nappropriate counter measure?\n\n628\n00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:43.210\nIf money was no object, if constraints\nwere not an issue, there were no politics,\n\n629\n00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.270\nthere was no culture of no you can't.\n\n630\n00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.850\nBut rather there was a culture\nof wow that may be a good idea.\n\n631\n00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.770\nLet's figure that out and\nsee if we can do that.\n\n632\n00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.350\nJust for a minute, hypothetically,\nwhat would that counter measure be?\n\n633\n00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.370\nWhat would you suggest?\n\n634\n00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:58.630\nI'm not saying that tomorrow morning you\nwalk into the organization you work for\n\n635\n00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:00.290\nand try to reinvent the world.\n\n636\n00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:04.460\nI'm just pointing out to you that when\nthere are no boundaries that you have that\n\n637\n00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:07.270\nare preconceived, and\nyou talk to people about issues and\n\n638\n00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:09.890\nconcerns, you have very\ndifferent outcomes.\n\n639\n00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:13.750\nAnd the answer may still be no, but I\npromise you that conversation goes a long\n\n640\n00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.490\nway towards fixing those issues,\neven if the immediate answer is not\n\n641\n00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:20.740\ngonna be positive,\nthan it does if it never happens.\n\n642\n00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:24.630\nAnd if you have that conversation as\nCISSP, it carries a lot of weight with\n\n643\n00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:27.130\nthe organization because you\nare the perceived expert.\n\n644\n00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:30.320\nYou're supposed to know that\nthis is a good or bad idea.\n\n645\n00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.120\nAnd if it's not the best way, you\nshould be prepared and let me be clear.\n\n646\n00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.460\nBe prepared with an alternative.\n\n647\n00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.810\nDon't simply just say,\nhey this is a problem.\n\n648\n00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:42.190\nAll right as my boss of many,\nmany years is fond of reminding me, right?\n\n649\n00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:45.120\nDon't come to me with problems, come to me\nwith an identification of the problem but\n\n650\n00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.080\nmost importantly offer me a solution.\n\n651\n00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:50.110\nAnd if you offer me a solution,\nthen we can have a dialog about whether or\n\n652\n00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.230\nnot we can change.\n\n653\n00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:54.590\nAnd this is really ultimately the most\nimportant opportunity for you to think\n\n654\n00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.960\nabout, with regards to risk, which is the\nopportunity to have the conversation about\n\n655\n00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.280\nwhat we can do differently to deal\nwith risk, within the organization.\n\n656\n00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:01.870\nRight?\n\n657\n00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:02.960\nVery important.\n\n658\n00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.880\n>> Very good.\nAll right Adam,\n\n659\n00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.380\nwell a lot of great stuff for\nus to think about, and a great in depth\n\n660\n00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:11.500\nlook at risk management and choosing\ncontrols, implementing those controls.\n\n661\n00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.680\nNot just implementing them, implementing\nthem if I can say that properly,\n\n662\n00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.530\nfantastic we thank you for that Adam.\n\n663\n00:30:17.530 --> 00:30:19.180\nRemember if you wanna check out Adam or\n\n664\n00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:21.950\nwant to attend one of his classes live\n>> That's me!\n\n665\n00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.950\n>> Shoot us an email,\nthat's right [LAUGH].\n\n666\n00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:28.600\nShoot him an email or\nshoot us an email at

--> 00:00:17.549\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:19.965\nAnd today, we're doing our CISSP.\n\n5\n00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:23.536\nAnd specifically, we're gonna\nbe looking at control types and\n\n6\n00:00:23.536 --> 00:00:28.312\npenetration testing methodologies and here\nto help us with that is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:28.312 --> 00:00:29.229\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.963\n>> It's going well, it's going well.\n\n9\n00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:34.863\nWe'll obviously, talk about both,\nbut methodology.\n\n10\n00:00:34.863 --> 00:00:35.769\nScary word.\n\n11\n00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:37.994\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll talk about what that is,\n\n12\n00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:41.214\nobviously make that as simple as\npossible and as painless as possible for\n\n13\n00:00:41.214 --> 00:00:43.024\nthose of you that need to understand it.\n\n14\n00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:45.183\nSo let's jump right in,\nlet's talk about controls a little bit.\n\n15\n00:00:45.183 --> 00:00:49.146\nSo what I thought we'd do, do something\na little bit different in the sense that\n\n16\n00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:53.067\nwe're gonna operate out of a list format\nhere for our conversation this time.\n\n17\n00:00:53.067 --> 00:00:56.015\nWe're gonna go to a list document,\nwe've got a bunch of bulleted items.\n\n18\n00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:57.094\nI wanna talk about them with you.\n\n19\n00:00:57.094 --> 00:00:59.404\nWe're gonna to put them in\ncontext as we often do,\n\n20\n00:00:59.404 --> 00:01:01.495\nMike's gonna help me to\ndo that a little bit.\n\n21\n00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:04.245\nAnd then as we get through\na little bit of this discussion,\n\n22\n00:01:04.245 --> 00:01:08.121\nwe're gonna jump over to a spreadsheet and\nshow you how this all comes together and\n\n23\n00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:10.479\ndemonstrate for\nyou what we can do with all this and\n\n24\n00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.819\nthen jump back into our list and\ntalk some more about some odds and end.\n\n25\n00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:16.817\nSo first thing we wanna talk\nabout is control types and\n\n26\n00:01:16.817 --> 00:01:20.494\nyou could see the number of controls\non the screen in front of you.\n\n27\n00:01:20.494 --> 00:01:23.397\nYou've got seven different\ncontrol types listed on the list.\n\n28\n00:01:23.397 --> 00:01:29.022\nWe've got different control elements or if\nyou wanna think of them as not categories,\n\n29\n00:01:29.022 --> 00:01:32.258\nbut different ways in which\ncontrols can be used or\n\n30\n00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:36.898\ndifferent types of controls that we\ncan see inside of an organization.\n\n31\n00:01:36.898 --> 00:01:39.689\nSo when we think about them,\nwe have in no particular order.\n\n32\n00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.102\nAgain, these are not a numbered list,\njust a list that we put together.\n\n33\n00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:46.500\nDirective, deterrent,\npreventive, compensating,\n\n34\n00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.404\ndetective as opposed to directive,\ncorrective and a recovery.\n\n35\n00:01:50.404 --> 00:01:52.849\nSo let's start with\na compensating control,\n\n36\n00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:55.430\njust randomly jumping in\nthe middle of the list.\n\n37\n00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.480\nLet's just talk about an example\nof the compensating control.\n\n38\n00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.173\nA compensating control is a control\nthat is designed to be in place, so\n\n39\n00:02:03.173 --> 00:02:05.321\nthat if another control fails,\n\n40\n00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:10.026\nthat control picks up the slack in\neffect and will offset the failure.\n\n41\n00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:15.923\nSo for instance, we have anti-lock\nbraking technology on cars today.\n\n42\n00:02:15.923 --> 00:02:18.294\nMost cars, almost without exception today,\n\n43\n00:02:18.294 --> 00:02:22.320\ncome with anti-lock brakes standard as\npart of just a normal way you buy a car.\n\n44\n00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.150\nBut in addition to anti-locking brakes,\nwhich are power assisted.\n\n45\n00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.131\nIf the brakes for\n\n46\n00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:31.921\nsome reason are augmented with\nan additional security system,\n\n47\n00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:36.976\nsome of the newer cars have anti-collision\ntechnology that will sense that there's\n\n48\n00:02:36.976 --> 00:02:41.396\nsomebody in front of you or somebody\nthat's stopping and comes to a stop and\n\n49\n00:02:41.396 --> 00:02:46.189\nwill brake the car for you even though you\nmay not be able to brake quickly enough.\n\n50\n00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.413\nAnd it will use the anti-lock\nbraking technology to be able to\n\n51\n00:02:49.413 --> 00:02:51.961\navoid the car skidding out or\nsliding sideways.\n\n52\n00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:54.283\nIt's really what anti-lock\nbraking technology does.\n\n53\n00:02:54.283 --> 00:02:56.837\nIt applies brake pressure\nin kind of an up and\n\n54\n00:02:56.837 --> 00:03:00.426\ndown motion to pump the brakes\nto prevent you from basically,\n\n55\n00:03:00.426 --> 00:03:05.068\nhard mashing the brakes or coming down on\nthem hard, so that the cars skids out.\n\n56\n00:03:05.068 --> 00:03:06.774\nOr effect, moves sideways.\n\n57\n00:03:06.774 --> 00:03:10.633\nAs a result of that, if the anti-lock\nbraking system were to fail,\n\n58\n00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:13.286\nthe anti-collision technology takes over.\n\n59\n00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:15.212\nAnd actually, it's a compensating control.\n\n60\n00:03:15.212 --> 00:03:17.369\nSo it brings the car to a stop,\nbut does so\n\n61\n00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:22.060\nperhaps not in as graceful a way as\nthe anti-locking braking technology would.\n\n62\n00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.219\nWe can see the idea of a compensated\ncontrol working in IT the same way.\n\n63\n00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:30.119\nDid we just deploy a firewall, for\ninstance, when we think about controls?\n\n64\n00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:34.230\nWe tend to deploy a firewall as\na mechanism of control that will prevent\n\n65\n00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.039\ninbound attacks from occurring, but we\nalso tend to then prevent attacks by using\n\n66\n00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:43.796\nanother system, either intrusion\ndetection or intrusion prevention system.\n\n67\n00:03:43.796 --> 00:03:48.291\nOr today, one is that a combination\nan IDPS system kind of a next generation,\n\n68\n00:03:48.291 --> 00:03:50.446\nwhich involves both technologies.\n\n69\n00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:54.329\nIntrusion detection is gonna be\npassive technology, it monitors and\n\n70\n00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.366\nalerts us, but\ndoesn't take an retaliatory action.\n\n71\n00:03:57.366 --> 00:04:00.896\nIntrusion prevention systems are active,\nthey monitor the alert.\n\n72\n00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:05.922\nBut they also can go out and reconfigure\na pathway, they can shut down a port.\n\n73\n00:04:05.922 --> 00:04:08.847\nThey can change an IP address,\nthey can do all sorts of other things.\n\n74\n00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:13.902\nSo as compensating controls by\nlining up both firewalls and\n\n75\n00:04:13.902 --> 00:04:16.637\nIDS or IPS systems side by side.\n\n76\n00:04:16.637 --> 00:04:19.818\nIf one were to fail, the other in\ntheory could take up the slack.\n\n77\n00:04:19.818 --> 00:04:22.650\nAnd therefore, hopefully,\nstill prevent the attack from occurring.\n\n78\n00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.787\nSo this is one example of a control type.\n\n79\n00:04:24.787 --> 00:04:27.689\nA directive control is a policy control.\n\n80\n00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:31.208\nSome sort of a control that says, hey,\ngo do this and do it this way for\n\n81\n00:04:31.208 --> 00:04:32.077\nthese reasons.\n\n82\n00:04:32.077 --> 00:04:33.889\nThat's what a directive control would be.\n\n83\n00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.036\nSo if a policy says,\n\n84\n00:04:35.036 --> 00:04:39.764\nwe only allow external access remotely\ninbound from outside through a VPN tunnel,\n\n85\n00:04:39.764 --> 00:04:44.492\nthen a directive control would implement\nor would indicate that you must implement\n\n86\n00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:48.028\na VPN tunnel in order to be able\nto access the system securely.\n\n87\n00:04:48.028 --> 00:04:50.247\nIt's an example of a directive control.\n\n88\n00:04:50.247 --> 00:04:53.707\nA deterrent control,\nsomething that is supposed to not prevent,\n\n89\n00:04:53.707 --> 00:04:56.260\nbecause we do talk about\npreventative control.\n\n90\n00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.520\nThese are small differences between\nthe two, but very important and subtle.\n\n91\n00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.373\nA deterrence control is\nsomething that should deter.\n\n92\n00:05:03.373 --> 00:05:06.019\nYou could say that well,\nis it deterrence like prevention?\n\n93\n00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:08.574\nAnd yes, we're splitting\nhairs cuz it is very similar.\n\n94\n00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:09.888\nBut if wanna deter you,\n\n95\n00:05:09.888 --> 00:05:13.119\nI'm going to encourage you\nstrongly not to do something.\n\n96\n00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:14.743\nAnd hopefully, you will get the message.\n\n97\n00:05:14.743 --> 00:05:19.030\nIf you don't get the message, I'm gonna\npull out the big guns and prevent you.\n\n98\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.433\nSo deterrence may be putting up\na sign that says, hey, smile,\n\n99\n00:05:22.433 --> 00:05:25.336\nyou're on camera,\nbecause we're monitoring you.\n\n100\n00:05:25.336 --> 00:05:29.435\nThat would be a deterrence or\nsome sort of a deterrent control.\n\n101\n00:05:29.435 --> 00:05:32.648\nA preventative control\nwould actually be having\n\n102\n00:05:32.648 --> 00:05:37.503\nthe camera in plain view using with or\nalong with the sign in combination,\n\n103\n00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:42.778\nbecause the preventative control may act\nto prevent you from doing something.\n\n104\n00:05:42.778 --> 00:05:47.121\nIf you know there's a camera there staring\nyou in the face, you're a lot less likely,\n\n105\n00:05:47.121 --> 00:05:50.572\npotentially anyway, a lot less likely\nto engage in some sort of bad or\n\n106\n00:05:50.572 --> 00:05:51.787\nsuspicious behavior.\n\n107\n00:05:51.787 --> 00:05:54.473\nIt could also be that maybe\nwe put a lock on something,\n\n108\n00:05:54.473 --> 00:05:57.519\nphysically locking it down so\nyou can't walk away with it and\n\n109\n00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:00.285\nthe preventative control\nwould be the use of the lock.\n\n110\n00:06:00.285 --> 00:06:03.903\nWhereas a deterrent control may be,\nyou could actually think of the camera\n\n111\n00:06:03.903 --> 00:06:06.265\npotentially being\na deterrent control as well.\n\n112\n00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:10.107\nSome people think well, isn't the camera\na deterrent preventative measure?\n\n113\n00:06:10.107 --> 00:06:12.405\nAbsolutely, you could\ncategorize it either way.\n\n114\n00:06:12.405 --> 00:06:16.044\nBut the point is you wanna make the\ndifference clear, make it apparent that\n\n115\n00:06:16.044 --> 00:06:19.882\ndeterrent controls and preventative\ncontrols have different focal points.\n\n116\n00:06:19.882 --> 00:06:21.682\nWe've talked about\ncompensating controls already.\n\n117\n00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:23.202\nWhat about a detective control?\n\n118\n00:06:23.202 --> 00:06:27.462\nWell, I mentioned an IDS and an IPS as\nbeing examples of detective controls.\n\n119\n00:06:27.462 --> 00:06:31.515\nAn IDS is a detective control,\nit finds suspicious behavior and\n\n120\n00:06:31.515 --> 00:06:32.872\nwill then alert you.\n\n121\n00:06:32.872 --> 00:06:36.806\nA corrective control could be something\nthat is done when we find suspicious\n\n122\n00:06:36.806 --> 00:06:37.424\nbehavior.\n\n123\n00:06:37.424 --> 00:06:40.279\nSo, an IPS may be an example\nof a corrective control,\n\n124\n00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:44.088\none that will effectively take action\nto correct some sort of attack and\n\n125\n00:06:44.088 --> 00:06:46.512\nprevent it, ultimately, from occurring.\n\n126\n00:06:46.512 --> 00:06:49.567\nCould be classified in different\nways in different areas.\n\n127\n00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:53.328\nA recovery control is something\nthat we implement to fix a problem.\n\n128\n00:06:53.328 --> 00:06:56.163\nIf we can run a script that\nwill restore function,\n\n129\n00:06:56.163 --> 00:07:00.363\nthat can be seen as a recovery control or\nat least one element of it anyway.\n\n130\n00:07:00.363 --> 00:07:04.670\nSo there's different ways to effectively\nspecify what the control types are.\n\n131\n00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.490\nUltimately, what we wanna do\nis have a working example.\n\n132\n00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.104\nIn our mind,\nkind of an idea of what those are.\n\n133\n00:07:10.104 --> 00:07:14.536\nNow before we go to a little practical way\nof showing you what that working example\n\n134\n00:07:14.536 --> 00:07:17.743\nmay be, got a little surprise\nthat Mike cooked up for you.\n\n135\n00:07:17.743 --> 00:07:19.864\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Before we get to that and by the way,\n\n136\n00:07:19.864 --> 00:07:23.860\nafter we show it you, you all better write\nin and tell Mike how awesome it was,\n\n137\n00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.526\ncuz he spent all night\nworking on this just for you.\n\n138\n00:07:26.526 --> 00:07:27.525\n>> That's right.\n\n139\n00:07:27.525 --> 00:07:29.313\n>> Because you're special.\n\n140\n00:07:29.313 --> 00:07:30.706\nSo we're gonna show that\nto you in just a minute.\n\n141\n00:07:30.706 --> 00:07:33.307\nBut before we do, let's just move down\nthe list to the next discussion item.\n\n142\n00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:36.072\nWhat we want to see\nare the control categories,\n\n143\n00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:40.084\nbecause control categories are also\ngonna be very important because\n\n144\n00:07:40.084 --> 00:07:43.059\nwe want to understand what\nkinds of controls we have\n\n145\n00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:48.100\nby grouping them together in large\ncategories, large containers, if you will.\n\n146\n00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.612\nSo we have three broad categories,\nphysical, administrative and\n\n147\n00:07:50.612 --> 00:07:51.944\nwhat we call logical or technical.\n\n148\n00:07:51.944 --> 00:07:54.940\nPhysical controls covers\na very broad spectrum.\n\n149\n00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.278\nThese will be things that we apply to\na system to prevent something from\n\n150\n00:07:58.278 --> 00:07:58.909\nhappening.\n\n151\n00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:03.216\nSo for instance, we could say that\na door that's locking a room, that keeps\n\n152\n00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:08.020\ninformation behind it secure, is\nan example of a physical control category.\n\n153\n00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:11.900\nDoor, locks, windows, guards, right?\n\n154\n00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.540\nDogs, fences.\n\n155\n00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:17.640\nThese are all examples of physical\ncontrols that may exist in that category,\n\n156\n00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.340\nor examples of kinds of controls it\nwould be in that particular category.\n\n157\n00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.580\nAdministrative controls.\n\n158\n00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.150\nI mentioned this when we talked\nabout a directive control type, and\n\n159\n00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.500\nI said a policy would\nbe one example of that.\n\n160\n00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:33.730\nSo things like policies and procedures,\nthings like privilege management,\n\n161\n00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.690\nthings like monitoring, are all gonna\nbe examples of administrative controls\n\n162\n00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.110\nthat may fall into that category.\n\n163\n00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.780\nAnd then logical and or technical, you\noften hear them referred to either way.\n\n164\n00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:47.250\nControls, things that are focusing\non how we access something,\n\n165\n00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.840\nso remote access controls, cryptography.\n\n166\n00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.170\nApplying cryptography to a solution\nto create confidentiality and\n\n167\n00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.610\nintegrity capabilities would be an example\nof a logical or a technical control.\n\n168\n00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.700\nApplication access, malware control.\n\n169\n00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.840\nThese are all examples of logical or\ntechnical, excuse me,\n\n170\n00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.340\ncontrol areas or\nexamples of them in that category.\n\n171\n00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.510\nSo, when we stitch these two together,\nthe control types and the categories,\n\n172\n00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.270\nwe'll have to give you a way of\nunderstanding how to marry these two.\n\n173\n00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:17.412\nAnd so, what we thought we would do for\nyou is throw up a little spreadsheet and\n\n174\n00:09:17.412 --> 00:09:18.511\ntake a look at this.\n\n175\n00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:22.571\nAnd what we're gonna wanna do is, if we\ncould perhaps move the picture out of\n\n176\n00:09:22.571 --> 00:09:25.941\nthe way, and therefore we could\nzoom in a little more clearer.\n\n177\n00:09:25.941 --> 00:09:26.760\nThat's gonna be a lot better.\n\n178\n00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.644\nThank you very much.\n\n179\n00:09:27.644 --> 00:09:30.291\nAnd we could zoom in and\nwe could see how to read this.\n\n180\n00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:33.360\nAnd I know it's hard to see because, by\nzooming in to make it a little more clear\n\n181\n00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.848\nfor you, you can't see the whole\nspreadsheet so bear with us.\n\n182\n00:09:35.848 --> 00:09:38.890\nWhat we're gonna do is just show you\nhow to read this really quickly.\n\n183\n00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.593\nYou can see that we have\na listing in the first column,\n\n184\n00:09:41.593 --> 00:09:43.226\nin A, of all the control types.\n\n185\n00:09:43.226 --> 00:09:47.910\nThings like locks, cameras, security\nofficers, there's a whole bunch of them.\n\n186\n00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.070\nWe can scroll down, but\nyou'll get the idea.\n\n187\n00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.028\nAnd we are gonna make this available for\ndownload are we not?\n\n188\n00:09:52.028 --> 00:09:52.680\n>> Absolutely.\n\n189\n00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.399\n>> Okay, so you will be able to\ndownload this spreadsheet and\n\n190\n00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:58.500\nuse it on your own is a study aide and\na guide to help you study.\n\n191\n00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.940\nSo for now, just trust us.\n\n192\n00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.274\nThere's a list of 30 some\nodd controls there, so\n\n193\n00:10:02.274 --> 00:10:04.238\nwe're only gonna focus\non a few at the top.\n\n194\n00:10:04.238 --> 00:10:07.629\nSo you can see that as we move\nover into column B, C, and D,\n\n195\n00:10:07.629 --> 00:10:12.470\nwe have our Physical, Technical, and\nAdministrative control categories.\n\n196\n00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.358\nSo we can pick a category first for\nthe control.\n\n197\n00:10:15.358 --> 00:10:19.885\nSo see the first nine of them or so\nare going to be all physical controls or\n\n198\n00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:22.603\nelements of a physical control category,\n\n199\n00:10:22.603 --> 00:10:26.241\nfollowed by a group that's\ngonna fall into our next one.\n\n200\n00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:27.909\nAnd then as we scroll down further,\n\n201\n00:10:27.909 --> 00:10:30.670\nwe have a group that falls\ninto our last area there.\n\n202\n00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.750\nSo as we look, and we can see that\nwe've broken them out for you so\n\n203\n00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.320\nyou could see examples of\neach control category.\n\n204\n00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.240\nTechnical, Administrative and Physical.\n\n205\n00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.270\nThen as we scroll over towards the right,\n\n206\n00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.220\nwhat we're gonna see\nare the control types.\n\n207\n00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.630\nSo you're gonna see Preventative,\nDetective, Corrective, Deterrent,\n\n208\n00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.159\nRecovery.\n\n209\n00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:51.115\nWe're gonna list those, and we're gonna\nput a check mark there to indicate that\n\n210\n00:10:51.115 --> 00:10:53.900\na control is of a certain category and\nof a certain type.\n\n211\n00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.227\nSo if we scroll across back\nto the front part there.\n\n212\n00:10:57.227 --> 00:10:59.713\nAnd let's just take a motion detector, A7,\n\n213\n00:10:59.713 --> 00:11:02.337\nI feel like we're playing battleship,\nright?\n\n214\n00:11:02.337 --> 00:11:03.123\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n215\n00:11:03.123 --> 00:11:07.020\nA7, so it's clearly gonna fall\ninto the Physical category.\n\n216\n00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.690\nSo motion detector a physical control, but\n\n217\n00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:12.230\nnotice it is classified\nas a Detective type.\n\n218\n00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.210\nBecause a motion detector\nis gonna detect motion.\n\n219\n00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.597\nHence the name motion detector.\n\n220\n00:11:16.597 --> 00:11:17.103\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n221\n00:11:17.103 --> 00:11:21.049\nit's gonna be a Detective control type,\nbut it's gonna fall into,\n\n222\n00:11:21.049 --> 00:11:23.102\nas you can see up at the top, right?\n\n223\n00:11:23.102 --> 00:11:26.020\nIt's gonna be a Physical\ncategory of control.\n\n224\n00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.260\nSo, you wanna be able to understand\nhow to marry these two together.\n\n225\n00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.515\nKinda be able to use a spreadsheet\nlike this, to help us study,\n\n226\n00:11:32.515 --> 00:11:35.695\nto make sure we understand the control\ncategories and control types, and\n\n227\n00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.145\nhow the two map together.\n\n228\n00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:38.615\nSo hopefully this will be valuable for\n\n229\n00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.490\nyou, we thought this would be a good way\nof presenting the information to you,\n\n230\n00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.640\nhopefully giving you\na sense of how to use this.\n\n231\n00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.970\nEncourage you to think about downloading\nthe spreadsheet as you watch the episode,\n\n232\n00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:50.950\nwhen you get done, make a note there and\njust go back at some point.\n\n233\n00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.910\nUse the download URL\nthat's available to you,\n\n234\n00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.850\nand make sure that you're\nable to go grab that.\n\n235\n00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.440\nThat'll be very beneficial for you.\n\n236\n00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.350\nAll right, very good.\n\n237\n00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.116\nSo remember, kudos to Mike, right?\n\n238\n00:11:59.116 --> 00:11:59.863\nYay.\n[APPLAUSE]\n\n239\n00:11:59.863 --> 00:12:01.000\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n240\n00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.020\n>> Mike was able to put\n\n241\n00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:02.700\nthat together for us.\n\n242\n00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.968\nSo I wanna thank him for\nthat time and attention and effort.\n\n243\n00:12:04.968 --> 00:12:06.280\nAll right, so-\n>> It was tricky.\n\n244\n00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:06.910\n>> It was tricky, right.\n\n245\n00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:10.116\nMike spent hours trying to figure out\nwhat is a column and what is a row.\n\n246\n00:12:10.116 --> 00:12:11.307\n>> That's right.\n[LAUGH] >> Once we got through that,\n\n247\n00:12:11.307 --> 00:12:12.257\nit actually went very quickly.\n\n248\n00:12:12.257 --> 00:12:14.072\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so Excel 101.\n\n249\n00:12:14.072 --> 00:12:15.746\nWe do have that class coming\nup in case you need that.\n\n250\n00:12:15.746 --> 00:12:16.999\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Feel free to join Mike in that\n\n251\n00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:18.162\ntraining, it will be valuable for\nyou as well.\n\n252\n00:12:18.162 --> 00:12:19.327\n>> I will be there.\n[LAUGH]\n\n253\n00:12:19.327 --> 00:12:19.935\n>> All right, so\n\n254\n00:12:19.935 --> 00:12:22.830\nlet's get back to our Word document,\nand let's take a look.\n\n255\n00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.190\nSo we do have control categories,\nso we've been through that.\n\n256\n00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.970\nSo what do we have up next?\n\n257\n00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.700\nWe have our steps for\nvulnerability assessment.\n\n258\n00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.976\nSo, one of the things that we have to\ndo now that we thought about controls,\n\n259\n00:12:30.976 --> 00:12:32.493\nhow to put them together, right?\n\n260\n00:12:32.493 --> 00:12:37.370\nHow to classify them, what the categories\nare, is we got that part of the puzzle.\n\n261\n00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:40.220\nSo we theoretically have\nprotection in place.\n\n262\n00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.140\nSo that's good.\n\n263\n00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.920\nBut now what we have to do is look at\nhow well that protection is working,\n\n264\n00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:49.150\nbecause if we don't figure out ultimately\nwhat we are capable of doing by\n\n265\n00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:53.470\ntesting to make sure that what we assume\nis happening, is actually happening.\n\n266\n00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.550\nWe know that in theory, it sounds good.\n\n267\n00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.500\nWe've got that control,\nit should be working.\n\n268\n00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:58.620\nBut is it really?\n\n269\n00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.520\nThis is where vulnerability\nassessment comes in.\n\n270\n00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.469\nThis is where we can do the trust but\n\n271\n00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:05.033\ntrust but\nverify portion of our discussion.\n\n272\n00:13:05.033 --> 00:13:08.549\nBecause by assessing and\nlooking at the systems and the controls,\n\n273\n00:13:08.549 --> 00:13:12.378\nwe can decide whether or not that\nvulnerability that we are attempting to\n\n274\n00:13:12.378 --> 00:13:15.540\nmitigate, to minimize the risk,\nthat we are minimizing.\n\n275\n00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:17.573\nCuz remember, vulnerability is a weakness.\n\n276\n00:13:17.573 --> 00:13:20.907\nAnd that weakness that we are looking\nto deal with through the application\n\n277\n00:13:20.907 --> 00:13:23.170\nof control has to be\ndealt with appropriately.\n\n278\n00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:25.490\nWe have to actually\nminimize that weakness,\n\n279\n00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.292\nhopefully to the point that it no\nlonger proves to be a challenge for us.\n\n280\n00:13:28.292 --> 00:13:30.670\nAnd so vulnerability assessment\nhelps us to do that.\n\n281\n00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.640\nThe steps involved with\nvulnerability assessment.\n\n282\n00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.210\nThree of them on the screen\nin front of you.\n\n283\n00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.940\nVulnerability scanning,\nwanna scan for vulnerabilities.\n\n284\n00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:38.390\nNow how do we do that, you might say.\n\n285\n00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.310\nWell that's a great question.\n\n286\n00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:40.250\nThank you for asking.\n\n287\n00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I love audience participation.\n\n288\n00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.920\nThis is awesome.\n\n289\n00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:43.572\nYou guys ask great questions.\n\n290\n00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:45.440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Outstanding.\n\n291\n00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.770\nSo, how do we do that?\n\n292\n00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:48.629\nWell, there's software out\nthere we can use, right?\n\n293\n00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:51.430\nAnd you may or may not have\nheard of some of these programs.\n\n294\n00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.260\nWe can use something like NMAP,\n\n295\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.600\nwhich is a Linux tool that allows us\nto be able to do this kind of scanning.\n\n296\n00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.360\nYou may use Winmap or\nZenmap which is the various\n\n297\n00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.420\nWindows based ports of NMAP\nthat have occurred over time.\n\n298\n00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.880\nSo you can use one of those tools.\n\n299\n00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:10.343\nYou may go in and you may decide to\ndownload a more robust tool, because NMAP,\n\n300\n00:14:10.343 --> 00:14:12.005\nor Zenmap are free, right?\n\n301\n00:14:12.005 --> 00:14:13.121\nYou don't really have to pay money for\nthem.\n\n302\n00:14:13.121 --> 00:14:16.150\nYou can just download them, but remember,\nyou get what you pay for, [LAUGH] right?\n\n303\n00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.250\nSo they may not be as full featured as\nsome of the vulnerabilities assessment\n\n304\n00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:20.600\npackages that are out there.\n\n305\n00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.710\nSo you may go out and\nbuy one from a big vendor and use that.\n\n306\n00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:27.800\nYou may use your own capabilities or\nwrite scripts that would go out and\n\n307\n00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.520\ndo certain things.\n\n308\n00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.330\nYou can use your own knowledge for\nthat end.\n\n309\n00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.015\nYou may have heard of a tool, a framework\ncalled the Metasploit framework, and\n\n310\n00:14:34.015 --> 00:14:36.000\nyou may or\nmay not know what Metasploit is.\n\n311\n00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.400\nIf you don't, go out and Google it and\nyou can certainly find out about it.\n\n312\n00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.345\nVery, very important caution and\nwarning, and\n\n313\n00:14:41.345 --> 00:14:43.061\nI'm not actually kidding about this now.\n\n314\n00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:46.270\nWhen I say there's something very serious\nabout this particular disclaimer.\n\n315\n00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:50.192\nSo Metasploit as a tool can get\nyou into a lot of trouble and\n\n316\n00:14:50.192 --> 00:14:52.905\npotentially can cause a lot of damage.\n\n317\n00:14:52.905 --> 00:14:55.760\nAnd I'm being very serious,\nI'm really not kidding around about this.\n\n318\n00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.509\nSo, when we talk about tools like this,\nright?\n\n319\n00:14:58.509 --> 00:15:00.340\nWe're giving you knowledge.\n\n320\n00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.800\nWe're giving you information.\n\n321\n00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.447\nWe are not suggesting in anyway,\nshape or form that you should go out and\n\n322\n00:15:06.447 --> 00:15:10.179\nuse this tool and\nfigure out how to use it on a live system.\n\n323\n00:15:10.179 --> 00:15:12.780\nWhat we're simply saying is these are\ntools that professionals will tend to use.\n\n324\n00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.050\nIf you want to become that\nkind of a professional,\n\n325\n00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.080\nthere definitely is training and\nknowledge available for you to do so.\n\n326\n00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.350\nBut you don't wanna use that tool in\nproduction unless you understand what it's\n\n327\n00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.420\ncapable of.\n\n328\n00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:26.061\nMetasploit can be used for good,\nit can also be used for hacking.\n\n329\n00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:27.824\nYou have to be very careful\nwith a tool like that or\n\n330\n00:15:27.824 --> 00:15:31.250\nyou could really do a lot damage without\nunderstanding what you're doing, right?\n\n331\n00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:32.850\nSo just be aware of that, right?\n\n332\n00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.991\nNow back to the fun and games,\npart of our discussion.\n\n333\n00:15:34.991 --> 00:15:37.155\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So tools like Metasploit are good for\n\n334\n00:15:37.155 --> 00:15:39.130\npotentially vulnerability scanning.\n\n335\n00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.350\nIn the right hands they\ncan be very valuable.\n\n336\n00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.120\nSo scanning for\n\n337\n00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:45.430\nvulnerabilities could involve something\nas simple as port scanning, right?\n\n338\n00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:46.314\nLooking for open ports.\n\n339\n00:15:46.314 --> 00:15:48.881\nYou may use something like\nAngry IP Scanner, which is\n\n340\n00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:52.547\njust a free tool that you can download\noff the Internet to look at open ports.\n\n341\n00:15:52.547 --> 00:15:55.154\nAnd then when you've done that,\nyou can then see what kind of services\n\n342\n00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:57.110\nare running, and\nthat may then tell you something.\n\n343\n00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.720\nWe'll tell you certain vulnerabilities\nare potentially inherent in that system.\n\n344\n00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.923\nSo, doesn't have to be complicated.\n\n345\n00:16:01.923 --> 00:16:05.780\nIt can be very easy as a matter of\nfact to do this kind of stuff, right.\n\n346\n00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:10.690\nAnalysis, looking at the data that we\nget back, what kind of data do we see?\n\n347\n00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:11.700\nDo we see open parts?\n\n348\n00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.310\nAre we running certain services?\n\n349\n00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.400\nDo we have a web server?\n\n350\n00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.960\nIf so, what kind of web server?\n\n351\n00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.240\nIf it is a Linux or Unix based web server,\nso if it's running,\n\n352\n00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.020\non say, a Linux based platform.\n\n353\n00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.700\nIf it is going to be an Apache web server,\nthere may be certain vulnerabilities that\n\n354\n00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.780\nwe may find that based on the build\nof that web server may or\n\n355\n00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.240\nmay not be inherent in\nthat particular system.\n\n356\n00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.600\nIs it a Microsoft IAS web server?\n\n357\n00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.030\nReplete with vulnerabilities, as well.\n\n358\n00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.340\nAnd we may find that there's more\nthan one way to attack that system.\n\n359\n00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.698\nSo something as simple\nas just an open scan or\n\n360\n00:16:39.698 --> 00:16:41.558\nan open port scan may tell us that.\n\n361\n00:16:41.558 --> 00:16:46.284\nAnd will talk about scan types later, will\ntalk about FIN, and Xmas, and NULL, and\n\n362\n00:16:46.284 --> 00:16:49.825\nthose kind of scans as old school\nlike OG kind of scans, right.\n\n363\n00:16:49.825 --> 00:16:52.365\n[COUGH] So we'll think about those\nthings and think about what they are and\n\n364\n00:16:52.365 --> 00:16:53.305\ntalk about them.\n\n365\n00:16:53.305 --> 00:16:56.600\nWe'll talk about attacks like Smurf and\nFraggle attacks and\n\n366\n00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.838\nyou have to know the difference\nbetween the two, right.\n\n367\n00:16:58.838 --> 00:17:02.700\nWe'll talk about Masquerading attacks and\nSpoofing attacks, and\n\n368\n00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:05.230\nman in the middle attacks, and\nall these things that can go wrong.\n\n369\n00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.680\nA lot of them are predicated on\nvulnerabilities that exist in systems,\n\n370\n00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.920\neither logical vulnerabilities from\na policy and performance perspective.\n\n371\n00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.250\nSomebody socially engineers a username and\na password out of somebody.\n\n372\n00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.580\nThey can masquerade or\nspoof the credential, or\n\n373\n00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.570\nthey don't configure the system\nthe right way or patch it the right way.\n\n374\n00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:25.440\nAnd they're liable to be vulnerable to\na Smurf attack, or Fraggle attack, or\n\n375\n00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.030\nsomething like that, and then we\nobviously have problems as a result.\n\n376\n00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.900\nSo we have to analyze the data we see.\n\n377\n00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.810\nNow we have to communicate\nwhat those results are.\n\n378\n00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:38.760\nWe have to walk through by kind of a\ndevolving the information we've uncovered.\n\n379\n00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.620\nAnd analyzing and breaking it down so\n\n380\n00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.410\nthat the people on the other end of this\ncommunication can understand what they\n\n381\n00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:45.940\nneed to do in order to\nsafeguard the system.\n\n382\n00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.400\nRemember, we wanna be typically be\ntalking to senior decision makers, right.\n\n383\n00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.040\nMore senior people in the business.\n\n384\n00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.750\nWhen I talk to senior decision makers,\nwhile I may want them to have a sense of\n\n385\n00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.230\nthe vulnerabilities and\nthe kind of attacks.\n\n386\n00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.220\nI'm not gonna give them the technical\ndetails of what a Fraggle or\n\n387\n00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.140\nSmurf attack is.\n\n388\n00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:07.306\nAnd the subtle but important difference\nwhich is the carrier protocol being used,\n\n389\n00:18:07.306 --> 00:18:11.365\nthe TCP versus UDP, conversation about\nhow they attack is carried out, right.\n\n390\n00:18:11.365 --> 00:18:14.509\nBoth of them are effectively\nmalformed packet attacks, but\n\n391\n00:18:14.509 --> 00:18:18.390\nthe difference is whether we use TCP or\nUDP to carry out the attack.\n\n392\n00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.726\nI'm not gonna talk to them\nabout the subtle difference,\n\n393\n00:18:20.726 --> 00:18:21.942\nit's not important to them,\n\n394\n00:18:21.942 --> 00:18:25.121\nthis is kind of the [SOUND] right over\nthe head conversation, I've lost them.\n\n395\n00:18:25.121 --> 00:18:28.308\nInstead, what I'm gonna present to them\nis the idea that there are weaknesses\n\n396\n00:18:28.308 --> 00:18:30.090\ninherent in their architecture.\n\n397\n00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.660\nAnd with proper investment,\nproper guidance,\n\n398\n00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.620\nand proper focus, the organization\ncan overcome those weaknesses.\n\n399\n00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.613\nThey have to help me to figure out\nwhat the best path is to do that.\n\n400\n00:18:39.613 --> 00:18:43.067\nAnd what they're willing to do in\norder to overcome those weaknesses,\n\n401\n00:18:43.067 --> 00:18:46.060\nis a conversation about need\nversus ultimately investment,\n\n402\n00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.790\nto offset that concern.\n\n403\n00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.840\nBut getting them bogged down in\nthe details, I've lost them.\n\n404\n00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.840\nThey're not gonna invest in anything,\nthey're onto the next conversation.\n\n405\n00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.790\nThey don't understand me and they don't\nknow why I'm talking to them, right?\n\n406\n00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.910\nAnd so that's gonna be something\nyou have to be aware of and\n\n407\n00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.000\nthink about when you deal with\nvulnerability assessments.\n\n408\n00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.610\nVery, very important, right?\n\n409\n00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:03.820\nSo vulnerability assessments.\n\n410\n00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.950\nMike, have we done any\nvulnerability assessments?\n\n411\n00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.100\nYou ever have that experience?\n\n412\n00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:09.920\n>> I have used a couple like\nMicrosoft Baseline Security Analyzer.\n\n413\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.404\n>> [CROSSTALK] Oh, MBSA a very good one.\n\n414\n00:19:11.404 --> 00:19:12.128\nOldie but a goodie.\n\n415\n00:19:12.128 --> 00:19:13.674\n>> Yeah, mm-hm, yeah.\n>> You know I actually have an interesting\n\n416\n00:19:13.674 --> 00:19:14.218\nstory about MBSA.\n\n417\n00:19:14.218 --> 00:19:20.645\nSo, MBSA along with the Windows Software\nUpdate Service, what's called WSUS today.\n\n418\n00:19:20.645 --> 00:19:25.375\nAs well as HFNetChk and HFNetChkPro which\nare also oldies but goodies, all came from\n\n419\n00:19:25.375 --> 00:19:30.410\nthe same company, a company called Shavlik\nTechnologies, may or may not know this.\n\n420\n00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.250\nI play a lot of geek trivia\nwith Michael Morothier and\n\n421\n00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.280\nthis is like the trump card in\nthe hole for me on this one.\n\n422\n00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.800\nSo if you ever play geek\ntrivia with your friends,\n\n423\n00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.550\nShavlik Technologies is the company that\nMicrosoft worked with to actually develop\n\n424\n00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.410\nthe entire patch management system.\n\n425\n00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:47.640\nAnd they built MBSA,\nthey built HFNetChk, HFNetChkPro.\n\n426\n00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.890\nThey built the technology that\nwill actually become WSUS.\n\n427\n00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.390\nThey got bought by a competitor\nof Microsoft several years ago,\n\n428\n00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.750\na company called VMware, little company,\nyou may have heard of them.\n\n429\n00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:56.680\nNot too big, right?\n\n430\n00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.460\nThey're actually owned by Dell now,\nbecause Dell is recently finishing up\n\n431\n00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.200\nthe acquisition of VMC,\nwhich is the parent company of VMware.\n\n432\n00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.390\nWe're very incestuous in\nthe IT technology community.\n\n433\n00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.130\nSo Dell now owns most of the world.\n\n434\n00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.970\nBut they don't own Microsoft, and\nGoogle, or Vine for right now.\n\n435\n00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.790\nIt's a big game of Stratego and risk.\n\n436\n00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:12.425\nYou ever heard of Stratego?\n\n437\n00:20:12.425 --> 00:20:14.641\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's a big game of risk right now,\n\n438\n00:20:14.641 --> 00:20:15.294\ngoing on, but\n\n439\n00:20:15.294 --> 00:20:19.170\nthe point is that that company got bought\nup several years ago by ultimately VMware.\n\n440\n00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.270\nAll that patch management technology,\n\n441\n00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:25.580\nobviously the guts of it belong to\nMicrosoft cuz they still use WSUS.\n\n442\n00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.300\nBut MBSA, and HFNetChk, and HFNetChkPro\nkinda went the way of the dinosaur.\n\n443\n00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.556\nYou don't see MBSA anymore because that\ntechnology is owned by somebody else.\n\n444\n00:20:33.556 --> 00:20:34.663\n>> Right.\n>> So you mentioned if it's\n\n445\n00:20:34.663 --> 00:20:36.894\nkind of old and interesting,\nyou shouldn't mention that one.\n\n446\n00:20:36.894 --> 00:20:38.092\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Good, very cool.\n\n447\n00:20:38.092 --> 00:20:41.700\nAll right, so now that we've done the way\nback machine concept, let's go forward.\n\n448\n00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.000\nSo we did steps for\nvulnerability assessment, so\n\n449\n00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.170\nwe know how to carry out\na vulnerability assessment.\n\n450\n00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:47.690\nWe know why it's so important.\n\n451\n00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:50.300\nNow what we need to do is,\nfrom vulnerability assessments,\n\n452\n00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:50.850\nwe have to go down.\n\n453\n00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.535\nThank you very much for\npreviewing that as you slid on in there,\n\n454\n00:20:53.535 --> 00:20:55.115\nwe now have to do penetration tests.\n\n455\n00:20:55.115 --> 00:20:58.823\nCuz out of the vulnerability assessment,\nwhat happens next is we have to go and\n\n456\n00:20:58.823 --> 00:21:00.520\ncarry that to the next level.\n\n457\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.060\nVulnerability assessments are important.\n\n458\n00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:06.480\nThey tell us, as security practitioners,\nwhat weaknesses exist in the system\n\n459\n00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.100\nthat we can become aware of and\ntake steps to prevent.\n\n460\n00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.930\nWhat we then have to do,\n\n461\n00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.850\nand whether this is done as you can\nsee penetration testing strategies\n\n462\n00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:18.380\nin different levels, externally,\ninternally, blind, or double blind.\n\n463\n00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.910\nWhether we do it ourselves,\nwhether we ask somebody outside to do it,\n\n464\n00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:25.270\nwhether we tell them about something,\nor we tell them nothing\n\n465\n00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.420\nis really a function of how we want\nthe Pen Test to be carried out.\n\n466\n00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:32.000\nBut ultimately, what we really need to do\nto take the vulnerability assessment to\n\n467\n00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.560\nthe next level is do what's\ncalled a penetration test.\n\n468\n00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.590\nAnd the penetration test allows us to,\nnot just look at vulnerabilities, but\n\n469\n00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.700\nto then use the outcome from\nthe vulnerability assessment,\n\n470\n00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:45.150\nkind of a step one, to then see how\nfar in we can we get to the system.\n\n471\n00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:46.470\nHow much can we exploit?\n\n472\n00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.390\nHow much can we take advantage of?\n\n473\n00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.400\nThat's what pen testing's all about.\n\n474\n00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.085\nVulnerability assessment is usually\na prelude, in other words, it is a step in\n\n475\n00:21:54.085 --> 00:21:57.960\nthe right direction toward pen testing,\nbut pen testings the end game for us.\n\n476\n00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.580\nIf all we do is vulnerability assessment.\n\n477\n00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.550\nIf all we do is carry out a vulnerability\nassessment, we take the outcome of\n\n478\n00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:07.690\nthe vulnerability assessment and\nwe try to implement changes.\n\n479\n00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:10.520\nBut we never test through\na penetration test to see whether or\n\n480\n00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.540\nnot our changes are successful,\nhow good are we?\n\n481\n00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.120\nWe just don't know, right?\n\n482\n00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.740\nAnd unless again, we trust but verify,\nkeep coming back to the state.\n\n483\n00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:22.011\nIt's good to say we did something,\nit's better to have empirical proof that\n\n484\n00:22:22.011 --> 00:22:24.092\nsomething is actually\nbeing done the right way.\n\n485\n00:22:24.092 --> 00:22:27.143\nThey often say,right, that it's\nbetter to be thought of an idiot,\n\n486\n00:22:27.143 --> 00:22:29.075\nthen open your mouth and prove it, right?\n\n487\n00:22:29.075 --> 00:22:30.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In this case the exact opposite,\n\n488\n00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.720\ndon't let anybody think you're an idiot.\n\n489\n00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:34.760\nOpen your mouth and\nprove you're not is my point.\n\n490\n00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.320\nRight, test the system.\n\n491\n00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.599\nMake sure that it's not gonna fall prey\nto the vulnerabilities and if it does,\n\n492\n00:22:39.599 --> 00:22:41.330\nyou gotta go back to the drawing board.\n\n493\n00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.860\nDo something different because whatever\nyou did is not working the right way.\n\n494\n00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.590\nSo, pen testing strategies.\n\n495\n00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:50.920\nExternal testing, you pay a company, or\na trusted partner, somebody from outside,\n\n496\n00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:55.250\nto come in and to effectively engage\nin the test against your system.\n\n497\n00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:57.470\nInternal testing, you do this internally.\n\n498\n00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.830\nYou may have heard of red teams,\nblue teams, tiger teams.\n\n499\n00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:04.380\nThese are terms that are used to\nrepresent internal testing activities in\n\n500\n00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.800\nthe government, the military,\n\n501\n00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.310\nsometimes in the private sector,\nnot every company refers to it that way.\n\n502\n00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.101\nSome just say,\nwe're conducting a pen test.\n\n503\n00:23:11.101 --> 00:23:17.150\nBut informal, pen testing language,\nwe refer to red team, blue team exercises,\n\n504\n00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:22.320\nor tiger teams sometimes and those are\noften gonna be internal testing solutions.\n\n505\n00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:27.610\nBlind testing is going to\nbe carried out when the,\n\n506\n00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.350\neither one of the two parties involved.\n\n507\n00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:33.630\nEither the group that is pen testing from\noutside or the group that's inside, and\n\n508\n00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.350\nthen you also have the defenders, right?\n\n509\n00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:38.900\nAnd so you have the people that\nare testing effectively the attackers, and\n\n510\n00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:39.970\nyou have the defenders.\n\n511\n00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:43.000\nSo, a blind test involves that one\nof them is gonna know something,\n\n512\n00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.260\nthe other doesn't know.\n\n513\n00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.954\nAnd a double-blind is that\nnobody knows anything.\n\n514\n00:23:45.954 --> 00:23:50.289\nSo when you're doing blind testing,\nwhat often happens is that the defenders\n\n515\n00:23:50.289 --> 00:23:53.126\nare not gonna be told that\nsomething is happening.\n\n516\n00:23:53.126 --> 00:23:56.454\nBut the attackers, the team that's doing\nthe pen test from outside would be\n\n517\n00:23:56.454 --> 00:23:58.230\nthe attackers in this scenario.\n\n518\n00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:00.970\nThat the pen testing team is\ngiven some knowledge because\n\n519\n00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:03.500\nthey have to know certain things\nin order to be able to come in and\n\n520\n00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:07.540\nto execute the attack, but the internal\nteam may not be told anything.\n\n521\n00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:09.140\nYou could reverse that of course and\n\n522\n00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:11.130\ntheoretically think about\nit the other way as well.\n\n523\n00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:14.535\nThe idea is just that one team does know,\nthe other team does not.\n\n524\n00:24:14.535 --> 00:24:15.407\nLet's put it that way.\n\n525\n00:24:15.407 --> 00:24:17.385\nWhichever team is in the know\nis not as important.\n\n526\n00:24:17.385 --> 00:24:20.320\nDouble-blind is knowing that neither team\n\n527\n00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.360\nreally has knowledge that will help\nthem or give them an advantage.\n\n528\n00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.700\nSo the idea is that the attackers\nare not really told anything.\n\n529\n00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.950\nAll they're told is here's the company\nname, you've got a week and\n\n530\n00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:33.590\nno matter happens, you cannot\ntouch anything on this IP range.\n\n531\n00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:34.590\nJust hypothetically, right?\n\n532\n00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.780\nCuz we wanna make sure that's off limits\ncuz we don't want you blowing up our\n\n533\n00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.930\nonline data warehouse hypothetically.\n\n534\n00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.940\nSo they're given that basic information.\n\n535\n00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:42.550\nGoodbye, good luck.\n\n536\n00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:43.620\nWe'll see you in a week.\n\n537\n00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.170\nAnd here's what we agree on\nthat you will leave behind\n\n538\n00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:48.320\nas the test that you were\nable to capture that system.\n\n539\n00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.420\nYou'll put a text file in this\ndirectory or whatever you'll do, right?\n\n540\n00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.970\nThey'll stipulate that.\n\n541\n00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:53.480\nThat's it.\n\n542\n00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.200\nThat's all you get.\n\n543\n00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.744\nYou'll get a publicly available name for\nthe company and\n\n544\n00:24:56.744 --> 00:25:00.620\nyou basically are told what's off-limits,\nwhat's out of scope.\n\n545\n00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.250\nThat's the extent of what you know.\n\n546\n00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:05.200\nThe defenders on the inside\nare not told you're coming.\n\n547\n00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.550\nNo knowledge of the fact that\nthere's gonna be an attack.\n\n548\n00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.740\nNo knowledge of the fact that\nthere's gonna be a test.\n\n549\n00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.460\nIf alarms go off, it's because something\nis in theory, from their perspective,\n\n550\n00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:14.170\nreally happening.\n\n551\n00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:15.440\nThey don't know the difference.\n\n552\n00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.510\nAnd then we'd sit back and\nsee what happens.\n\n553\n00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.720\nNow the thing to understand with pen\ntesting is it can be incredibly disruptive\n\n554\n00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.020\nif not done the right way.\n\n555\n00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:26.230\nBecause in a double blind test the\ndefenders don't realize this is a test.\n\n556\n00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:30.190\nAnd if they take what they perceive to\nbe the right action to stop the test and\n\n557\n00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.960\nthings get out of hand and\nthere are not some very clear guidelines\n\n558\n00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.290\non the side of the attacking team\nto understand what's off-limits,\n\n559\n00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:40.110\nthen they may actually wind up\nblowing up production systems.\n\n560\n00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:42.090\nAnd I see this happen all the time.\n\n561\n00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:46.058\nWhen I'm either engaged in pen testing and\nthings go wrong because the customer's not\n\n562\n00:25:46.058 --> 00:25:48.480\nclear on what is and\nis not supposed to happen.\n\n563\n00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.020\nI see it happen all the time and I'm\ncalled in after the fact to help unwind\n\n564\n00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.110\nthe damage that was done as a consultant.\n\n565\n00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:58.040\nSo it's very important for you, if you're\nthinking about being on the right side of\n\n566\n00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.020\nthis conversation, to understand\nthat we have these test strategies.\n\n567\n00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:06.040\nBut also to understand that you have to\nmake sure you are very clearly stipulating\n\n568\n00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.880\nwhat the rules of engagement\nare gonna be with regards to testing,\n\n569\n00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.230\nespecially pen testing.\n\n570\n00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.900\nGet you in a lot of trouble if you're\nnot taking advantage of that and\n\n571\n00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.110\nreally understanding\nwhat's happening there.\n\n572\n00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:17.335\nAny pen testing war stories there?\n\n573\n00:26:17.335 --> 00:26:19.035\n>> I have not done any pen testing.\n\n574\n00:26:19.035 --> 00:26:21.445\nDone a little CEH training.\n\n575\n00:26:21.445 --> 00:26:25.605\n>> Yes, the ethical hacking and\nlicense pen testing, absolutely.\n\n576\n00:26:25.605 --> 00:26:27.915\n>> When you look at these\ndifferent test strategies,\n\n577\n00:26:27.915 --> 00:26:29.915\ndo you typically implement more than one?\n\n578\n00:26:29.915 --> 00:26:33.705\nAre there advantages to\nexternal versus internal?\n\n579\n00:26:33.705 --> 00:26:34.835\n>> Absolutely, now great question.\n\n580\n00:26:34.835 --> 00:26:36.945\nSo you definitely wanna\nbe thinking about both.\n\n581\n00:26:36.945 --> 00:26:41.180\nWe often recommend throughout the course\nof the year that you will use both\n\n582\n00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:41.810\nsolutions.\n\n583\n00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:43.470\nYou will do internal testing.\n\n584\n00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.070\nYou may do that several times,\ncuz that's relatively easy to do.\n\n585\n00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:49.310\nYou own the resources, you don't\nhave to worry about contracting and\n\n586\n00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.320\nspending money.\n\n587\n00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:53.580\nTypically, especially when you're\ngetting for audits, you'll tend to go\n\n588\n00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:57.440\nthrough an internal pen test to see what\nthe outcome of that audit may look like.\n\n589\n00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.090\nBecause as an auditor, we'll come in,\nwe're gonna probe the security systems.\n\n590\n00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.910\nWe're gonna do some sort of\nvulnerability assessment most likely.\n\n591\n00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:05.230\nSo, we're gonna be looking at that stuff.\n\n592\n00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.380\nSo, if you know what's there already, and\nyou can take steps to prevent us from\n\n593\n00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:10.440\nfinding those things by\nfixing those problems.\n\n594\n00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.800\nThat's gonna be advantageous for you.\n\n595\n00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.810\nSo, you're gonna wanna do internal\ntesting on a regular, consistent basis,\n\n596\n00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.150\ntypically two, three times a year.\n\n597\n00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:19.270\nMaybe once a quarter,\nonce every six months.\n\n598\n00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.140\nSomething like that.\n\n599\n00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.250\nIt's usually valuable and recommended.\n\n600\n00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:23.610\nBut again, no hard fast rule.\n\n601\n00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.460\nI have customers that do it once a year.\n\n602\n00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.420\nI have customers that do\nit every three months.\n\n603\n00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.620\nIt really just depends on\nthe nature of your business.\n\n604\n00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.630\nI do have a lot of customers,\nalmost on exception most of them,\n\n605\n00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.820\nthat will contract at least once\na year to an external third party,\n\n606\n00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.560\nthat will come in and do an external\npen test and vulnerability assessment.\n\n607\n00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.400\nUsually both are kind of contracted for\nit.\n\n608\n00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.790\nThey'll do one and then the other.\n\n609\n00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:47.320\nAnd then combine them together and\nreport out on the results for you.\n\n610\n00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.220\nEspecially as I said around the audit\nwindow, where they're gonna try to\n\n611\n00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.060\nget ready for that audit,\nwanna know what the surprises are.\n\n612\n00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.030\nSo we're gonna see a lot of that activity.\n\n613\n00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.620\nNow you may go out to,\nyou know, a security provider.\n\n614\n00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:01.390\nEffectively either a managed security\nprovider, what we call an MSP, or\n\n615\n00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:04.650\na managed security service provider,\nsometimes referred to as MSSP.\n\n616\n00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:05.760\nYou can contract with them.\n\n617\n00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:10.640\nSo, companies like the Lloyds and\nPricewaterhouseCoopers, the big\n\n618\n00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:16.080\nassessment and auditing and security\nvendor companies do this kind of work.\n\n619\n00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:19.510\nYou can contract with them and\nthey do this work all the time.\n\n620\n00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:22.670\nThere are smaller companies,\nprobably local to your geography.\n\n621\n00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:25.190\nThese companies I just mentioned\nare global, they exist everywhere.\n\n622\n00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:27.060\nBut you may not want to use\na company that's that big.\n\n623\n00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.810\nYou may want something\na little bit smaller, right?\n\n624\n00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:31.170\nSo you may go to ABC Corp,\nwhoever that is.\n\n625\n00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:34.300\nSo there's probably a local vendor\nIn your area that does this as well.\n\n626\n00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.080\nOne of the things you want to think about\ndoing is hooking up with information\n\n627\n00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.680\nsecurity professionals in your geography,\ntrying to figure out more about them.\n\n628\n00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.450\nWho they are.\n\n629\n00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:42.680\nWhat user groups are there.\n\n630\n00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.460\nHow do you network with peers and\ncolleagues to find out about this stuff?\n\n631\n00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:50.550\nLiterally you could go to Google and\nsay who's the security pen tester in,\n\n632\n00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:55.090\nI don't know Wisconsin or\nwhoever, wherever you may be.\n\n633\n00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.260\nBut the reality is you may or\n\n634\n00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.620\nmay not really trust those people\ncuz you don't know who they are.\n\n635\n00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.360\nIf you're gonna have a peer of colleague\nrecommend somebody to you that's a whole\n\n636\n00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.290\ndifferent story.\n\n637\n00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:06.290\nSo really not only can you and\nwhen you do become a CSSP, you join\n\n638\n00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.700\nthe information security community to get\naccess to those peers and colleagues.\n\n639\n00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.910\nAnd you may have that already, but\nbecoming a member of one or more peer led\n\n640\n00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:18.330\ngroups, things like InfraGuard, which is\na local information security awareness and\n\n641\n00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.746\nuser group that the FBI is involved with\nand a lot of geographies without, or\n\n642\n00:29:21.746 --> 00:29:24.960\nwithin rather, the U.S.\nthey have local chapters around.\n\n643\n00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.480\nThat's usually a really good way for\n\n644\n00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.050\ninformation security\nprofessionals to become involved.\n\n645\n00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:31.815\nWe mentioned the saca chapter\nseveral times in prior episodes.\n\n646\n00:29:31.815 --> 00:29:36.140\nA saca chapter typically are local\nin most big cities like ISC squared\n\n647\n00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:40.330\nthey are another information\nsecurity organization and\n\n648\n00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:45.240\nthey have a lot of users, a lot of\ncertified people around the world.\n\n649\n00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.970\nThe CISA and CISM credentials\nare gonna be their credentials.\n\n650\n00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:52.250\nSo you may wanna find a local chapter and\nassociate with them.\n\n651\n00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.770\nISC Squared has many local chapters in a\nlot of the big cities in the United States\n\n652\n00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:56.700\nand throughout the world.\n\n653\n00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.830\nAnd you may be able to become\na member of one of those.\n\n654\n00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.126\nSo, be on the lookout for\nthose kind of things.\n\n655\n00:30:01.126 --> 00:30:03.448\nBecause that's how you're going\nto find out about these things.\n\n656\n00:30:03.448 --> 00:30:04.286\n>> Very good.\n\n657\n00:30:04.286 --> 00:30:05.464\nAll right, and then we got our,\n\n658\n00:30:05.464 --> 00:30:08.184\nI know we still want to talk about our\ncategories of penetration testing.\n\n659\n00:30:08.184 --> 00:30:09.765\n>> Yes, we do, yes.\n\n660\n00:30:09.765 --> 00:30:11.980\nSo we wanna, if we can,\nput those back up real quick.\n\n661\n00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.860\nWe're going to talk about those for\njust a second.\n\n662\n00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.540\nSo, you can see our categories\nof pen testing up there.\n\n663\n00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.881\nIt's important to have a wing man, right?\n\n664\n00:30:17.881 --> 00:30:18.879\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Very important.\n\n665\n00:30:18.879 --> 00:30:19.514\nKeeps you honest.\n\n666\n00:30:19.514 --> 00:30:20.195\nKeeps you focused.\n\n667\n00:30:20.195 --> 00:30:22.160\nRight, making sure I\ndon't forget anything.\n\n668\n00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.850\nGot all the stuff up here but\nevery so often, I turned sideways and\n\n669\n00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:25.870\neverything leaks out the side.\n\n670\n00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.544\nYou ever see that movie, Johnny Pneumonic?\n\n671\n00:30:27.544 --> 00:30:28.196\n>> I have, I like that.\n\n672\n00:30:28.196 --> 00:30:31.879\n>> With Keanu Reeves,\nsome of his best work by the way,\n\n673\n00:30:31.879 --> 00:30:34.571\ngreat cinematography masterpiece.\n\n674\n00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:38.122\nBy the way, all kidding aside,\nthe idea with Johnny Pneumonic, he was,\n\n675\n00:30:38.122 --> 00:30:40.659\nlike a 25th century or\nwhatever it was, courier.\n\n676\n00:30:40.659 --> 00:30:43.274\nHe would have basically\na memory chip in his head.\n\n677\n00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:45.270\nThey'd load them up with knowledge, and\n\n678\n00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:46.650\nwalk around with all\nthe knowledge in his head.\n\n679\n00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.630\nTrying to keep it from blowing off his\nhead and trying to seep out the sides.\n\n680\n00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.180\nBut in addition to that,\nthey're remaking Point Break.\n\n681\n00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:53.870\n>> I saw that.\n\n682\n00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:55.140\n>> Yeah, another interesting one, right?\n\n683\n00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.160\n>> Looking forward to that one.\n\n684\n00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.461\n>> Another Keanu Reeves masterpiece there,\nyeah.\n\n685\n00:30:58.461 --> 00:31:00.049\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, anyway, getting back.\n\n686\n00:31:00.049 --> 00:31:01.460\nThis is not the Keanu Reeves show,\n\n687\n00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.660\nthis is the categories of\npen testing conversation.\n\n688\n00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.040\nSo categories of penetration testing,\nright?\n\n689\n00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.050\nSo we have three categories,\nzero knowledge, partial knowledge,\n\n690\n00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:08.870\nfull knowledge.\n\n691\n00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:10.350\nSo when we think about\na zero knowledge test,\n\n692\n00:31:10.350 --> 00:31:13.820\nwhat we're thinking about it's\na test that the pen testers,\n\n693\n00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.990\nwe talked about,\nhas no knowledge of the system at all.\n\n694\n00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:19.720\nIn other words, they're not gonna be\ntold anything like we talked about with\n\n695\n00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.760\nthe blind and double-blind,\nthought process where the attacker and\n\n696\n00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.870\nor the defender may or\nmay not know anything.\n\n697\n00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:28.190\nThey're just really told, hey basically,\nshow up here and you got a week.\n\n698\n00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:29.720\nThat's basically what you know.\n\n699\n00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:34.030\nA zero knowledge test, you can only find\nout stuff that is publicly available, or\n\n700\n00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:37.810\nthat you are having the wits to figure out\nhow to gain through social engineering.\n\n701\n00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.510\nSo when we do zero knowledge pen testing,\nand\n\n702\n00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:43.070\nI do a lot of this work with customers\nall the time, I'm not told anything.\n\n703\n00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.590\nI'm basically just given a contract\nthat says hey, you've got two weeks,\n\n704\n00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:47.100\nhere's the name of the company.\n\n705\n00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.380\nAnd whatever you find,\nsimply observe and report back.\n\n706\n00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.780\nOr, you can attack these kind of systems,\nyou may find this, but\n\n707\n00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.740\nyou're not able to touch that.\n\n708\n00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.290\nBecause obviously,\n\n709\n00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:58.160\nas I said, there are certain systems that\nare gonna be off limits no matter what.\n\n710\n00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.260\nSo you can't just break up\nthe production network to say hey,\n\n711\n00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.960\nI planted a flag on that system.\n\n712\n00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.510\nSo zero knowledge, we know nothing.\n\n713\n00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.790\nPartial knowledge,\nwe tend to know certain things.\n\n714\n00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.202\nSo if I have a partial knowledge test,\n\n715\n00:32:09.202 --> 00:32:12.320\nI'm given a statement to work\na contract that involves probably\n\n716\n00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.850\nthe publicly available IP addresses,\nthe routable IPs the company owns.\n\n717\n00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:21.350\nI'm probably given access to certain\ninformation about the structure\n\n718\n00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:22.360\nof the network.\n\n719\n00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.640\nI may be told there's a DMZ.\n\n720\n00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.780\nI may be told there's certain systems\nrunning in certain places, but\n\n721\n00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.300\nI'm not gonna be given full access.\n\n722\n00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.190\nI'm not gonna be given passwords and\nuser names to everything.\n\n723\n00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:33.590\nMaybe only certain systems, but\n\n724\n00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:37.470\nI'm not gonna be given a total,\nbasically all-access pass.\n\n725\n00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.410\nWhereas in full knowledge,\nI'm given everything.\n\n726\n00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:40.980\nI'm on the inside.\n\n727\n00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.660\nI'm running from inside the network, so\n\n728\n00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:47.520\nI'm probably sitting in the on the lan\nin the network operation center.\n\n729\n00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.980\nI'm fully connected internally\nbehind all the security perimeters,\n\n730\n00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.910\nI have all the user names and\npasswords with full admin access, and\n\n731\n00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:58.120\nI'm in there hacking away, probing to see\nwhat I can find, and specifically what I'm\n\n732\n00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.380\nlooking for are what are the unknown\nweaknesses or vulnerabilities\n\n733\n00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:05.130\nthat an attacker if they gain access\nmay compromise and take advantage of.\n\n734\n00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.580\nThat's really what we're gonna look for\nwith full knowledge.\n\n735\n00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.640\nZero and partial knowledge looks for\nthat, but\n\n736\n00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.540\nit's not as thorough because I'm\nnot gonna be on the inside and\n\n737\n00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:15.480\nI'm not gonna have as much access so\ni may not find as many things.\n\n738\n00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.460\n>> Very good.\n\n739\n00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:20.620\nAll right, well Adam a lot of great\ninformation there on doing our penetration\n\n740\n00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:22.810\ntest and methodologies, if I can say that.\n\n741\n00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:23.410\n>> It's a hard word.\n\n742\n00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:24.660\n>> It is.\nIt's tricky.\n\n743\n00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.130\nAnd those control types right.\n\n744\n00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:30.162\nLearning the different types of control\nand the general categories that we can put\n\n745\n00:33:30.162 --> 00:33:32.910\nthem in so we know what to\nexpect out of those controls and\n\n746\n00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:36.359\nwe talked a little bit again more\nabout layering those controls to make\n\n747\n00:33:36.359 --> 00:33:38.650\nsure we're relying on\none individual thing.\n\n748\n00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:41.290\nSo, fantastic information\nwe appreciate that Adam.\n\n749\n00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:43.510\nWe are out of time for\nthis particular episode, so\n\n750\n00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:44.890\nwe're gonna go ahead and sign off.\n\n751\n00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:49.100\nBut before I do, let me remind you, if you\nwant to attend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n752\n00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.450\nmake sure you drop us\na line at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n753\n00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.610\nFor now, signing off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n754\n00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:56.587\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n755\n00:33:56.587 --> 00:33:57.841\n>>

00:00:20.275\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're gonna be doing our CISSP,\n\n4\n00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:25.267\nspecifically we're looking at threat\nmodeling as well as doing a little bit\n\n5\n00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:30.353\nof review on our penetration testing\nmethodology, and who do I have with me?\n\n6\n00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:31.188\nMister Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:32.746\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:34.541\n>> It's going well,\nhow's everybody doing today?\n\n9\n00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:35.561\nHopefully you guys are doing well.\n\n10\n00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:38.530\nSorry Mike and I were just sharing\na joke before we got on there.\n\n11\n00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.317\nAll right, anyway.\n\n12\n00:00:39.317 --> 00:00:42.334\nSo we're here to talk\na little bit more about risk.\n\n13\n00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:44.637\nAnd when we talk about risk,\nwe talk about pen testing,\n\n14\n00:00:44.637 --> 00:00:46.410\ntalking about how all that stuff works.\n\n15\n00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.250\nWe've had some really good\nconversations about that,\n\n16\n00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.770\ngonna continue that obviously, but wanted\nto remind you, take you back for a minute,\n\n17\n00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.950\nit's always good to look\nback before we look ahead.\n\n18\n00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.900\nAnd we wanna make sure we think about some\nof the stuff we've been discussing in that\n\n19\n00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.690\narea, so wanted to quickly remind you of\nwhat vulnerability assessment as well as\n\n20\n00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.450\npenetration testing is, and\nmake sure we have that in mind.\n\n21\n00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.350\nWe're gonna throw a little list up for\nyou by way of doing that review and\n\n22\n00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.230\nhelp you to think through\nthe penetration testing methodology,\n\n23\n00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.090\nand then we'll continue talking\nabout threats, threat modeling, and\n\n24\n00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.400\nsome of the other stuff we're\nhere to discuss as well.\n\n25\n00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.770\nSo when we spoke about\nvulnerability assessments and\n\n26\n00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.640\nwe spoke about pen testing, if you\nremember from our prior episode, and\n\n27\n00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.750\nif you haven't seen it by the way,\nit's a killer, right?\n\n28\n00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.520\nIt's a cliffhanger.\n\n29\n00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.850\nIt's the season end and\nit is like awesome.\n\n30\n00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.010\nWe don't know if Mike's gonna survive or\nnot.\n\n31\n00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.676\nWell I gave it away cuz he's here,\nso he does survive.\n\n32\n00:01:31.676 --> 00:01:34.152\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> But the point is but it was unclear,\n\n33\n00:01:34.152 --> 00:01:35.343\nwe weren't sure.\n\n34\n00:01:35.343 --> 00:01:38.140\nBut what we were talking about there,\nall kidding aside, was the following.\n\n35\n00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.476\nWe were talking about how you would create\nor go through the activities around\n\n36\n00:01:42.476 --> 00:01:45.877\na vulnerability assessment as\na prelude to pen testing, and\n\n37\n00:01:45.877 --> 00:01:50.080\nwhat kind of pen testing could take place,\nexternal, internal, blind,\n\n38\n00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.616\ndouble-blind, as well as the types of\nknowledge you may have around pen tests,\n\n39\n00:01:54.616 --> 00:01:58.528\nsay zero knowledge, partial knowledge or\nfull knowledge pen test.\n\n40\n00:01:58.528 --> 00:02:01.975\nWe put all that together, we come up\nwith a pen testing methodology, and\n\n41\n00:02:01.975 --> 00:02:04.445\nthe methodology's on\nthe screen in front of you.\n\n42\n00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:08.975\nThis is one of those times when a numbered\nsequence list of activities is a trigger\n\n43\n00:02:08.975 --> 00:02:12.205\nfor you to makes some notes, to make\nsure you understand things in order.\n\n44\n00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:14.885\nWe have talked a couple of\ntimes in some of our prior\n\n45\n00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:18.045\nepisodes about the fact that when\nwe do put up a numbered list and\n\n46\n00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:20.975\nwe specify that it is important\nto know something in order,\n\n47\n00:02:20.975 --> 00:02:24.160\nthat you should take notice of that and\nobviously act accordingly.\n\n48\n00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.750\nSo you'll see pen test methodology.\n\n49\n00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.210\nStep one, reconnaissance.\n\n50\n00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.900\nWe have to go out and\nexamine what's going on around us.\n\n51\n00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.330\nWe have to probe a little bit.\n\n52\n00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.950\nThis is where the ability to be able\nto do some requirements gathering,\n\n53\n00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.850\nlooking at operating system\nfingerprinting, looking at open ports.\n\n54\n00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.670\nThings of that nature may help us\nto better understand the nature of\n\n55\n00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.480\nwhat's there.\n\n56\n00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.537\nEnumeration helps us to do some\nof that in step two as well.\n\n57\n00:02:47.537 --> 00:02:51.553\nBut reconnaissance may involve\npassively looking at the company.\n\n58\n00:02:51.553 --> 00:02:53.812\nCan we go out online and\nsee, for instance,\n\n59\n00:02:53.812 --> 00:02:57.630\nwhat is out there on LinkedIn about\npeople may work for the company?\n\n60\n00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.640\nWhat's on Facebook,\nwhat kind of activity are they sharing?\n\n61\n00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.830\nAre they tagging themselves in pictures\nin locations that may expose information\n\n62\n00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.390\nabout the internal workings of the\ncompany, maybe network engineers taking\n\n63\n00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.360\npictures of themselves in the operating\nenvironment of the data center, and\n\n64\n00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.840\nmaybe we could see the racks and\nsee what kind of equipment they run.\n\n65\n00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.200\nAnd that could be valuable,\neven though you don't think about that,\n\n66\n00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.330\nthat could be valuable.\n\n67\n00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.920\nSo reconnaissance is about looking for\n\n68\n00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.612\nwhat's available outside of\nthe organization, effectively on the web.\n\n69\n00:03:24.612 --> 00:03:27.987\nWe search LinkedIn,\nwe look at Facebook, we Google.\n\n70\n00:03:27.987 --> 00:03:32.380\nWe try to get, if it's a public trading\ncompany, we try to get a prospectus or\n\n71\n00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.706\na share listing so we'll get the the\nreported information from the last year\n\n72\n00:03:36.706 --> 00:03:39.769\nfinancial reporting that\nthe company went through.\n\n73\n00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.753\nWe'll see who the board of directors are,\n\n74\n00:03:41.753 --> 00:03:45.615\nwe'll take a look at the officers of the\ncompany, we'll then go profile them, and\n\n75\n00:03:45.615 --> 00:03:47.900\ntry and find out information about them.\n\n76\n00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.770\nYou know what do they do?\n\n77\n00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.240\nWhat are they responsible for?\n\n78\n00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.930\nWhat kind of stuff are they involved with?\n\n79\n00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.470\nCan we find out more about them?\n\n80\n00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.830\nIt's the kind of thing that can lead\nto a lot of interesting information.\n\n81\n00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.200\nIf you remember,\nsometime in the last year or\n\n82\n00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.560\nso, we've had several spectacular examples\n\n83\n00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.600\nof social engineering that have turned\nup some very interesting information.\n\n84\n00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.380\nThe directors of some of the intelligence\norganizations of the United States\n\n85\n00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.160\nwere recently the subject of some of this\nactivity, and without going into the gory\n\n86\n00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.490\ndetails, effectively have their email,\ntheir personal email accounts hacked, and\n\n87\n00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.330\ninformation about them that should not\nhave been exposed was exposed along with\n\n88\n00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.170\nprobably other stuff that we\nshould not know about, right?\n\n89\n00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.690\nYou can think about some of the\ninformation that ever so often leaks out.\n\n90\n00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.340\nEarlier this past year, we had the iCloud,\niPhoto thing that went on,\n\n91\n00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.960\nwhere a lot of celebrities and\njust average, innocent everyday people\n\n92\n00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.630\nthat were not as famous had their\nphotos hacked, and therefore exposed,\n\n93\n00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.410\nonline, because iCloud was found not to be\nquite as secure as it should have been.\n\n94\n00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.504\nAnd this was all done through pen testing,\nbut\n\n95\n00:04:49.504 --> 00:04:53.200\nobviously bad hackers were looking\ninto hacking the system actually for\n\n96\n00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.670\ntaking on these activities and\ncarrying them out.\n\n97\n00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.930\nAnd you know these things happen.\n\n98\n00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.500\nChase Manhattan or Chase Bank had\na big problem earlier this year,\n\n99\n00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.370\nJP Chase Morgan, or\nJP Morgan Chase rather.\n\n100\n00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.910\nJP Morgan Chase had a problem earlier this\nyear as well where they were the subject\n\n101\n00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.780\nof some pen testing gone awry,\n\n102\n00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.450\nmeaning hackers trying to get into\ntheir systems, and as a result had some\n\n103\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.140\ninformation disclosures that\nthey were not too pleased about.\n\n104\n00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.450\nLots and lots of companies\nare dealing with these issues today.\n\n105\n00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.550\nIt is up to us as CISSPs,\nthe security professionals,\n\n106\n00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.510\nto stand on the border, that form the\nfirst line of defense to be ever vigilant.\n\n107\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.420\nWe talked often in some of\nour prior discussions about\n\n108\n00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.220\nthe fact that you have to be better\nthan those that coming to attack you.\n\n109\n00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.060\nAnd I made the point that luck is\nnot the operational methodology\n\n110\n00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.740\nthat we want to use to manage risk.\n\n111\n00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.650\nYou may be better on any given day,\nbut the reality is you have to be\n\n112\n00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.460\nbetter all the time, and that's what\nseparates us, as security professionals\n\n113\n00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.250\nfrom amateurs who do this but don't\nreally understand what they're doing.\n\n114\n00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.880\nYou don't get to be this grey without\nthis much hair on your head, right?\n\n115\n00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.120\nIf you're not this good all the time and\nknow what you're doing and\n\n116\n00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.680\nstress as a result of it, right?\n\n117\n00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.495\nI'm kidding, of course.\n\n118\n00:05:55.495 --> 00:05:58.485\nYou could do this and\nobviously be very successful at it\n\n119\n00:05:58.485 --> 00:06:00.005\nregardless of whether you have\nhair on your head or not.\n\n120\n00:06:00.005 --> 00:06:01.705\nI don't wanna exclude anybody\nwho doesn't have hair.\n\n121\n00:06:01.705 --> 00:06:06.245\nBut I do wanna make it clear that it is\nimportant for you to practice your skills,\n\n122\n00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:09.495\nand for you to become good at\nsomething implies hours and\n\n123\n00:06:09.495 --> 00:06:13.055\nhours of the pursuit of that skill.\n\n124\n00:06:13.055 --> 00:06:15.945\nOften we would talk about in earlier\ntimes, when I say earlier I mean hundreds\n\n125\n00:06:15.945 --> 00:06:19.620\nof year ago, we would talk about\nthe concept of the Renaissance person.\n\n126\n00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.128\nRenaissance man, Renaissance women,\nLeonardo Da Vinci for instance,\n\n127\n00:06:23.128 --> 00:06:26.170\nMichelangelo, were examples for\nRenaissance people.\n\n128\n00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.010\nPeople that were not just good at one\nthing, these people are the most famous\n\n129\n00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.240\nartists in the world that\nwe're talking about, right?\n\n130\n00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.500\nSir Issac Newton, another great example\nof a Reconnaissance individual.\n\n131\n00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.190\nYou can think of Albert Einstein as being\nsomebody in the modern day that fits into\n\n132\n00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.830\nthis particular category.\n\n133\n00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.230\nThese are people that were good at a lot\nof things, not just mastering one thing.\n\n134\n00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.250\nBut masters of all they surveyed,\nand they ultimately touched and\n\n135\n00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.640\nwanted to learn how to do.\n\n136\n00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.840\nAnd so the reality is, to get good\nat security today, you have to have\n\n137\n00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.360\nthat Renaissance mindset, that philosophy\nthat I have to be good at a lot fo things.\n\n138\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.560\nBecause if all I'm good\nat is just pen testing,\n\n139\n00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.680\nyou're gonna be very good at this,\nbut this is not the only thing we do.\n\n140\n00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.370\nYou have to be good at crafting policy.\n\n141\n00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.310\nYou have to be good at\nvulnerability assessments.\n\n142\n00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.960\nYou have to be good at understanding\nhow to manage a team of individuals.\n\n143\n00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.480\nYou have to be good at understanding how\nto have a conversation with people in\n\n144\n00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.800\nthe C Suite about security and\n\n145\n00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.010\nthose needs, and create a budget request\nthat reflects those and manage change.\n\n146\n00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.500\nAnd these are all skills that are related\nto penetration testing in one form or\n\n147\n00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.690\nanother, but are not directly related to\nin sense that they flow directly from it.\n\n148\n00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.680\nAnd if all you're good at is pen testing,\n\n149\n00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.120\nyou're going to be what we\ncall a one trick pony, right?\n\n150\n00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.940\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Which means you're very good\n\n151\n00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.730\nat only one thing.\n\n152\n00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.810\nBut unfortunately you're not going to be\nvery valuable to the organization if we\n\n153\n00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.610\ndon't need that particular thing.\n\n154\n00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.170\nAnd so as much from\nthe perspective of being able to\n\n155\n00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.170\nreally get better at your craft and\nultimately spread the knowledge, but\n\n156\n00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.900\nalso become more valuable\nto the organization, right?\n\n157\n00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.600\nSelf preservation if nothing else,\nyou want to get good at a lot of things.\n\n158\n00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.070\nBut you know, it's hard, I have this\nconversation all the time with students.\n\n159\n00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.193\nHow do I get better at stuff if nobody\nlet's me do anything because nobody thinks\n\n160\n00:07:53.193 --> 00:07:56.310\nI know how to do it, and when I go to do\nit they tell no, no, no you can't do that,\n\n161\n00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.730\nyou're gonna mess everything up.\n\n162\n00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.238\nIt's very hard to learn how\nto do these things today.\n\n163\n00:08:00.238 --> 00:08:03.463\nYou don't often get a chance to\ngo pen test on a live network,\n\n164\n00:08:03.463 --> 00:08:04.928\nthat's just the reality.\n\n165\n00:08:04.928 --> 00:08:09.895\nIf you do, then that is fairly unusual,\nlet's put it that way.\n\n166\n00:08:09.895 --> 00:08:11.560\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you certainly could go and\n\n167\n00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.460\ntake classes, and\nI'm not trying to dissuade you and\n\n168\n00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.140\nsay training is or is not appropriate.\n\n169\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.690\nIt's a very good way to learn,\nor Mike and I wouldn't be\n\n170\n00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.120\nspending all this time trying to\nhelp you figure all this stuff out.\n\n171\n00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.010\nBut it's not the only thing,\nyou've got to go out and\n\n172\n00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.170\npractice those skills by\nputting them in to play.\n\n173\n00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.690\nSo, in addition to all the stuff we talk\nabout here, what I would suggest to you,\n\n174\n00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.740\nespecially in an area like this\nwhere we talk about some technology,\n\n175\n00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.990\nwe talked in one of our prior episodes\nabout tools like N-Map or ZenMap or\n\n176\n00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.140\nthe Metasploit framework and things of\nthat nature, think of virtualization.\n\n177\n00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.810\nThink of the virtualization\nplatforms we have today,\n\n178\n00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:44.750\nthink of virtual desktop infrastructure,\nvirtual machines,\n\n179\n00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.130\nthink about the things you can do by\nbuilding a small virtual network, and\n\n180\n00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.900\nthe kind of skills you can practice and\nultimately hone in those networks until\n\n181\n00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.760\nyou get good at them enough that you can\ngo out and use them in the real world.\n\n182\n00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.800\nIt's really been a game changer\nover the last several years.\n\n183\n00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.940\nAnd the reality is that to be able\nto get good at something like this,\n\n184\n00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.790\nyou have to practice.\n\n185\n00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.010\nI mean, I could talk to you about it all\nday, and we could show you how to do it,\n\n186\n00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.780\nbut that's not a substitute for\nyou actually doing it yourself.\n\n187\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:11.220\nAnd the reality's I got good at\ndoing this, as did Mike when he\n\n188\n00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.610\nstarted to learn how to do at least\nvulnerability assessments, right?\n\n189\n00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.360\nHe was good at that,\nhe said he's done that.\n\n190\n00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.740\nHe's good at that because he practices it,\nnot because he read about it in a book and\n\n191\n00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.850\nnever did it himself.\n\n192\n00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.000\nSo the reality is in order\nto get good at this stuff,\n\n193\n00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.820\nyou're going to have to go out and do it.\n\n194\n00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:28.270\nThink about virtualizing environments,\nisolating them from production networks,\n\n195\n00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.790\nand then infecting them with something,\nor setting them as such where they have\n\n196\n00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.090\nvulnerabilities, or\nwhatever you're going to do.\n\n197\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.738\nAnd then go out and figure out how to use\nthese tools to find those vulnerabilities.\n\n198\n00:09:36.738 --> 00:09:39.770\nThat's going to be a great way for you to\nput these skills to actually into play and\n\n199\n00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.440\npractice them in the real world.\n\n200\n00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.860\nAnd then as you ultimately get better,\nover time you can go out and\n\n201\n00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.609\ndo other things.\n\n202\n00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.550\nSo we have reconnaissance,\nwe have enumeration,\n\n203\n00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.330\nwhere we're going to go out and do\nthings like scanning for open ports, and\n\n204\n00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.380\nmaybe looking for\nvulnerability assessments, or rather using\n\n205\n00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.370\na vulnerability assessment to be able\nto ultimately understand what's there.\n\n206\n00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.750\nYou may or may not be familiar\nwith something called CVE miter,\n\n207\n00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.530\nthe common vulnerability enumeration\ndatabase that's out there.\n\n208\n00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.600\nThe common vulnerability database is one\nof those things that you can look at\n\n209\n00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.520\nonline, to look at the vulnerabilities\nthat are available to you,\n\n210\n00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.400\nby operating system, or by platforms.\n\n211\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.010\nSo as a security practitioner,\nas a security professional, we want to\n\n212\n00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:18.480\nknow if we run Linux, or we run Windows,\nthat there are certain things that may or\n\n213\n00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.310\nmay not be secure, and how do we fix\nthose things by knowing what they are.\n\n214\n00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.416\nSo we go and we look them up.\n\n215\n00:10:23.416 --> 00:10:24.370\nSo you're going to have to go out and\n\n216\n00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.650\nlook for known vulnerabilities and\nfigure out where they are.\n\n217\n00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.410\nVulnerability analysis means we find\nwhat's there, we look at what may be\n\n218\n00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.513\nan issue for us in the system,\nand then we decide in step four,\n\n219\n00:10:34.513 --> 00:10:37.210\nexecution/exploitation, how\nto take advantage of this.\n\n220\n00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:40.918\nRemember the goal of the pen test is to\nget into the system and ultimately own it.\n\n221\n00:10:40.918 --> 00:10:42.632\nWe want to be able to take it over,\n\n222\n00:10:42.632 --> 00:10:46.120\nwant to be able to show that we were\nable to use a flaw or a vulnerability,\n\n223\n00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.040\na weakness of some kind, to create\na risk and exploit that weakness.\n\n224\n00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.320\nSo this is all about gaining\ncontrol of the system.\n\n225\n00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:56.880\nIt may be changing the background on the\ndesktop, it may be leaving a file there,\n\n226\n00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.280\nit may be logging somebody off and\nthen logging back in as another person and\n\n227\n00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:04.100\ncreating a profiles that\nwe know you were there.\n\n228\n00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.870\nIt's all these things you could do,\n\n229\n00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:09.080\npoint is if you do any of those things\nwithout permission you effectively have\n\n230\n00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.380\nfigured out a way to be able to\nshow that you took over the box.\n\n231\n00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.450\nYou've exploited the vulnerability or\nweakness.\n\n232\n00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:17.560\nThis is something to consider and\nto be aware of.\n\n233\n00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.440\nAnd then we have to document findings.\n\n234\n00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.660\nWe always come back to this idea of\nreporting what we've done, right?\n\n235\n00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:25.680\nLike any good soldier, we go out there,\nwe do all the stuff we're going to do,\n\n236\n00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.410\nwhen we get done,\nwe go back and report in.\n\n237\n00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:28.410\nHey, this is what I did,\n\n238\n00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.530\nthis is what I found,\nthis is what ultimately the outcome is.\n\n239\n00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.580\nIf we don't document, if we go through all\nthe steps and we forget to do step five,\n\n240\n00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.890\nwe've effectively not finished the story,\nbecause we haven't told the stakeholders\n\n241\n00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:41.580\nand the people that have asked us\nto do this, what the outcome was.\n\n242\n00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:43.900\nAnd that's the whole point of\nthis in the first place, right?\n\n243\n00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:46.360\nIt's not like we've just decided\nwe're going to go out and\n\n244\n00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.520\nwe had nothing better to do today.\n\n245\n00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.200\nIt's kind of a slow day,\ndidn't have much to talk about.\n\n246\n00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.770\nLet's go do a pen test, right?\n\n247\n00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:54.850\nIf that's the case, okay, but\nwe need to get you a hobby.\n\n248\n00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.280\nSomething that involves going outside,\ntalking to people, interacting with them,\n\n249\n00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.660\nit will be a good thing.\n\n250\n00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.870\nSo you don't want to just be\nsitting around with nothing to do,\n\n251\n00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.250\nbecause this is not the activity you\npick up in when you have nothing to do.\n\n252\n00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.510\nThere's a lot of other\nstuff you should be doing.\n\n253\n00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.520\nLike making sure it's not possible for\npeople to do this to you, for\n\n254\n00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.230\ninstance right?\n\n255\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.760\nAs opposed to going out and\ndoing this to others.\n\n256\n00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.190\nSo wanted to just walk back through\nthe pen test methodology with you,\n\n257\n00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.080\nremind you of how to bring all that\nknowledge together from vulnerability\n\n258\n00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.950\nassessments and penetration testing.\n\n259\n00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:24.090\nBefore we then go ahead, and\nwe start talking more about threats and\n\n260\n00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.090\nthreat modeling.\n\n261\n00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.670\nWe've talked a lot about threats already.\n\n262\n00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.370\nWe've talked about threat sources, the\nthreat actors that can do us harm, we've\n\n263\n00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.120\ntalked about threat events, the things\nthat threat sources actually carry out\n\n264\n00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.360\nthat can ultimately lead to exploitation\nof vulnerabilities and weaknesses.\n\n265\n00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.676\nWe've defined that terminology earlier,\nin one of our prior episodes.\n\n266\n00:12:40.676 --> 00:12:42.630\nAnd we want to make sure that\nyou're thinking about that,\n\n267\n00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.120\nwhich is why we bring it back up again\nin the context of this conversation.\n\n268\n00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:48.830\nOnce we've done those things,\nand we understand what those are,\n\n269\n00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.170\nthere may be some resources on the web\nthat are going to be valuable to us.\n\n270\n00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.670\nSo let's take a look at a couple of\nthem and talk about what they are from\n\n271\n00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.380\nthe perspective of hey where do I go and\nhow do I figure this out.\n\n272\n00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.880\nOne of the most important for\nus to consider and\n\n273\n00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.130\nwe've talked about NIST in a couple\nof different areas already.\n\n274\n00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.490\nYou'll continue to hear me to refer to it\nas we go through other episodes in other\n\n275\n00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.280\nareas of our discussion.\n\n276\n00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.970\nNIST, The National Institute for\nScience and Technology, or\n\n277\n00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.020\nexcuse me, National Institute\nof Standards and Technology,\n\n278\n00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.620\npardon me, in the United States.\n\n279\n00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:18.510\nShame on me as a bad presenter for\nnot getting that right the first time,\n\n280\n00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.300\nI apologize.\n\n281\n00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.270\nWhen you have about 1,000\nacronyms in your head,\n\n282\n00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:24.630\nyou're entitled to be slightly off\non one when you're presenting.\n\n283\n00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:27.080\nSo I got the National Institute\nof Technology part right, so\n\n284\n00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.800\nthat was close enough.\n\n285\n00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.330\nSo NIST, right, is going to be\nthe United States government, let's\n\n286\n00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.440\ntake a bit as a practical documentation\ndistribution arm of the US government.\n\n287\n00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.230\nWhat this does, it is a US government's\nsponsored entity, but what they do is they\n\n288\n00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.480\nfocus on computer security and\ncomputer security related resources.\n\n289\n00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.670\nThey do other stuff as well.\n\n290\n00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.260\nBut focus primarily in computer security,\nand\n\n291\n00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.570\nthey produce a very large\nvolume of documentation.\n\n292\n00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.410\nThey are produced in the form of special\npublications, what are commonly referred\n\n293\n00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:58.910\nto as SP documents, and\nthere are different categories,\n\n294\n00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:03.520\nwe could scroll down just a little and\nmaybe zoom in just a wee bit more.\n\n295\n00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.860\nWe can see that there\nare different categories.\n\n296\n00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.030\nThe SP 800 series deals\nwith computer security.\n\n297\n00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.650\nThe SP 1800 series,\ncybersecurity practice guides.\n\n298\n00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:16.290\nThese are brand new, relatively speaking,\ncompared to the SP 800 guides,\n\n299\n00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:20.690\nthat go back in some cases to the early\n1990's, and the SP 500 series computer\n\n300\n00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:25.300\nsystems technology from the 1970's\nforward, mid-1970's forward.\n\n301\n00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.926\nSo these are all different categories.\n\n302\n00:14:27.926 --> 00:14:29.020\nWhat we're going to focus on and\n\n303\n00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:32.970\njust give you a sense over the SP 800\ncategories for the computer security.\n\n304\n00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.059\nIf you scroll down we'll\nsee them down below.\n\n305\n00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.880\nWe could see that they\nare numerically sequenced, so\n\n306\n00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.420\nthe current last draft that we have\nout now, as of early December of 2015,\n\n307\n00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:47.670\nas we're looking,\nis as you can see SP800178.\n\n308\n00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.280\nThis one has to do with Comparison\nof Attribute Based Access Control,\n\n309\n00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.130\nwhat's called ABAC,\nStandards for Data Services.\n\n310\n00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.710\nSo that's something that's in draft form.\n\n311\n00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.740\nWhen we see draft, what that means is\nthat that is still an emerging standard\n\n312\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.800\nthat has not been formally approved and\nthat not everybody has agreed on.\n\n313\n00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.801\nThen if we go down to something like 800,\nlet's go down below the division\n\n314\n00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:09.630\nannual report, because that's not\none that we would normally look at.\n\n315\n00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:13.066\nLet's just randomly chose 170 there,\nthat's a good one.\n\n316\n00:15:13.066 --> 00:15:17.739\n800-167 there from October of 2015,\nGuide to Application Whitelisting, so\n\n317\n00:15:17.739 --> 00:15:21.500\nthat's a formally recognized\nstandard that's been finalized.\n\n318\n00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.440\nAnd that one, and you can click on any\nof them, I just clicked on that one for\n\n319\n00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.480\nus, and you can see it brings up a PDF\nof however many pages there are, and\n\n320\n00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.780\nit's going to then allow you to see what\nthat information is, who wrote it, and\n\n321\n00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.010\nyou can go back and\nread through it and take a look.\n\n322\n00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:34.780\nNot suggesting,\n\n323\n00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.310\njust to be clear, that this particular\none is of great importance, just pointing\n\n324\n00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:42.180\nout generically this is where you\nwould go to seen this documentation.\n\n325\n00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:45.282\nYou hear me talk about it from time to\ntime, it's always good to go to the source\n\n326\n00:15:45.282 --> 00:15:47.542\nin other words, and\nfind out where to find these things.\n\n327\n00:15:47.542 --> 00:15:53.616\nIn addition to the NIST documentation, we\nalso can delve into something like OWASP.\n\n328\n00:15:53.616 --> 00:15:56.930\nAnd OWASP specifically as you\ncan see on the screen and\n\n329\n00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:01.506\nwe'll go to this web page and zoom in\na little bit, So not quite that much.\n\n330\n00:16:01.506 --> 00:16:05.130\nWow, it's right up against\nthe screen oh my god right?\n\n331\n00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.750\nIt's like in one of those\nmovies where the guy like\n\n332\n00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.110\nfalls right into the camera you see\nthe face smooshed up against the glass.\n\n333\n00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:11.910\nITProTv in 3D.\n\n334\n00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.060\nThere you go exactly right.\n\n335\n00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.330\nSo yeah,\nI can do my whole icon thing logo thing.\n\n336\n00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:21.370\nAll right so the OWASP top ten, the open\nweb application security project is OWASP,\n\n337\n00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:26.940\nfor what OWASP stand for, they put out\na rolling list of top ten issues or\n\n338\n00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.210\nconcerns in this case with regards\nto web application, security.\n\n339\n00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.420\nThey have several different lists\nof things that you should look at.\n\n340\n00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.230\nBut the OWASP Top 10 is\nanother great resource\n\n341\n00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.210\nwhen we think about threat identification.\n\n342\n00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.470\nIt lists the ten or\nthe top ten current vulnerabilities and\n\n343\n00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.780\nconcerns that we should be looking\nat with regards to web application.\n\n344\n00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.380\nOff to the right,\n\n345\n00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.230\nunder the quick download,\nyou will see the quick link to the PDF.\n\n346\n00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:52.030\nSo this list is updated every three years.\n\n347\n00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:56.570\nThis is the current list the 2013 list,\nthis will be updated in 2016.\n\n348\n00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:00.420\nWe'll have a new list out\nduring 2016 at some point.\n\n349\n00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.760\nIt's about a 20 something page PDF.\n\n350\n00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.700\nAnd it lists, among the other items, if we\ncould zoom in on that list right there.\n\n351\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.110\nYou'll see the 2010, which is\nthe prior list that was put together.\n\n352\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:14.270\nAnd they kind of list it off to the left,\nso that was the previous list.\n\n353\n00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:18.120\nThe updated version, which is the current\nversion for 2013, is listed on the right.\n\n354\n00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:24.090\nAnd we can walk down and see that several\nof the listed items, A1 through A5,\n\n355\n00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:29.740\nare going to be very close or similar\nin scope, injection is the top on both.\n\n356\n00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:33.945\nWe have broken authentication and\nsession management is A2.\n\n357\n00:17:33.945 --> 00:17:38.160\nCross-site scripting, what's known as XSS,\nis going to be number three.\n\n358\n00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.620\nLooks like insecure direct object\nreferences is number four, right.\n\n359\n00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:45.140\nSo we have a bunch of those there.\n\n360\n00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.840\nNumber five is security misconfiguration.\n\n361\n00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.800\nAnd there there is some that are\nhighlighted in various colors that have\n\n362\n00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.410\nchanged a little bit, that are different.\n\n363\n00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:56.270\nAnd so from 10 to 13,\nwe've modified or changed a few, but\n\n364\n00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.980\nthe bulk of the list has for\nthe most part stayed the same.\n\n365\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:04.210\nSo being familiar with a list like\nthis helps us to identify threats,\n\n366\n00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:07.040\nhelps us to understand,\nat least specifically in the web space,\n\n367\n00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.530\nwhat kind of threats we\nmay be dealing with.\n\n368\n00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.040\nThis is very important.\n\n369\n00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:13.280\nIf you are a security professional\nthat's asked to give guidance or\n\n370\n00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:18.050\nmake recommendations for secure systems\nthat deal with web-based services today\n\n371\n00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:21.820\nand access data or provide data access\nover the web, if you don't know about\n\n372\n00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:25.140\nthe OWASP top ten and you're not\ntaking advantage of the guidance, it's\n\n373\n00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.750\nsomething you definitely want to start\nthinking about, because it's going to\n\n374\n00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:31.770\ngive you effectively a ready-made set of\ncontrols that could be implemented to help\n\n375\n00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:36.310\nyou secure against the most common forms\nof attacks that occur within the web.\n\n376\n00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:40.110\nSo this is one example of the kind\nof things that as a CISSP or\n\n377\n00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.510\na couple of examples, right,\nin regards to OWASP, that as a CISSP,\n\n378\n00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.390\nwe want to be familiar with,\nwe want to know about.\n\n379\n00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.160\nNow are there hundreds more?\n\n380\n00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.120\nAbsolutely, can you go\nto Google real quick?\n\n381\n00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:52.300\nMike's going to help me out real\nquick while I'm talking to you.\n\n382\n00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:57.900\nIf we can go to Google, and under Google\ntype in top ten security vulnerabilities,\n\n383\n00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.670\nand we're going wait a minute as soon as\nMike brings that up we'll throw that up on\n\n384\n00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:04.080\nthe screen and\nsee what kind of results we get right?\n\n385\n00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.980\nAnd so as soon as he does that,\nand he gets that, and\n\n386\n00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.950\nwe'll flip over to the screen,\nwe'll take a look.\n\n387\n00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:11.950\nWe can zoom in real quick, and we can\nprobably see, and actually what I'm just\n\n388\n00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:15.560\nlooking for, it's not so much,\nbut how many returns did we get.\n\n389\n00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.790\nWhat was the actual number of searches.\n\n390\n00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.740\n>> Let's see, what do we got.\n\n391\n00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.340\n15 million?\n>> 15 million.\n\n392\n00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.440\nNow, we know that out past the first 20 or\n30,\n\n393\n00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.810\nthere's probably not a huge\namount of relevancy.\n\n394\n00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:26.760\nSo 50 million sounds like a big number.\n\n395\n00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.320\nSo you put that on perspective\nbecause 14.999 million of them\n\n396\n00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.190\nare probably not really going to be\nof all that great importance to us,\n\n397\n00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:37.290\nbut reality is your 15 million heads\ncome back for that search term.\n\n398\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:40.920\nImagine how many actual things are out\nthere and what's one of the very top ones\n\n399\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.910\nthere, I think if I'm not mistaken\nOWASP top ten is there right?\n\n400\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.240\nSo we got the OWASP top\nten that's coming up, and\n\n401\n00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.250\nthat's the first several ones that\nare there from different companies.\n\n402\n00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.020\nBut then you've the PHP and\nthe OWASP Top Ten.\n\n403\n00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.430\nSo that's also OWASP.\n\n404\n00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:57.130\nYou see OWASP was there, but then there's\nalso other ones from different vendors.\n\n405\n00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:01.010\nThings like, Top 10 External and\nInternal Vulnerabilities from a company.\n\n406\n00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.800\nFrom this company,\nthat company or whatever.\n\n407\n00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.500\nSo you can see there's a lot there, but\n\n408\n00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.936\nthere's also a lot of other\nthings we can link to.\n\n409\n00:20:06.936 --> 00:20:09.430\nSo we want to think about the fact\nwhen we think about threats and\n\n410\n00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.920\nvulnerabilities, we\nare thinking about a very broad\n\n411\n00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.910\nset of concerns that we may have\nas a security professional.\n\n412\n00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:17.050\nIf you don't do anything with the web,\n\n413\n00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.960\nare you really worried about\nwhat OWASP has to say?\n\n414\n00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.250\nIt's probably not all\nthat relevant to you.\n\n415\n00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:24.230\nBut if your company starts\ndoing web services,\n\n416\n00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:26.360\nit's going to become really\nrelevant very quickly.\n\n417\n00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.950\nI had a customer couple years\nago come through one of\n\n418\n00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:34.750\nmy seminars when I was speaking and\nI had been talking about the cloud and\n\n419\n00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:36.540\nsecurity based\nvulnerabilities in the cloud.\n\n420\n00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.000\nAnd after we got done,\nshe was very polite,\n\n421\n00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.020\nshe sat through the whole presentation.\n\n422\n00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.660\nShe came up to me afterwards and\ntalked to me for a little bit.\n\n423\n00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.410\nShe said you know this is really\ninteresting stuff, I'm glad I came,\n\n424\n00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.130\nI learned a lot, it's very valuable.\n\n425\n00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:48.950\nBut my company has no need for\nthis we're not doing cloud services.\n\n426\n00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.580\nAnd so\nwe had a very interesting conversation.\n\n427\n00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.690\nI said that it's interesting that\nyou're not doing cloud services today.\n\n428\n00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.320\nNot a big deal one way or the other,\nbut you say you have no need for\n\n429\n00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.100\nwhat we talked about.\n\n430\n00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.520\nYou're not doing cloud.\n\n431\n00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.470\nSo we talked a little bit about\nthe fact that cloud may not\n\n432\n00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.280\nbe as obvious as some people think it is.\n\n433\n00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.320\nSo I said hey do you\naccess email by the web?\n\n434\n00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.320\nShe said, yeah,\nwe use a web-based interface,\n\n435\n00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.470\nsomething like Outlook Web Access or\nwhatever it is, to access email.\n\n436\n00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:13.430\nI said great,\ndo you have any people that access this,\n\n437\n00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:17.610\nor are accessing information remotely,\nfrom outside the organization?\n\n438\n00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.720\nRemote teleworkers, right, telecommuters.\n\n439\n00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:20.860\nYeah, we have some of those.\n\n440\n00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.540\nSo I walked her through, so you can\nprobably see where this is going, right?\n\n441\n00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.410\nShe's using the cloud all the time,\nshe just doesn't realize and\n\n442\n00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.975\nas a result of that, what I showed her,\nwas that this conversation's incredibly\n\n443\n00:21:30.975 --> 00:21:33.370\nrelevant to her,\neven though she doesn't realize it is,\n\n444\n00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:37.470\nbecause the definition of cloud is\nreally what she was struggling with.\n\n445\n00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.390\nNot the fact that she needed to secure it.\n\n446\n00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:40.820\nShe just bypassed the thought process,\n\n447\n00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:42.630\nbecause she didn't think she needed to,\nbut\n\n448\n00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.950\nwe pointed out to her that she actually is\nusing the same technology that she thought\n\n449\n00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.750\nreally didn't make sense and as a result\ndidn't have to pay attention to.\n\n450\n00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.080\nNow I'm not saying she didn't have\nsecurity regimes in place to protect email\n\n451\n00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.580\nand things like that, she did.\n\n452\n00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.320\nThe leap of faith she had to make\nwas that thinking about those\n\n453\n00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.500\ntechnologies in relation to\nthe threats associated with cloud,\n\n454\n00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.970\nopened her mind up to different ways\nof approaching and managing that.\n\n455\n00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.320\nThat she wasn't seeing,\nwasn't making the connection with,\n\n456\n00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.580\nbecause she didn't think they\nwere related to the cloud.\n\n457\n00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.430\nThis is one of the things CISSPs do and\ndo every day.\n\n458\n00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.880\nWe make the simple very,\nvery easily approachable for people.\n\n459\n00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.020\nWe make the complex something that\npeople can have a dialogue about.\n\n460\n00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:22.440\nIt's our job to translate the complex\ninto something that the company and\n\n461\n00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.980\nthe organization can have a dialogue\nabout, whether it's through identification\n\n462\n00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:29.110\nthreat, whether it's through management\nof risk, whether it's through\n\n463\n00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:33.400\ntangible explanation, quantifiable\nin qualitative assessment of risk.\n\n464\n00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.420\nWhether it's through penetration\ntesting and vulnerability assessment.\n\n465\n00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.300\nAnd then the reporting\nof that information.\n\n466\n00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:42.760\nIf you're not able to do those things\nas a security professional today,\n\n467\n00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:45.850\nit is very unlikely that you are going\nto be successful ultimately.\n\n468\n00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:49.550\nYou will become the CISSP, I'm not\nsuggesting you won't be able to do that.\n\n469\n00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.390\nYou'll study hard, and you will most\nlikely pass and take and therefore,\n\n470\n00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:54.460\nultimately, certify out through the exam.\n\n471\n00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.660\nBut the really challenge to that is\nthat how do you then take that and\n\n472\n00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.320\nactually use that everyday,\nbecome better at what you do?\n\n473\n00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.770\nIt's hard, don't get me wrong,\nit's very hard to pass this exam.\n\n474\n00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.480\nIt's 250 questions, right.\n\n475\n00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.780\nIt's six hours of sitting in one place,\nanswering questions.\n\n476\n00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.250\nI don't like to do much of anything for\n\n477\n00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:11.400\nsix hours-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n478\n00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.150\n>> in a row, right, let alone sit and\n\n479\n00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.150\nanswer questions.\n\n480\n00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:15.500\nNow I took the test years ago.\n\n481\n00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.662\nI took it the old school way where it was\na Scantron sheet with the bubble answer\n\n482\n00:23:18.662 --> 00:23:21.045\ngrid, [CROSSTALK] and\nyou had a number two pencil, right,\n\n483\n00:23:21.045 --> 00:23:22.813\njust like back in the old\ndays with school.\n\n484\n00:23:22.813 --> 00:23:27.280\nAnd most of you that are listening to\nthis now are probably not already CISPs.\n\n485\n00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.306\nA piece of the reality is you're going\nto go out and try to become one.\n\n486\n00:23:29.306 --> 00:23:32.460\nSo you're going to take the test\nnow using computer testing,\n\n487\n00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:34.700\nwhich is how we've been doing\nthe exams for several years.\n\n488\n00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.906\nYou're still going to answer questions,\nbut you're going to do it in a point and\n\n489\n00:23:36.906 --> 00:23:37.760\nclick environment.\n\n490\n00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.580\nIt's no less fun,\nit's very exciting to sit and\n\n491\n00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.470\nanswer questions six hours either way.\n\n492\n00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:46.960\nBut my point is listen,while it's very\nhard to do this and to become successful\n\n493\n00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:51.260\nat passing the exam, it is the easiest\nof all the challenges in front of you.\n\n494\n00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.670\nBecause once you pass that exam, put those\nletter after your name, if you apply and\n\n495\n00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:59.774\nyou are given the status of a CISSP,\nhopefully one in good standing, right?\n\n496\n00:23:59.774 --> 00:24:01.262\nCuz you're gonna subscribe\nto the code of ethics.\n\n497\n00:24:01.262 --> 00:24:02.580\nWe know how important that is.\n\n498\n00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:04.889\nOnce you've done that,\nthe challenge really begins.\n\n499\n00:24:04.889 --> 00:24:08.594\nBecause the hard part is now how do I put\nmy skills to work for the organization or\n\n500\n00:24:08.594 --> 00:24:10.800\nwhatever you're gonna\ndo with those skills.\n\n501\n00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.690\nHow do I put them to work in\nthe business or as a consultant for\n\n502\n00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.620\nmany businesses to actually make the world\na safer place, to make it more secure?\n\n503\n00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.760\nI don't make light of it, I also\ndon't spend a lot of time on it, but\n\n504\n00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.680\nthis is what CISSPs do.\n\n505\n00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.580\nWe are the superheros of\nthe information security world, right?\n\n506\n00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.780\nBecause we make the world\na safer place for\n\n507\n00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.460\nthose that we are ultimately\nsworn to protect.\n\n508\n00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.200\nIt's our job to implement policies.\n\n509\n00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.000\nIt's our job to make the systems\nthat we are accountable for\n\n510\n00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.140\nand ultimately responsible for\nmore secure.\n\n511\n00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.550\nThat's what superheroes do every day.\n\n512\n00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.520\nYou don't see me with\nmy cape on right now.\n\n513\n00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.370\nI took my mask off so you could see me.\n\n514\n00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:43.345\nBut I have it in the back.\n\n515\n00:24:43.345 --> 00:24:47.355\nMike was trying it on early before we got\non and he was running around the studio.\n\n516\n00:24:47.355 --> 00:24:49.765\nWe got a blooper reel we may\nshow you at one point later.\n\n517\n00:24:49.765 --> 00:24:52.525\nHe was trying to fly it\ndidn't end very well but.\n\n518\n00:24:52.525 --> 00:24:56.057\nSo you know the reality is becoming\na CISSP is the easy part the journey\n\n519\n00:24:56.057 --> 00:24:59.827\nthat you take is not hard by comparison\nto the work you do afterwards,\n\n520\n00:24:59.827 --> 00:25:01.077\nwhen you become certified.\n\n521\n00:25:01.077 --> 00:25:03.947\nSo think about that as we wrap up\nour conversations around threat and\n\n522\n00:25:03.947 --> 00:25:05.857\nthreat management, and\nidentification of threat.\n\n523\n00:25:05.857 --> 00:25:10.297\nBecause this is really ultimately what\nyou're signing on to do, manage risk,\n\n524\n00:25:10.297 --> 00:25:11.680\nidentify threats.\n\n525\n00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.800\nEngage in that dialogue at the corporate\nlevel inside the organization\n\n526\n00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.790\nday in and day out.\n\n527\n00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.030\nRelentlessly.\n\n528\n00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.070\nRelentlessly.\n\n529\n00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.620\nRight?\n\n530\n00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.540\nGo through those activities and\nfigure out how to make everything better.\n\n531\n00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.230\nAnd there are gonna be days when\nyou wake up, go to work, and\n\n532\n00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.500\nnothing works the right way.\n\n533\n00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:26.460\nRight?\nIt's a bad day.\n\n534\n00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:27.690\nThose are usually Mondays, by the way.\n\n535\n00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.170\nSo if you skip Mondays,\nTuesdays are typically better.\n\n536\n00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:31.550\nRight?\nSo if you go in and\n\n537\n00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.660\nnothing is working the right way,\nyou've had a problem and\n\n538\n00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.410\nit's just getting worse by the day?\n\n539\n00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.180\nThose are days you dread, but listen,\nevery organization in the world,\n\n540\n00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.490\nevery business, every job has those days.\n\n541\n00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:43.295\nThey're not unique to us, it's just\nthat we get to play with really cool,\n\n542\n00:25:43.295 --> 00:25:46.265\nhigh-priced technology, which makes\nthem more exciting ultimately, right?\n\n543\n00:25:46.265 --> 00:25:47.060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n544\n00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.540\nwe're going to wrap up\nthis particular episode.\n\n545\n00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.290\nAnd we're gonna come back and\ntalk about some cool and exciting things.\n\n546\n00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.140\nPlease remember the five step\nmethodology for pen testing.\n\n547\n00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:58.790\nPlease remember the definitions of all\nthe terminology we share with you,\n\n548\n00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.870\nwhether it's threat event, threat source.\n\n549\n00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:02.190\nWhether it is vulnerability,\n\n550\n00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:06.700\nwhether it is the types of knowledge\nwe need to engage in a pen test, right?\n\n551\n00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.460\nThere are three,\nyou should know what they are.\n\n552\n00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:12.400\nWhether it is the different kinds of\npenetration testing, there are four types.\n\n553\n00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.500\nKnow what they are.\n\n554\n00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.920\nRight?\nMake sure you know all that stuff.\n\n555\n00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.770\nRemember, we talked about mile wide,\ninch deep.\n\n556\n00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:21.180\nMile wide and inch deep is\nthe mantra of the CISSP candidate.\n\n557\n00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.870\nIt's something if you can say over and\nover again, ultimately get it into your\n\n558\n00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:28.209\nhead as you're studying, you'll be\nsuccess at taking and passing this exam.\n\n559\n00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.995\n>> Very good Adam we appreciate it a lot\nof great information there learning that\n\n560\n00:26:32.995 --> 00:26:35.845\nthreat modeling and\nthat penetration test methodology and\n\n561\n00:26:35.845 --> 00:26:38.470\na couple great resources\nthat he pointed out, right?\n\n562\n00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:42.840\nUsing those niche special publications and\nOSP's top ten list.\n\n563\n00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:47.400\nStuff that we can use as we're\npreparing to get certified as CISSP.\n\n564\n00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.526\nWe thank you for that Adam and we\nappreciate everybody out there watching.\n\n565\n00:26:50.526 --> 00:26:54.555\nRemember if you want to attend\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n566\n00:26:54.555 --> 00:26:57.408\ndrop us an email at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n567\n00:26:57.408 --> 00:27:01.360\nThat's gonna do it for now,\nsigning off, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n568\n00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.510\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n569\n00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:03.820\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n570\n00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:04.522\n>> Take care everybody.\n\n571\n00:27:04.522 --> 00:27:09.802\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:20.270\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\ntoday we're doing our CISSP and\n\n4\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.530\nspecifically we're gonna be going\ninto risk acquisition strategy.\n\n5\n00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.590\nAll right, we've gotta think about\nwhat happens when our network,\n\n6\n00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.380\nour organization, starts to grow.\n\n7\n00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.440\nWe start bringing in new hardware.\n\n8\n00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.580\nWhere do we get that from, what are the\nsecurity risks associated with that?\n\n9\n00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.400\nWe start outsourcing to third party\nproviders, what do we have to think about?\n\n10\n00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.070\nAnd here to help with all of that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.920\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.360\n>> Good, how is everybody doing today?\n\n13\n00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.980\nHopefully it's a good\nweather day where you are.\n\n14\n00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.770\n>> Yeah, not so much-\n>> Not so much for us, but that's okay.\n\n15\n00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.630\nAll right, so it's good to talk about risk\nand we've talked a lot about risk and\n\n16\n00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:57.340\nit's good, obviously,\n\n17\n00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.560\nto be aware of risk in many different\nareas for many different reasons, right?\n\n18\n00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.250\nSo when we think about risk and\nwe think about acquisition and\n\n19\n00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.000\nacquisition strategy and\nhow we manage risk in the supply chain,\n\n20\n00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.900\nwhat we wanna do is actually step back for\na minute.\n\n21\n00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.220\nAnd what we wanna really think about\nfirst is what are the potential vectors,\n\n22\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.870\nthe potential places where risk\nmay come into the organization?\n\n23\n00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.180\nWe talked a lot about threat sources,\nthreat actors, bad actors.\n\n24\n00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.130\nPeople, services, malware,\nthings that are looking to do us harm.\n\n25\n00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.670\nWe know from our prior episode\nconversations about risk that this is one\n\n26\n00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.950\nof the places, probably the primary place,\nwhere we focus on the impact of risk\n\n27\n00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.830\nbecause we think about threat sources,\nleading to threat events, threat events\n\n28\n00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.900\nultimately lead to the likelihood that a\nvulnerability will become exploited, which\n\n29\n00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.170\neventually, depending on what happens and\nhow we deal with that through mitigation,\n\n30\n00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.550\nacceptance, transference, and/or avoidance\nof risk, may lead to organizational risk,\n\n31\n00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.130\nand we have to then measure, quantify,\nwhat that risk may look like from\n\n32\n00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.960\nan impact perspective, and\nwe have to think about qualitatively\n\n33\n00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.850\nmeasuring what the impact of that risk\nis in a soft, as opposed to a hard, way.\n\n34\n00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.240\nSo we've talked about all this already.\n\n35\n00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.880\nWell, we haven't really linked to this\nconversation is what some of the potential\n\n36\n00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.590\nattacks, the places where we actually\nsee this happening can occur from.\n\n37\n00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.630\nAnd I think a great way to start talking\nabout acquisition strategies is by looking\n\n38\n00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.220\nat places where we may fall prey to or\nbe subject to attack and be aware of those\n\n39\n00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.520\nhelps us to frame the conversation about\nwhat we look to do when we protect not\n\n40\n00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.440\nonly the supply chain but protect the\ninformation of the systems that come to us\n\n41\n00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.160\nthrough that outsourcing or\nreciprocal arrangement when we contract.\n\n42\n00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.980\nSo if we step back and\nthink about things like social engineering\n\n43\n00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.580\nas an attack vector,\nwhat does that mean to us?\n\n44\n00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.040\nIt means typically that people that\nare gonna have information in our\n\n45\n00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.780\norganizations may be targeted, all right.\n\n46\n00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.140\nSomebody may walk up to them and try to\nask them questions, seemingly innocently.\n\n47\n00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.280\nHey, I see you've got an ITProTV shirt on.\n\n48\n00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.810\nI'd point to mine but\nI don't have one on today, right.\n\n49\n00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.730\nBut an ITProTV shirt and\nthat must mean you work for them,\n\n50\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:52.690\nthat's a really cool company.\n\n51\n00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.060\nI've heard a little about them, but\nI'm not really sure what you do.\n\n52\n00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.930\nCan you tell me a little\nabout what ITProTV does?\n\n53\n00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.450\nThat's a pretty seemingly\ninnocent conversation.\n\n54\n00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.979\nThe reality is if I'm trying to get\ninformation out of you about not just what\n\n55\n00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:07.510\nit is but more importantly I work into\nthe conversation at some point, hey so\n\n56\n00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.515\nwhere are those studios you talked about?\n\n57\n00:03:09.515 --> 00:03:10.771\nWhere are they located, right?\n\n58\n00:03:10.771 --> 00:03:15.792\nAnd maybe you say oh yeah, they're at\nABC Corps on the corner of Circle Lane and\n\n59\n00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:20.240\nSquare Drive, right, and\nour address is 123 Circle Lane.\n\n60\n00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.060\nOkay, I probably didn't need\nto know that information.\n\n61\n00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.270\nYou telling me that is probably not a good\nthing for you and it's a good thing for\n\n62\n00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.050\nme as the potential attacker cuz now I\nhave a very useful piece of information.\n\n63\n00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.150\nI've got a geographic location,\nan address as to where I may actually go\n\n64\n00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.355\nif I wanna physically\nbe able to observe and\n\n65\n00:03:38.355 --> 00:03:40.925\nmaybe even attack systems\nthat are located there.\n\n66\n00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:44.675\nOr have a logical way of figuring out now\nwhere those systems are because you've\n\n67\n00:03:44.675 --> 00:03:47.385\ngiven me the physical location for\nwhere the studios are.\n\n68\n00:03:47.385 --> 00:03:50.145\nSo a lot of times people\nare just innocently talking.\n\n69\n00:03:50.145 --> 00:03:52.425\nThey're innocently being\nasked to do something.\n\n70\n00:03:52.425 --> 00:03:55.005\nYou see somebody carrying\na stack of boxes, right,\n\n71\n00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:58.675\nand they're kind of wobbling down the road\ntrying to walk in and get into a building.\n\n72\n00:03:58.675 --> 00:04:02.180\nAnd everything's falling down,\nyou know the typical human\n\n73\n00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.830\nperspective on that is right, if you're\na nice person what are you gonna do.\n\n74\n00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.970\nYou're gonna go and probably either offer\nto help them, hey let me take some of\n\n75\n00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.110\nthat from you, or at least let me hold the\ndoor open for you cuz you're clearly not\n\n76\n00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.010\ngonna be able to get to the door and\nopen it up and do all that.\n\n77\n00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.935\nWell if the door is a security control,\nand it's there as a physical control\n\n78\n00:04:18.935 --> 00:04:21.540\nto prevent unauthorized\npeople from walking in.\n\n79\n00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.760\nWhat if that person doesn't belong there?\n\n80\n00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.350\nWhat if they've just done that\neffectively to trick somebody\n\n81\n00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.340\ninto doing the exact thing you're\nabout to by being a nice person?\n\n82\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.200\nCarding in and\nopening the door for them so\n\n83\n00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.360\nthat they can walk in, potentially right\nunder the guise of delivering their boxes.\n\n84\n00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.080\nBut the reality is now they've\neffectively gotten past\n\n85\n00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.570\none of the security parameters.\n\n86\n00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.380\nThey've breached at least one of\nthe rings in the defensive depth\n\n87\n00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.820\narchitecture we've built.\n\n88\n00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.590\nAnd again, seemingly innocently, right?\n\n89\n00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.900\nI mean, what's the average response?\n\n90\n00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.050\nI want to help that person.\n\n91\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.170\nI want to be nice.\n\n92\n00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.850\nThat's okay.\nThere's nothing wrong with that,\n\n93\n00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.590\nI'm not suggesting you should\ngo through life now forevermore\n\n94\n00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.420\nignoring the plight of\npeople that need help.\n\n95\n00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.420\nIt's not what being a good information\nsecurity professional is about.\n\n96\n00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.800\nRemember the code of ethics, right?\n\n97\n00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.870\nAct honorably, act justly.\n\n98\n00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.100\nAlways make sure you help\nthose that need help.\n\n99\n00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.330\nThat's important.\n\n100\n00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.850\nBut what I wanna point out to you is when\nwe think about something like social\n\n101\n00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.000\nengineering, it's the common things\nthat people look to take advantage of\n\n102\n00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.250\nthat we just don't necessarily stop and\nthink about that can cause us harm.\n\n103\n00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.490\nAnd so I wanna think about\nthese kinds of attacks.\n\n104\n00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.260\nThings like, specifically something like\na pretexting attack which is a form of\n\n105\n00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.970\nsocial engineering attack that effectively\nallows somebody to pretend to do something\n\n106\n00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.230\nin order to gain help or\nto gain information.\n\n107\n00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.915\nYou like travel a great deal for\nmy work and for what I do.\n\n108\n00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:34.155\nI'm in airports all the time.\n\n109\n00:05:34.155 --> 00:05:35.165\nI'm always in new cities.\n\n110\n00:05:35.165 --> 00:05:38.305\nI'm always spending time with\ncustomers in their environments.\n\n111\n00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:39.865\nRight.\nWalking into their buildings,\n\n112\n00:05:39.865 --> 00:05:41.665\ndealing with them in their world.\n\n113\n00:05:41.665 --> 00:05:44.223\nAnd I have to travel a lot\nto get to those places.\n\n114\n00:05:44.223 --> 00:05:49.082\nI spend enormanently amounts of time\non planes looking at people violating\n\n115\n00:05:49.082 --> 00:05:54.029\nthe most common sensible rules of\ninformation security on a regular basis.\n\n116\n00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:57.194\nPeople working on proprietary,\nintellectual property,\n\n117\n00:05:57.194 --> 00:06:01.115\nfinancial documents, legal documents,\nall sorts of stuff on laptops,\n\n118\n00:06:01.115 --> 00:06:04.279\nwithout glare screens with no\nthought really around who's\n\n119\n00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:07.214\naround them in the plane\nlooking at this information.\n\n120\n00:06:07.214 --> 00:06:11.277\nWe've made it so easy today to effectively\nextend the thought process of remote\n\n121\n00:06:11.277 --> 00:06:15.535\nworking to traveling, because you have\nInternet access, you're comfortable.\n\n122\n00:06:15.535 --> 00:06:17.735\nWell, relatively speaking,\ndepending where you sit in the plane.\n\n123\n00:06:17.735 --> 00:06:20.695\nBut in theory anyway, you've got a seat,\nyou got a table of some sort.\n\n124\n00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:23.565\nYou've got lots of time on your hands,\ndepending on the flight, and most people\n\n125\n00:06:23.565 --> 00:06:26.615\nbring their computers, at least if\nyou're traveling on business anyway.\n\n126\n00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:29.840\nAnd so as a result,\nyou see people working all the time.\n\n127\n00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.040\nAgain if I was a bad actor,\n\n128\n00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.350\nif I was somebody looking to do harm,\nI wouldn't have to do this anymore, right?\n\n129\n00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.650\n[LAUGH] I could just decide that I'm\ngonna go out spend some time on a plane,\n\n130\n00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.600\nfigure out all the information I need\nto know about these companies, and\n\n131\n00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.070\nI could just put that to use and\nI would never have to work again, right?\n\n132\n00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.260\nSo the reality is it's very difficult for\nus to instill in the mind of the end user,\n\n133\n00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.070\nthe mind of the person that\nis consuming information and\n\n134\n00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.880\nservices, even through a contractual\nagreement, the need for security.\n\n135\n00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.680\nAnd this is really the focus\nof this conversation.\n\n136\n00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.240\nWe talked about phishing attacks already\nseveral times in prior episodes, the idea\n\n137\n00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.710\nof sending unsolicited email to somebody\nwith a hope of tricking them into clicking\n\n138\n00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:11.748\non a link or doing something like that, in\norder to respond and give us information.\n\n139\n00:07:11.748 --> 00:07:15.360\nMaybe resetting the user name and\nthe password, at least under the guise of\n\n140\n00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.470\ndoing that anyway, thinking they're\nsubmitting that information to IT for\n\n141\n00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.890\nsupport or for reset, when in fact\nthey're sending it to the hacker,\n\n142\n00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.380\nwho's gonna use it to\nbreak into a system later.\n\n143\n00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.890\nBaiting attacks,\nwhere we leave information such as a USB\n\n144\n00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.380\ndrive sitting on the floor, and then,\nyou know, everybody walks by it, and\n\n145\n00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.370\nwe wait to see who picks it up and\nplugs it into a machine.\n\n146\n00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.171\nThere's a great, really great video out\nthere, if you just Google baiting attacks,\n\n147\n00:07:40.171 --> 00:07:43.130\nas in baiting a hook like fishing,\nbaiting attacks,\n\n148\n00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.906\nyou'll find several videos out there that\npeople have done just about this concept.\n\n149\n00:07:47.906 --> 00:07:51.548\nYou know kind of a spy camera concept,\ndropping something on the floor waiting\n\n150\n00:07:51.548 --> 00:07:54.046\nfor people to pick it up and\nthen seeing what happens.\n\n151\n00:07:54.046 --> 00:07:55.276\nAnd this happens all the time.\n\n152\n00:07:55.276 --> 00:08:00.493\nI mean, I can probably On more than one or\ntwo hands count the number of times I've\n\n153\n00:08:00.493 --> 00:08:05.630\ndone this during pen testing or\nvulnerability assessments for customers.\n\n154\n00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.650\nAnd almost without exception every\ntime somebody picks that thing up,\n\n155\n00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.130\ntakes it in the building, plugs it in,\nand we figure out how to then,\n\n156\n00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.110\nfrom that point, break into systems.\n\n157\n00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:17.670\nBecause we're able to install malware,\ninstall a remote access trojan, whatever's\n\n158\n00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.130\non there that we're using during\nthe test to gain access to a system.\n\n159\n00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.220\nSo this happens and\nit happens quite a bit.\n\n160\n00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.290\nTail gating attacks and I mentioned this\nand explained this when I said somebody\n\n161\n00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.290\nmay open the door for you and\nhold it open while you're walking in.\n\n162\n00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.880\nThese are different kinds of attacks.\n\n163\n00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.390\nWanna to make sure we're\ncomfortable with them.\n\n164\n00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.640\nAnd we understand what happens with them,\n\n165\n00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.170\nbecause our goal is ultimately\nto reduce security risk.\n\n166\n00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:41.250\nAnd if we can train people,\nmake them aware of what they need to do.\n\n167\n00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.000\nWhat we call it in the military or\nin those kind of circles is operational or\n\n168\n00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.360\nsituational awareness, right?\n\n169\n00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.910\nIf you're paying attention to\nwhat's going on around you, you're\n\n170\n00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:52.920\nmuch more likely not to fall prey to\nthings that normally may distract you and\n\n171\n00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.500\nmay cause you not to pay attention.\n\n172\n00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.295\nSo if you're focused and you're aware,\nthese are the critical traits we wanna try\n\n173\n00:08:58.295 --> 00:09:00.670\nto instill in people through\nsecurity awareness and training.\n\n174\n00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:02.190\nThis is important.\n\n175\n00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.200\nHow do we translate that out\nto an acquisition strategy and\n\n176\n00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.970\nmanaging acquisition risk?\n\n177\n00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.620\nWell we have to work with our vendors.\n\n178\n00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.460\nWe have to think about\nwhat kind of information,\n\n179\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.470\nwhat kind of system access\nwe're allowing them to have.\n\n180\n00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:18.390\nMost of you listening to our conversations\nmay or may not be familiar specifically\n\n181\n00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.480\nwith the details of what happened\nwith Target and the Target breach.\n\n182\n00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.210\nThat occurred roughly\nabout 18 months ago now.\n\n183\n00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.610\nBut, if you are generically\nfamiliar with the idea behind it,\n\n184\n00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:32.180\nwhat basically happened is that a vendor,\nusing a control system,\n\n185\n00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:35.650\na HVAC vendor, so basically someone who's\nworking on heating, electricity and\n\n186\n00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:40.920\nair conditioner related things in stores\nwas able to gain access to systems and\n\n187\n00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.110\nwas given access legitimately\nto do their job.\n\n188\n00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.400\nThey had to get into certain systems,\nbe able to do certain things.\n\n189\n00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.860\nThe problem wasn't the HVAC\nvendor was a bad actor.\n\n190\n00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.660\nThe problem was that the system\nprovisioning that took place inside Target\n\n191\n00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.400\nthrough IT to give the vendor\naccess was not managed correctly.\n\n192\n00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.710\nAnd as a result of that, the vendors\naccess was granted in such a way\n\n193\n00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.610\nthat they didn't just have access\nto the HVAC control systems, but\n\n194\n00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.080\nthey actually had access to other\nareas of the IT infrastructure.\n\n195\n00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.230\nThey didn't realize that at the time and\nnobody knew that, except of course for\n\n196\n00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.950\nthe bad actors that figured out that\nthey could use that to their advantage.\n\n197\n00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.850\nAnd they were able to get into the back\noffice systems and effectively,\n\n198\n00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:20.540\nas a result parlay that access that\nwas incorrectly granted, and as\n\n199\n00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.710\na result of that effectively gain access\nto systems that we should've never seen.\n\n200\n00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.320\nThat was what really sat at the heart\nof this issue, and it became a very,\n\n201\n00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.600\nvery big problem, not only for\nTarget but for a lot of their customers.\n\n202\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.430\nMillions of people account information,\ncredit card numbers,\n\n203\n00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:37.670\nthings of that nature were potentially\nexposed during that breach.\n\n204\n00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.530\nThis kind of issue is really what\nwe're talking about, this exact thing.\n\n205\n00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:46.020\nHow do we reduce the risk profile, or what\nwe call the risk attack surface, right?\n\n206\n00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.560\nHow do we reduce that,\nnot just for the company, but for\n\n207\n00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.720\neverybody that works\nwith us contractually.\n\n208\n00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.330\nBecause if we're not focused on awareness,\nif we're not focused on training,\n\n209\n00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.690\nif we're not focused on making sure\nthat our vendors are subject to\n\n210\n00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.990\nthe same security assessments, the same\nsecurity awareness training requirements,\n\n211\n00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.320\nthe same vulnerability assessments and\n\n212\n00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.950\npenetration testings and\naudit requirements that we use.\n\n213\n00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.430\nContractually, we are basically\naccepting blindly\n\n214\n00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.180\nwhatever risk they bring\ninto the equation.\n\n215\n00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:15.630\nAnd we may not realize that they have or\n\n216\n00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:18.170\ndon't have the same standards\nin place that we do.\n\n217\n00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.059\nIt comes down ultimately to the idea of\nthrough contractual negotiations, and\n\n218\n00:11:22.059 --> 00:11:25.715\ncontractual requirements of mandating\nthat your vendors are gonna follow\n\n219\n00:11:25.715 --> 00:11:27.580\nthe same standards you do.\n\n220\n00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:31.890\nAs a CISSP, one of the key things\nyou have to think about doing\n\n221\n00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.740\nis focusing the organization on\nthe management identification,\n\n222\n00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.350\nit's really a management of risk.\n\n223\n00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.940\nAnd we've talked a lot about\nthe ways in which we do that.\n\n224\n00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.140\nIf you're not able to do\nthat inside the organization\n\n225\n00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:45.840\nthere's no way you're ever going\nto do it outside the organization.\n\n226\n00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.770\nBut if you're really good at doing\nit in the organization why aren't we\n\n227\n00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.670\nextending that thought process\nto the external vendors and\n\n228\n00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.300\ntrusted partners that come\nin through federation.\n\n229\n00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.890\nAnd that's the logical question and\n\n230\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.170\nthat's really the thing we\ngotta figure out how to do.\n\n231\n00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:01.100\nSo reducing security risks\nbecomes very important.\n\n232\n00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.660\nOne of the ways we do that is\ncontractually as I mentioned\n\n233\n00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.580\nthrough agreements such as service level\nagreements and stipulating what are called\n\n234\n00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.050\nservice level requirements that\nare gonna basically build up and\n\n235\n00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:15.350\nstipulate what the building blocks or\nthe necessary items are in the agreement.\n\n236\n00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:19.630\nWhen you sign a hosting agreement with\na company for a cloud service, Microsoft,\n\n237\n00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.740\nGoogle, Amazon, whoever it is, you are\nbeing given a list of things you can and\n\n238\n00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.630\ncannot do as a customer based on\nthe requirements the vendor has and\n\n239\n00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.490\nwhat they've specified.\n\n240\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.780\nAnd said to you effectively,\nin exchange for your money for\n\n241\n00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.710\nus to offer you goods and\nservices you're gonna behave this way,\n\n242\n00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:37.950\nyou're gonna consume this way,\nyou're gonna operate this way.\n\n243\n00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.320\nSo effectively, you're gonna\npay attention to our rules, and\n\n244\n00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.130\nuse our system with our rules.\n\n245\n00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.040\nEffectively, that's what the hosting\nagreement basically says.\n\n246\n00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.230\nAnd then there's some other stuff in\nthere, certainly, about uptime and\n\n247\n00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:50.170\nescalations and things of that nature.\n\n248\n00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.190\nIf there's a problem,\nhow do I fix the problem?\n\n249\n00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.630\nWho do I talk to, what do I do?\n\n250\n00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.000\nThat stuff's there as well.\n\n251\n00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.340\nBut the rules of engagement,\nthe rules that stipulate\n\n252\n00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:02.760\nhow you're gonna consume that service are\nvery clearly documented in that agreement.\n\n253\n00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.040\nThere's no reason why you should not be\nusing that same thought process with your\n\n254\n00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.040\nvendors to extend that information,\nthat thought process,\n\n255\n00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.430\nout to them by way of\nreducing security risk.\n\n256\n00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.060\nIt becomes very important and\n\n257\n00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.510\nit's one of those things that no matter\nhow many times we talk about and\n\n258\n00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:20.020\nwhile it makes great sense on paper and\nyou hear us talk about it.\n\n259\n00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.290\nAnd you know Mike's listening to me and\nnodding his head, going yeah that's good\n\n260\n00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.930\nstuff, that's exactly what they need\nto do, everybody should do that.\n\n261\n00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.860\nAnd that's right you should.\n\n262\n00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.200\nBut than we look at the real\nworld that we see time and\n\n263\n00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.840\ntime again that people don't\nact with common sense.\n\n264\n00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.710\nRight?\nAnd so\n\n265\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.380\nwhile we know it's important we also\nrealize that it's just not always\n\n266\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.660\ndone regardless of how much sense it\nmay make you just don't always do it.\n\n267\n00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.990\nWe talked a lot in at least one or\ntwo other prior episodes\n\n268\n00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.020\nabout the fact that misguidance in\nparticular to be very helpful here.\n\n269\n00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.540\nThings that may be valuable to you\nthat instantly be offered to you.\n\n270\n00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.021\nWe actually took you out website showed\nyou where to find those documents.\n\n271\n00:13:56.021 --> 00:14:00.070\nThere are many of them NIST 100 61 r2,\n\n272\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:04.780\nwhich is the computer security\nincident handling guide.\n\n273\n00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.930\nNIST 800 81-2, securing DNS.\n\n274\n00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.200\nThese are just examples of some of\nthe documents that will be valuable\n\n275\n00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.466\nas we look at reducing risk and\nattack surfaces within the organization.\n\n276\n00:14:14.466 --> 00:14:20.224\n840-R3 or Rev3,\nguide to enterprise patch management,\n\n277\n00:14:20.224 --> 00:14:23.110\nanother really important one.\n\n278\n00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.340\n882R1, the guide to ICS,\nindustrial control systems and\n\n279\n00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.270\nhow we deal with securing them.\n\n280\n00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.720\nThat may or may not be something you deal\nwith directly, but if you do, it's a huge,\n\n281\n00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.620\nhuge area and\n\n282\n00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.338\na very large amount of risk that we have\nto address in industrial control systems.\n\n283\n00:14:37.338 --> 00:14:41.520\nToday, 883 R1, Guide to Malware Incident\nPrevention and Handling for desktops and\n\n284\n00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.358\nlaptops.\n\n285\n00:14:42.358 --> 00:14:46.260\nThere's probably 20 different\nNIST guides in that 800 series\n\n286\n00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.230\nthat are valuable to this conversation.\n\n287\n00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.950\nI'm simply throwing out three or\nfour examples not indicating in any way,\n\n288\n00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.800\nshape or form, let me be clear,\nthat I expect you to go run out,\n\n289\n00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.540\ndownload those and read them in\norder to prepare for the exam.\n\n290\n00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.680\nQuite the opposite.\n\n291\n00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.980\nThis is not an exam about\nNIST documentation standards.\n\n292\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.800\nIt's an exam about mastering\ninformation security knowledge.\n\n293\n00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.730\nNIST plays a part in\nacquisition of that knowledge.\n\n294\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.080\nBut unless you have a need\nspecific to that area,\n\n295\n00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:13.890\nthere's no reason to read\nthat documentation right now.\n\n296\n00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:15.390\nThere's a great need for you to go out and\n\n297\n00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:19.640\nlook at it as you apply the skills that we\ntalked about in any of our episodes across\n\n298\n00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.410\nthe entire set of discussions\nwe're having to the real world.\n\n299\n00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:24.880\nYou wanna go do this for real.\n\n300\n00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.600\nYou need some guidance on how\nto deal with supply chain risk.\n\n301\n00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.050\nLook up in the NIST document\nthat helps you to do that.\n\n302\n00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.700\nRead it.\n\n303\n00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.470\nImplement the guidance you find there.\n\n304\n00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.550\nYou'll be a lot happier\nabout the outcomes.\n\n305\n00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:36.970\nBut we're not suggesting you\ngo study that right now in\n\n306\n00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.140\norder to prepare for the exam.\n\n307\n00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.900\nRemember, we have to deal with risk\nacross all the areas of the organization.\n\n308\n00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.300\nWe have to deal acquisition strategy\nrelated risk across all the areas of\n\n309\n00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.550\nthe organization.\n\n310\n00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:52.023\nHardware, software, services\nare typically the areas that we focus on.\n\n311\n00:15:52.023 --> 00:15:55.178\nServices typically is where we\nbring in the external vendors, and\n\n312\n00:15:55.178 --> 00:15:57.217\nthe contractors as we were talking about.\n\n313\n00:15:57.217 --> 00:16:00.424\nBut hardware and software is a place\nwhere we don't always think about that.\n\n314\n00:16:00.424 --> 00:16:03.470\nBut we are buying from external sources,\nright.\n\n315\n00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.460\nI mean unless you are in the habit\nof building your own software.\n\n316\n00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.220\nAnd some people are.\n\n317\n00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.770\nSome people develop their own products and\nservices.\n\n318\n00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.130\nBut even then,\nyou're probably buying hardware.\n\n319\n00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.580\nMost of us don't build our own\nhardware from the ground up.\n\n320\n00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.770\nYou may buy components and build servers,\nbut you're still buying those chips and\n\n321\n00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:20.710\nthose boards from somebody.\n\n322\n00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.250\nFrom some company,\noutside external to your organization.\n\n323\n00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:28.300\nAs a result to that, you effectively\nare opting in to inherent whatever risk\n\n324\n00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.490\nthat vendor has in their supply chain.\n\n325\n00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:33.290\nYou may not realize they have risk,\nbut they do.\n\n326\n00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:37.590\nWe've seen examples of it over the years\nwhere a vendor has put out a product that\n\n327\n00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.980\nfor one reason or\nanother was either infected with malware,\n\n328\n00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.280\nhave been compromised,\nthey weren't aware of it.\n\n329\n00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.370\nAnd it gets out into the market, and then\nit takes some time for us to realize that.\n\n330\n00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:50.640\nAnd then we have to deal with remediating\nthe issues associated with that exposure.\n\n331\n00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.370\nSo it's not as if you\njust buy equipment and\n\n332\n00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.260\nthere's never a risk associated with that.\n\n333\n00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.140\nI'm not suggesting for\n\n334\n00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:00.330\na minute that vendors that you buy from\nregularly are looking to do you harm.\n\n335\n00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:04.130\nI'm just pointing out that you don't know\nanything about what you're getting from\n\n336\n00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:06.900\nthem, other than you open the box and\nthere's a circuit board.\n\n337\n00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:09.100\nYou open the box and there's a hard drive.\n\n338\n00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.428\nWho put the hard drive together,\nwhere it came from,\n\n339\n00:17:11.428 --> 00:17:15.000\nwhat's loaded on there that you may or\nmay not see is something, unfortunately,\n\n340\n00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.640\nthat we just don't have\na lot of visibility into.\n\n341\n00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.400\nSo being aware of the fact that there's\nrisk in every element of our exchange for\n\n342\n00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.840\ngoods and services is an important\nthought process for the CISSP.\n\n343\n00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.959\nI don't want you to go\nhide under a rock either.\n\n344\n00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:29.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, and just say okay, I'm done,\n\n345\n00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.180\nI can't do this anymore.\n\n346\n00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.950\nBreathing is too risky\nI'm gonna stay in bed.\n\n347\n00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.870\nYou know that's not the right approach.\n\n348\n00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:37.360\nBut what I am suggesting is that we\nhave to be a little bit more skeptical,\n\n349\n00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.740\nof all the things we take for\ngranted every day.\n\n350\n00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.520\nSo, practical real world example\nof this right, how many of you,\n\n351\n00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.190\nif you think about your relationships with\nthe business and the vendors you deal with\n\n352\n00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:50.550\non a regular basis in your\ncurrent professional job, right.\n\n353\n00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.620\nHow many of you are thinking about\nwhere you buy your equipment from?\n\n354\n00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:59.370\nHow many of you have a policy in place\nin your organization that stipulates to\n\n355\n00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.380\nonly buy from what we called OEMs,\nOriginal Equipment Manufacturer vendors.\n\n356\n00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:07.630\nIn other words, if you want Dell laptops,\nyou're gonna buy directly from Dell or\n\n357\n00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.080\nan authorized representative\nthat sells Dell products.\n\n358\n00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:10.800\nRight?\n\n359\n00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.890\nBut you're not gonna buy on eBay,\nyou're not gonna go out and\n\n360\n00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:18.690\nfind something that is in the,\nlet's just call it the discount channel,\n\n361\n00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:22.540\nright, in the sense that it's\nrefurbished or recycled materials.\n\n362\n00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.690\nYou may buy refurbished materials\ndirectly from the OEM manufacturer, and\n\n363\n00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.300\nthat's okay, because they've\ndealt with cleaning them up,\n\n364\n00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:30.200\nat least hopefully\nthey've done a good job.\n\n365\n00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.710\nBut the reality is if you buy a laptop,\nor a server, or a router, or a switch, or\n\n366\n00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:39.705\nyou know a san, or a nas from a third\nparty that's not known to you.\n\n367\n00:18:39.705 --> 00:18:42.400\nEffectively a private individual or\nanother company\n\n368\n00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.930\nyou're buying whatever the risk is that\nthey've associated with that product, and\n\n369\n00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:49.600\nthey haven't clearly articulated or\nidentified what it is.\n\n370\n00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.650\nEven if they give you a risk statement and\nsay okay Mike, here's the deal.\n\n371\n00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:55.490\nI had malware on this thing,\nI think I cleaned it up, but\n\n372\n00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:56.380\nI'm just letting you know.\n\n373\n00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:57.820\nI mean, that would be refreshing.\n\n374\n00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.680\nThat doesn't happen by the way,\nright, but that would be refreshing.\n\n375\n00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.380\nBut this is basically a problem, right?\n\n376\n00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:05.920\nI mean, we don't have, and I'll make\na reference to something you may or\n\n377\n00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.300\nmay not be familiar with.\n\n378\n00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:10.450\nBut we don't have a Carfax service, for\n\n379\n00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:13.010\nbuying used computer\nequipment on the Internet.\n\n380\n00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.290\nI mean, it would be great if we did.\n\n381\n00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:18.140\nCarfax, for those of you that may not know\nwhat it is, is a service that we have in\n\n382\n00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.130\nthe United States where\neffectively you're able to go and\n\n383\n00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.370\nlook up information on a used car\nthat you're about to purchase, and\n\n384\n00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.760\nyou can see what the history of the used\ncar was, the maintenance cycle on it,\n\n385\n00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.350\nif it was dealt with at the dealer,\nif it was in an accident most importantly.\n\n386\n00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.480\nYou're able to get\ninformation on the accident.\n\n387\n00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.950\nSee whether the car was damaged.\n\n388\n00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:36.970\nIf so, was it fixed?\n\n389\n00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:37.990\nAnd how was it fixed?\n\n390\n00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:41.190\nYou're effectively able to get\na risk report on the vehicle.\n\n391\n00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:42.650\nSo, you know whether it's\na good purchase or not.\n\n392\n00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.040\nIt would be great if we had that.\n\n393\n00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.660\nAnd by the way, I didn't mention this but\nI get 10% of any idea that any of you go\n\n394\n00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.190\nout and actually figure out how to\nachieve based on our conversations.\n\n395\n00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.130\nMike gets 5, I get 10,\n\n396\n00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:58.710\nright, just to be clear, so\n15% off the top comes from that idea.\n\n397\n00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.930\nBut it would be great if\nwe had something like that,\n\n398\n00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.630\nI mean that would be really cool.\n\n399\n00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.170\nBut we don't, at least not today.\n\n400\n00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.410\nSomebody goes out and figures out\nhow to do it, that'd be awesome.\n\n401\n00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:06.940\nSo.\nBut\n\n402\n00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:10.370\na risk register is a really critical\nelement of what we need, right?\n\n403\n00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:11.840\nI mean this is really important stuff.\n\n404\n00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.400\n>> Absolutely.\n\n405\n00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.150\nAnd I can't think about the people that,\nthey buy,\n\n406\n00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:17.390\nthey need a new router,\na new piece of hardware.\n\n407\n00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.740\nYou go out, you get it from Ebay or\nsomeplace like that.\n\n408\n00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.896\nIt comes in, and\nit's like a Christmas present, right?\n\n409\n00:20:21.896 --> 00:20:25.125\nI want to open it up,\nI want to put it on the network, and\n\n410\n00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:29.227\nthere's no thought about you know,\nwhat might already be on there.\n\n411\n00:20:29.227 --> 00:20:30.854\n>> You're right.\nAnd there may be a thought, right.\n\n412\n00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:33.761\nBut the problem is the thought\nis overwhelmed by the, hey,\n\n413\n00:20:33.761 --> 00:20:35.170\nnew toy, shiny new things.\n\n414\n00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:36.730\nI don't want to play with them,\nas Mike said.\n\n415\n00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:38.010\nThat's all good.\n\n416\n00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:42.140\nBut the problem is, you've just plugged\nsomething in, that most likely is okay,\n\n417\n00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:42.890\nI mean, let's be honest.\n\n418\n00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.460\nMore often than not,\nyou don't have a problem.\n\n419\n00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:48.210\nBut, do you really want to play\nRussian Roulette with your network?\n\n420\n00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.460\nCuz that's effectively what you're doing,\nright?\n\n421\n00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.300\nYou're taking an unknown device,\nwhatever that is, you're plugging it in,\n\n422\n00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.540\nand you're hoping that\nthere's nothing evil and\n\n423\n00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.820\nnasty lurking on there that's gonna jump\nout to effectively take over your role.\n\n424\n00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.980\nAnd if it does how are we\ngonna deal with that, right?\n\n425\n00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.750\nI mean those are issues that\nwe really need to think about.\n\n426\n00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.130\nBeing smart is about stopping and\n\n427\n00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.240\nreally thinking through what\nthe next five steps look like and\n\n428\n00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.560\nbeing prepared for the bad and\nthe good that comes with those five steps.\n\n429\n00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.390\nIt's not about plugging it in and\n\n430\n00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.390\nthen hoping after the fact that\nnothing goes wrong, right?\n\n431\n00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:22.881\nSo it's really about prior planning,\n\n432\n00:21:22.881 --> 00:21:25.469\nthat's really what we talk about\nwhen we talk about managing risk.\n\n433\n00:21:25.469 --> 00:21:29.436\nIt's looking ahead, thinking about your\noptions, assessing what the impact\n\n434\n00:21:29.436 --> 00:21:32.217\nof those decisions are and\nthen making good decisions,\n\n435\n00:21:32.217 --> 00:21:36.326\nand if you make bad ones, that's okay,\nbut have a plan to deal with them, right?\n\n436\n00:21:36.326 --> 00:21:40.907\nSo if you do plug the device in and\nall of the sudden all the lights dim and\n\n437\n00:21:40.907 --> 00:21:45.725\nyou here a dark kinda scary voice\nemanating from the device sounds a little\n\n438\n00:21:45.725 --> 00:21:47.450\nbit like Darth Vader.\n\n439\n00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.100\nSaying I now own your network, right,\n\n440\n00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:53.310\nLuke I'm your father whatever it says,\nhave a plan for that, right?\n\n441\n00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.760\nThat plan should include quickly\nexiting the building, right, and\n\n442\n00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.430\nthen making sure your interns\ngo in to deal with the problem.\n\n443\n00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:00.320\nYou shouldn't do that.\n\n444\n00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.890\nBut you should unplug the device, right?\n\n445\n00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:05.860\nClearly, first step would be uncable it\nfrom the system you just plugged it into\n\n446\n00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.650\nso it can't do any more damage.\n\n447\n00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:09.050\nBut if we're not thinking ahead and\n\n448\n00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:12.280\nknowing we should do that, how many of\nuse are gonna have clarity of mind?\n\n449\n00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.740\nTo think through the fact that\nthe very first thing I should do\n\n450\n00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.760\nis make sure that device\ncan't talk to anything else.\n\n451\n00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.380\nRight?\n\n452\n00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:19.040\nAnd if you don't plan ahead,\n\n453\n00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.560\nI promise you the first thing you're\ngonna do is not to unplug the device.\n\n454\n00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.800\nYou're gonna do a lot of other things,\nbut you're not gonna unplug the device.\n\n455\n00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.370\nSo you gotta think about this, right?\n\n456\n00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.310\nThis becomes really important.\n\n457\n00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:31.145\nMaking sure we bring in third\nparty assessment capabilities.\n\n458\n00:22:31.145 --> 00:22:33.560\nWe've talked a lot about the value\nof auditing from outside.\n\n459\n00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.100\nThe value of penetration testing and\n\n460\n00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.960\nvulnerability assessments from outside,\nthat external perspective, right?\n\n461\n00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.130\nMake sure you have that\nperspective brought in.\n\n462\n00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:43.150\nIf you're gonna contract\nwith a third party,\n\n463\n00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.550\nyou should have somebody\nassess their business and\n\n464\n00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:49.200\ndo a risk assessment on them before\nyou agree to do business with them.\n\n465\n00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.840\nThat's becoming more and\nmore acceptable today\n\n466\n00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.390\nin business with regards to security and\nthe thought processes around them.\n\n467\n00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:58.650\nNow I'm not saying that that company's\ngonna think that's a polite thing for\n\n468\n00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.460\nyou to do.\n\n469\n00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.600\nI'm not suggesting they're gonna like\nbeing told, hey, we need to have a risk\n\n470\n00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.340\nassessment done, but if they want your\nbusiness then you guys will work that out.\n\n471\n00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.380\nAnd if you're gonna stand\nfirm on that requirement,\n\n472\n00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.260\nthen hopefully they're\ngonna understand that.\n\n473\n00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.390\nAnd if they don't, then you probably\nneed to find a vendor who will.\n\n474\n00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:17.020\nBecause they're probably not a good person\nto partner with because they're clearly\n\n475\n00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.570\nnot gonna be thinking about\nrisk the same way you do.\n\n476\n00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.760\nBecause if they are they're gonna\nunderstand the value of doing that,\n\n477\n00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.310\nand they're probably going to\nbe perfectly fine with it.\n\n478\n00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:26.240\nBecause they know that you're\nnot gonna find anything,\n\n479\n00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.830\nand it's gonna create a level\nof trust between the two of you\n\n480\n00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:30.910\nthat's gonna allow you to\ndo more business together.\n\n481\n00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.891\nSo that's a good thing for\nboth of you, but\n\n482\n00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:34.817\nonly if both parties view it the same way,\n\n483\n00:23:34.817 --> 00:23:38.527\nso third party assessments can be very\nimportant and obviously very critical.\n\n484\n00:23:38.527 --> 00:23:41.844\nWe talked a little bit about SLAs,\nI mentioned them a minute or two ago,\n\n485\n00:23:41.844 --> 00:23:45.608\nservice level agreements are also a very\nuseful tool here contractually binding\n\n486\n00:23:45.608 --> 00:23:47.678\nboth parties to stipulated requirements.\n\n487\n00:23:47.678 --> 00:23:50.818\nThose requirements are called SLRs,\nservice level requirements.\n\n488\n00:23:50.818 --> 00:23:55.531\nTo make sure we understand Effectively\nwhat the rules of engagement are gonna be.\n\n489\n00:23:55.531 --> 00:23:59.737\nYou know if Mike and I partner together\nand say, okay, I'm gonna buy goods and\n\n490\n00:23:59.737 --> 00:24:01.090\nservices from Mike.\n\n491\n00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:02.730\nMike's gonna provide them to me.\n\n492\n00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:06.340\nI need some agreement with Mike that tells\nme what I should expect, what I pay for\n\n493\n00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.660\nmy goods and services.\n\n494\n00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:11.140\nAnd Mike needs some agreement from\nme as to what I'm gonna pay for.\n\n495\n00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.850\nAnd as a result, we both have to\nunderstand what our expectations are.\n\n496\n00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:17.810\nAnd service level agreements are really\nabout defining the agreed upon levels of\n\n497\n00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:20.790\nperformance and\nexpectations within that arrangement.\n\n498\n00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:24.440\nIt's very important as a contractual\nvehicle, we use them all the time,\n\n499\n00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:28.200\nthere may be external SLA, and often\nthey are between different vendors, and\n\n500\n00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.610\nthe IT service or\nfunction in the business.\n\n501\n00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.920\nThe business itself may create the SLA,\nwith the external company,\n\n502\n00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:35.750\nask IT to take it on and manage it.\n\n503\n00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.745\nThere's different ways\nSLAs may be created.\n\n504\n00:24:37.745 --> 00:24:42.360\nInternal-facing SLAs, SLAs that\nare created between business units and\n\n505\n00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.870\nIT within the business\nare also common today.\n\n506\n00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:48.558\nWe tend to refer to them as OLAs,\noperational-level agreements.\n\n507\n00:24:48.558 --> 00:24:52.280\nThey're just internal-facing SLAs,\nthey effectively are the same thing for\n\n508\n00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.820\nthe purposes of our discussion.\n\n509\n00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.560\nJust be aware of them.\n\n510\n00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.820\nUnderstand what they are.\n\n511\n00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.220\nThey help us to typically stipulate what\nminimum acceptable requirements are.\n\n512\n00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.860\nBoth from a performance and\nin some cases from a security perspective,\n\n513\n00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.810\nand identifying minimum\nrequirements is very important.\n\n514\n00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:09.920\nWe've talked about requirements gathering,\nand how this works as well.\n\n515\n00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.030\nWe spent several minutes\nin at least one or\n\n516\n00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:15.820\ntwo of our prior discussions in other\nepisodes, detailing through and\n\n517\n00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.950\nwalking through the process of how\nyou would do requirements gathering.\n\n518\n00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:21.970\nSo making sure we understand how\nto do requirements gathering,\n\n519\n00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:25.470\nreminding you of that here in this area,\nis also a good thought process for\n\n520\n00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.130\nus to be thinking through.\n\n521\n00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:30.810\nWe want to also make sure that we're\nthinking about how we're gonna report out\n\n522\n00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.060\non the levels of service, and\n\n523\n00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.130\nthe management of service\nthat we're providing.\n\n524\n00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.420\nWe've talked a lot about the value of\nreporting and communicating findings.\n\n525\n00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.660\nService level reporting around\nthe implementation of the SLA.\n\n526\n00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.420\nThe management of risk, the current\nstate of risk becomes important\n\n527\n00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.520\nas part of the overall function\nthat we're thinking about as well.\n\n528\n00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.660\nAnd we wanna wrap this\nall up in a pretty bow.\n\n529\n00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.892\nRight?\nAnd really put it together in a way that's\n\n530\n00:25:51.892 --> 00:25:54.397\ngonna present it,\nnot just to the organization, but\n\n531\n00:25:54.397 --> 00:25:57.682\npresent it to each individual in\nthe organization or in the business,\n\n532\n00:25:57.682 --> 00:25:59.310\nin a meaningful and personal way.\n\n533\n00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.740\nAnd this is where security awareness\ntraining comes back into the conversation.\n\n534\n00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.210\nWhen we've been thinking about\nsecurity awareness training,\n\n535\n00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.440\nwe've really couched that conversation\nwhen we've had it with you in terms of,\n\n536\n00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.780\nhey, these are good things\nto tell people about.\n\n537\n00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.440\nMake sure they're relevant to their job.\n\n538\n00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.640\nMake sure they understand how\nto engage in that activity.\n\n539\n00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.890\nAll that's important.\n\n540\n00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:19.380\nBut the most important\nthing we need to do,\n\n541\n00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.900\nis to figure out what are the messages,\n\n542\n00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.610\nthe things we have to tell the individual\nusers in the business by job role,\n\n543\n00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:29.990\nby area, by function, and then train\ndown on them to make them aware of them.\n\n544\n00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:31.760\nBut this is one thing we\nhave to kinda agree on.\n\n545\n00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.110\nYou're just gonna have\nto trust me on this.\n\n546\n00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.700\nBecause I've done this with so\nmany cycles, with so many businesses over\n\n547\n00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.160\nthe years, I could tell you from first\nhand experience, this is how it works.\n\n548\n00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.840\nIf you don't do this on a rolling basis,\n\n549\n00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.120\nin other words if all you do is security\nawareness training once a year.\n\n550\n00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.390\nAnd it becomes an afterthought for most\npeople that they have to check off the box\n\n551\n00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:55.550\nproverbially or literally, by reading\nthrough some material, looking at a video,\n\n552\n00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.760\nanswering some questions,\nit's like an HR function in effect.\n\n553\n00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.650\nIf that's how you couch it for\nindividuals, it's not very meaningful.\n\n554\n00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.950\nOh, that's that whole thing I gotta\ndo before the end of the year,\n\n555\n00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:06.890\nI gotta get that done.\n\n556\n00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.130\nAnd then everybody celebrates, says yay,\n\n557\n00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.680\nwe got 95 or 98%, almost everybody\nin the company went through it.\n\n558\n00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.230\nAwesome, we're good for another year.\n\n559\n00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:16.330\nNo, you're really not.\n\n560\n00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:19.500\nAll you've done is effectively wasted\na half hour of everybody's time in\n\n561\n00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.260\nthe organization, because you haven't\nreally made an impact on them.\n\n562\n00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:23.480\nIt's not meaningful,\n\n563\n00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.630\nit's not relevant, it's not timely and\nit's not helping them do their job better.\n\n564\n00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:28.880\nIt's something they don't look forward to.\n\n565\n00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.640\nIt's something they don't take seriously.\n\n566\n00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:34.990\nAnd the context in the meaning in\nthe organization is just very irrelevant.\n\n567\n00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:36.820\nIt just doesn't really\nregister with people.\n\n568\n00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:40.650\nIf you make security awareness training\nsomething that happens on a regular basis,\n\n569\n00:27:40.650 --> 00:27:42.950\ncontinuously in the organization.\n\n570\n00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:46.900\nRepurposing and refocusing people's\nthought process around security,\n\n571\n00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:51.150\naround risk management, around engagement\nthroughout the course of the year.\n\n572\n00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.520\nEngagement around themed activities or\nthemed messages.\n\n573\n00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.720\nThere's a million ways to do this,\nI'm not suggesting become a party planner.\n\n574\n00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.900\nI'm just pointing out that ultimately,\n\n575\n00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.370\nsecurity awareness training is more than\na simple half hour video once a year.\n\n576\n00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:05.560\nIf you want it to be meaningful\nto your constituents,\n\n577\n00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:10.650\npeople you are charged with managing\nsecurity on behalf of, and as a CISSP.\n\n578\n00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.860\nWe have to create policies to\nmanage security awareness training,\n\n579\n00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.010\nwe have to create procedures\nto implement it, and\n\n580\n00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:20.340\nthen we have to manage it throughout the\ncourse of the year in the organization.\n\n581\n00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.670\nDo more in other words than just make\nit a simple half hour moment in time.\n\n582\n00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:26.160\nThat's a check box and\nit becomes very relevant\n\n583\n00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.520\nto those people that your trying\nto reach out and engage with.\n\n584\n00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.615\nAnd as a result, they become much more\neffective at helping you to manage risk.\n\n585\n00:28:32.615 --> 00:28:34.495\nAnd that's what really what\nultimately we wanna have happen.\n\n586\n00:28:35.795 --> 00:28:36.445\n>> Very good, Adam.\n\n587\n00:28:36.445 --> 00:28:37.315\nWe appreciate that.\n\n588\n00:28:37.315 --> 00:28:39.365\nA lot of great information\non risk management.\n\n589\n00:28:39.365 --> 00:28:43.485\nAnd as we start to extend that\nout beyond our organization,\n\n590\n00:28:43.485 --> 00:28:46.212\nwhich are bringing in third parties or,\nacquisitions.\n\n591\n00:28:46.212 --> 00:28:49.992\nWe've gotta see how that changes our risk\nmanagement, and what we need to look for,\n\n592\n00:28:49.992 --> 00:28:52.572\nand we're all looking forward\nto our next security party.\n\n593\n00:28:52.572 --> 00:28:55.012\nI think it's going to be a blast,\nI can't wait to see that.\n\n594\n00:28:55.012 --> 00:28:58.352\nYou've got to make that relevant, as you\nsaid, once a year isn't gonna cut it.\n\n595\n00:28:58.352 --> 00:29:01.551\nIt's gotta be be something that\nreally does stick with them, and\n\n596\n00:29:01.551 --> 00:29:04.981\nit's gotta be a continual thing,\notherwise it's really not worth doing.\n\n597\n00:29:04.981 --> 00:29:06.511\nAll right, Adam, we appreciate that.\n\n598\n00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:07.291\nRemember, ladies and\n\n599\n00:29:07.291 --> 00:29:10.441\ngentlemen, if you

00:00:19.060\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\ntoday we're doing our CISSP,\n\n4\n00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.150\nand specifically we're gonna be\nlooking at asset classification.\n\n5\n00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.190\nHow we go about classifying\nthese apps assets and\n\n6\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.300\nhow that affects the way\nwe protect those assets.\n\n7\n00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.470\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Mister Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.430\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.060\n>> Good.\nGood.\n\n10\n00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.340\nHow's everybody doing out there?\n\n11\n00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.980\nBy the way, today is cool argyle sock day.\n\n12\n00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.860\n>> Ha ha.\n>> In case you didn't know that.\n\n13\n00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.475\nAll right, so let's talk about\nasset classification, all right?\n\n14\n00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:45.050\nAs Mike was saying, the real important\nthing we gotta think about first\n\n15\n00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.920\nwhen we start talking about\nassets in this domain and\n\n16\n00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.000\nin this general area of knowledge is,\nwhat is an asset, right?\n\n17\n00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.110\nI mean, it's an obvious question, but it's\none that we really have to start out with.\n\n18\n00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.490\nAnd from there, if we can come up with\na clear definition of an asset equals\n\n19\n00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.640\na computer,\nan asset equals a piece of information,\n\n20\n00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.200\nan asset equals a person,\na resource within the organization.\n\n21\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.520\nAny and or all these things,\nby the way, can be assets.\n\n22\n00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.970\nAssets can be a chair, they can be\na mouse pad, they can be a mouse.\n\n23\n00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.220\nSo lot's of things that can be assets.\n\n24\n00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.330\nWe want to protect them, but\n\n25\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.120\nwe don't necessarily want to\nprotect all of them they same way.\n\n26\n00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.650\nA mouse pad doesn't need\nthe same kind of protection that\n\n27\n00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.350\nconfidential proprietary financial\ndata within the organization does.\n\n28\n00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.400\nThey both are important.\n\n29\n00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.070\nBut one is a little bit more\nimportant than the other,\n\n30\n00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.670\nalthough mousepads\nare definitely very important.\n\n31\n00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.450\nWant to make sure we guard those,\nvery, very important.\n\n32\n00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.130\nSo it is funny.\n\n33\n00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.330\nAnd I'll tell you a quick story\nabout asset classification\n\n34\n00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.180\nby way of getting it started.\n\n35\n00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.560\nSo talking about mousepads, right?\n\n36\n00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.830\nDo a lot of work with the government,\nwith the military in particular within\n\n37\n00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.260\nthe United States and\nin other countries as well.\n\n38\n00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.220\nAnd so I'm on a base, several bases\nover the last year, doing work, but\n\n39\n00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.600\none base in particular.\n\n40\n00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.410\nAnd I do a lot of work at\nthis particular location.\n\n41\n00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.990\nAnd so I'm there and\nI'm walking through the halls.\n\n42\n00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.260\nAnd if you've ever been in the military,\nor work in the government and\n\n43\n00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.350\nwork in secure areas,\nyou have a sense of this, right?\n\n44\n00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.580\nAlthough I have a clearance,\nI'm given a special visitor badge,\n\n45\n00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.450\nwhatever based the level\nof clearance I have.\n\n46\n00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.280\nI'm not classified at a security level\nthat allows me to walk freely throughout\n\n47\n00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.260\nthe building, typically,\nbecause I'm not active duty.\n\n48\n00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.400\nAnd I'm not gonna have that\nkind of security clearance.\n\n49\n00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.490\nSo I have to have\nan escort everywhere I go.\n\n50\n00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.680\nSo I've got an escort with me, and\nwhen I say everywhere, I mean literally.\n\n51\n00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.360\nIf I go to the bathroom, this nice person\nstands right outside the door waiting for\n\n52\n00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.360\nme to take care of what I have to\ntake care of, come back out, and\n\n53\n00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.500\nthen they walk with me\nwherever I'm gonna go.\n\n54\n00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.160\nSo that part's okay, no big deal.\n\n55\n00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.990\nI never get lost so that works out well.\n\n56\n00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.450\nBut you're walking through these areas,\nand\n\n57\n00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.170\na lot of times there's very sensitive\nclassified information being dealt with\n\n58\n00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.000\nin a lot of the bases that I work with and\na lot of the places I do work in.\n\n59\n00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.300\nAnd so you'll here as I'm walking down\nthe hall, right, you'll hear somebody will\n\n60\n00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.440\nscream typically classified information or\nunclass on deck, depending on where I am.\n\n61\n00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.090\nAnd everybody shuts their door or\neverybody turns and does whatever they\n\n62\n00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.350\nhave to do so he can see anything, which\nis all fine, but in most of these areas\n\n63\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.710\nwhere you have classified assets being\nused, all the systems are tagged.\n\n64\n00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.230\nSo you have a red tag, which at least\nin the US government in the military,\n\n65\n00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.250\nred tag white writing,\nclassified red effectively means secure.\n\n66\n00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.340\nGreen unclassified, green sticker,\nwhite writing unclassified means\n\n67\n00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.290\neffectively that it's for\nuse in an unclassified environment.\n\n68\n00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.980\nSo entire systems are classified, so\nliterally everything has a sticker so\n\n69\n00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.650\nyou walk by the monitor has a red class\nsticker on it, the system itself and\n\n70\n00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.260\neven the mouse pad, you turn the mouse pad\nover and it has a sticker on the bottom\n\n71\n00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.630\nthat says classified, so-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n72\n00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.590\n>> Classified mouse pads,\n\n73\n00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.732\ncoming to a system near you soon.\n\n74\n00:03:38.732 --> 00:03:39.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n75\n00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.720\nwhen we talk about asset management and\nclassified of assets,\n\n76\n00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.010\nwhat we really need to start\nthinking about is what is an asset,\n\n77\n00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.380\nand what does it mean to\nus in the organization?\n\n78\n00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.280\nBased on that,\nwe literally then can decide\n\n79\n00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.610\nhow to mark information when we\ntalk about data specifically.\n\n80\n00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.450\nHow to mark information,\nhow to mark those assets so\n\n81\n00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.800\nthat we know they are classified,\nor they're unclassified.\n\n82\n00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.550\nOr they should be used by this group of\npeople, maybe not that group of people.\n\n83\n00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.370\nSo while it is a little bit crazy to say,\nlet's put the classified sticker on\n\n84\n00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.130\nthe mouse pad, the logic of it is, it's\npart of a system that is classified and\n\n85\n00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.340\neverything associated with the system\nhas to be classified the same way.\n\n86\n00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.870\nThe logic is actually very specific and\n\n87\n00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.690\nvery sound, even though in the real world\nit translates into a funny anecdote,\n\n88\n00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.600\nbecause you classify a mouse\npad as being secure.\n\n89\n00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.900\nBut the point is not that the mouse\npad itself is secure, but rather that\n\n90\n00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.930\nthe entire system the mouse pad is\na part of is classified as being secure.\n\n91\n00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.020\nAnd every element, according to\nthe data classification policy,\n\n92\n00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.520\nhas to be labeled and\nclassified accordingly.\n\n93\n00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.400\nThat's why we label mouse pads\nas being classified, right?\n\n94\n00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.420\nSo just think about the logic of that and\nwhat classification means.\n\n95\n00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.630\nWhen we think about\ncategorization of information,\n\n96\n00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.740\nwe're thinking about determining not\nwhat the classification should be, but\n\n97\n00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.120\nrather what the impact is if that\norganizational asset, the data, or\n\n98\n00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.830\nwhatever it may be that were\nclassified is exposed, and\n\n99\n00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.070\ntherefore potentially breached or\nlost to us in some way.\n\n100\n00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.490\nSo, attacks against confidentiality,\nintegrity, and durability in terms of\n\n101\n00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.430\ncategorization, we have to understand\nwhat the impact of that attack could be.\n\n102\n00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.450\nAnd categorizing information helps us,\nagain, to understand impact specifically.\n\n103\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.728\nWanna make sure we make that connection,\nwe're aware of that.\n\n104\n00:05:15.728 --> 00:05:18.480\nSo classification and/or\ncategorization systems,\n\n105\n00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.270\nthere are many,\nmany that we can point to, again.\n\n106\n00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.250\nNumber one, not an exhaustive list\nthat I'm about to share with you.\n\n107\n00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.170\nNumber two,\n\n108\n00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.540\nmerely examples of systems worldwide that\ngive you a sense of what may be done.\n\n109\n00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.040\nAre we suggesting you go out and\nstudy these?\n\n110\n00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.710\nNo.\nAre we suggesting that you have some\n\n111\n00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.040\npassing knowledge familiarity with them,\nas a security professional today?\n\n112\n00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.920\nIf you work in these areas, absolutely.\n\n113\n00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.940\nBut to prepare for the exam,\nI don't expect you to go out and\n\n114\n00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.700\nread up on Canada's Security\nof Information Act,\n\n115\n00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.440\nthat's one of the acts\nthat you can look at.\n\n116\n00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.630\nIt's a good thing to know about\nif you do work in Canada, and\n\n117\n00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.400\nare subject to data classification, the\ncategorization requirements within Canada.\n\n118\n00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.530\nBut if you're not, there's probably not a\nlot of reason for you to read up on that.\n\n119\n00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.790\nChina has a law called Guarding State\nSecrets that deals with this, right?\n\n120\n00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.120\nAgain, is it important to know?\n\n121\n00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.480\nYeah, if you're gonna be traveling\nin China, doing business there,\n\n122\n00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.810\nit's probably important to know.\n\n123\n00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:10.450\nIf you're not,\n\n124\n00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.320\nit may not be something that you\nreally have to spend a lot of time on.\n\n125\n00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.250\nThe UK has the Official Secrets Act\nthat's been in the news over the last\n\n126\n00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.060\ncouple of years given what\nhappened with Edward Snowden,\n\n127\n00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.680\nthe data breaches that have occurred.\n\n128\n00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.340\nAll the information that was leaked.\n\n129\n00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.950\nLot of it pointed back not just to the US,\nbut to a lot of our allies in terms of\n\n130\n00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.600\nthings we were,\nwere not doing in combination with them.\n\n131\n00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.300\nSo the Official Secrets Act has\nactually been in the news a little bit,\n\n132\n00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.540\nyou may have heard of that one.\n\n133\n00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.300\nThe United States, NIST has what's\nas known as the FIPS standards.\n\n134\n00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.810\nFIPS, Federal Information\nProcessing Standards,\n\n135\n00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.830\nwhich is what the US Federal Government\nuses in order to classify and\n\n136\n00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.160\ncategorize data within their systems.\n\n137\n00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.339\nThere's also NIST SB 860, which is the\nguide to mapping types of information and\n\n138\n00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:56.052\ninformation security systems\nto system security categories.\n\n139\n00:06:56.052 --> 00:06:57.399\nIt's a long title, right?\n\n140\n00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:02.020\nBut XP860 is the guide that will allow\nus to see, from a NIST perspective and\n\n141\n00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:05.390\na US government perspective,\nhow that's carried out.\n\n142\n00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.940\nIt's used in combination with the FIPS\nstandards and the the two together\n\n143\n00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.910\nare used to provide guidance for\nclassification and categorization.\n\n144\n00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.650\nData classification as we said\nspecifically when we think about\n\n145\n00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.610\nclassifying data, not just classifying\nassets, but classifying data overall,\n\n146\n00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:26.270\nis all about ensuring that we understand\nwhat has to go into the data management,\n\n147\n00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.770\nthe definition of data and\nthe management of it, so\n\n148\n00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.610\nwe understand how to use it securely.\n\n149\n00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.300\nSo for instance, you may have heard\nof classification schemes things like\n\n150\n00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:40.450\nTop Secret, things like Ultra,\nEyes Only, For Official Eyes Only, FOUO.\n\n151\n00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.740\nThese are different classification\nschemes that may exist in the government,\n\n152\n00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.230\nmay exist in the military,\ndepending on where you are.\n\n153\n00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:50.850\nThe private sector doesn't typically tend\nto spend a lot of time classifying data to\n\n154\n00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:51.639\nthis degree.\n\n155\n00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:56.275\nIf you are in the private sector using\nconfidential data, it's just data that is\n\n156\n00:07:56.275 --> 00:08:01.250\nrestricted typically, and it may be called\nconfidential, but we don't tend to see it\n\n157\n00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.956\nbeing labeled top secret, eyes only You\nknow that's only an environment where we\n\n158\n00:08:05.956 --> 00:08:09.550\nhave very stringent data\nclassifications on it's systems.\n\n159\n00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.720\nI'm not suggesting that\nprivate sectors don't do this.\n\n160\n00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.480\nThere are some of my clients that do but\nthey're in very specific related\n\n161\n00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.260\nindustries and they don't tend\nto spend a lot of time on this,\n\n162\n00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.420\nmost companies don't, unless they're\ntold to through regulations.\n\n163\n00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.780\nSo this may be something you do or\ndon't see but it's still something from\n\n164\n00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.570\na conceptual perspective, we wanna\nbe aware of and at least understand.\n\n165\n00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:33.620\nSo if you just have a bunch of data and\nyou say well it's all secret,\n\n166\n00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.270\nwanna keep it all secure,\nhow are we gonna implement that?\n\n167\n00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.210\nHow does that classification become\nsomething that we actually do?\n\n168\n00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:40.650\nWe need to create a policy.\n\n169\n00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.450\nWe've talked about the value\nof policies before, policies,\n\n170\n00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:47.150\nif you remember, quick knowledge check for\nyou out there listening to us.\n\n171\n00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:50.620\nSo, if I asked you to define what\na policy is, what would you say?\n\n172\n00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.700\nAnd I want you to think about that for\na minute, obviously.\n\n173\n00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.060\nI'm gonna use my powers\nof mental persuasion and\n\n174\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.840\ntelepathy to beam the answer to you,\nright?\n\n175\n00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.070\nAnd we're gonna make sure you know what\nthe definition of a policy is, but\n\n176\n00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.990\na policy is gonna be something,\nas we've described before,\n\n177\n00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.640\nthat is basically a high-level\nstatement of intent.\n\n178\n00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.260\nIt's gonna take the thought process\nstrategically from the organization about\n\n179\n00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.500\nwhat we wanna accomplish, distill that\ndata down into several paragraphs, a page\n\n180\n00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.430\nor two, maybe several pages of material\nthat give us direction at a high level.\n\n181\n00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:23.290\nBut it's not gonna be specific\nin terms of tactical detail and\n\n182\n00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.520\nimplementation guidance, this is the key\ndefining characteristic of a policy.\n\n183\n00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.950\nIt is a high level statement\nof intent minimal direction,\n\n184\n00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:33.660\nfocused really on\ngenerating the message and\n\n185\n00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:38.230\nthen leaving the implementation details\nup to the procedure, which is gonna be\n\n186\n00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.315\nthe tactical step by step process we go\nthrough in order to implement the policy.\n\n187\n00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:45.065\nAnd if you remember in the episode\nwhere we talked about this,\n\n188\n00:09:45.065 --> 00:09:48.015\nMike was kind enough to go out to\nthe SANS Reading Room for us and\n\n189\n00:09:48.015 --> 00:09:51.175\nput up the SANS site where they\nhave their policy template library.\n\n190\n00:09:51.175 --> 00:09:52.945\nAnd you were able to actually see those,\nand so\n\n191\n00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:56.365\nyou could download a bunch if needed a, I\nthink as Mike called it, a starting point\n\n192\n00:09:56.365 --> 00:09:59.765\nor kind of a toolkit to get started with\nif you don't know how to write policies.\n\n193\n00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:03.200\nSo just reminding you about that and\nmaking sure you're aware of that, but\n\n194\n00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.285\nwe should have data\nclassification policies.\n\n195\n00:10:05.285 --> 00:10:06.700\nThese are really important.\n\n196\n00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.685\nHow do we classify data,\nin other words, how we manage that,\n\n197\n00:10:09.685 --> 00:10:12.070\nbut we manage everything that\nwe do with the policies.\n\n198\n00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:14.340\nThis becomes very important for\nus to consider.\n\n199\n00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.180\nOur questions like who\nhave access to the data?\n\n200\n00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:18.960\nThis is a question we wanna ask,\n\n201\n00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.590\nwe wanna figure this out as\npart of drafting the policy.\n\n202\n00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.820\nHow the data will be secured,\nhow long the data should be retained,\n\n203\n00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.610\nwhat's our retention period,\nin other words.\n\n204\n00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:27.330\nWhat method or\n\n205\n00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.600\nmechanism should be used to dispose of\nthe data when it reaches the end of life?\n\n206\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.340\nWhether the data needs to be encrypted or\nnot during storage and\n\n207\n00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.380\nduring use, these are all\nquestions that should be asked.\n\n208\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.970\nTo help us draft the policy.\n\n209\n00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:41.130\nAs we do these things,\ngo through this exercise,\n\n210\n00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.780\nask these questions, figure out\nthe definitions, we're gonna come up with\n\n211\n00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.990\ninformation that helps us to shape and\nto focus the direction of the policy.\n\n212\n00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.670\nWhat classifications should be used?\n\n213\n00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.760\nAs I said, it's really up to you,\nthere's no standard,\n\n214\n00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:58.170\nthere's no guideline that says you\nmust use private versus public.\n\n215\n00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:02.780\nYou must use company restricted, company\nconfidential, you must use top secret.\n\n216\n00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.280\nYou must use eyes only,\nI mean, those are all fine.\n\n217\n00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.210\nThey all mean something.\n\n218\n00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:11.070\nThe trick with data classification is\ndefining what the classification levels\n\n219\n00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.470\nwill be, and clearly articulating,\ndefining, documenting them, and\n\n220\n00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.100\ncommunicating them to everybody\nthat's gonna use the data.\n\n221\n00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.780\nThat way no matter who uses it,\nthey understand what you mean when you say\n\n222\n00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.730\ncompany restricted versus\ncompany confidential, right?\n\n223\n00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.460\nBecause that could have different meanings\n\n224\n00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.780\ndepending on where you are and\nwhat you do.\n\n225\n00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.490\nI have a customer that uses\nboth company restricted and\n\n226\n00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:31.910\ncompany confidential, as an example.\n\n227\n00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:35.870\nCompany restricted means that is only\navailable to people that actually work\n\n228\n00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:36.750\nfor the company.\n\n229\n00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.200\nAnybody can see it, but it's really just\nmeant for people inside the company, so\n\n230\n00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.600\nnot for customers, in other words,\nbut for any employee or team member.\n\n231\n00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.110\nCompany confidential on the other hand\nis meant only for people that are on\n\n232\n00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.800\nan access list that have rights to\nsee the data based on need to know.\n\n233\n00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.690\nSo that is a slightly different\ninterpretation, because you may have\n\n234\n00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.960\na different way of thinking about\nrestrictive versus confidential.\n\n235\n00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.370\nSo define what those classification\nterms are gonna be, it's very important,\n\n236\n00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.630\ndo you need to have them?\n\n237\n00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.600\nWe're not saying you must, but we're\nstrongly encouraging you to think about\n\n238\n00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.150\nthe fact that it is a good best\npractice to classify data.\n\n239\n00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:12.580\nThe reason for\nthis is that if we don't classify data,\n\n240\n00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.680\nwhat can happen is ultimately, that\ndata may inadvertently be exposed to or\n\n241\n00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.270\nused by individuals that should\nnormally not have a right to see it.\n\n242\n00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.370\nAnd again, we're talking about\ninformation specifically,\n\n243\n00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:27.290\nnot so much assets, although clearly this\ncan impact, one can impact the other.\n\n244\n00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:31.070\nIf information is accessed through\na computer system that is secure,\n\n245\n00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.740\nwe don't classify the system as\nwell as the data to provide or\n\n246\n00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.670\ndeny the appropriate level of\naccess to secured individuals.\n\n247\n00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:39.440\nIndividuals that belong seeing the data.\n\n248\n00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.850\nWe actually have effectively rendered\nthat data available to them even\n\n249\n00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:45.010\nthough we classified it at a high level.\n\n250\n00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:48.460\nSo we do want to make sure we're aware of\nthat, that the operational systems that\n\n251\n00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.020\naccess data have to be classified the same\nway that the data itself is classified.\n\n252\n00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:56.480\nThis is a very important thought\nprocess that we engage in as well.\n\n253\n00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.968\nWhich brings us over to the next\nlogical question, right,\n\n254\n00:12:58.968 --> 00:13:01.071\nwhich is who decides how\ndata will be classified?\n\n255\n00:13:01.071 --> 00:13:02.736\nSo we've talked about\nthe fact we should do it,\n\n256\n00:13:02.736 --> 00:13:05.670\nwe've talked about the fact it's good\nto do it, there should be categories.\n\n257\n00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:09.070\nWe should include the systems that\naccess it as well as the data itself.\n\n258\n00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:10.810\nBut who actually gets to decide on that?\n\n259\n00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.086\nIs that gonna be me, it's gonna be Mike?\n\n260\n00:13:13.086 --> 00:13:16.146\nIt's gonna be both of us go out for\nhappy hour, have a couple of drinks,\n\n261\n00:13:16.146 --> 00:13:18.190\nwe'll talk about it,\ncome up with something?\n\n262\n00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.960\nWe'll get back to you,\nwe'll let you know what it is.\n\n263\n00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.540\nIt's gonna be really good, I promise you,\nis that the way we do data classification?\n\n264\n00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.890\nHopefully not, by the way, right?\n\n265\n00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.910\nThat's not the appropriate mechanism or\nmethodology we decide on, so the idea is,\n\n266\n00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:32.120\nthe question really is,\nwho should decide how to classify data?\n\n267\n00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.220\nThe individual who owns the data or what\nwe call or who we call the data owner is\n\n268\n00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.960\nresponsible, ultimately, on deciding what\nthe classification of the data should be.\n\n269\n00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.360\nSo very important point for\n\n270\n00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:46.420\nyou to be aware of, data ownership\nequals ability to classify data.\n\n271\n00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.630\nPlease make sure you\nare aware of that all right?\n\n272\n00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.580\nSo the data owner is responsible for\ndeciding how to classify data.\n\n273\n00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.930\nOnce we classify data,\n\n274\n00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:58.260\ndoes the data owner need to review\nthat classification every so often?\n\n275\n00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.240\nSo in other words, I own the data, right?\n\n276\n00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.590\nAnd I say to you, hey,\nwe're gonna classify the data this way,\n\n277\n00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.740\ndo I never come back to the data\nagain as long as the data is kept?\n\n278\n00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:07.530\nLet's say the data is kept for\n\n279\n00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:11.300\nseven years, should I ever review\nthe classification is what I'm asking?\n\n280\n00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.130\nAnd the answer is absolutely you should\nbecause data classification over time\n\n281\n00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.210\nmay change.\n\n282\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.620\nThe relevancy of the data to\nthe organization may change.\n\n283\n00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.300\nThe need for\nthat data to be classified higher or\n\n284\n00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.190\nlower in the organization depending\non need and use may change.\n\n285\n00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.820\nAnd so data classification like\nanything else should be examined and\n\n286\n00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.300\nshould be reviewed, and we're not\nsaying you gotta review it every day,\n\n287\n00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.190\nit's just something you\nmay do once a year,\n\n288\n00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.200\nsomething you may do every six months,\nagain, refer to the policy.\n\n289\n00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:42.280\nThis is why policy is so\nimportant, refer to the policy for\n\n290\n00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.790\nhow often data classification\nshould be reviewed.\n\n291\n00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:48.630\nThat should be stipulated in the policy,\nretention period as well as review period\n\n292\n00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.980\nshould be spoken about and\ndetailed in the policy.\n\n293\n00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.790\nSo we do want to make sure we're aware\nof that and we understand that, and\n\n294\n00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.630\nwe think about management of data and\nclassification.\n\n295\n00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.310\nWe don't wanna leave out assets and I've\ntalked a lot about the fact that data is\n\n296\n00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.210\nsimply one form of the assets we manage.\n\n297\n00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.330\nWe have all sorts of different assets and\nI'll remind you again\n\n298\n00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:10.920\nclassifying the systems that access data\nis also part of data classification.\n\n299\n00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.280\nWant to make sure we're aware of that,\nso, things like inventory management, and\n\n300\n00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.770\nconfiguration management tend\nto fall into asset management.\n\n301\n00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:21.580\nInventory management is about hardware and\nsoftware, keeping track of all that,\n\n302\n00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.040\nconfiguration management is about\nkeeping track of the build, or\n\n303\n00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.840\nconfiguration settings for\nall the systems that we use.\n\n304\n00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.050\nSo we tend to see what's known as a CMDB,\n\n305\n00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:34.110\na configuration management\ndatabase being used.\n\n306\n00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:39.070\nWe tend to enter what are known as CIs,\nconfiguration items, into the CMDB.\n\n307\n00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.020\nThis is the language of\nconfiguration management,\n\n308\n00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.790\na configuration item is simply an entry\nin the configuration management database.\n\n309\n00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:50.498\nSo hypothetically, if you have a Windows\n7 laptop or an Apple Macintosh AirBook or\n\n310\n00:15:50.498 --> 00:15:54.959\nwhatever it may be, and it you have\na build on that, a certain configuration.\n\n311\n00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:58.916\nYou're running the latest version of\nthe Windows operation system or the latest\n\n312\n00:15:58.916 --> 00:16:02.716\nversion of the Macintosh OS, whatever\nthat may be, OS X, or whatever it is.\n\n313\n00:16:02.716 --> 00:16:05.673\nAnd you've got service packs and\nyou've got updates and\n\n314\n00:16:05.673 --> 00:16:08.020\nyou've got certain hardware in the system.\n\n315\n00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.607\nWe would want to capture all that,\nall of that is part of\n\n316\n00:16:10.607 --> 00:16:14.273\nthe configuration items that get entered\ninto the configuration management\n\n317\n00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:17.755\ndata base when we think about\nconfiguration management.\n\n318\n00:16:17.755 --> 00:16:21.275\nAnd we also have to bring in or at least\nthink about bringing in at this point, and\n\n319\n00:16:21.275 --> 00:16:22.735\nwe'll come back to this idea later,\n\n320\n00:16:22.735 --> 00:16:26.395\nbut we wanna think about bringing in here\nthe idea of change management, right?\n\n321\n00:16:26.395 --> 00:16:28.495\nBecause we can't really\ndo asset management,\n\n322\n00:16:28.495 --> 00:16:30.515\nwe can't really do inventory management,\n\n323\n00:16:30.515 --> 00:16:33.555\nwe can't really do configuration\nmanagement unless we have a robust\n\n324\n00:16:33.555 --> 00:16:37.460\nchange management process that helps us\nto understand how to do those things.\n\n325\n00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.460\nSo when we think about change,\n\n326\n00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.340\nwe think about the value of\nchange in the organization.\n\n327\n00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:46.420\nChange is something that if we manage,\nand we have a process to deal with,\n\n328\n00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.310\nand we have an understanding of, and\n\n329\n00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:53.110\nwe follow the procedures associated with\nchange, it can be a force used for good.\n\n330\n00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.970\nIt can actually help us to\nachieve the end results we need.\n\n331\n00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.000\nHelp us to understand how to\nmanage risk and to qualify\n\n332\n00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.690\nthe assets of the organization in such\na way that we undertake management of them\n\n333\n00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:07.970\nwith a process that allows us to track\nchanges when they occur, and to keep our\n\n334\n00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.790\ndocumentation and all the configurations\nassociated with them up to date.\n\n335\n00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.250\nIf we don't introduce change\nmanagement as part of asset management,\n\n336\n00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.150\nwe are effectively\nallowing chaos to reign.\n\n337\n00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.810\nSo the idea would be that we would\nengage in changing configurations.\n\n338\n00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:24.870\nWe would engage in changing\ndata classifications.\n\n339\n00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:26.730\nBut we would have no way\nof centrally tracking and\n\n340\n00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.690\nmanaging that to understand what was done.\n\n341\n00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:32.690\nImagine what would happen if you went to\nyour build documentation about how to\n\n342\n00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.630\neffectively create a templated\nimage of a system for deployment.\n\n343\n00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.480\nAnd the build document says oh, when\nyou deploy you'll have a Windows Server\n\n344\n00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.480\n2008 R2 image, and\nit'll have Service Pack 1.\n\n345\n00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.230\nAnd that's what our standing baseline is.\n\n346\n00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.140\nAnd you deploy that template, and\nit winds up being Server 2003 or\n\n347\n00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:53.960\nServer 2012 or whatever the current\noperating system is, whatever that is.\n\n348\n00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:56.910\nIt is something else in other words,\nit's not what you expected.\n\n349\n00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:59.150\nThat could potentially\nlead to complications.\n\n350\n00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:03.570\nWhat if the applications and the data\nthat you were gonna manage on that system\n\n351\n00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:08.080\nare not certified to run on either earlier\nor later version of that operating system.\n\n352\n00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.110\nThat could lead to not only delayed\na project, but actually a security breach.\n\n353\n00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:16.650\nExposure of data confidentiality, exposure\nand complications with integrity or\n\n354\n00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.570\nperhaps availability is compromised.\n\n355\n00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:19.690\nThis can be a problem.\n\n356\n00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:22.780\nSo change management is certainly a very\nimportant part of what we call IT\n\n357\n00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.020\nasset management, or\nwhat's called ITAM, I-T-A-M.\n\n358\n00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:30.390\nWhich is this whole process, the broader\ndiscipline of managing all the assets,\n\n359\n00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.840\nthe configurations and\nthe changes that occur with them.\n\n360\n00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:36.220\nWe wanna be thinking about\nthat as a general idea\n\n361\n00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.540\nbehind how we actually engage\nin asset management, right?\n\n362\n00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.230\nThoughts, comments, questions?\n\n363\n00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.863\nI'm talking to Mike by the way not to\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n364\n00:18:43.863 --> 00:18:45.255\n>> you cuz I know although you may have\n\n365\n00:18:45.255 --> 00:18:47.138\nthem you can't communicate\nthem clear to us.\n\n366\n00:18:47.138 --> 00:18:47.800\nBut Mike has\n\n367\n00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.340\nbeen looking at me expectantly\nwanting to say something I think.\n\n368\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:53.830\n>> No, no I was just, you know, you hit\nright on my next question which was who's\n\n369\n00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:58.900\nresponsible for generating the actual\nclassifications, you said the data owner.\n\n370\n00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.980\nNow as an end user,\nlet's say I create information.\n\n371\n00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:06.160\nI'm probably still not gonna be\nthe one that ends up classifying.\n\n372\n00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.560\nDoes it go through some kind of system,\ntypically?\n\n373\n00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.150\n>> Sure.\nSo when we think about data\n\n374\n00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:13.420\nclassification, and Mike brings up\na really good point which is, okay, Adams,\n\n375\n00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.120\nyou said the owner.\n\n376\n00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.710\nSo, in theory, if I'm the owner, and\nI create a Word document, effectively,\n\n377\n00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:19.660\ndo I have the right to classify it?\n\n378\n00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.920\nOr, is there some overarching\nIT function or something,\n\n379\n00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:26.260\nwhatever that is, that's gonna\nclassify the data on my behalf.\n\n380\n00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.100\nSo now we're getting into\nan access control conversation.\n\n381\n00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.330\nCuz now we have to think about\naccess control models and\n\n382\n00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.890\nwe're not gonna have that\nconversation right now.\n\n383\n00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:34.860\nWe will have it at some point.\n\n384\n00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.810\nBut, high level, is it a discretionary\naccess control model we use?\n\n385\n00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.030\nIs it a mandatory access control model?\n\n386\n00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.420\nIf it's a Mac,\na mandatory access control model?\n\n387\n00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.990\nThere is mandatory data labeling\nclassification as well as user, or\n\n388\n00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.230\nobject labeling as well as subject\nlabeling, is what we would say.\n\n389\n00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:53.090\nSubjects are users.\n\n390\n00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:57.870\nObject will be data and as a result we\nhave to label and classify both so that we\n\n391\n00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.480\nhave the right level of effectively,\nsensitivity and security taking place.\n\n392\n00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.890\nSo this may be driven by a central system.\n\n393\n00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:05.360\nMike, you're absolutely right and\n\n394\n00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.370\nalthough the owner has the right\nultimately to decide what\n\n395\n00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.770\nhappens with their data, it may be\na central function that enforces that.\n\n396\n00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:16.400\nAnd so we wanna make sure we understand\nthe difference between classification and\n\n397\n00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.260\nenforcement.\n\n398\n00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.960\nWhich is really the subtle, but very\nimportant point that Mike's drawing our\n\n399\n00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.750\nattention to with\nthe question that he posed.\n\n400\n00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.090\nSo, it's a good question.\n\n401\n00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:25.360\nMike's gonna get a gold star on\nthe board behind us here of me.\n\n402\n00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.630\nGo to a break, and if he gets five more,\nhe gets to take a break today and\n\n403\n00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:29.460\nactually have lunch.\n\n404\n00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.260\n>> Woo hoo.\n>> So, hopefully he'll\n\n405\n00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.050\nask some more good questions\nwhile we're talking.\n\n406\n00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.760\nAll right so, as we continue\nthe conversation here about asset\n\n407\n00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.220\nclassification what we\nhaven't talked about yet\n\n408\n00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.900\nis something known as\nthe equipment life cycle.\n\n409\n00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.900\nRight?\nThe idea that anything, and\n\n410\n00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.320\nthis could be a data life cycle,\nit could be equipment life cycle, but\n\n411\n00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.300\ngenerically everything has a life cycle.\n\n412\n00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.590\nWe start at a certain point.\n\n413\n00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.580\nWhen we engage that activity,\nthat system, that data, whatever it is.\n\n414\n00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:54.230\nAnd we run through a series\nof predetermined phases\n\n415\n00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:57.210\ntill we get to the point where we no\nlonger wanna use that information and\n\n416\n00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.250\nwe have to retire it in some way.\n\n417\n00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:03.460\nAnd so a life cycle is really about\nmanaging the cradle to grave,\n\n418\n00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.920\nif you will, thought process around this\nsystem, or this service, or this data, or\n\n419\n00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.720\nthis asset, or whatever it may be.\n\n420\n00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.780\nWhen we think about equipment life\ncycle in particular, we think about\n\n421\n00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.660\nthe idea of defining requirements, what\nis it we need to be able to accomplish?\n\n422\n00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.700\nWhat is it we wanna be able to do?\n\n423\n00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.840\nAnd we have to figure that out\nup front before we go out and\n\n424\n00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.780\nbuild a system, acquire it,\nsomehow buy, rent, and/or use.\n\n425\n00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.540\nBecause if all I say is,\nI wanna be able to have a computer.\n\n426\n00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.450\nWell, okay, Adam, what kind of computer?\n\n427\n00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:32.490\nIs it a desktop?\n\n428\n00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.580\nIs it a laptop?\n\n429\n00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:34.700\nIs it a server?\n\n430\n00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.860\nRight?\nIs it a handheld tablet device?\n\n431\n00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:38.790\nThere's lots of options today.\n\n432\n00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:39.960\nThat really doesn't help me very much.\n\n433\n00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.470\nWe need to do a little bit\nbetter job of narrowing and\n\n434\n00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:46.120\nrefining your requirements so\nwe know what kind of computer you want.\n\n435\n00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.895\nI want a nice, pretty, shiny one,\nthat's what I often tell people.\n\n436\n00:21:48.895 --> 00:21:51.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Acquire and implement, so stage two in\n\n437\n00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:55.150\nthe life cycle after we define\nrequirements is acquire and implement.\n\n438\n00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.980\nYou've told me what you want,\nyou want a Dell Latitude laptop,\n\n439\n00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:01.050\nyou want it to have 128 gigs of RAM, you\n\n440\n00:22:01.050 --> 00:22:06.050\nwant it to have 256 CPU cores I'm building\na little gaming, streaming device, right?\n\n441\n00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.750\nLittle activity when I'm busy and\nI've nothing else to do.\n\n442\n00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.216\nSo acquiring and implement,\nwe're gonna go out and buy that, right?\n\n443\n00:22:11.216 --> 00:22:13.718\nOr we're gonna somehow get that,\nmaybe we can built it,\n\n444\n00:22:13.718 --> 00:22:15.660\nmaybe we have parts laying around, right?\n\n445\n00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:16.810\nOr maybe we can rent it.\n\n446\n00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:19.120\nHowever we get it, it doesn't really\nmatter, we're gonna acquire it,\n\n447\n00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.110\nwe're then going to implement it.\n\n448\n00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:21.950\nWe're gonna start working with it.\n\n449\n00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:25.370\nAt that point we switch to operations and\nmaintenance, day to day use.\n\n450\n00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:29.130\nAnd the system maintenance that goes into\nday to day wear and tear to offset that so\n\n451\n00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.590\nthat we can actually have\nthe system be functional.\n\n452\n00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:35.470\nAt a certain point in time when we're\nno longer gonna operate and maintain.\n\n453\n00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:37.630\nWe have to worry about disposal and\ndecommission.\n\n454\n00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:41.250\nHow do we ultimately move through\nthat life cycle to the end point\n\n455\n00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.820\nwhere we say okay,\nwe're gonna retire that system.\n\n456\n00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.410\nWe're gonna get rid of the laptop or\nturn it off or whatever.\n\n457\n00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:49.090\nWe're gonna take that information and\nretire it or\n\n458\n00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:52.320\ntake that system and we're gonna repurpose\nit and do something else with it.\n\n459\n00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.720\nSo how do we clean up in other words?\n\n460\n00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.890\nAnd securely put all that information\naway when we're doing using it.\n\n461\n00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.695\nThis is the other thing\nwe have to think about.\n\n462\n00:22:58.695 --> 00:23:01.955\nEquipment life cycles very important,\nany life cycles important,\n\n463\n00:23:01.955 --> 00:23:03.655\nbut especially when we\nthink about equipment,\n\n464\n00:23:03.655 --> 00:23:07.315\nbecause we have the potential at\nevery phase in the life cycle, right?\n\n465\n00:23:07.315 --> 00:23:11.925\nWith requirements gathering, with\nacquisition implementation, operation and\n\n466\n00:23:11.925 --> 00:23:14.105\nmaintenance and the disposal and\ndecommissioning,\n\n467\n00:23:14.105 --> 00:23:16.365\nthe four phases that we talk about.\n\n468\n00:23:16.365 --> 00:23:19.890\nWe have the opportunity\nto positively impact\n\n469\n00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:23.030\nthe system usage by\nminimizing risk at each area.\n\n470\n00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.050\nIf we're smart about\nrequirements gathering,\n\n471\n00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.500\nwe're gonna figure out the requirements\nup front and then we're gonna acquire or\n\n472\n00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.890\nimplement a system that is secure\nenough to meet those requirements or\n\n473\n00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.550\nexceed them if at all possible.\n\n474\n00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.770\nWhen we think about acquisition and\nimplementation, we're gonna go out and\n\n475\n00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.530\nminimize risk by dealing with,\nas we've already talked about,\n\n476\n00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:43.355\ncertified vendors that we know we have a\nrelationship with that hopefully is gonna,\n\n477\n00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:46.070\nthey're gonna minimize risk in\ntheir area of the supply chain,\n\n478\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.560\nso that we don't inherit a lot of risk,\nright?\n\n479\n00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.781\nWhen we think about operation and\n\n480\n00:23:49.781 --> 00:23:51.925\nmaintenance we're gonna keep\nup with patch management.\n\n481\n00:23:51.925 --> 00:23:54.922\nWe're gonna make sure that\nwe use change management and\n\n482\n00:23:54.922 --> 00:23:59.258\na configuration management database to\nformally document what we're doing and\n\n483\n00:23:59.258 --> 00:24:03.677\nhow we're doing it, so we know the system\nis always gonna be as secure as it can be.\n\n484\n00:24:03.677 --> 00:24:07.472\nWhen we think about decommissioning and\ndisposing of data, or\n\n485\n00:24:07.472 --> 00:24:11.710\na system at the end of its life cycle,\nwe're gonna do so securely.\n\n486\n00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:15.260\nWe're not just simply gonna throw away\nthe computer with the hard drive in it and\n\n487\n00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.065\nhope nobody figures out what's on it.\n\n488\n00:24:17.065 --> 00:24:19.475\nWe're gonna separate the hard\ndrive from the system.\n\n489\n00:24:19.475 --> 00:24:23.445\nWe're gonna then deal with the data that's\nremaining on the hard drive, wiping it out\n\n490\n00:24:23.445 --> 00:24:27.775\nin some way, hopefully rendering that\ninformation in accessible with people.\n\n491\n00:24:27.775 --> 00:24:31.795\nWhether we degauss the hard drive,\nwhether we physically destroy, whether we\n\n492\n00:24:31.795 --> 00:24:36.205\nlogically wipe what's on there with some\nsort of re-riding or overriding software.\n\n493\n00:24:36.205 --> 00:24:39.590\nThere's different ways to do that, and\nwe'll talk more about some of those later\n\n494\n00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.660\nbut the point is we'll\ntake steps to do that.\n\n495\n00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.560\nAt every step along the way,\nin other words,\n\n496\n00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:48.340\nin that life cycle, we're interdicting\nthe thought process about risk mitigation,\n\n497\n00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.920\nrisk minimization, and\nmanagement of risks.\n\n498\n00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.160\nBy doing that, we're being good security\nprofessionals, we're living up to our part\n\n499\n00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.530\nof the bargain about trying to always\nbe aware of risks and deal with it, and\n\n500\n00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:02.640\nwe're trying to focus the end user on\nthe fact that they have to be secure\n\n501\n00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.700\nthroughout the entire life cycle\nof owning and managing a system.\n\n502\n00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.490\nYou don't leave your laptop laying around,\nright?\n\n503\n00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:10.830\nClearly, we know that, but\nwhat about your mobile device?\n\n504\n00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:12.210\nWhat about your phone?\n\n505\n00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:13.650\nDo you leave your phone laying around?\n\n506\n00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.980\nProbably leave that lying around\na lot more than you do your laptop.\n\n507\n00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.630\nIs it secure?\n\n508\n00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:19.230\nDo you have a passcode on there?\n\n509\n00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:24.000\nIf you have a fingerprint swipe or\nwhatever, those four-digit passcodes\n\n510\n00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.500\nare not incredibly difficult to crack,\nbut they are hard to crack, and so\n\n511\n00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.600\nit may not be something somebody could\njust pick up and immediately get into.\n\n512\n00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.410\nThey may have to struggle\na little bit to get through that.\n\n513\n00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.800\nAre you in the habit of\nwiping the surface glass, or\n\n514\n00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.640\nthe screen,\noff whenever you tap in your code?\n\n515\n00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.650\nBecause, with those clean fingers\nyou walk around with all day,\n\n516\n00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:46.040\nyou're gonna leave grease and\noil on the screen, and today,\n\n517\n00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:49.320\nalmost without exception,\nmost of our devices are touch enabled.\n\n518\n00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:53.180\nYou're swiping and doing all sorts of\nstuff, so that screen gets real dirty, but\n\n519\n00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.960\nthe fact that you're constantly logging\ninto that screen using four specific\n\n520\n00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:02.520\npoints, or five now if it's a later\nversion of a phone, to log in is\n\n521\n00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:08.750\ngonna leave a very, very easily understood\ntrack as to what those five points are.\n\n522\n00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.530\nIf you've narrowed down for me what\nthe five numbers are, I now have a much\n\n523\n00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:16.140\ngreater chance of figuring out that\ncombination than I did if I had to guess\n\n524\n00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:20.390\nfrom nine or 10 numbers, and then start\nrandomly putting combinations together.\n\n525\n00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:21.960\nI'm not suggesting it's any easier.\n\n526\n00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.920\nI'm simply pointing out, it's another link\nin the chain that makes it easier for\n\n527\n00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.370\nsomebody to take that\ndevice away from you, so\n\n528\n00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:30.820\nwe have to practice good device management\nthroughout the entire life cycle.\n\n529\n00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:34.020\nI can't tell you how many times I'm at\nStarbucks or somewhere in a public place\n\n530\n00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:38.100\nworking, and I see people get up from\ntheir tables, leave their computer,\n\n531\n00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:42.100\nleave their phone, go to the bathroom,\ngo out to the car, do this, do that.\n\n532\n00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.050\nThey get distracted,\nthey're talking with somebody.\n\n533\n00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.590\nThat stuff's just sitting on the table.\n\n534\n00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:47.620\nAgain, I'm a good person, right?\n\n535\n00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.980\nIt's probably my downfall at the end of\nthe day, I'm too nice to do this stuff.\n\n536\n00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:54.680\nBut the reality is, if I was a bad person,\nI'd have a collection of bright,\n\n537\n00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.230\nshiny new toys because I could walk\nout and nobody would even know.\n\n538\n00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.450\nI see the same thing in Barnes and\nNoble, places like that,\n\n539\n00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.310\nwhere you have those cafes, and\npeople are there reading, and again,\n\n540\n00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.770\nthey get up and do the strangest things.\n\n541\n00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:07.131\nThey walk away and disappear for\nlike 10-20 minutes.\n\n542\n00:27:07.131 --> 00:27:08.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't know where they're going.\n\n543\n00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.180\n>> Who knows what they're doing?\n\n544\n00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.120\n>> But they're obviously not clearly\nreally focused on the fact they have\n\n545\n00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.870\na computer and\nall sorts of stuff sitting there, so\n\n546\n00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.450\nthis can be a critical thing\nwe have to think about.\n\n547\n00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:20.490\nGood data management practices,\nright, very important to think about,\n\n548\n00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:24.810\nhow we classify data, how we categorize\ndata, how we manage data overall.\n\n549\n00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:29.140\nDocumentation is critical,\nit is key to this process.\n\n550\n00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:32.680\nDocument the classification,\ndocument the categorization,\n\n551\n00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.630\ndocument through change management\neverything done to the system.\n\n552\n00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.390\nIf you're doing these things,\nyou're gonna be a lot happier.\n\n553\n00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:41.700\nIf you're not, you're gonna be spending\na lot of time wishing you were.\n\n554\n00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.910\nDon't be that person, right?\n\n555\n00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:44.750\n>> Very good, Adam.\n\n556\n00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.671\nAll right, a lot of great information\nthere on asset classification,\n\n557\n00:27:48.671 --> 00:27:52.848\nand one of the things that I really got\nout of that is making sure that that goes\n\n558\n00:27:52.848 --> 00:27:55.750\nalong with the entire life\ncycle of that equipment.\n\n559\n00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:59.180\nYou might start out with those good\nintentions, classifying everything, but\n\n560\n00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.700\nthen, when it gets time\nto dispose of that stuff,\n\n561\n00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.620\nsometimes they might get a little lax.\n\n562\n00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.140\nMake sure it goes all the way through that\n\n563\n00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.170\nlife cycle that we have with that\nequipment, as well as that data, right?\n\n564\n00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:12.530\nIt's something that you've gotta revisit,\nyou don't classify it once and\n\n565\n00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:13.470\nthen be done with it.\n\n566\n00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:17.840\nThings change, classifications change,\nthe data becomes less or more important to\n\n567\n00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.910\nthe organization, so it's something\nthat has to be done on a regular basis.\n\n568\n00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:22.950\nSo, fantastic.\n\n569\n00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:26.650\nThanks for that information, Adam, and\nremember, if you wanna attend one of\n\n570\n00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:31.980\nAdam's live classes,\nshoot us an email at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n571\n00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.920\nThat's it for this episode,\nsigning off, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n572\n00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:36.825\n>> I'm a generic user classified that way.\n\n573\n00:28:36.825 --> 00:28:39.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we'll see you next

--> 00:00:16.845\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:19.493\nToday, we're doing our CISSP.\n\n5\n00:00:19.493 --> 00:00:23.377\nAnd specifically, we're gonna be\nlooking into protecting privacy and\n\n6\n00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:27.210\nthis is a pretty large topic and\nit deals with a lot of different things.\n\n7\n00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.120\nSome of them might be more\nobvious to you like you may\n\n8\n00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.588\nbe thinking about end user privacy, but\nwe've also got to consider data in for\n\n9\n00:00:34.588 --> 00:00:37.111\nour corporation and keeping that private.\n\n10\n00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:39.897\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:39.897 --> 00:00:40.874\nHow are you doing today, Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.731\n>> I'm doing well, I'm doing well.\n\n13\n00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:44.544\nSo let's talk about privacy a little bit.\n\n14\n00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.377\nLet's think about privacy and\nwe've spoken about privacy already.\n\n15\n00:00:47.377 --> 00:00:51.556\nWe've spoken a lot about what privacy\nmeans from the individual's perspective.\n\n16\n00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:55.200\nThink about what we talk about as PII,\nP-I-I.\n\n17\n00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.697\nPersonally identifiable information\nis what PII represents or\n\n18\n00:00:58.697 --> 00:00:59.867\nwhat is meant by PII.\n\n19\n00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:02.381\nAnd when we think about personally\nidentifiable information,\n\n20\n00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:04.760\nwe're thinking about data that\nis unique to an individual.\n\n21\n00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.139\nSo, a driver's license number,\nuniquely identifies me.\n\n22\n00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:11.960\nThe United States, a social\nsecurity number, a passport number.\n\n23\n00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.003\nThere may be many different things\nthat identify an individual.\n\n24\n00:01:15.003 --> 00:01:19.851\nMaybe they're medical records, perhaps\nan employee ID within a either a ERP\n\n25\n00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:24.701\nsystem or a customer ID in a CRM system,\ncustomer relationship management,\n\n26\n00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:28.830\nenterprise resource provisioning\nis what ERP stands for.\n\n27\n00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.141\nSo the idea generically is how do\nwe take all that unique data and\n\n28\n00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:35.589\nnot just mange it, not just use it,\nbut how do we safe guard it??\n\n29\n00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:39.070\nHow do we apply confidentiality,\nintegrity at minimum?\n\n30\n00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.700\nAnd certainly, availability standards to\nit to safeguard that data and this is\n\n31\n00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.614\nreally what protecting privacy and privacy\nthough processes have to be about today.\n\n32\n00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:50.091\nIt's about all the things that can\ngo wrong with data, exposing it\n\n33\n00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:54.380\nunnecessarily that we really are\nattempting to discuss and think through.\n\n34\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.154\nSo individuals, starting from this\nthought process or this particular point.\n\n35\n00:01:59.154 --> 00:02:02.110\nIndividuals should be given\nthe right to control their own data.\n\n36\n00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.992\nWe can probably all agree that whether or\nnot in law, that is stipulated,\n\n37\n00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:08.266\nit's a good idea.\n\n38\n00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:12.162\nAnd so although we struggle with it, for\ninstance, here in the United States,\n\n39\n00:02:12.162 --> 00:02:14.650\nit is not something that\nis enshrined in law.\n\n40\n00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.098\nThe way it is in the European Union, but\nwe still have a thought process that\n\n41\n00:02:18.098 --> 00:02:22.042\nindividuals should have control over their\nown data, but promise we don't back it up\n\n42\n00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:25.153\nwith this many loss and\nprotections as they do in other countries.\n\n43\n00:02:25.153 --> 00:02:27.443\nSo we still think that that's importing,\nbut\n\n44\n00:02:27.443 --> 00:02:30.760\nwe have an acted necessarily\nin the same forth right now.\n\n45\n00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.322\nHaving said that though,\n\n46\n00:02:32.322 --> 00:02:35.588\nas a CISSP working inside of\na company being in charge or\n\n47\n00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:40.632\nultimately being focused on data privacy,\nyou still have to come up with policies.\n\n48\n00:02:40.632 --> 00:02:43.451\nYou still have to implement\nprocedures ultimately and\n\n49\n00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:46.610\nyou still have to manage data access and\ndata security.\n\n50\n00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.664\nWhether or not it's the law of the land,\n\n51\n00:02:48.664 --> 00:02:51.816\nthat individual should have\nultimate control of their data.\n\n52\n00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:55.768\nYou have to decide what data control means\nwithin the boundary of the organization\n\n53\n00:02:55.768 --> 00:02:59.500\nand what we have to really then struggle\nwith is what does that boundary mean?\n\n54\n00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.224\nWe've talked about data classification and\ndata not only classification, but\n\n55\n00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:06.725\ncategorization in terms\nof what data is and\n\n56\n00:03:06.725 --> 00:03:09.796\nwhat it means to the organization\nto have that data.\n\n57\n00:03:09.796 --> 00:03:12.550\nWe've spoken about this and\ntalked about this in a prior episode.\n\n58\n00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.706\nWhat we have to do is take\nthat thought process.\n\n59\n00:03:14.706 --> 00:03:18.429\nLink that to the geographical\nconversation about what the boundary or\n\n60\n00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:20.910\nborder of the information is going to be.\n\n61\n00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.253\nIs it just literally\nwithin our organization?\n\n62\n00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:27.593\nIs it being shared with other partners,\nother vendors inside of our supply chain,\n\n63\n00:03:27.593 --> 00:03:29.640\nup and down and throughout that chain?\n\n64\n00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.870\nAnd if it is,\ndoes the border now really extend to them?\n\n65\n00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.378\nAnd then what if they turn around and\n\n66\n00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:36.950\nshare that with one of their\nsubcontracted relationships?\n\n67\n00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.696\nHow far down the level or how far down,\nrather that level do we go or\n\n68\n00:03:40.696 --> 00:03:44.602\nthat particular rat hole or black hole or\nnot rat hole or black hole?\n\n69\n00:03:44.602 --> 00:03:45.982\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Rabbit hole,\n\n70\n00:03:45.982 --> 00:03:47.318\nthat's the one I'm trying to come up with.\n\n71\n00:03:47.318 --> 00:03:51.400\nHow far down that hole do we actually\ngo in order to track our data?\n\n72\n00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.885\nThis is a very complicated decision\npoint for us as security professionals,\n\n73\n00:03:55.885 --> 00:03:58.856\nbecause if we want to extend\nthe border of the data.\n\n74\n00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:02.329\nAnd therefore, the protection of the data\nto individuals outside the immediate\n\n75\n00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.751\norganization, we have to come up with\nways to ensure that they're gonna manage\n\n76\n00:04:05.751 --> 00:04:08.170\nthe data the same way that we\nwant the data to be secured.\n\n77\n00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.165\nIf they're not gonna do that, we probably\nshouldn't share the data with them.\n\n78\n00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:12.030\nThat's just the reality.\n\n79\n00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.870\nSo how secure is the data?\n\n80\n00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.720\nHow accessible is the data?\n\n81\n00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.823\nUnder what format will the data be used?\n\n82\n00:04:17.823 --> 00:04:22.440\nAnd what shape and form will the data be\nused will it stored, will it be transfer?\n\n83\n00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.511\nThese are questions that really can\ncomplicate our lives dramatically when we\n\n84\n00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:26.731\nthink about data protection.\n\n85\n00:04:26.731 --> 00:04:30.725\nThe EU, the European Union as I've talked\nabout in some of our prior discussions has\n\n86\n00:04:30.725 --> 00:04:32.470\nreally taken the lead on this.\n\n87\n00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.808\nThey have through their data\nprotection Directive 95/46,\n\n88\n00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.537\nreally stood out in front\nof everybody else and said,\n\n89\n00:04:38.537 --> 00:04:41.935\nthis is how we view the data\nprotection rights of the individual and\n\n90\n00:04:41.935 --> 00:04:46.142\nthe rights of the individual to manage\ntheir data throughout the data lifecycle.\n\n91\n00:04:46.142 --> 00:04:50.113\nSo strengthening individual's rights is\nreally what the focus of that directive\n\n92\n00:04:50.113 --> 00:04:53.852\nhas been and being able to give users,\nindividual users the rights to control\n\n93\n00:04:53.852 --> 00:04:57.960\nthe disposition of their data is what the\nultimate goal of that directive has been.\n\n94\n00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.298\nSo we wanna be thinking about that,\nunderstanding that,\n\n95\n00:05:00.298 --> 00:05:01.834\ninsuring that we have a sense of that.\n\n96\n00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:05.555\nObviously, along with that, we then have\nto think about, as I was just saying,\n\n97\n00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:08.910\nhow we extend the border of that\nprotection out beyond the EU.\n\n98\n00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.468\nSo we talked about a concept\nknown as safe harbor provisions.\n\n99\n00:05:11.468 --> 00:05:15.622\nWhether we get into the conversation\nspecifically about what safe harbor\n\n100\n00:05:15.622 --> 00:05:19.709\npermissions or protections exist\ncurrently today and they are in flux,\n\n101\n00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:23.030\nas I've mentioned in one\nof our prior conversations.\n\n102\n00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.957\nThe idea of safe harbor right now is being\nreevaluated, which means that although we\n\n103\n00:05:26.957 --> 00:05:30.773\nhave the generic concept of safe harbor\nand we should understand generically what\n\n104\n00:05:30.773 --> 00:05:34.554\nthat means the specificity of how it's\nbeing implemented may change over time.\n\n105\n00:05:34.554 --> 00:05:36.309\nAnd so let's focus more broadly,\n\n106\n00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:39.758\njust generally the idea of what\na safe harbor provision looks like,\n\n107\n00:05:39.758 --> 00:05:43.283\nnot the specificity of what one may or\nmay not be at any moment in time.\n\n108\n00:05:43.283 --> 00:05:46.954\nAnd the idea of a safe harbor\nprovision effectively helps us,\n\n109\n00:05:46.954 --> 00:05:50.835\nas a company that is looking to\ndo business with, individuals and\n\n110\n00:05:50.835 --> 00:05:55.355\nsecure and safeguard their data to\nunderstand what the requirements are for\n\n111\n00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:58.760\nus to align with in order to secure and\nto do exactly that.\n\n112\n00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.898\nSafeguard their data and\n\n113\n00:05:59.898 --> 00:06:03.266\nalign them with whatever the national\nlegislative requirements may be.\n\n114\n00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:04.590\nSo in just plain English,\n\n115\n00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.386\nwe have to effectively use safe harbor\nprovisions to give us the rule book,\n\n116\n00:06:08.386 --> 00:06:12.302\nthe play book that we should manage the\ndata through in order to be aligned with\n\n117\n00:06:12.302 --> 00:06:16.067\nthe requirements of the country that\nhas said, this is what our laws are.\n\n118\n00:06:16.067 --> 00:06:21.260\nSo in the example of the EU Data\nProtection Directive, the 9546 directive.\n\n119\n00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.140\nThe United States and\nother entities that want to do business\n\n120\n00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:30.140\nwith European Union and subjects that live\nin the EU, individuals that are there that\n\n121\n00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.130\nwant to provide their data to some sort of\nbusiness, so that they can buy something.\n\n122\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.146\nOr maybe a doctor or a hospital concern or\n\n123\n00:06:37.146 --> 00:06:41.061\nhealthcare concern that may expose their\ndata outside of the border of the EU in\n\n124\n00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:43.694\norder to work with a partner,\nsomething like that.\n\n125\n00:06:43.694 --> 00:06:45.556\nIf they're doing that,\n\n126\n00:06:45.556 --> 00:06:50.740\nthat data is not subject necessarily\nto EU data protection laws.\n\n127\n00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.559\nSome countries may not\nrecognize those laws.\n\n128\n00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:55.453\nAnd as a result, may say, well,\nthat's nice, but we have our own laws or\n\n129\n00:06:55.453 --> 00:06:57.590\nin protect the data based on what we say.\n\n130\n00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.528\nWhat safe harbor effectively says to\nthose countries is if you want access\n\n131\n00:07:01.528 --> 00:07:05.529\nto the data, you're gonna have to abide\nby the boiled down version of the EU\n\n132\n00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:07.899\ndata protection laws that are stipulated.\n\n133\n00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:12.128\nIn the safe harbor agreement that we\nnegotiate between the country that wants\n\n134\n00:07:12.128 --> 00:07:15.560\nthe data and wants the business and\nin this case the EU.\n\n135\n00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.614\nAnd having done that, it gives us\na playbook, a rule book that says,\n\n136\n00:07:18.614 --> 00:07:20.681\nthese are the basic tenets\nyou have to follow.\n\n137\n00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:22.590\nYou have to implement\nthese basic protections.\n\n138\n00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.616\nYou have to help us to\nmanage your data this way.\n\n139\n00:07:24.616 --> 00:07:28.923\nAlthough you may not follow the exact\nletter of the law using safe harbor,\n\n140\n00:07:28.923 --> 00:07:31.470\nyou will follow the spirit of the law.\n\n141\n00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.716\nAnd by following the spirit of the law,\nyou are aligned enough.\n\n142\n00:07:34.716 --> 00:07:38.146\nYou are providing enough protection\nthat we will say that it's okay for\n\n143\n00:07:38.146 --> 00:07:40.320\nyou to manage the data on our behalf.\n\n144\n00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.272\nThis is effectively what\nsafe harbor provides.\n\n145\n00:07:42.272 --> 00:07:45.661\nSo whether it is a safe harbor\nagreement between the United States,\n\n146\n00:07:45.661 --> 00:07:49.882\nhypothetically and the EU, whether it is a\nsafe harbor between the United States and\n\n147\n00:07:49.882 --> 00:07:53.284\nanother country, whatever it may be,\nit doesn't really matter.\n\n148\n00:07:53.284 --> 00:07:57.034\nTwo countries that are just simply looking\nto exchange information where both\n\n149\n00:07:57.034 --> 00:08:00.615\ncountries have very clear legislative\nrequirements that are different,\n\n150\n00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:02.772\na safe harbor agreement\ncan bridge the gap and\n\n151\n00:08:02.772 --> 00:08:05.986\nallow the two countries to\neffectively manage data effectively.\n\n152\n00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:07.925\nThat's what a Safe Harbor\nrequirement will do.\n\n153\n00:08:07.925 --> 00:08:11.340\nSo sort of be thinking about that, be\naware of that as part of our conversation.\n\n154\n00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.140\nWhen we think about it, we've already\ntalked about data information\n\n155\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.870\nfrom the respective of ownership.\n\n156\n00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.750\nWe know that the data owner should\nhelp us to classify data and\n\n157\n00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.390\nshould stipulate how\ndata will be classified.\n\n158\n00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.630\nRemember that data ownership\nis really about understanding\n\n159\n00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.280\nwho is ultimately responsible for data.\n\n160\n00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.960\nWhen I own data, it's mine.\n\n161\n00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.210\nIn effect, if I own it,\nI can decide what will be done with.\n\n162\n00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.190\nI can decide how long\nit will stick around.\n\n163\n00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.260\nI could decide who should\nhave access to it.\n\n164\n00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.650\nI could decide if it should\nbe destroyed and when.\n\n165\n00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.560\nSo I wanna be thinking about the fact\nthat ownership implies control, right?\n\n166\n00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.690\nThis is a very important thought process\nfor me, important thought process for you.\n\n167\n00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:53.550\nWhen you think about becoming a CISSP,\nwe focus a lot on data management.\n\n168\n00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.000\nWe focus a lot on data ownership,\ndata accountability,\n\n169\n00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.710\nin terms of who's gonna be accountable and\nresponsible for data.\n\n170\n00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.840\nAnd we talk about access control\nsystems that help us to do this.\n\n171\n00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.118\nThings like discretionary access control,\nmandatory access control,\n\n172\n00:09:07.118 --> 00:09:11.327\nattribute-based access control,\ntemporal-based access control,\n\n173\n00:09:11.327 --> 00:09:14.925\nrule-based access control,\nrole-based access control.\n\n174\n00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:16.975\nStop me when you here one\nthat you may like, right?\n\n175\n00:09:16.975 --> 00:09:18.885\nAny or all these, and\nthere are more, by the way, and\n\n176\n00:09:18.885 --> 00:09:22.265\nwe'll talk about all those at some\npoint in one of our episodes together.\n\n177\n00:09:22.265 --> 00:09:24.715\nAnd you'll hear us go through and\nexplain what they are.\n\n178\n00:09:24.715 --> 00:09:27.240\nBut the idea is that there\nare many access control models.\n\n179\n00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.050\nThey are used, regardless of\nhow they're set up to operate,\n\n180\n00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:35.580\nto implement control of data, and control\nof the users that are accessing data.\n\n181\n00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.360\nWe talked about subjects and\nobjects in those models.\n\n182\n00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.380\nSubjects are going to be the users, and\n\n183\n00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.630\nthen objects are going\nto represent the data.\n\n184\n00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:47.910\nAnd so, subjects want access to objects,\nand objects have to effectively\n\n185\n00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.340\nallow themselves to be accessed by\nauthenticating users into the system.\n\n186\n00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.720\nAnd so we talked more about how all that\nworks, but information ownership and\n\n187\n00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.380\ndata ownership is a very big part of that.\n\n188\n00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.750\nWe have to understand\nwho owns the data and\n\n189\n00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.720\neffectively based on that,\nwhat they decide the data will or\n\n190\n00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.080\nwill not be allowed to be able to be\nused as, or used for, or seen by.\n\n191\n00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.680\nAnd those kind of questions come\nup with regards to ownership.\n\n192\n00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.850\nDetermining the impact the information\nhas on the organization,\n\n193\n00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.815\nin other words it's\na function of ownership.\n\n194\n00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:18.750\nUnderstanding the replacement cost of the\ninformation, is a a function of ownership.\n\n195\n00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.300\nDetermining who has a need to see\nthe data and under what circumstances,\n\n196\n00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:23.780\nthese are all functions of ownership.\n\n197\n00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.810\nThese are things that data ownership\nimplies that we would be doing.\n\n198\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.540\nSo, want to just make sure\nwe're aware of that and\n\n199\n00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:31.530\nwe understand that as\npart of the discussion.\n\n200\n00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.000\nWe've talked a lot about documentation and\nwhy documentation is so important.\n\n201\n00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.030\nEvery time we do something, we should\nhave a written record of what it is.\n\n202\n00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.830\nWe talk a lot in the discussions\nabout intrusion detection and\n\n203\n00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.880\nintrusion prevention systems and\nfirewalls, about the value of logging and\n\n204\n00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.810\nwriting everything down in a log so\nwe know it's been happening.\n\n205\n00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:52.980\nWe talk a lot in our discussions with\ndatabases about transactional logging.\n\n206\n00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.970\nSo we understand what's happening in\nwriting down all the transactions.\n\n207\n00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.360\nSo we see them and\ncan reproduce them if we need to.\n\n208\n00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.870\nEverywhere we go, everywhere we look,\neverywhere we turn, we see a discussion\n\n209\n00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.900\nabout documentation cropping up\nwith regards to system management.\n\n210\n00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.270\nIt's very, very important.\n\n211\n00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.890\nSo, generically, the idea for\nCISSP, and for that matter for\n\n212\n00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:14.670\nany IT professional not just a security\nfocused one, but any IT professional,\n\n213\n00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.940\nis the more documentation we have,\nthe better we are right?\n\n214\n00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.870\nAnd we can never have too much as we know,\nbecause when we ask people on average,\n\n215\n00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.705\nhey do you think your\ndocumentation is really good?\n\n216\n00:11:24.705 --> 00:11:28.080\nWhat we often hear from them is, you know\nit's okay but it could be better, right?\n\n217\n00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:31.120\nCould always do a better job\nif I had more time, right?\n\n218\n00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.580\nEverybody's always whining about time.\n\n219\n00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:33.968\nIf I just had more time.\n\n220\n00:11:33.968 --> 00:11:37.045\nIf you stopped complaining so\nmuch and you started doing your job,\n\n221\n00:11:37.045 --> 00:11:38.730\nyou'd have a lot more time, right?\n\n222\n00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.740\nSo, the idea is that when we do,\nand all kidding aside right,\n\n223\n00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.920\nwe clearly could do a better job if\nwe spend more time doing things.\n\n224\n00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.170\nThere's no doubt about that.\n\n225\n00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.540\nBut the balance and the problem is we only\nhave so many hours to do our job in a day.\n\n226\n00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.060\nAnd we only have so\nmany things that we can get done.\n\n227\n00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.908\nAnd usually documentation,\nalthough it's very important,\n\n228\n00:11:55.908 --> 00:11:58.605\nit's further down the list of\nthings that we need to get to.\n\n229\n00:11:58.605 --> 00:12:01.036\nBut sometimes, and\nmore often than not let's be honest,\n\n230\n00:12:01.036 --> 00:12:02.720\nusually don't have the time to get to.\n\n231\n00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.420\nRight, that's usually the rub and\nthat's the problem.\n\n232\n00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.420\nSo while documentation is very important,\ndata ownership implies the documentation\n\n233\n00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.320\nabout the data should be\nkept up to date as well.\n\n234\n00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.280\nData owners have the responsibility to\nmake sure documentation about the data\n\n235\n00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.090\nis kept up to date.\n\n236\n00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:20.630\nThat's one of the few things that data\nownership really demands of the owner,\n\n237\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:23.150\nis that documentation about\nthe data is kept up to date.\n\n238\n00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:27.108\nSo, ownership of the data,\nin terms of things like copy writing,\n\n239\n00:12:27.108 --> 00:12:30.860\ngetting a patent, perhaps a trademark,\nwe've spoken about those.\n\n240\n00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.940\nThose are things the data owner would\nprobably be involved in trying to do,\n\n241\n00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.500\nbecause they're part of\nthe responsibility of ownership.\n\n242\n00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:42.710\nMaking sure, not that we actually pull\nthe levers to create backups of our data,\n\n243\n00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.300\nbut that we have a thought process in\nthe organization, we have policies,\n\n244\n00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.720\nand we have procedures that stipulate\nthat our data will be backed up.\n\n245\n00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.240\nAnd we'll have copies of it in\ncase there's a disaster and\n\n246\n00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.420\na plan to recover it.\n\n247\n00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.310\nThat's part of data ownership,\nthat's part of the responsibility as well.\n\n248\n00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.820\nSo, these are all things we\nwant to be thinking about.\n\n249\n00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.900\nWe want to juxtapose,\n\n250\n00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.810\nwe want to compare data ownership with\nsomething known as data custodianship.\n\n251\n00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.320\nLittle bit of a different thought process,\nformal term.\n\n252\n00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.380\nWhat custodianship really means,\nis that we are going to be the caretakers\n\n253\n00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.510\nof the data on a day to\nday operational basis.\n\n254\n00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:17.510\nOwnership implies overarching\naccountability and responsibility for\n\n255\n00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:22.070\nthe systems around the management of\nthat data, and the classification of it,\n\n256\n00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:25.810\nto ensure that the data is going to\nbe used in the appropriate ways.\n\n257\n00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:30.030\nCustodianship is the implementation of\nthose controls and the management of data\n\n258\n00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:34.880\nwithin those systems, moment to moment,\nday to day, day in, day out kind of thing.\n\n259\n00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.360\nSo custodianship is about the actual\ntactical management of data,\n\n260\n00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.320\nwhereas ownership is about\nthe strategic operationalizing or\n\n261\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.800\nsetting up, and therefore\nenvisioning how data will be used.\n\n262\n00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.370\nWe want to make a clear distinction\nbetween these two roles.\n\n263\n00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.200\nThey both are very important, and\nthey both exist in the organization, but\n\n264\n00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.570\nwe don't always clearly define them.\n\n265\n00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:56.740\nA lot of times we'll just simply say,\noh yeah, you're the data owner Mike.\n\n266\n00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.310\nYou created that document.\n\n267\n00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:59.610\nMike, who's going to see that document?\n\n268\n00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:03.140\nAnd make says, well Mike is gonna see it,\nso I'm going to see it, right?\n\n269\n00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.240\nAdam's gonna see it and\nJoe's gonna see it.\n\n270\n00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.730\nAnybody else Mike, no, nobody else.\n\n271\n00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.240\nGreat, Mike, thank you.\n\n272\n00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.290\nAnd then that's all we do and\nthen somebody goes off and\n\n273\n00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:13.140\nimplements Mike's access control request.\n\n274\n00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:15.840\nOr maybe Mike implements it himself,\nif he's the data owner,\n\n275\n00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.310\nbut also happens to be able to do that.\n\n276\n00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.150\nHe may just say, I'll just go ahead and\nmake the appropriate changes on\n\n277\n00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.740\nthe access control list, and\nwe're done, cuz I own the data.\n\n278\n00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:25.660\nNo big deal.\n\n279\n00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.630\nWhat we're really doing is asking Mike\nto play the role of data owner and then,\n\n280\n00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.120\nwe're asking Mike to\ntell the data custodian,\n\n281\n00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.360\nhow Mike wants to implement the ownership\nresponsibilities that he's been given.\n\n282\n00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.742\nSo, this is very a big important\ndistinction for us, so\n\n283\n00:14:38.742 --> 00:14:40.390\nwe wanna make sure we draw.\n\n284\n00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.559\nSo, when we assign the role of data\ncustodianship we have to be clear,\n\n285\n00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:46.655\nwe have to be unequivocal about\nwho will inhabit that role.\n\n286\n00:14:46.655 --> 00:14:51.450\nIn most organizations IT administrators\nare gonna be the data custodians.\n\n287\n00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:55.460\nBut we want to keep in mind that\ncustodianship may be implied in the access\n\n288\n00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.550\ncontrol model.\n\n289\n00:14:56.550 --> 00:15:00.830\nIn other words, a mandatory access control\nmodel, while it is maintained by IT\n\n290\n00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.710\nadministrators, actually implements\nmoment to moment ownership and\n\n291\n00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.890\nmanagement of the data,\nonce the data is put into the system.\n\n292\n00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:12.700\nBecause the mandatory access control\nmodel implies data sensitivity and\n\n293\n00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.030\nuser labeling, both the object and\nthe subject have to be labeled.\n\n294\n00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:19.720\nAnd they have to be at the same level\nin order to effectively be able to see\n\n295\n00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.490\neach other.\n\n296\n00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:24.290\nOr the user has to be at a minimum,\nlet's say, at the level of the data.\n\n297\n00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.740\nThey may be above the data, but\nthey have to be at least at the minimum\n\n298\n00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.740\nlevel of the data in order for\nthe two to correspond.\n\n299\n00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.960\nSo if we have a three tiered system,\nhypothetically, level one being\n\n300\n00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:36.968\nthe lowest, level two being the middle,\nlevel three being the highest.\n\n301\n00:15:36.968 --> 00:15:41.150\nIf a user's labeled at level one,\nor given level one access, and\n\n302\n00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.740\ndata exists at level one.\n\n303\n00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.740\nThey're both at the same level, and in\na mandatory model they can see each other.\n\n304\n00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.800\nAnd, as a result, user and\ndata can interact.\n\n305\n00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.985\nThe mandatory access control\nmodel is implementing that.\n\n306\n00:15:50.985 --> 00:15:54.217\nIt's acting as the custodian of the data,\nonce the system is set up,\n\n307\n00:15:54.217 --> 00:15:56.072\nis what I'm trying to point out to you.\n\n308\n00:15:56.072 --> 00:16:00.052\nWhile there is an oversight role, there is\na management role outside of the system,\n\n309\n00:16:00.052 --> 00:16:04.052\nthe actual implementation of the controls\nis being done through the system itself.\n\n310\n00:16:04.052 --> 00:16:05.760\nIf I was a level two user and\n\n311\n00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.910\ndata was at level one I would\nstill be able to see the data.\n\n312\n00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:15.190\nBut if we invert that, if data's at\nlevel two and the user is at level one,\n\n313\n00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.660\nuser doesn't see the data\nin a mandatory system.\n\n314\n00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.390\nSo we want to to make sure we\nunderstand the data custodianship\n\n315\n00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:24.850\nhas to be assigned as a role, but\nthat rule may then actually be implemented\n\n316\n00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.880\nthrough an axis control\nmechanism of some kind.\n\n317\n00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.220\nWe wanna just be aware of that and\n\n318\n00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.130\nkinda keep that in the back\nof our minds as well.\n\n319\n00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.640\nWhen we think about data and\nwe think about data use, and\n\n320\n00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.300\nwe think about how data\ncan be implemented for\n\n321\n00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.410\nuse, we also wanna think about\nthe quality of data, right?\n\n322\n00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:39.660\nIs data good?\n\n323\n00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.340\nHow do we know?\n\n324\n00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.680\nRemember, integrity is a very\nimportant part of the conversation\n\n325\n00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.040\naround information security management.\n\n326\n00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.280\nIf we don't have integrity,\nwe may not have data that's good, and\n\n327\n00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.730\nif we don't have data that's good, the use\nof that may be flawed or compromised.\n\n328\n00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:56.130\nSo we have to think about data quality as\nwell as data management and data usage.\n\n329\n00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:59.310\nThis is another important aspect of data,\nand when we think about privacy and\n\n330\n00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.460\nprivacy protection,\n\n331\n00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.650\nwe're thinking about the quality of\nthe data as well as the data itself.\n\n332\n00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.500\nData quality standards would involve\na variety of things, things like accuracy,\n\n333\n00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:12.810\nthings like reliability, things like\nrepeatability, reproducibility.\n\n334\n00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:17.840\nThe data itself should be\nrelevant to the organization.\n\n335\n00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.580\nSo these kinda things\nhave to be looked at and\n\n336\n00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.610\nexamined when we think about data quality.\n\n337\n00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:22.860\nIs the data timely?\n\n338\n00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.890\nIs it complete?\n\n339\n00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.750\nThese are all things that we would\nwant to know and be aware of.\n\n340\n00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:30.150\nWe often talk about quality\ncontrol versus quality assurance.\n\n341\n00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.800\nQA versus QC,\nthat's two ways of thinking about quality.\n\n342\n00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:36.360\nQuality control is really\nan assessment of the quality\n\n343\n00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:41.060\nbased on internal standards and processes\nthat monitor the quality of the data and\n\n344\n00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.660\nthe system but\nfrom an internal perspective.\n\n345\n00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:47.650\nQuality assurance is an assessment\nof quality based on standards,\n\n346\n00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.600\ntypically external to the organization or\nthe process.\n\n347\n00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.750\nSo QC is really an internal look\nat the quality of the data,\n\n348\n00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.900\nassessing the data and monitoring it.\n\n349\n00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.810\nQA is typically thought of as an external\nlook at the data from a quality and\n\n350\n00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:01.930\na standards perspective.\n\n351\n00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.390\nJust want to differentiate\nbetween the two,\n\n352\n00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:07.250\nand make sure we're comfortable with\nboth of those thought processes as well.\n\n353\n00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.520\nWhen we assess data quality we\nalso have to think about verifying\n\n354\n00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.440\nthe integrity of the data and\nwe made that point earlier.\n\n355\n00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.760\nI just want to remind you of that.\n\n356\n00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.980\nIt's not just about hey from a QA\nprospective that data looks good.\n\n357\n00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.710\nWe have to verify the data still has\nintegrity and indeed still has value.\n\n358\n00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.760\nAnd this is also a very important thought\nprocess for us to engage in as well.\n\n359\n00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.320\nWe've talked about\nthe value of documentation.\n\n360\n00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.640\nWe've talked about being able\nto layout classification and\n\n361\n00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.959\nqualification of the data.\n\n362\n00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:36.070\nThese things are all done based on\ndata standards and the organization\n\n363\n00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:39.960\nshould typically create some sort of\na data standard that is gonna layout for\n\n364\n00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:44.380\nus, as security professionals, for\nthe information workers in the system, for\n\n365\n00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:47.220\nthe information owners,\nfor the data custodians.\n\n366\n00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.680\nWhat the expectation of data\nmanagement will look like.\n\n367\n00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.990\nAnd data standards describe the objects,\nthe features or items that are collected\n\n368\n00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:58.070\nabout data and how data will then be used\nis really what a data standard stipulates.\n\n369\n00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.270\nSo we wanna make sure we are aware\nof that and we think about that.\n\n370\n00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:04.450\nThe benefits of data standards\nare better data management overall,\n\n371\n00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:08.240\nincreased data sharing, typically\nhigher quality of data will be found,\n\n372\n00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.980\nimproved consistency and integration\nof the data will come from a standard.\n\n373\n00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.990\nThese are all things that are important.\n\n374\n00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.890\nIf you have never been involved\nin drafting a data standard, and\n\n375\n00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.760\nlet's be honest, most of us unless you do\nthis specifically may never have done this\n\n376\n00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.290\nor even thought about it.\n\n377\n00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.970\nIt may not be something you're just really\nsure how to do, it can be kind of hard,\n\n378\n00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.480\na little bit daunting.\n\n379\n00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.590\nThere is guidance out there,\nyou can, of course,\n\n380\n00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:33.030\ngo out and look for\nsample standards, right?\n\n381\n00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.630\nWe've talked about policies,\nthat you can find policies online.\n\n382\n00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:38.330\nYou can find sample data\nstandards online as well.\n\n383\n00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.360\nYou can talk to peers and colleagues.\n\n384\n00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.910\nI've talked a lot about the value of\nnetworking with organizations that\n\n385\n00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.240\nwill help you to build your\ninformation security career over time.\n\n386\n00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.120\nAnd talking to peers and\ncolleagues that do these kind of things,\n\n387\n00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.300\nthat may have a background with this,\nis another way for\n\n388\n00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.490\nyou to be able to get some insight\ninto drafting data standards.\n\n389\n00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:56.990\nBut if all else fails, right?\n\n390\n00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:58.950\nGo to the oracle of\nthe Internet as we often say.\n\n391\n00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:00.130\nGo to Google, right?\n\n392\n00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.520\nAnd Google, and if you Google for\n\n393\n00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.790\ndata standards, you will find a wealth of\ninformation about what standards exists,\n\n394\n00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.670\nwhich ones you many wanna find and\ntherefore perhaps co opt and\n\n395\n00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.800\nuse would then be a question for\nyou to consider, ultimately.\n\n396\n00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.640\nBut we also have to think about the legal\nimplications of data management when it\n\n397\n00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.670\ncomes to privacy.\n\n398\n00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.790\nWe've talked about the EU\nprivacy protection directive.\n\n399\n00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.540\nThere are international, typically.\n\n400\n00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.290\nThere may be national,\nthere may be regional and local laws,\n\n401\n00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.370\nstandards, guidelines,\nthings that we have to be aware of.\n\n402\n00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.610\nThere could be,\nin the United States for instance,\n\n403\n00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.860\nfederal laws that stipulate\nhow data has to be managed.\n\n404\n00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.620\nThings like the Fair Credit Reporting Act\nfor instance, right?\n\n405\n00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.030\nWill stipulate how credit Information\nthat's supposed to be reported to manage\n\n406\n00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:41.170\nfor individuals, but\nthen there may be state-based laws\n\n407\n00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:44.360\nthat in some cases may have a different\ntake or interpretation on things.\n\n408\n00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.170\nMore often than not, the federal law may\n\n409\n00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.660\nbe the law that we follow because it is\nthe overarching law in the United States,\n\n410\n00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.420\nbut that doesn't always mean\nthe state law can be ignored.\n\n411\n00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.590\nThe state law may take precedence, really\ndepends on what we're talking about.\n\n412\n00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.900\nAnd so, we really have to be aware of\nthe fact that as a security professional,\n\n413\n00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.800\nthere may be more than one\nset of regulations and\n\n414\n00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.460\nrequirements we have to abide by.\n\n415\n00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.190\nThere could be local laws within the city\nor the municipality, or the county, or\n\n416\n00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:11.820\nwherever you may find yourself that you\nhave to abide by as a business owner.\n\n417\n00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.300\nYou may have to follow those along with\nthe state laws, and the federal laws and\n\n418\n00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.170\nthe international laws and\nall of those things, right?\n\n419\n00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:21.180\nSo we have to think about the multilayer\n\n420\n00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.940\ncomplexity of jurisdiction when\nit comes to this kind of thing.\n\n421\n00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.520\nWe'll walk through in our head\nwhat that may mean ultimately, and\n\n422\n00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.250\nwhat that could mean is very\ncomplicated to manage something.\n\n423\n00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:30.810\nThat's really what it\ncould mean ultimately.\n\n424\n00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:32.310\nWe have to think about\nthe data life cycle.\n\n425\n00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.460\nWe've talked a lot about life cycles and\nwhy they're important.\n\n426\n00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.400\nWe've talked about the idea of\nrequirements gathering upfront, thinking\n\n427\n00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.010\nabout how to acquire an implement,\nthinking about how to operate and\n\n428\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.550\nmaintain, and ultimately how\nto decommission and dispose.\n\n429\n00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:47.920\nThese are the standard forms,\nsort of standard phases, of a life cycle.\n\n430\n00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.930\nWe want to make sure we understand what\nthose are and why they're important.\n\n431\n00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:52.420\nWe've talked a lot about them already.\n\n432\n00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.980\nWe also want to think about data modeling\na little bit when we think about privacy\n\n433\n00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:58.070\nand the use of data.\n\n434\n00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:00.540\nHow do we create databases?\n\n435\n00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:03.891\nAnd how do we put data into storage\nfacilities that can then be pulled out,\n\n436\n00:22:03.891 --> 00:22:04.930\nreported on and used.\n\n437\n00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.240\nAnd data modeling helps us to do this.\n\n438\n00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.640\nHelps us to examine the data, helps us\nto understand the value of the data,\n\n439\n00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.590\nthrough reporting, through more often than\nnot, today is referred to as either BI,\n\n440\n00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.960\nBusiness Intelligence, or\nbig data, big data analytics.\n\n441\n00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.590\nThese are terms we often hear and\nwe often hear a lot about.\n\n442\n00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:23.640\nWhen we examine data,\nwhen we wanna be able to use it,\n\n443\n00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.700\nwe want to extract value\nout of it in effect, right?\n\n444\n00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:29.720\nWe wanna be able to take a spreadsheet\nthat has a bunch of information on it.\n\n445\n00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.440\nAnd we want to then be able to read\nthat information in innovative ways,\n\n446\n00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.620\nexamine the value of the data and\nextract it, so we can use it.\n\n447\n00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.490\nMaybe it's a spreadsheet that has a bunch\nof sales figures in it and we wanna be\n\n448\n00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:43.980\nable to see what the cumulative sales\nwhere for that particular time period.\n\n449\n00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:44.890\nThat's pretty straightforward.\n\n450\n00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.500\nThat's just a quick calculation.\n\n451\n00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.385\nBut what about trending in that data?\n\n452\n00:22:48.385 --> 00:22:51.890\nDid the sales go up or down,\nday by day, week by week,\n\n453\n00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:53.610\nmonth by month over the term?\n\n454\n00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.470\nThat's apparent when we start to\nstep back and look at the data\n\n455\n00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:00.130\nat a broader scope by looking at each\nindividual transaction it's very hard for\n\n456\n00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:02.455\nus to get a sense of whether\nwe're trending up or down.\n\n457\n00:23:02.455 --> 00:23:04.795\nSo there may be a reason to\nbe able to do data modeling,\n\n458\n00:23:04.795 --> 00:23:08.135\nto answer questions about what\nthe hidden value of the data is.\n\n459\n00:23:08.135 --> 00:23:10.905\nAnd this is what really data\nmodeling helps us to understand and\n\n460\n00:23:10.905 --> 00:23:11.905\nhelps us to think through.\n\n461\n00:23:11.905 --> 00:23:14.815\nSo, wanna make sure we're aware of that,\nreally understand that.\n\n462\n00:23:14.815 --> 00:23:19.440\nWe obviously have to think about\nthe design of these systems conceptually,\n\n463\n00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.510\nwhat is a database gonna be designed like?\n\n464\n00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:23.160\nWhat kind of access do we have?\n\n465\n00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.630\nIs it a relational model?\n\n466\n00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.700\nIs it gonna be a different\nkind of database?\n\n467\n00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.730\nAre we gonna store data outside of\ndatabases just in file share somewhere?\n\n468\n00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:34.400\nUse what's called an enterprise content\nmanagement system, and ECM system,\n\n469\n00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.530\nto get access to it.\n\n470\n00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:38.910\nThink about Websphere,\nthink about SharePoint.\n\n471\n00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.520\nThink about these kinds of systems\nthat allow us to effectively\n\n472\n00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.580\ncreate large electronic filing cabinets,\nright?\n\n473\n00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:48.425\nAnd then with a web front end access\nthe data pretty much on demand.\n\n474\n00:23:48.425 --> 00:23:51.375\nWhenever we want to see it provided\nwe authenticate into the system and\n\n475\n00:23:51.375 --> 00:23:53.245\nfollow the appropriate usage rules.\n\n476\n00:23:53.245 --> 00:23:54.774\nWrite a program up front.\n\n477\n00:23:54.774 --> 00:23:57.532\nWrite web based API to be\nable to access the data.\n\n478\n00:23:57.532 --> 00:24:00.960\nWrite level of access, or\nwrite level of access control.\n\n479\n00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.085\nAnd they were able to get to the data.\n\n480\n00:24:02.085 --> 00:24:03.583\nSo what's the design look like?\n\n481\n00:24:03.583 --> 00:24:07.890\nThese are also important for us as\nsecurity professionals to think about.\n\n482\n00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:10.390\nWe may not work with data\nbases on a regular basis.\n\n483\n00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.890\nWe may not be the data base manager or\nin other words,\n\n484\n00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.670\nthe DBA administrator or analyst.\n\n485\n00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.200\nThat doesn't mean we don't\nhave the responsibility\n\n486\n00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.500\nto understand the data is stored\nin places that needs security.\n\n487\n00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.680\nAnd we have to provide confidentiality,\nintegrity, and\n\n488\n00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.870\navailability to controls to that data.\n\n489\n00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:27.890\nWe may have to partner\nin other words right and\n\n490\n00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.590\nwork with a team of individuals\nthat help us to understand\n\n491\n00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.220\nthe specifics of the technology so\nthat we can better do our job.\n\n492\n00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:38.810\nAnd database management is a subset of\na very important larger conversation\n\n493\n00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:40.640\naround asset management and privacy.\n\n494\n00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.510\nBut if you don't specialize in database\nmanagement then you'd better specialize in\n\n495\n00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.710\npartnering with people that do is what I\noften tell my customers and my students.\n\n496\n00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.110\nBecause you're not gonna\nbe good at everything.\n\n497\n00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:54.438\nAnd it's foolish, it's a fallacy,\nto try to get good at everything.\n\n498\n00:24:54.438 --> 00:24:57.360\nBecause you're just not gonna\nbe able to get good enough\n\n499\n00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.380\nthat you're really going to make\na difference at doing it the right way.\n\n500\n00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.280\nYou're gonna do it, but\n\n501\n00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.060\nyou're probably not gonna get it as right\nas you could is what I'm suggesting.\n\n502\n00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:07.060\nSpecialize in things that you\nreally know how to do well,\n\n503\n00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.040\nthat you have a passion for and find\nthe people that specialize in the other\n\n504\n00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.380\nthings you need that they do well and\nthey have a passion for.\n\n505\n00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.590\nGet really good at partnering, and you\nwill get really good at security in other\n\n506\n00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.900\nwords, is what I would suggest to you and\nI want you to think about.\n\n507\n00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.250\nSo just think about that.\n\n508\n00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.200\nHow do we look at auditing?\n\n509\n00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.070\nWe've got data stored,\ngot it in the database,\n\n510\n00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:27.360\nwe've classified it, we've categorized it,\nwe've assigned ownership of it.\n\n511\n00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.100\nWe're using it, but\nhow do we verify what's going on?\n\n512\n00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.890\nHow do we audit data to ensure\nthat ultimately the use of\n\n513\n00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:36.380\ndata is happening along the guidelines\nthat we've set out and stipulate it?\n\n514\n00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.550\nThis is an issue,\nthis is a really concern.\n\n515\n00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.380\nIf we can't verify what's happening,\nwe can't know for\n\n516\n00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.450\nsure it's happening the right way.\n\n517\n00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:48.150\nAnd audits are incredibly important\nevents in the lifecycle of data,\n\n518\n00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:53.140\nbecause audits stipulate and therefore\nspecify what is actually happening,\n\n519\n00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.720\nas opposed to what we think is happening.\n\n520\n00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.960\nSo we have the effectively\nthe to be situation, right?\n\n521\n00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.860\nI'd like to be like that.\n\n522\n00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:05.040\nBut audits really help us to understand\nwhat we currently are doing, the as is,\n\n523\n00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.100\nas opposed to the to be.\n\n524\n00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.390\nAnd they verify that the as is,\n\n525\n00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.210\nthe current state,\nis exactly what we hope it would be.\n\n526\n00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:13.870\nAnd if it's not,\nit shows us the delta's the gaps, and\n\n527\n00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:17.710\npoints to places where we may need\nto make some additional fixes or\n\n528\n00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.330\ndeterminations about doing\nsomething differently, ultimately.\n\n529\n00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.700\nAudits often are scary words for\npeople, right?\n\n530\n00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.440\nWe hear auditing and we think oh my god,\nsomeone's gonna come in and\n\n531\n00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.620\ntell me I'm doing everything wrong, and\nI'm gonna have to start over again.\n\n532\n00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.020\nAudits don't actually have to be that.\n\n533\n00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.900\nThey're not adversarial unless\nyou make them that way.\n\n534\n00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.350\nWhat you need to understand is\nthat the auditor has a job to do.\n\n535\n00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:39.760\nAnd that auditor is there to figure out\nwhat you're supposed to be doing and\n\n536\n00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.330\nwhether you're doing it the right way.\n\n537\n00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.220\nIf you already know what\nyou're supposed to do and\n\n538\n00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:47.090\nyou're doing it the right way, the auditor\nis not gonna have a lot to do, right?\n\n539\n00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:48.790\nYou're gonna buy them a cup of coffee,\n\n540\n00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.830\nyou're gonna hang out with them a little\nbit, cuz their usually fun people.\n\n541\n00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.390\nI know that cuz I'm an auditor and\n\n542\n00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.510\nlook at the cool socks I was\nwearing when we started.\n\n543\n00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.190\nAuditors that wear cool socks\nlike that have to be cool.\n\n544\n00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.200\nHow else could you possibly\ninterpret that, right?\n\n545\n00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.140\nSo you're gonna buy them a cup of coffee.\n\n546\n00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:03.200\nYou're gonna talk to them.\n\n547\n00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:04.420\nYou're gonna let them do their job,\n\n548\n00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.950\nget out of their way when they say I\nneed some time to look at this stuff.\n\n549\n00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.700\nBut hopefully they're gonna come back and\ntell you, hey everything is good.\n\n550\n00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.130\nBecause you're exactly in\nthe place you need to be.\n\n551\n00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.470\nYou're doing the right things.\n\n552\n00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.210\nIf you're not following procedure.\n\n553\n00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:16.840\nIf you're not following policy.\n\n554\n00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.650\nIf you don't have good documentation.\n\n555\n00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:22.410\nIf we ask you where is the policy\nthat stipulates how to do this, and\n\n556\n00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.105\nyour answer is, what's a policy?\n\n557\n00:27:24.105 --> 00:27:26.620\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're not gonna have a good day.\n\n558\n00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:27.640\nRight?\n\n559\n00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.570\nNo matter how much coffee you buy me,\nyou're gonna see me look like this.\n\n560\n00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:32.300\nI'm gonna be very stern.\n\n561\n00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.450\nI'm not gonna look like this,\nvery happy, right?\n\n562\n00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:37.920\nSo when we audit we wanna give\nyou a clean bill of health.\n\n563\n00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.480\nWe can only do that legitimately if you're\nactually doing the job the right way.\n\n564\n00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:42.630\nThat's just the reality of audits.\n\n565\n00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:43.190\nThat's what they are.\n\n566\n00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:44.420\nSo just make sure you understand that.\n\n567\n00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.380\nMake sure you understand that.\n\n568\n00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.720\nObviously very important\nto think about that.\n\n569\n00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.060\nYou'll finally as we're wrapping up our\nconversations in this area thinking about\n\n570\n00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.970\ndata access, data sharing, decimation,\nare also important points when we come to\n\n571\n00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:59.340\nprivacy in the conversation about asset\nmanagement and data privacy overall.\n\n572\n00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.220\nWhen we think about how How\nwe're gonna access data.\n\n573\n00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.590\nAre we doing that securely?\n\n574\n00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:05.920\nAre we using secure encrypted\ncommunication mechanisms?\n\n575\n00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.980\nWhen we're storing data,\n\n576\n00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.720\nare we storing data in encrypted form\nto prevent it from being compromised?\n\n577\n00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.560\nWhen we are decimating we're\nsharing broadly and sending it out.\n\n578\n00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:18.770\nAre we doing that via email without any\nsort of digital signatures, without any\n\n579\n00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:21.690\nsort of encryption so people don't know\nwhether the data is legitimate and\n\n580\n00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:23.290\nknow whether it's been secured?\n\n581\n00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:25.190\nWhen we have our\ncryptography conversation,\n\n582\n00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:28.510\none of our upcoming episodes,\nwe'll talk about both symmetric and\n\n583\n00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:33.030\nasymmetric cryptography, and the value\nof using cryptography to secure data.\n\n584\n00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:37.110\nBut also to create integrity,\nnon-repudiation or proof or origin for\n\n585\n00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:41.120\ndata, when we think about being able\nto use integrity controls like hashing\n\n586\n00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.280\nto do these kind of things.\n\n587\n00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.250\nThese are important conversations, and\nthis is the kind of thing we have to think\n\n588\n00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:48.720\nabout in this area as well, because\nif we're not focused on those things.\n\n589\n00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.530\nIf we're not focusing on or thinking about\nhow we access data, how we share it,\n\n590\n00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.940\nhow we disseminate it, then what's gonna\nhappen is, somebody's gonna come and\n\n591\n00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.910\naccess it in a way\nthey're not supposed to.\n\n592\n00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:02.500\nOr they're gonna take it away from us,\nand or when we have data that's in\n\n593\n00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.440\nthe system and we think we're securing it,\nwhat about the data that's left behind\n\n594\n00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:10.030\nwhen we destroy the data when we get rid\nof it at the end of the data life cycle?\n\n595\n00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.520\nWhat about data remnants?\n\n596\n00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.460\nWe've talked about residual risk before,\nrisk that's left over.\n\n597\n00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:15.790\nData get's left over as well.\n\n598\n00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:18.600\nThis is another important element\nof the conversation here.\n\n599\n00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:23.160\nData remanence is data that's left over\nwhen we destroy the data in the system\n\n600\n00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.440\nthrough accepted methods.\n\n601\n00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.080\nWe overwrite the data,\nwe degauss the drive, whatever we may do.\n\n602\n00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.090\nThere's always something left behind.\n\n603\n00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.660\nThe question is whether we can\nactually get to the data and\n\n604\n00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.700\nreconstitute it or not.\n\n605\n00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:38.040\nAnd this is also a part of the data\nprivacy and data auditing conversation.\n\n606\n00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:42.480\nDestroying media and getting rid of\nthe data that is there in a standard or\n\n607\n00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.650\ncertified way to ensure\nthe data is not exposed.\n\n608\n00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:49.960\nWe don't breach confidentiality, we don't\nbreach integrity, but we do safeguard\n\n609\n00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.530\nthe data destruction process is incredibly\nimportant for the security professional.\n\n610\n00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:56.280\nWe talked about what gets left behind.\n\n611\n00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.130\nWe talked about some of\nthe ways you can do that.\n\n612\n00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:00.740\nMake sure you're aware of all these\nthings, all these encompassing points of\n\n613\n00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:03.756\nthe conversation we've had\nwith regards to privacy.\n\n614\n00:30:03.756 --> 00:30:06.410\n>> Very good Adam,\nit's a great look at privacy and\n\n615\n00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:10.790\nhow to protect that data that information\nmake sure it's kept secure again.\n\n616\n00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:13.280\nAnother one of those throughout\nit's life cycle right,\n\n617\n00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:17.360\nfrom when that data was created,\nto when it's stores, maintained, accessed\n\n618\n00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:20.750\nas well as in the end of its lifetime\nwhen we have to get rid of that data.\n\n619\n00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.400\nAlso a little insightful look\ninto the world of auditors and\n\n620\n00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.700\nhow to keep them happy and\nmake sure your auditors know.\n\n621\n00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.230\nMake sure you're doing it right and\nget them coffee and you should\n\n622\n00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:30.650\n>> And compliment them on their socks.\n\n623\n00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:31.970\nThat's also very important.\n\n624\n00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.940\n>> Absolutely,\nmake sure you look at their socks.\n\n625\n00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.070\nAll right, Adam, we appreciate all that,\nwe hope everybody enjoyed watching.\n\n626\n00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:40.503\nRemember, if you wanna attend\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n627\n00:30:40.503 --> 00:30:43.887\nall you gotta do is drop us\nan email at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n628\n00:30:43.887 --> 00:30:46.910\nThat's gonna do it for this episode,\nsigning out, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n629\n00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:47.770\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n630\n00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:48.900\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n631\n00:30:48.900 -->

00:00:19.815\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're gonna be doing our CISSP.\n\n4\n00:00:19.815 --> 00:00:24.377\nAnd specifically, we're gonna be looking\nat retention policies and data security.\n\n5\n00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:28.738\nWe're gonna take a look at policies that\ndictate how long we can keep stuff around,\n\n6\n00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:33.700\nor how long we should, we're talking about\nmedia as well as hardware, and personnel.\n\n7\n00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.190\nAnd then we're gonna look at\nour data security controls and\n\n8\n00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.460\nsetting up baselines for those.\n\n9\n00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.810\nAnd different ways that we\nhandle our data, again,\n\n10\n00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.960\nit depends is the data at rest?\n\n11\n00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.934\nIs it in transit?\n\n12\n00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:48.070\nThat's gonna change the way\nwe handle that data.\n\n13\n00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.159\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Adam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:50.914\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n15\n00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:52.270\n>> Good, good, good.\n\n16\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.300\nGood to see everybody, even if it is\nonly virtually through a camera lens.\n\n17\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.700\nBut still,\nglad to have you here nonetheless.\n\n18\n00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.230\nLet's talk a little bit about\nappropriate retention policies.\n\n19\n00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.610\nWhen we think about retaining things,\nas Mike was saying,\n\n20\n00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.170\nwe're thinking about\nkeeping things around.\n\n21\n00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.500\nHow long do we need them?\n\n22\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.640\nWhat kind of things do we wanna keep?\n\n23\n00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.280\nIf you own a home,\nyou go through this every year in theory,\n\n24\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.090\nat least once a year.\n\n25\n00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.813\nYou gotta go clean out the garage, we tend\nto call it spring cleaning here in the US.\n\n26\n00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:18.198\nAlthough seasons are becoming a little\nmore muddled, may be harder to figure out\n\n27\n00:01:18.198 --> 00:01:20.652\nwhen that is, at least for\nus here in sunny south Florida.\n\n28\n00:01:20.652 --> 00:01:22.551\n>> Looks like crap.\n>> See there, you missed that whole thing,\n\n29\n00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:23.078\nthat's why.\n\n30\n00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:24.946\nSo you know when you go through and\nyou clean up,\n\n31\n00:01:24.946 --> 00:01:27.490\nyou figure out what you want to keep,\nwhat you want to get rid of.\n\n32\n00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.065\nAnd you put stuff off to the side and\n\n33\n00:01:29.065 --> 00:01:32.560\nyou focus on keeping the things\nthat you want and you reorganize.\n\n34\n00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.970\nSo generically the idea is the same\nwhen we think about information,\n\n35\n00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.200\nthink about assets.\n\n36\n00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.780\nDo we keep things forever?\n\n37\n00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.490\nYou may be one of those people that\nwill say, hey I've got to keep that\n\n38\n00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.210\nfile from 1925 just in case somebody may\nwant it at some point in the future.\n\n39\n00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.800\nGuilty as charged.\n\n40\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.470\nThat would be me.\n\n41\n00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.580\nI have every email that goes back 20 years\n\n42\n00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.320\nin our organization on\nthe repository of information.\n\n43\n00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.430\nBut the reality is it's important to\nfigure out how to keep the things that\n\n44\n00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.590\nare relevant, but also then securely get\nrid of the things that we no longer need.\n\n45\n00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.730\nAnd along the way, we have to figure out\nhow long something should be kept for,\n\n46\n00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.320\nunder what conditions and with what\nfocus in terms of data classification,\n\n47\n00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.310\ncategorization and secure usage.\n\n48\n00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.000\nSo, retention is all about these things\nand really thinking through this.\n\n49\n00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.800\nWe know that we need\nultimately to drive retention.\n\n50\n00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.610\nSomething that we've\nreferred to as governance.\n\n51\n00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.660\nAnd we've talked a bit about GRC\nactivities generically in prior episodes,\n\n52\n00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.340\nsome of our prior conversations.\n\n53\n00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.190\nGovernance, risk, and compliance\nactivities are how we often refer to them.\n\n54\n00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.070\nGovernance specifically is really the idea\nof applying policy to a problem, and\n\n55\n00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.000\nthen managing to that end.\n\n56\n00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.380\nSo governance is all about making\nsure we do the things we need to do\n\n57\n00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.710\ndriven by the specific policy and\n\n58\n00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.110\nthen procedures that implement,\nto align us with business requirements.\n\n59\n00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.870\nSo that's what governance is all about.\n\n60\n00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.320\nAnd so establishing retention and\nestablishing archiving and establishing\n\n61\n00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.883\nthe thought process around information\nmanagement is really governed by or, well,\n\n62\n00:03:00.883 --> 00:03:04.190\n[LAUGH] Without meaning to say it twice,\nI will say it twice.\n\n63\n00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.748\nThe concept is governed by the application\nof the file process of governance.\n\n64\n00:03:08.748 --> 00:03:12.321\nGovernance really helps us to figure out\nhow to do the things we want to do and\n\n65\n00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:15.063\nto insure that we're doing\nthem according to the rules.\n\n66\n00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:17.920\nThe stipulations and\nthe thought processes we've laid down.\n\n67\n00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.469\nSo understanding where data exists,\nunderstanding how to classify and\n\n68\n00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.920\ndefine data, archiving and managing data.\n\n69\n00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.440\nThese are all functions that\nInformation governance and\n\n70\n00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.770\narchiving policies would help us\nto drive and ultimately to manage.\n\n71\n00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.353\nAnd so\nwe want to be thinking about these things.\n\n72\n00:03:32.353 --> 00:03:37.215\nBuilding, ultimately, effective overall\ndata retention policies is as much\n\n73\n00:03:37.215 --> 00:03:41.361\nabout understanding what is the value\nof the data as anything else.\n\n74\n00:03:41.361 --> 00:03:44.141\nBut equally important as what\nis the value of the data,\n\n75\n00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:48.490\nit's also about making sure that we\nunderstand how long data stays relevant.\n\n76\n00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.920\nHow long data is important\nin the organization.\n\n77\n00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.880\nYet we may, for instance in the United\nStates, we typically have from a financial\n\n78\n00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.550\nrecords standpoint, for government\nentities as well as for private companies,\n\n79\n00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.900\nwe typically have a seven year window\nwhere we have to keep information around\n\n80\n00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.310\nfor tax reporting purposes,\nthings like that.\n\n81\n00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.720\nIf you are in a private company, not\npublicly held, and you're not divulging\n\n82\n00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.335\nfinancial information, you still have to\nkeep those records for about seven years,\n\n83\n00:04:14.335 --> 00:04:17.210\ncuz the government, when you pay\ntaxes every year, may come back and\n\n84\n00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.210\naudit you and\nwant to see that information.\n\n85\n00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.568\nSo we have a built-in retention policy\nthere that is approximately a seven year\n\n86\n00:04:23.568 --> 00:04:24.877\nwindow, 84 months.\n\n87\n00:04:24.877 --> 00:04:28.636\nSo, we can look at that and say,\nwell okay, if I have to keep records for\n\n88\n00:04:28.636 --> 00:04:32.784\nseven years, am I going to store them\nsomewhere where anybody can get to them?\n\n89\n00:04:32.784 --> 00:04:36.990\nAm I going to store them in a place that's\non site, and then store them off site?\n\n90\n00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.910\nYears ago this would have\nbeen a physical conversation.\n\n91\n00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.463\nWould have been boxes of\nrecords in what they call them.\n\n92\n00:04:43.463 --> 00:04:44.327\n>> Banker's boxes.\n\n93\n00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:44.830\nRight.\n\n94\n00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.170\nA bankers boxes.\n\n95\n00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.060\nAnd you would have put\nthem in file folders.\n\n96\n00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.390\nAnd labeled them by month and\nby year and whatever.\n\n97\n00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.450\nThese days while you still may have that,\n\n98\n00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.880\nreality is a lot of the data's\nprobably electronic today.\n\n99\n00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.310\nAnd so you're gonna store it and\nit may not be in a storage facility.\n\n100\n00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.440\nIt may be in a data storage\nfacility that is now digital.\n\n101\n00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.970\nSo, we're thinking about storing it on\nthe network, it may be a SAN or a NAS or\n\n102\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.950\nputting it into a secure file storage\n\n103\n00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.420\nsolution that a third\nparty vendor may sell us.\n\n104\n00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.370\nCloud based today for instance.\n\n105\n00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.096\nSo we may paste and byte it to archive and\nstore the data for us.\n\n106\n00:05:16.096 --> 00:05:18.035\nAre we going to encrypt the data?\n\n107\n00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:19.810\nAre we going to store it unencrypted?\n\n108\n00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.471\nAre we gonna have access control\nthat stipulates who does and\n\n109\n00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:24.500\ndoesn't have rights to see the data?\n\n110\n00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.130\nIs the data stored in a form\nthat is easily accessible so\n\n111\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.710\nwe can use it all the time?\n\n112\n00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.530\nIs it stored in a more archaic form, one\nthat's harder to get into and access, but\n\n113\n00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.200\nis more secure because it's\nin long term storage and\n\n114\n00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.070\nwe're not really gonna\naccess it very often.\n\n115\n00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.800\nSo we may compress the data,\nstore it in a zipped or\n\n116\n00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.040\na compressed format of some kind and\nthen encrypt it.\n\n117\n00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.710\nAnd then as a result of that\nmake it harder to use, but\n\n118\n00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.800\nas a result of making it harder\nto use it's also more secure.\n\n119\n00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.759\nSo we have to think about these\nthings when we thing about retention,\n\n120\n00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:54.903\nwe think about archiving,\nbecause ultimately,\n\n121\n00:05:54.903 --> 00:05:58.760\nit's these conversations that help draft\nthe policy or help shape the policy.\n\n122\n00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.060\nWe've talked about this before and\nI want to make this point clear for\n\n123\n00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.910\nall of you as we're\ngoing through this now.\n\n124\n00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.800\nPolicy should be a direct result of\naligning with business requirements in\n\n125\n00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.340\nthe business.\n\n126\n00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.220\nIn other words, if a business requirement\nsays we have to keep data for\n\n127\n00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.410\nseven years, let's have a policy\nthat deals with retention.\n\n128\n00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.400\nThat's gonna be a direct match\na one to one correlation.\n\n129\n00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.570\nIf we don't have a policy in the business\nthat says, this is how we're gonna retain\n\n130\n00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.660\ndata, then we're clearly not\ndoing something correctly.\n\n131\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.250\nBecause we have a requirement in the\nbusiness that says I must retain data for\n\n132\n00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.960\nin this case seven years.\n\n133\n00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.380\nSo if I have requirements that are unmet,\nthat are unmanaged, and\n\n134\n00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.710\nunrealized, I don't have policy.\n\n135\n00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.950\nIf I have policies that are not\nlinked to requirements, I may or\n\n136\n00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.410\nmay not be doing the right thing,\nand I'm never gonna be one to\n\n137\n00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:47.150\nsuggest that policies are not good whether\nwe link them to requirements or not..\n\n138\n00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.290\nI'm simply pointing out that policy for\n\n139\n00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.720\npolicy sake, is not the same thing as\npolicy to support business requirements.\n\n140\n00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.570\nAnd there is such a thing as\nhaving too many policies.\n\n141\n00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.030\nBecause they may get in\nthe way of you doing your job,\n\n142\n00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.660\nbecause we don't really have a reason or\na driver for that policy to exist.\n\n143\n00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.780\nAnd this is something else\nthat's important that you want\n\n144\n00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.810\nto think about as well.\n\n145\n00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.740\nHow we link?\n\n146\n00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.110\nHow do we require and figure out to manage\npolicies linked to business requirements?\n\n147\n00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.400\nHow do we identify them?\n\n148\n00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.970\nOne of the key things that we have\nto think about doing is involving\n\n149\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:19.020\nstakeholders in the conversation around\nnot just business requirement gathering\n\n150\n00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.760\nand understanding and\nidentifying the business requirements but\n\n151\n00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.748\nthen linking that and\ndistilling that into policy.\n\n152\n00:07:24.748 --> 00:07:29.150\nStakeholders in other words are gonna be\nthat critical bridge, that voice of reason\n\n153\n00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.920\nin the wilderness that helps us\nunderstand and effectively to define.\n\n154\n00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.050\nNot only clearly what requirements are,\nbut\n\n155\n00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.200\nhow to link them to policy\nin a meaningful way.\n\n156\n00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.446\nWhen we create a policy, we should in\nother words run it by the stakeholders.\n\n157\n00:07:41.446 --> 00:07:44.580\nMr. and Mrs. Stakeholder,\ndoes this clearly articulate,\n\n158\n00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.850\ndoes this clearly capture,\ndoes this clearly represent?\n\n159\n00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.646\nWhat the intent of the business\nrequirements are that we\n\n160\n00:07:50.646 --> 00:07:51.664\nare talking about.\n\n161\n00:07:51.664 --> 00:07:55.182\nIn this case, data retention,\nsecure data storage,\n\n162\n00:07:55.182 --> 00:07:58.396\nsecure data archiving,\nand secure data access.\n\n163\n00:07:58.396 --> 00:07:59.835\nAnd if our policy captures that.\n\n164\n00:07:59.835 --> 00:08:02.482\nWe've done a good job, and\nthey should be able to understand that.\n\n165\n00:08:02.482 --> 00:08:04.913\nIf it doesn't, then maybe we need\nto go back to the drawing board and\n\n166\n00:08:04.913 --> 00:08:07.660\nfigure something else out, because\nthat's going to be important as well.\n\n167\n00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.410\nSo want to be thinking about that.\n\n168\n00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.180\nWe should have, in other words,\ncommon objectives that the policy maps do,\n\n169\n00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.100\nbut the policy also has to be\nunderstood at a level that anybody in\n\n170\n00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.820\nthe organization is going to clearly\nget what the policy is trying to do.\n\n171\n00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.300\nIf the policy's so confusing,\nthe policy is so kind of, for\n\n172\n00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.290\nlack of a better way of putting it,\nout there, it's just very unclear.\n\n173\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.523\nThen if the stakeholders don't understand\nit, it's a pretty good bet on our\n\n174\n00:08:31.523 --> 00:08:33.927\npart that the business users\nare not gonna get it either.\n\n175\n00:08:33.927 --> 00:08:35.597\nAnd they're not gonna\nunderstand the value of it.\n\n176\n00:08:35.597 --> 00:08:39.439\nAnd we've probably all found ourselves in\npositions where we've been asked to do\n\n177\n00:08:39.439 --> 00:08:42.055\nthings and we ask the logical\nquestion as all people do,\n\n178\n00:08:42.055 --> 00:08:44.590\ncuz typically,\nthat's how most of us are wired.\n\n179\n00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.120\nWhich is well, why?\n\n180\n00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.370\nAnd then if we don't really understand\nthe why, we're very unlikely to buy into\n\n181\n00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.710\nthe idea that thing, whatever it\nis that we're doing, makes sense.\n\n182\n00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.012\nI have this ongoing\nconversation with my children.\n\n183\n00:08:56.012 --> 00:08:58.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In this regard.\n\n184\n00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.470\nWhy are we doing this, Daddy?\n\n185\n00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.215\nWhy, why, why, why, why.\n\n186\n00:09:01.215 --> 00:09:04.460\nAnd as an educator, somebody who\nteaches for a living and consults and\n\n187\n00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.607\ntalks to customers for a living,\nthis is what I do day in and day out.\n\n188\n00:09:07.607 --> 00:09:10.567\nI spend most of my time\nanswering the why question.\n\n189\n00:09:10.567 --> 00:09:14.423\nAnd after many, many years,\nI'm not better at it than when I started,\n\n190\n00:09:14.423 --> 00:09:15.984\nbut I'm a lot more patient.\n\n191\n00:09:15.984 --> 00:09:19.760\nSo we do have to understand,\nultimately that if we can distill down and\n\n192\n00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.704\nanswer the question why\neffectively as a litmus test,\n\n193\n00:09:22.704 --> 00:09:27.000\nto figure out whether our policies\nare spot-on, we've nailed the policies.\n\n194\n00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.757\nThe policy clearly articulates the why,\nit's mapped to the business requirements,\n\n195\n00:09:30.757 --> 00:09:32.207\nwe know we've got a good policy.\n\n196\n00:09:32.207 --> 00:09:33.895\nIf we don't, probably need to go back and\n\n197\n00:09:33.895 --> 00:09:36.080\nrethink that a little bit,\ntighten that up a little.\n\n198\n00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.980\nIt's always a good way\nto think about that.\n\n199\n00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.734\nSo we should have record\nretention policies.\n\n200\n00:09:39.734 --> 00:09:43.374\nThey should be clear, they should be\narticulated, broadly communicated,\n\n201\n00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:45.250\nwidely available, and spot checked.\n\n202\n00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.200\nWe've talked about the value of auditing\nto understand whether something is being\n\n203\n00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.800\ndone, aligned with what our expectations\nof it being done actually represent.\n\n204\n00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.590\nSo keep that in mind as well.\n\n205\n00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.960\nWho needs access to the data,\n\n206\n00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.020\nas we talked about, do access requirements\nchange over the retention period?\n\n207\n00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:02.930\nDoes the technology used\nto access the data chain?\n\n208\n00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.520\nThis is one of the big things\nthat catches people off guard.\n\n209\n00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.480\nWe keep data for 7, 10,\nlet's say, 15 years.\n\n210\n00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.710\nIs the access control mechanism\nthat we're using the same?\n\n211\n00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.730\nIt may or may not be,\nthat's probably not gonna change.\n\n212\n00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:15.710\nBut here's something that will.\n\n213\n00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.293\nIs the operating system that we're using\non the computers that we started with 15\n\n214\n00:10:20.293 --> 00:10:23.417\nyears ago gonna be the same as it will\nbe at the end of that retention period?\n\n215\n00:10:23.417 --> 00:10:27.340\nAbsolutely not, I mean not normally\nanyway, let's put it that way.\n\n216\n00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.710\nSo if that's the case,\n\n217\n00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.910\nhave the applications that are gonna\nbe part of that process changed?\n\n218\n00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:37.917\nIn other words, if we 15 years\nago used Office 95, Word 95.\n\n219\n00:10:37.917 --> 00:10:39.187\nRemember Office 95?\n\n220\n00:10:39.187 --> 00:10:40.427\nThe good old days.\n\n221\n00:10:40.427 --> 00:10:43.790\nOffice 3X, Office 3.1 or\nsomething like that.\n\n222\n00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:48.090\nIf we used that version of the program\nto create and craft the data, and\n\n223\n00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:53.140\nnow fast forward 15 years, we're using\nOffice 25, 2012 or whatever it is,\n\n224\n00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:57.935\nand it's no longer going to recognize or\naccess the data in that format.\n\n225\n00:10:57.935 --> 00:10:59.162\nWe have a problem if we\nhaven't thought through that.\n\n226\n00:10:59.162 --> 00:11:01.515\nDo we have a copy of that software?\n\n227\n00:11:01.515 --> 00:11:05.835\nCan we use that software from an archive\nto then load the data and access it,\n\n228\n00:11:05.835 --> 00:11:09.402\nor has somebody along the way gone in,\naccessed the data under\n\n229\n00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:14.157\nthe appropriate change management,\nconfidentiality and integrity controls?\n\n230\n00:11:14.157 --> 00:11:17.478\nUpdated the data format to now be\nused with the most recent version of\n\n231\n00:11:17.478 --> 00:11:21.089\nthe application that will be used to\naccess it at the end of the life cycle,\n\n232\n00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:24.878\nand then stored it successfully again,\nensuring all the confidentiality,\n\n233\n00:11:24.878 --> 00:11:27.880\nintegrity, and\navailability controls are still in place.\n\n234\n00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.503\nAnd obviously,\n\n235\n00:11:28.503 --> 00:11:31.047\nchange matters if it becomes very\nimportant in this conversation.\n\n236\n00:11:31.047 --> 00:11:34.807\nIf we're not thinking about these\nthings and not doing these kinds\n\n237\n00:11:34.807 --> 00:11:39.447\nof things to drive this conversation,\nwe're gonna have a significant problem.\n\n238\n00:11:39.447 --> 00:11:43.719\nBecause the problem will be that from\na backwards compatibility perspective and\n\n239\n00:11:43.719 --> 00:11:47.620\nan access control perspective,\nwe're gonna be at different places.\n\n240\n00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.787\nAccess control's probably gonna\nstill be inherently available, but\n\n241\n00:11:50.787 --> 00:11:54.640\nbackwards compatibility and application\nreliance is gonna be shot, we're not gonna\n\n242\n00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.667\nbe able to give them the data, or\nthe format is no longer supported.\n\n243\n00:11:57.667 --> 00:12:02.665\nIf you remember several years ago,\nactually a little bit longer than\n\n244\n00:12:02.665 --> 00:12:07.401\nseveral years ago now, but back,\nlet's say ten years ago or so,\n\n245\n00:12:07.401 --> 00:12:12.568\nwe made the switch in Microsoft Office\nfrom the DOC or XLS or PPT format,\n\n246\n00:12:12.568 --> 00:12:19.010\nto DOCX, PPTX, XSLX, that's a mouthful\nto say without getting that one wrong.\n\n247\n00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.950\nWe added, in other words, an x to the end,\n\n248\n00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.650\nnow we didn't just add an x to\nthe end of the data by extension.\n\n249\n00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:28.630\nWe actually became XML aligned, and\nour data format is now XML friendly, and\n\n250\n00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:32.340\nXML effectively is fully\nsupported in that program.\n\n251\n00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.750\nWell, that's the way the industry went,\nthat's where everything is gone, so\n\n252\n00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.020\nthat makes a lot of sense.\n\n253\n00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.520\nBut it's not that we're not supporting the\nold format, but if you're using a really,\n\n254\n00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.490\nreally old format, we may no longer\nsupport that down the road, and\n\n255\n00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.990\nthat could become a problem.\n\n256\n00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.380\nAnd you may blow\nthe integrity of the data.\n\n257\n00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.420\nYou may breach confidentiality\nby trying to change the data 15\n\n258\n00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.040\nyears from now into a format\nthat will work, and\n\n259\n00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.750\nthat can be a problem if it wasn't\ndone the right way along the way.\n\n260\n00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.150\nSo very important considerations\nto think about here.\n\n261\n00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.930\nIt's not just a matter of throwing data\nin a box, putting it on a shelf, and\n\n262\n00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.880\ndusting it off every so\noften to make sure it's still available.\n\n263\n00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.820\nThere's a lot more to it than that.\n\n264\n00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:11.050\nCISSPs have to focus on these key areas.\n\n265\n00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.760\nWe, as the professionals that understand\nthe liabilities associated with this, have\n\n266\n00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.480\nto focus the organization, in other words,\nnot just on the policy, but on the process\n\n267\n00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.790\nand procedure that has to be implemented\nto support the policy over the long-term.\n\n268\n00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:28.837\nThis is what we do, and this is where we\nexist in terms of the value that we add.\n\n269\n00:13:28.837 --> 00:13:32.510\nKey areas to focus on,\nmedia, hardware, personnel.\n\n270\n00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.130\nDoes anybody in the organization still\nunderstand that data 15 years later?\n\n271\n00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.260\nIs anybody gonna know what it is and\nhow to access it?\n\n272\n00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.380\nI mean, this is also a potential issue.\n\n273\n00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.073\nThis happened around the turn of the\nmillennium, where we went from the 1990s\n\n274\n00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:48.107\nto the 2000s, and everybody was worried\nabout whether or not data would translate.\n\n275\n00:13:48.107 --> 00:13:50.567\nThere was that whole issue,\nthe millennium bug.\n\n276\n00:13:50.567 --> 00:13:55.059\nBut there was also the use of old data\nformats, Pascal, Fortran, Cobol, etc and\n\n277\n00:13:55.059 --> 00:13:58.839\nputting data into those formats in\nmidframe and mainframe systems,\n\n278\n00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:03.528\n20, 30, 40 years ago made a lot of sense\nbecause that was the flavor of the day,\n\n279\n00:14:03.528 --> 00:14:06.430\nand everybody did that, and it was fine.\n\n280\n00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:10.730\nTranslating that into newer data\nsystems that are now web enabled and\n\n281\n00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:14.290\nare now taking those midframe and\nmainframe computers and\n\n282\n00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:18.180\nputting them on the web, in effect,\nto access data through middleware\n\n283\n00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.160\ncan cause disruption and\nconcern about data integrity and data use.\n\n284\n00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.400\nThat's a separate conversation, it's not\na conversation for now, but I'm just\n\n285\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:30.650\npointing out to you that institutional\nknowledge in people's heads that\n\n286\n00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:34.560\nwe don't write down because that's the\nthing we often miss with documentation.\n\n287\n00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.980\nIf Fred was the only person in the entire\ncompany who understood that, and\n\n288\n00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:42.320\nFred retired 10 years ago,\nand it's now 15 years later,\n\n289\n00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.370\nand we need to access that data, and\n\n290\n00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.590\nit's in a format that nobody understands,\nyou may not be able to use that data.\n\n291\n00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.690\nAnd so as a result you've broken the\navailability constraints around that data\n\n292\n00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.655\neven though you didn't set out to do so,\nand you had controls in place that\n\n293\n00:14:55.655 --> 00:14:59.100\nsafeguarded the data, but effectively,\navailability has been compromised.\n\n294\n00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:02.140\nNot because of anything you did on\npurpose, just because you didn't plan for\n\n295\n00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.920\nthe fact that when Fred leaves, somebody\nneeds to capture that knowledge and\n\n296\n00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.460\nunderstand how to apply it\nto the system going forward.\n\n297\n00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.840\nYou may be able to call Fred up and\nget him back, but\n\n298\n00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.400\nFred may also not want to have\nany part of that anymore.\n\n299\n00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.683\nAnd as a result, you may have a problem,\nbecause if you can't find another Fred,\n\n300\n00:15:17.683 --> 00:15:19.497\nyou may not be able to use the data.\n\n301\n00:15:19.497 --> 00:15:20.777\nSo what would you do?\n\n302\n00:15:20.777 --> 00:15:23.717\nYou would call Fred's Are Us,\nand you would then get a Fred.\n\n303\n00:15:23.717 --> 00:15:25.710\nSo just keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n304\n00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:28.338\nSo data retention policies\nobviously very important.\n\n305\n00:15:28.338 --> 00:15:31.300\nSo we wanna make sure we have them, wanna\nmake sure we draft them, there are all\n\n306\n00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.900\nsorts of data retention policy\ntemplates out there you can look at.\n\n307\n00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.710\nThe European Union has a real good one.\n\n308\n00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.810\nThe European Document Retention Guide\nfrom 2013 is\n\n309\n00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:43.130\na user guide you can use to\nfigure out how to format one.\n\n310\n00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:48.310\nThere are many local,\nmunicipal solutions for states and\n\n311\n00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.730\nmunicipalities within the United States\nthat are their own versions of this.\n\n312\n00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.055\nYou can Google to find them.\n\n313\n00:15:53.055 --> 00:15:58.373\nThe employment practices code from the UK,\nNovember, 2011 is when it was drafted.\n\n314\n00:15:58.373 --> 00:16:00.184\n>> Gives you guidance on how to do this.\n\n315\n00:16:00.184 --> 00:16:02.043\nThere's many, many examples out there.\n\n316\n00:16:02.043 --> 00:16:04.292\nThe idea of being able to\nsearch the Internet or\n\n317\n00:16:04.292 --> 00:16:07.530\nthe world wide web today to find\ninformation is not new to anybody.\n\n318\n00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.360\nAnd, hopefully, nobody that's going\nthrough these discussions with us\n\n319\n00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.890\nis gonna be surprised by the fact that\nwe say, hey, why don't you go out and\n\n320\n00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.200\nsearch for that on occasion.\n\n321\n00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.410\nBecause there's gonna be so much out there\nthat by the time you actually go and\n\n322\n00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.640\nfigure out, hey, I want to find that,\nthere may be a thousand new things, and\n\n323\n00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.250\nyou may wanna get the most\nrecent information.\n\n324\n00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:25.490\nSo, we may point you to that at\nvarious points just because it's gonna\n\n325\n00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:26.750\nbe the best way to keep up and\n\n326\n00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.810\nget the most timely, the most accurate\nrepresentation of that information.\n\n327\n00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:31.250\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n328\n00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:33.135\nPlus, it's fun to say Google something.\n\n329\n00:16:33.135 --> 00:16:33.648\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n330\n00:16:33.648 --> 00:16:34.148\n>> All right.\n\n331\n00:16:34.148 --> 00:16:35.528\nSo, in addition to going out and\n\n332\n00:16:35.528 --> 00:16:38.510\nfinding that information, and\nthinking about retention, we also,\n\n333\n00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:40.480\nas Mike pointed out in\nhis opening comments,\n\n334\n00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.650\nhave to think about the value\nof what we call a baseline.\n\n335\n00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:44.790\nSo, let's start by talking\nabout what a baseline is.\n\n336\n00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:48.800\nA baseline is effectively\ngoing to be a configuration.\n\n337\n00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.690\nBut it's a special kind of configuration.\n\n338\n00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.950\nA configuration is a representation of\nall the settings that would go into\n\n339\n00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:58.760\neffectively making a system look and\nfeel like we would like it to.\n\n340\n00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:03.310\nSo, if I say I want a Windows 7\nlaptop with Windows Seven Enterprise,\n\n341\n00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.490\nI want to be able to have the latest\nsecurity updates and patches,\n\n342\n00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:11.170\nI want to run Offiice 2016 on it,\nI want to have Adobe Acrobat on there\n\n343\n00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.930\nas well cuz I may need to be\nable to use the Adobe product.\n\n344\n00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.950\nSo, if I put those things on there,\nthat all becomes part of the baseline.\n\n345\n00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.780\nIt's part of the configuration for\nall of the system information and\n\n346\n00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.600\nall of the software or the applications\nthat are running on top, and\n\n347\n00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.860\nall the security settings that I need\nin order to be able to effectively make\n\n348\n00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.590\nthat system do what I want it to do.\n\n349\n00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:35.910\nIn Windows, we can look at basic hardware\nand system configuration in several ways.\n\n350\n00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:40.400\nWe can go into the control panel, we can\nlook at various tools inside of Windows.\n\n351\n00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.300\nYou also can use the MSInfo command,\nright,\n\n352\n00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.910\nto be able to bring up basic\nconfiguration information in the system.\n\n353\n00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.800\nYou may wanna use Winver,\nanother Windows command,\n\n354\n00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:52.770\nto be able to go in, and\nto be able to see the Windows version, and\n\n355\n00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:56.430\nthe security software patching\nlevel in terms of service packs.\n\n356\n00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.480\nWe can look at Windows Update and\ngo in and\n\n357\n00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.680\nsee what patches have been\napplied to the system.\n\n358\n00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.700\nWe could look at the programs area\nto see what programs are installed.\n\n359\n00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.270\nThere's a lot of different\nthings we may wanna do, right?\n\n360\n00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.440\nSo, gathering all that up and\nputting it into\n\n361\n00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.720\na configuration that we can then use and\nmanage is what we would call a baseline.\n\n362\n00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:18.030\nHaving all that together, usually\ntaking some sort of copy of that, so\n\n363\n00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.760\nwe will document that and write it down,\nthat's where the configuration\n\n364\n00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.550\nmanagement database and the CI, the\nconfiguration items, come in that we've\n\n365\n00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.780\nspoken about with change management and\nconfiguration management.\n\n366\n00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.360\nBut the baseline itself\nis usually also gonna be,\n\n367\n00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.930\nnot just a collection of settings, but\ntypically, it could be done either through\n\n368\n00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:40.950\nsome sort of capture of the information in\nthe state, so we may create a template or\n\n369\n00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:45.095\ncreate some sort of snapshot that\nwe can use to then deploy or\n\n370\n00:18:45.095 --> 00:18:49.085\nuse to be able to move the system back and\nforth between various states.\n\n371\n00:18:49.085 --> 00:18:50.525\nSnapshots are good for that.\n\n372\n00:18:50.525 --> 00:18:51.785\nThey let us time travel.\n\n373\n00:18:51.785 --> 00:18:54.205\nWe may clone the baseline system,\n\n374\n00:18:54.205 --> 00:18:57.105\nget it into a state that we know\nwe're gonna want to use it from.\n\n375\n00:18:57.105 --> 00:18:59.385\nCloning means to make a copy.\n\n376\n00:18:59.385 --> 00:19:00.615\nSo, we may do something like that.\n\n377\n00:19:00.615 --> 00:19:02.495\nSo, there's a lot of different\nways to get a baseline.\n\n378\n00:19:02.495 --> 00:19:05.990\nBut ultimately the goal is,\nthat baseline becomes the standard that we\n\n379\n00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:10.460\nuse to reproduce the system to get the\nconfiguration and all the settings right.\n\n380\n00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.400\nIf we automate that process, it takes the\nhuman element out of the mix because once\n\n381\n00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:19.080\nwe get it right, if we then capture what\nis right and we use an automated process\n\n382\n00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.770\nto reproduce that, chances are good\nwe're gonna be a lot less likely\n\n383\n00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:26.910\nto effect we make a mistake and\nto configure the system incorrectly.\n\n384\n00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.320\nThereby ensuring, hopefully,\n\n385\n00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.870\nif it's done the right way, that the\nsecurity we need in that baseline that was\n\n386\n00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:35.280\nbuilt in is gonna reproduce\nitself every time we make a copy.\n\n387\n00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.758\nThis is one of the most important elements\nabout what a baseline represents for us.\n\n388\n00:19:38.758 --> 00:19:41.350\nIt's, effectively, and\nyou can think of it this way,\n\n389\n00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:45.160\nas being the first line of defense in\nthe defense in-depth architecture.\n\n390\n00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:48.770\nBecause if we can really think about\nstandardizing the configuration of\n\n391\n00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.880\na system and\nreproducing it as often as necessary, but\n\n392\n00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:56.500\nnot just doing that, measuring ongoing\ncompliance with those settings by looking\n\n393\n00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.930\nat the system over time and seeing whether\nthe effective settings in the baseline\n\n394\n00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:05.000\nare continuing to be applied, continuing\nto be observed, and continuing to be used.\n\n395\n00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.578\nOr has somebody modified them?\n\n396\n00:20:06.578 --> 00:20:09.520\nAnd if they have,\nhas that change negatively impacted us?\n\n397\n00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.130\nAnd if it has, how do we fix that?\n\n398\n00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.460\nBaselines are good for this as well.\n\n399\n00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:17.440\nWe will call this continuous monitoring,\nconfiguration monitoring.\n\n400\n00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.380\nAnd then, we would talk about remediation.\n\n401\n00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.150\nSo, we would look at, effectively,\n\n402\n00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.855\nwhether the system is compliant\nwith the baseline or not.\n\n403\n00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:25.720\nIt's the term we use over the long term.\n\n404\n00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.230\nAnd if it drifts, if there is a delta,\na gap that has been experienced,\n\n405\n00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.860\nwe can then change and remediate that,\nputting it back to the good or\n\n406\n00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.780\nlast known state, which is effectively\nwhat a baseline represents for us.\n\n407\n00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:39.230\nSo, we wanna think about considerations\nassociated with baselines.\n\n408\n00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.090\nThink about all the things we've talked\nabout in terms of how they're used and\n\n409\n00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.400\nwhy they are important.\n\n410\n00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.850\nWhich parts are the system\nare we gonna configure and\n\n411\n00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:47.900\ncapture in order to create the baseline?\n\n412\n00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.670\nAre we gonna look applications as\nwell as the hardware configuration?\n\n413\n00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.450\nAre we just worried about the hardware,\nnot worried about the software?\n\n414\n00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.230\nThere's different ways to\nthink about doing this.\n\n415\n00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:59.210\nRight?\nSo, wanna be thinking about that.\n\n416\n00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:01.660\nWhat level of security\nshould the baseline aim for.\n\n417\n00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.050\nIs it going to be, as we said,\nan all out baseline for\n\n418\n00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.260\neverything, including user\naccess control on the system?\n\n419\n00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.700\nOr is it just focused at\na configuration level and\n\n420\n00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:11.570\naccess control is done separately?\n\n421\n00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.450\nReally, just depends on the nature of\nthe system or what we're thinking about.\n\n422\n00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.220\nShould we apply the baseline\nthroughout the entire organization?\n\n423\n00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.180\nOr do we have different baselines for\ndifferent purposes?\n\n424\n00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.190\nDesktop, for instance, versus a server?\n\n425\n00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:23.820\nWe're gonna have very\ndifferent baselines for\n\n426\n00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.220\nthose because they do different things and\nthey use different operating systems.\n\n427\n00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.650\nAnd as a result of that they will look and\nfeel differently.\n\n428\n00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:34.140\nWe traditionally don't put audio drivers,\nor at least we don't have a need for them,\n\n429\n00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.790\nso we tend to remove them on servers\nunless we're doing streaming media or\n\n430\n00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:40.150\nyou're building yourself\na really cool gaming system,\n\n431\n00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.750\nin which case you definitely need\naudio drivers on the server.\n\n432\n00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:45.200\nBut if you're not doing that, right,\nif it's just gonna be a file and\n\n433\n00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.670\nprint server, there's no reason for\naudio drivers to be there.\n\n434\n00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:51.290\nBecause if you put them there, they\npotentially lead to a liability, right?\n\n435\n00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:54.200\nSomebody may find a way to use\nthose to exploit the system.\n\n436\n00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.620\nSo, when we talk about something\nsuch as hardening the system, right,\n\n437\n00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.930\nas part of the build process,\nwe would harden by stripping out\n\n438\n00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.240\nall the things that don't\nnecessarily need to be there.\n\n439\n00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.290\nSo, all the unwanted or\nunneeded services, all the bloatware or\n\n440\n00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.460\nthe software that vendors may provide\nthat may or may not be appropriate for\n\n441\n00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.250\nuse, that's the polite term, by the way.\n\n442\n00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.656\nWe call it something else, but\nwe won't go into that here.\n\n443\n00:22:14.656 --> 00:22:16.410\nBut bloatware, right?\n\n444\n00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.390\nThere may be applications you don't need.\n\n445\n00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.870\nSo, for instance, the standard template\nmay say, well, let's deploy Office and\n\n446\n00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.620\nAdobe Acrobat like I was saying.\n\n447\n00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.135\nBut, really, on a server that's a file and\n\n448\n00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:28.595\nprint server, there's absolutely no\nreason to have a full installed Office.\n\n449\n00:22:28.595 --> 00:22:31.215\nAnd you probably don't really\nneed Acrobat there, either.\n\n450\n00:22:31.215 --> 00:22:34.655\nBecause you're not gonna be accessing data\nand reading it locally on that system.\n\n451\n00:22:34.655 --> 00:22:37.535\nYou're simply gonna be archiving and\nstoring it and serving it up to people\n\n452\n00:22:37.535 --> 00:22:40.315\nwho will have access to those\nprograms locally on their desktops.\n\n453\n00:22:40.315 --> 00:22:42.385\nSo, you wanna think about all that.\n\n454\n00:22:42.385 --> 00:22:44.260\nThe less you put in a system,\n\n455\n00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:48.690\nthe higher the security profile can become\nin terms of the hardening of the system.\n\n456\n00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:50.780\nAnd, therefore, the more secure,\npotentially, it will be.\n\n457\n00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:54.840\nWe talk about attack surface reduction,\nASR, is what we call this.\n\n458\n00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.400\nAnd a hardening is all about ASR,\nit's all about attack surface reduction.\n\n459\n00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.050\nWe know, historically, and those of you\nthat have been doing this long enough\n\n460\n00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.560\nshould know that, while Adobe makes\na very good suite of products, and\n\n461\n00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.260\nI don't want you to take what I'm about\nto say the wrong way, the use of certain\n\n462\n00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.300\nAdobe products can lead to additional\nsecurity complications in the system.\n\n463\n00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:12.810\nRight?\n\n464\n00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:17.410\nAnd so, the use of things like Java,\nthe use of Adobe products like Flash\n\n465\n00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:22.030\nas one example, may lead to additional\nsecurity concerns that we have to spend\n\n466\n00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.060\nextra time mitigating and\nextra time managing through.\n\n467\n00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.655\nIf we can remove those from\na system in order to harden them,\n\n468\n00:23:27.655 --> 00:23:30.180\ncuz we don't have a compelling\nbusiness reason to put them there,\n\n469\n00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.990\nit's gonna make our lives a lot easier.\n\n470\n00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.090\nAnd, ultimately,\nit's gonna make the system more secure.\n\n471\n00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.650\nSo, be selfish and just say, well,\nI don't wanna work this hard.\n\n472\n00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.400\nAnd get rid of the stuff you don't need.\n\n473\n00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.750\nWhatever motivates you is fine.\n\n474\n00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.483\nBut the point is, this is exactly the kind\nof thought process we need to engage in.\n\n475\n00:23:43.483 --> 00:23:47.997\nBecause if we don't have the right kind of\nbaseline, and we don't harden our systems,\n\n476\n00:23:47.997 --> 00:23:50.999\nit's gonna be very hard for\nus to get out of reactive mode.\n\n477\n00:23:50.999 --> 00:23:52.720\nRight?\nConstantly chasing after that system.\n\n478\n00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.687\nConstantly patching it,\nconstantly worrying about vulnerabilities,\n\n479\n00:23:55.687 --> 00:23:57.178\nwe're never going to be proactive.\n\n480\n00:23:57.178 --> 00:23:59.433\nWe're never going to be\nout there in front of it,\n\n481\n00:23:59.433 --> 00:24:01.640\nmanaging all the other\nthings we've got to do.\n\n482\n00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.560\nInstead, we're going to be constantly\nfirefighting as you often hear\n\n483\n00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.120\nthe term used to reacting to that concern.\n\n484\n00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.580\nBaseline protection and\nbaseline configuration management and\n\n485\n00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:15.200\ncompliance is a very important skill for\nthe CISSP to master and figure out.\n\n486\n00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.308\nWe often create catalogs of baselines or\n\n487\n00:24:17.308 --> 00:24:19.979\nimages as you may hear them\nreferred to sometimes.\n\n488\n00:24:19.979 --> 00:24:22.407\nDepends on the kind of\ntechnology you're using.\n\n489\n00:24:22.407 --> 00:24:26.527\nIf you're using disk imaging to put images\ninto systems that automate deployment,\n\n490\n00:24:26.527 --> 00:24:30.007\nthis will be a catalog of images that\nyou will create and simply use, but\n\n491\n00:24:30.007 --> 00:24:32.920\nthose images are indeed\nconsidered to be baselines.\n\n492\n00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.060\nSo you may use\nWindows Deployment Services,\n\n493\n00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:38.670\nwhat we call WDS,\nold school, OG form of that.\n\n494\n00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.980\nRemember RIS,\nRemote Install Services, right?\n\n495\n00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:42.740\nSo you may use RIS.\n\n496\n00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.070\nThat's an oldie but a goodie.\n\n497\n00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:47.570\nNot around much anymore unless you happen\nto play with NT4 in Windows 2000 on\n\n498\n00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:48.650\nsome occasion.\n\n499\n00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.970\nBut RIS and/or WDS back in the day.\n\n500\n00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:52.200\nYou may be ghosting.\n\n501\n00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.960\nYou may be using Altiris, right?\n\n502\n00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.950\nThere's different software\nplatforms out there.\n\n503\n00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.850\nSystem Center Config Manager.\n\n504\n00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.550\nMike and I were having that conversation\njust before we got started.\n\n505\n00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:03.370\nSo whatever your configuration\nmanagement solution is,\n\n506\n00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:05.390\nthat's where your\nbaselines are going to be.\n\n507\n00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:06.490\nThat's where you're going to store them.\n\n508\n00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:07.580\nBecause that's where your images are.\n\n509\n00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.205\nSo you're going to be looking at\nthat kind of software platform and\n\n510\n00:25:10.205 --> 00:25:11.940\ntying those skills in to manage it.\n\n511\n00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.020\nRemember my admonition to you earlier.\n\n512\n00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.690\nThat's a key vocabulary word by the way.\n\n513\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.810\nRemember my admonition to you earlier.\n\n514\n00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:18.610\nRight.\n\n515\n00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.590\nWhere I said to you in one\nof our earlier discussions\n\n516\n00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:25.680\nthat you need to partner with the people\nthat have the skills that you need if\n\n517\n00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.510\nyou're not an expert in this technology.\n\n518\n00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:31.540\nIf configuration management and baselines\nare just not your thing, and that's okay,\n\n519\n00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:35.150\nthere's nothing wrong with that, if that's\nnot you, you better just find the people\n\n520\n00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.530\nin the organization that know\nhow to manage those systems.\n\n521\n00:25:37.530 --> 00:25:42.230\nAnd work with them to integrate security\ninto those baselines, make sure\n\n522\n00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:46.280\npatch management is happening, make sure\nyou're stripping out the hardware and\n\n523\n00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:50.100\nthe software that you no longer need on\nthose systems and by doing that you're\n\n524\n00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:54.610\ngonna create a more secure and more robust\nway of managing your infrastructure.\n\n525\n00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:57.480\nTo that end we want to talk quickly\nabout two terms that are important.\n\n526\n00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.890\nScoping and tailoring.\n\n527\n00:25:58.890 --> 00:25:59.520\nRight?\n\n528\n00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.630\nNot the tailoring that you think\nof when you go to the tailor and\n\n529\n00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.020\nthey adjust your clothes for\nyou but it's close.\n\n530\n00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.070\nBut let's talk about scoping and\ntailoring.\n\n531\n00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.990\nSo scoping is the idea of\nproviding through the thought\n\n532\n00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:10.640\nprocess that we use to manage.\n\n533\n00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.230\nProviding an enterprise with specific or\na business with specific terms and\n\n534\n00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.700\nconditions on\nthe applicability of controls.\n\n535\n00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:22.010\nIn other words we have to make sure\nthat we are able to give context,\n\n536\n00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.260\nwhich is really what scoping is all about.\n\n537\n00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.480\nGive context to the organizational\nthought process\n\n538\n00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.870\naround what controls we're using and why.\n\n539\n00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.940\nSo scoping is really about creating\nthat context and understanding how to\n\n540\n00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.700\nanswer the question why if you wanna\nthink about what scoping does, right.\n\n541\n00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.090\nWhen we think about tailoring, tailoring\ninvolves an element of scoping, we're kind\n\n542\n00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:45.880\nof taking the scope, the context, but\nwe're now narrowly focusing, tactfully,\n\n543\n00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.510\nso that we can actually apply the controls\nthat are specific to the need.\n\n544\n00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:54.210\nAnd we can then communicate effectively\nas to the who, what, where, when, and\n\n545\n00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.260\nhow, notice I left out the why.\n\n546\n00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:00.880\nWho, what, when, where and how about those\ncontrols and the importance of them.\n\n547\n00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.000\nSo tailoring is really about narrowing and\n\n548\n00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.610\nfocusing on the tactical elements of\nwhat we're going to do to implement.\n\n549\n00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:11.450\nWhereas scoping is really more about\nthe strategic thought process and\n\n550\n00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:12.890\nanswering the question of why.\n\n551\n00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:13.820\nCreating the context.\n\n552\n00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.930\nAnd if you could marry those\ntwo thought processes together,\n\n553\n00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:18.900\nwe really hit all the highlights, right?\n\n554\n00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:22.670\nWe hit the who, what, when, where,\nwhy, and how, the five Ws and the H.\n\n555\n00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.680\nBut we get the thought process that is\nmore high level in the organization,\n\n556\n00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:31.000\nmore strategic about context and need, and\nthen we get the tactical conversation with\n\n557\n00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.890\nthe tailoring and the focus to make sure\nthat those controls are implemented in\n\n558\n00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.930\na way, that they not only are business\naligned, but they add relevancy and\n\n559\n00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:41.900\nthey ensure that we then are able\nto understand what we need to do.\n\n560\n00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.280\nThat's right.\n\n561\n00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.440\nSo when we think about scoping and\n\n562\n00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:49.160\ntailoring, we wanna look at two specific\nareas that may be helpful to you.\n\n563\n00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.770\nSome practical real world examples\nI wanna share with you quickly.\n\n564\n00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.030\nWe're gonna throw up a quick web page for\nyou.\n\n565\n00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.240\nActually, two, but\nwe're gonna start with the first one here.\n\n566\n00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.770\nWhich is again something from NIST,\nand we'll just zoom in a little bit so\n\n567\n00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:00.850\nyou can see that.\n\n568\n00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:04.580\nAnd on the NIST website,\nwe are talking specifically about\n\n569\n00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.540\nthe Security Content Automation Protocol,\ncommonly called SCAP as you can see.\n\n570\n00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:12.830\nAnd what SCAP allows us to\ndo is to really focus in on\n\n571\n00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:17.020\nautomation of scoping and tailoring\nneeds and concerns in the business\n\n572\n00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:20.480\nto try to figure out how to create\nthese base lines and work with them\n\n573\n00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.040\nin order to be able apply them inside\nthe organization or in the business.\n\n574\n00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.270\nSo this is one practical real\nworld example of scoping and\n\n575\n00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.750\ntailoring that NIST has provided and\nput out there.\n\n576\n00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:30.980\nNow SCAP is not new.\n\n577\n00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.458\nSCAP's been around.\n\n578\n00:28:32.458 --> 00:28:34.432\nWell this is probably 2009 or so.\n\n579\n00:28:34.432 --> 00:28:36.930\nSo it's been around for\nseveral years at this point.\n\n580\n00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:41.000\nGoes through iterations every so often,\nbut the website as you can see talks about\n\n581\n00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.240\nvalidation, content, specification,\nand all the things associated with it.\n\n582\n00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.877\nAnother area that we\nshould look at quickly,\n\n583\n00:28:46.877 --> 00:28:49.516\njust another website Mike's gonna help\nme with and throw up here for us.\n\n584\n00:28:49.516 --> 00:28:53.500\nIs coming to us not from this, but\nrather from SANS, and you can see the CIS,\n\n585\n00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:58.385\nthe Critical Information Security Critical\nSecurity Controls, currently in Version 6.\n\n586\n00:28:58.385 --> 00:29:00.090\nThey go through revisions every so often.\n\n587\n00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.840\nThank you for\nzooming in there a little bit.\n\n588\n00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.840\nThey go through revisions.\n\n589\n00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.320\nWe're currently at Version 6.\n\n590\n00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:08.860\nAnd the idea is this is a list of\nthe top 20 critical security controls\n\n591\n00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:14.000\nthat are broken up into typically five\ncategories or critical tenant areas,\n\n592\n00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.470\noffense informs defense, so\nthe idea of being able to think about\n\n593\n00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:21.320\nhaving a good offense and having that\ndefense kind of be linked to that,\n\n594\n00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.140\nprioritizing the need in the business, and\nfiguring out what controls are important.\n\n595\n00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:28.390\nHaving metrics to measure against,\nusing continuous monitoring and\n\n596\n00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:32.510\nautomation to be able to scale, and\nto scope, and tailor controls as needed,\n\n597\n00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.945\nand you'll see there are 20\ncontrols on the list.\n\n598\n00:29:34.945 --> 00:29:39.350\nMike kind of scrolled up and down real\nquickly, so he was showing them to you.\n\n599\n00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:42.530\nBut the idea with these controls are that\nif you go and take a look at them,\n\n600\n00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:46.360\nand randomly if you'd just look at\na couple, things boundary defense there,\n\n601\n00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.110\nCSC 12, data protection, number 13.\n\n602\n00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:52.790\nWireless access control, number 15.\n\n603\n00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:54.640\nApplication software security, number 18.\n\n604\n00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.960\nYou get the idea.\n\n605\n00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.270\nThese are all very important elements and\nwe probably have a need for all 20 but\n\n606\n00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.680\nthe reality is if we're not doing things\nwith web related services, we may be able\n\n607\n00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.800\nto bypass that control, because\nmaybe it's just not important to us.\n\n608\n00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.470\nSo this is another example of the concept\nthat we can apply by looking for\n\n609\n00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.020\nexternal guidance to figure how scope and\ntailor.\n\n610\n00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.170\n>> Another great episode there Adam.\n\n611\n00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:19.580\nYou know we looked at base lines and\nreally kind of took it to that next level\n\n612\n00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.420\nby looking at baselines and\nscoping those, and tailoring those down.\n\n613\n00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.090\nCouple of great resources\nwe can use if we want to\n\n614\n00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.330\ndive into that a little bit further.\n\n615\n00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:30.270\nAnd then, back to the beginning of\nthe episode when we were talking\n\n616\n00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:34.500\nabout retention policies and some of\nthe things that I hadn't thought about.\n\n617\n00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.920\nWe were used to putting stuff away\nin a box and putting it on a shelf.\n\n618\n00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.890\nAnd now everything is\ngoing out to the cloud and\n\n619\n00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:43.870\ndifferent ways of storing information,\nelectronically in the cloud or locally,\n\n620\n00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:47.980\nbut how about the software I use to\ncreate or access that data ten years ago?\n\n621\n00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:49.510\nCan I still access it?\n\n622\n00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.010\nSo, great information there,\nwe appreciate that Adam.\n\n623\n00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:55.380\nRemember, if you guys ever want to\nattend one of Adam's classes live\n\n624\n00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:56.200\nshoot us an email.\n\n625\n00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.630\nWe can get you in touch, SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n626\n00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:03.710\nThat's gonna do it for this episode so\nsigning off I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n627\n00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:06.675\n>> And I'm gonna be here next time\nbecause we have a retention policy that\n\n628\n00:31:06.675 --> 00:31:07.486\nstipulates that.\n\n629\n00:31:07.486 --> 00:31:08.600\nI'll see you soon.\n>> He's gonna be here for seven years.\n\n630\n00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.726\n>> I will be.\n\n631\n00:31:09.726 --> 00:31:10.643\n>> We'll see you soon.\n\n632\n00:31:10.643 --> 00:31:16.220\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.370\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.740\nToday we are doing our CISSP and\n\n5\n00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.760\nspecifically we're going to be going\ninto our data handling requirements.\n\n6\n00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.530\nWe've talked a little bit about data\nretention in previous conversations.\n\n7\n00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.990\nNow we're gonna look at what\nthose handling requirements are.\n\n8\n00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.070\nIf we're gonna keep that data around,\nhow do we keep it around?\n\n9\n00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.920\nHow do we protect it, keep it safe?\n\n10\n00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.620\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.820\n>> I'm good, I'm good, I'm excited and\n\n13\n00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.940\nall aflutter with anticipation around\ndata handling requirements myself.\n\n14\n00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.460\nSo let's talk about those for\njust a little bit, shall we?\n\n15\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.680\nSo when we think about data, and\nwe've had a lot to say about data,\n\n16\n00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.840\nwe've had a lot to say about retention so\nfar.\n\n17\n00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.680\nHad a lot to say about\nthe need to protect data.\n\n18\n00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.800\nSo I think we're pretty good about that.\n\n19\n00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.380\nBut, generically, let's just remind\nourselves about the reason we're here,\n\n20\n00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.360\nwhich is focusing on confidentiality,\nfocusing on integrity.\n\n21\n00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.500\nObviously availability\nis part of that as well.\n\n22\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.380\nBut primarily when we think about data\nhandling and data handling requirements,\n\n23\n00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.630\nwe need to think about how we're gonna\nsafeguard our data when it's in motion,\n\n24\n00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.905\nwhen it's at rest.\n\n25\n00:01:13.905 --> 00:01:17.070\nAnd what are we gonna do to ensure\nconfidentiality first and foremost, and\n\n26\n00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.660\nof course integrity,\nand then availability?\n\n27\n00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.430\nDon't wanna leave that out.\n\n28\n00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.300\nThat's always gonna be\nan important consideration.\n\n29\n00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.060\nSo cryptography is gonna be one of those\nvery important tools that we can bring to\n\n30\n00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.540\nbear in order to ensure that data is\ngoing to be handled and secured using\n\n31\n00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.850\nthe proper thought process along with\nbusiness requirements and things of that.\n\n32\n00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.890\nSo, protection of data becomes key.\n\n33\n00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.510\nAnd this is really what we're focused on.\n\n34\n00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.190\nData protection involves data at\nrest as well as data in transit.\n\n35\n00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.980\nWant to make sure we focus on both and\nwe're gonna break our conversation\n\n36\n00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.028\ndown along those lines\nstarting with data at rest.\n\n37\n00:01:47.028 --> 00:01:50.350\nData at rest can be defined as\ndata that is either in storage so\n\n38\n00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.420\ndata that is put somewhere whether\nit is on a removable thumbdrive,\n\n39\n00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.190\nso USB drive, whether it's in\na fixed drive in your machine\n\n40\n00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.000\nout in the cloud somewhere that\nwe can then go access remotely.\n\n41\n00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.580\nWe're talking about data that's being\nstored somewhere that we then we have to\n\n42\n00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.230\npull out and make available to us during\nthe process of actually engaging its user.\n\n43\n00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.100\nWe'll talk about data in transit\nas the next stop on that road.\n\n44\n00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.510\nBecause, obviously,\nonce we start to consume the data and\n\n45\n00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.270\npull it off the device or\nremove it from where it is and\n\n46\n00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.420\nbring it back to us remotely,\nwe're now talking about moving data.\n\n47\n00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.800\nLet's start with data at rest.\n\n48\n00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.560\nData at rest is really the idea of\nfocusing on data that is in some way\n\n49\n00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.710\nbeing stored for later use or\ncontinuous use but on demand.\n\n50\n00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.890\nAnd so how do we deal with that?\n\n51\n00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.230\nWell, we have physical things\nwe have to think about.\n\n52\n00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.260\nIs the place where the data is secured or\nrather where the data is stored secure?\n\n53\n00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.170\nSo, do we have closed\ncircuit TV monitoring?\n\n54\n00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.620\nIf it's in a data center with\nother data that somebody may want\n\n55\n00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.340\ndo we have locks on the doors?\n\n56\n00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.670\nDo we have guards?\n\n57\n00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.420\nWhat if that data's being stored in\na cloud vendor based environment,\n\n58\n00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.525\nin a multi-tenant scenario?\n\n59\n00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:56.320\nMulti-tenant scenarios in\nthe cloud imply you have one or\n\n60\n00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.130\nmore customers being, using or\nstoring data in this case,\n\n61\n00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.720\nand using systems, commingling in effect,\ncausing pools of resources.\n\n62\n00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.240\nWe want to segment that data so\nthat it's only available to the customer\n\n63\n00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.920\nthat owns it, so\nwe have to think about zoning and masking.\n\n64\n00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.790\nThese are things that we do in\nthe storage network to be able to\n\n65\n00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.470\npresent the data in a way that is only\navailable to the individual customer.\n\n66\n00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.600\nProtecting the data from being\nexposed to everybody else.\n\n67\n00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.840\nThat's a logical set of controls but\n\n68\n00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.600\nit's also a physical\nsolution that we can apply.\n\n69\n00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.890\nBut then we have to do other things,\n\n70\n00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.380\nwe have to make sure that people who come\ninto the data center are signing in and\n\n71\n00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.300\nare gonna be checks that they\nare not bringing in information\n\n72\n00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.130\nthat may be used to\ncompromise our systems.\n\n73\n00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.430\nSo data at rest protection\ncan be complicated,\n\n74\n00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.830\nit could be something where we potentially\nare going to use offsite storage and\n\n75\n00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.170\nhave a copy, a backup of the data, that's\nactively being used in our system, so\n\n76\n00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.550\ndata being used, data being consumed\nis different than data at rest.\n\n77\n00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.760\nData that's at rest could be a backup\ncopy for disaster recovery and\n\n78\n00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.280\nbusiness continuity purposes.\n\n79\n00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.330\nThat's another form of data at rest.\n\n80\n00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.500\nBut what about when it's being\ntransitted between our facility and\n\n81\n00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.110\nthe location where it's gonna wind up?\n\n82\n00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.530\nHow are we protecting it then?\n\n83\n00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.490\nThose are data in transit questions,\nand we'll talk about those.\n\n84\n00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.440\nBut traditionally, we would apply\ncryptography and cryptographic solutions\n\n85\n00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.430\nto data at rest, in order to provide\nsafeguards to the data itself.\n\n86\n00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.410\nThe physical security that we apply\naround the data is important, the guards,\n\n87\n00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.830\nthe closed circuit TV,\nthe monitoring, the access control.\n\n88\n00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.720\nAll that's good, but that, in an of\nitself, is not enough because if somebody\n\n89\n00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.730\ngets through all that and gets the data\nand we don't protect the data itself\n\n90\n00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.710\nwith something that sticky, attributes and\ncontrols that stay with the data no\n\n91\n00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.450\nmatter where it is then the data\nitself can easily be compromised.\n\n92\n00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.620\nAnd so we have to encrypt the data\nas part of this thought process.\n\n93\n00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.310\nSo, the risks that are associated\nwith data at rest are numerous.\n\n94\n00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.940\nBut the general idea if we boil it down\nis, we wanna protect the people and\n\n95\n00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.300\nprotect data, we've talked about that.\n\n96\n00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.630\nBut when it comes to protecting data,\nwe wanna safeguard the data using physical\n\n97\n00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.490\ncontrols making sure\npeople can't get to it.\n\n98\n00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.070\nBut if they do we also\nwant to safeguard the data\n\n99\n00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.510\nby applying controlled mechanisms things\nlike cryptography to the data itself so\n\n100\n00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.140\neven if the data is accessed it can only\nbe used if they have the proper access\n\n101\n00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.230\ncontrol and proper keys necessary to\nbe able to gain access to the data.\n\n102\n00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.185\nSo you have to be an authorized user\nwith the proper typically private or\n\n103\n00:05:17.185 --> 00:05:19.430\nprivate/public key pair in place for\n\n104\n00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.100\nyou to be able to access the data,\nwe apply cryptography.\n\n105\n00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.940\nSo we wanna make sure we prevent people\nfrom gaining unauthorized access to\n\n106\n00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.490\nthe data when it's at rest.\n\n107\n00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.070\nWanna make sure that we are gonna perform\nactions from a maintenance perspective.\n\n108\n00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.370\nStoring that data, short,\nmedium and long term.\n\n109\n00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.950\nThat never jeopardize the integrity or\nthe confidentiality of the data.\n\n110\n00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.330\nSo, if we move the data from one\nstorage location to another,\n\n111\n00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.790\nare we doing that securely?\n\n112\n00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.860\nIf a data vendor, somebody that\nwe're paying to store our data,\n\n113\n00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.380\ncopies the data because they're gonna\ndecommission one storage solution and\n\n114\n00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.340\nmove data to another, are they doing\nthat securely without exposing our data?\n\n115\n00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.920\nDo the people in the data center,\n\n116\n00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.730\nthat access the data, are they cleared\nto be able to work on that system and\n\n117\n00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.590\ndo they understand how to keep the\nintegrity as well as the confidentiality\n\n118\n00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.256\ncontrols in place to keep our data\nseparate from everybody elses?\n\n119\n00:06:05.256 --> 00:06:08.930\nAnd are they gonna commingle the data in\nsuch a way that they expose our data,\n\n120\n00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.440\neither by accident or on purpose?\n\n121\n00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.470\nDo they misconfigure the storage pathing,\nwhat we call the storage multi-pathing, so\n\n122\n00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.780\nthat way you can get to your storage and\nyou can access data.\n\n123\n00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.260\nAre they implementing security\non the storage pathways?\n\n124\n00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.100\nThings like CHAP authentication,\nto validate users that are coming in and\n\n125\n00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.240\naccessing the data.\n\n126\n00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.810\nThis is very critical, very important with\nCloud services, and with virtualization in\n\n127\n00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.560\nparticular to support Cloud,\nbecause the data is stored in common areas\n\n128\n00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.060\non storage area networks and multiple\nvirtual machines and multiple customers.\n\n129\n00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.280\nAnd a multi-tenant environment may\naccess that data simultaneously or\n\n130\n00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.500\nat least that element where the data is.\n\n131\n00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.780\nAnd as a result we have to\nmake sure we safeguard that.\n\n132\n00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.710\nAnd authenticate the access\ncontrols to the data,\n\n133\n00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.990\nto make sure that the right\ncustomers are seeing the right data.\n\n134\n00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.100\nThis becomes very important.\n\n135\n00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.010\nSo we have a lot of risks\nassociated with data at rest.\n\n136\n00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.010\nRecommendations around how to\ndeal with the risk, right?\n\n137\n00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.630\nWouldn't be good to just define the risk.\n\n138\n00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.320\nWe have to tell you how to fix it and\ndeal with it.\n\n139\n00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.920\nSo, things like developing and\ntesting appropriate data recovery plans.\n\n140\n00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.660\nYou know, part of disaster recovery\nbusiness continuity should be,\n\n141\n00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.310\nhow am I gonna recover data\nif something goes wrong?\n\n142\n00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.000\nPlan for that.\n\n143\n00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.540\nBut also, don't just plan.\n\n144\n00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.130\nTest the plans to make sure that\nthey will work the right way.\n\n145\n00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.510\nUse compliant encryption algorithm and\ntools.\n\n146\n00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.860\nMake sure that the encryption you're\nusing is gonna stand the test of time.\n\n147\n00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.120\nThis is one of the things that I talk\nabout with my customers quite often,\n\n148\n00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.300\nand this is an area where a lot of\npeople don't make the connection,\n\n149\n00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.350\ndon't fast forward and\nthink about what happens in the future.\n\n150\n00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.800\nWe talked about this issue\nin our prior episode, right?\n\n151\n00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.720\nWhere we were talking about being able\nto access data for a retention period.\n\n152\n00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.330\nAnd do we have the software available 15,\n20 years later to be able to do that?\n\n153\n00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:42.576\nDo we have the knowledge 15 or\n\n154\n00:07:42.576 --> 00:07:45.960\n20 years later to be able to use that\nlegacy system to bring the data up?\n\n155\n00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.650\nYou know, this is an issue.\n\n156\n00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.879\nWell, what about the encryption?\n\n157\n00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:53.232\nIs the encryption algorithm we're applying\nstrong enough to stand the test of a 20\n\n158\n00:07:53.232 --> 00:07:54.890\nyear retention window?\n\n159\n00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:59.288\nOr do we have to put that data, literally,\nin a locked vault somewhere, you know?\n\n160\n00:07:59.288 --> 00:08:02.485\nPut a 24-hour guard around it,\nmake sure nobody can get to it, and\n\n161\n00:08:02.485 --> 00:08:05.519\nsafeguard it that way because we're\nnot gonna be able to strongly\n\n162\n00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:07.911\nencrypt the data to prevent\npeople from seeing it.\n\n163\n00:08:07.911 --> 00:08:11.751\nAnd as a result, we really have to focus\non the physical security up front.\n\n164\n00:08:11.751 --> 00:08:15.600\nThis will be the Mission Impossible\nconcept for security, right?\n\n165\n00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.630\nMaking sure we have the pressure\nsensitive pad on the floor, right?\n\n166\n00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.456\nThe really cool music playing in the\nbackground whenever you access the data.\n\n167\n00:08:22.456 --> 00:08:26.020\nSo we're gonna digress for half a second\nhere, cuz I have to comment on this.\n\n168\n00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.400\nWhenever I talk about Mission Impossible,\nthis always comes up in my classes.\n\n169\n00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.510\nSo if you saw the movie,\n\n170\n00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.720\nthe first movie, because the original\nTV episodes were just way cooler.\n\n171\n00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.170\nI'm sorry if you don't agree with me,\nbut that's just the way it is.\n\n172\n00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:41.025\nBut the movie, the first movie when you\nsaw it if you remember at a certain point\n\n173\n00:08:41.025 --> 00:08:43.612\nTom Cruise is going in to\nbreak into the CIA, right?\n\n174\n00:08:43.612 --> 00:08:45.382\nAnd he's gonna get the knock list,\n\n175\n00:08:45.382 --> 00:08:49.110\nthe list of all the spies that have\nto be safeguarded, can't be exposed.\n\n176\n00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.280\nIn it's this vault, theoretically,\nin the middle of the CIA.\n\n177\n00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.540\nSo they have all these great protections,\nright?\n\n178\n00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:57.452\nThey've got the guard sitting out front,\nthey've got the receptionist,\n\n179\n00:08:57.452 --> 00:09:00.636\nyou gotta sign in, you've got the guard\nwith the gun, you've got the vault door,\n\n180\n00:09:00.636 --> 00:09:01.838\nyou walk in, your card key in.\n\n181\n00:09:01.838 --> 00:09:03.849\nThe pressure sensitive plate in the floor,\n\n182\n00:09:03.849 --> 00:09:06.085\nsecure workstation\nisolated from everything.\n\n183\n00:09:06.085 --> 00:09:08.840\nThe only way to get to the list\nis in the vault, right?\n\n184\n00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.846\nHeat sensitive,\npressure sensitive, you name it.\n\n185\n00:09:10.846 --> 00:09:12.610\nEvery kind of sensitivity you can imagine.\n\n186\n00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.830\nIt's a very sensitive vault,\nlots of feelings, lots of emotions, right.\n\n187\n00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.345\nSo the guy goes in there,\nthe analyst goes in there.\n\n188\n00:09:18.345 --> 00:09:20.000\nAccesses it, right?\n\n189\n00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.955\nDrinks the spiked coffee,\nhas to leave go to the bathroom.\n\n190\n00:09:22.955 --> 00:09:24.585\nSo now what do they do?\n\n191\n00:09:24.585 --> 00:09:29.265\nSo Tom Cruise and the other character\nactor are up in the HVAC system, cuz you\n\n192\n00:09:29.265 --> 00:09:32.255\nmake the ducts big enough that people can\ncrawl through them, it's very important.\n\n193\n00:09:32.255 --> 00:09:32.825\n>> Of course.\n>> It's\n\n194\n00:09:32.825 --> 00:09:35.065\none of the key things you do\nwhen you architect securely.\n\n195\n00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:36.265\nIs make sure ducts are big enough for\n\n196\n00:09:36.265 --> 00:09:39.005\nthe bad actors to crawl through\nthem to get to your data.\n\n197\n00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:41.225\nSo they've done that,\nthat was done very well.\n\n198\n00:09:41.225 --> 00:09:43.282\nThen they open up the access hatch,\n\n199\n00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:47.337\ncuz you also wanna leave an air\nconditioning duct available and open.\n\n200\n00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:50.999\nNot just a duct, but one that's big enough\nfor a human body to actually fit through\n\n201\n00:09:50.999 --> 00:09:53.990\ninto the secure vault,\ncuz that's also very important.\n\n202\n00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:58.250\nAnd then, all they have protecting it\nat the end of the day is a laser field.\n\n203\n00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.450\nOkay, so I get that,\nthat's kinda cool, but\n\n204\n00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.790\nwhat does Tom Cruise do, cuz he's the man.\n\n205\n00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.500\nHe has the really cool sliding mirror that\njust effectively moves the lasers out of\n\n206\n00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.295\nthe way, so he can then lower\nhimself into the vault and\n\n207\n00:10:09.295 --> 00:10:12.600\nthen get the list, and\nthis is the best part of the whole thing.\n\n208\n00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.399\nSo secure workstation totally isolated\nonly way to access the list, so\n\n209\n00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:17.805\nlet's think about this.\n\n210\n00:10:17.805 --> 00:10:20.828\nYou've got the data it's stored securely\nit's in the vault you got these\n\n211\n00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:22.015\ncontrols, right.\n\n212\n00:10:22.015 --> 00:10:25.585\nAnd then you have an optical\nfloppy disk on the machine\n\n213\n00:10:25.585 --> 00:10:29.330\nthat effectively allows you to write the\nlist and take it off the machine thereby\n\n214\n00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:33.052\neffectively nullifying every security\ncontrol you have put in place.\n\n215\n00:10:33.052 --> 00:10:34.657\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n216\n00:10:34.657 --> 00:10:36.917\ncuz that really happens in the real world,\nright?\n\n217\n00:10:36.917 --> 00:10:38.967\nSo data at rest, right?\n\n218\n00:10:38.967 --> 00:10:43.397\nWhat I'm getting at here is\nthe absurdity of what we can go to,\n\n219\n00:10:43.397 --> 00:10:46.060\nin terms of the lengths we go to\nto protect the system when it's\n\n220\n00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:50.460\ntalking about data at rest, and that it's\nthe smallest thing that can trip us up.\n\n221\n00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.200\nWho puts a writable floppy disk drive\n\n222\n00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.680\non a system that's got a million dollar\nsecurity system associated with it?\n\n223\n00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.690\nClearly, the producers\nof Mission Impossible,\n\n224\n00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:04.110\nbut my point is that's\njust not good design.\n\n225\n00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.890\nIt's not good data at rest protections.\n\n226\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.426\nIf we were designing that system the one\nthing I would have done differently.\n\n227\n00:11:09.426 --> 00:11:12.476\nI would have left the cool HVAC\nvents with the laser field and\n\n228\n00:11:12.476 --> 00:11:14.100\nall that in place, right?\n\n229\n00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.400\nThat's okay, but I would not have\nput a floppy drive on that system,\n\n230\n00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.190\nbecause now what I have effectively\nsaid is, even if you break in\n\n231\n00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.860\nthe only way you're getting the data\nis if you sit there and read it.\n\n232\n00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.000\nAnd if you really want it you're\ngonna have to write it down,\n\n233\n00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.120\nand by writing it down it's\ngonna take you longer to get it.\n\n234\n00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.140\nAnd we're probably gonna find you hanging\nlike a marionette in the vault before\n\n235\n00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:33.807\nyou get out.\n\n236\n00:11:33.807 --> 00:11:37.011\nAnd as a result we're gonna shoot you,\ncuz that's what we do with people that\n\n237\n00:11:37.011 --> 00:11:40.513\naccess data that aren't supposed to get\nit, and that's gonna solve our data access\n\n238\n00:11:40.513 --> 00:11:44.060\nproblem cuz now you're not gonna be able\nto tell anybody what you saw, right.\n\n239\n00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:48.010\nSo when you think about data at rest\nprotections they have to be contextual,\n\n240\n00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:49.430\nthey have to be appropriate, but\n\n241\n00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.310\nmost importantly they have to make sense,\nright.\n\n242\n00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.380\nDon't do things that violate\nthe integrity of the system\n\n243\n00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.340\nin order to safeguard a system is\nwhat we're trying to get at here.\n\n244\n00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.940\nPutting the floppy disk on the system just\ndoesn't make sense cuz nobody needs it.\n\n245\n00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.176\nIf it was that secure you shouldn't have\na way to get it out of the system in\n\n246\n00:12:04.176 --> 00:12:04.739\nthe first place.\n\n247\n00:12:04.739 --> 00:12:07.218\nIf you think about it, or\nat least an alternate mechanism.\n\n248\n00:12:07.218 --> 00:12:10.500\nSo we wanna make sure we use\nthings like complex passwords.\n\n249\n00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.150\nWanna make sure we use encryption.\n\n250\n00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:16.636\nWanna make sure we are using\nmulti factor authentication.\n\n251\n00:12:16.636 --> 00:12:19.985\nThese are all mechanisms that will\nhelp us to safeguard data at rest and\n\n252\n00:12:19.985 --> 00:12:22.620\nmake sure the data at rest\nis not gonna be compromised.\n\n253\n00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.796\nSo using secure password\nmanagement techniques and\n\n254\n00:12:25.796 --> 00:12:30.272\npassword policies that require passwords\nto be changed every 30 days or\n\n255\n00:12:30.272 --> 00:12:33.386\nwhatever it may be that\nthey're gonna be complex.\n\n256\n00:12:33.386 --> 00:12:37.425\nYou may even implement the idea of using\npass phrases instead of passwords as\n\n257\n00:12:37.425 --> 00:12:39.646\nan additional security solution there.\n\n258\n00:12:39.646 --> 00:12:42.940\nDon't allow passwords or\npass phrases to be written down.\n\n259\n00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.573\nMake sure people store\nthem in a secure way.\n\n260\n00:12:44.573 --> 00:12:46.720\nAll the common stuff we\nwould think about right.\n\n261\n00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.278\nMaking sure that the data that is taken\noff the system in any way, shape, or\n\n262\n00:12:50.278 --> 00:12:52.385\nform is gonna be encrypted automatically.\n\n263\n00:12:52.385 --> 00:12:54.410\nThat's another great way\nto protect data at rest.\n\n264\n00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.530\nMaking sure we don't allow\nthe insertion of removable media\n\n265\n00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:59.200\nto remove data from the system.\n\n266\n00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.760\nTalked about that, another way to think\nabout data at rest recommendations.\n\n267\n00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.170\nIf we are going to do all those things,\nright?\n\n268\n00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:08.770\nAnd then have all the other\nprotections we talked about as well.\n\n269\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.180\nWe still have to focus on now data moving\nthrough the system from one system\n\n270\n00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:12.787\nto another.\n\n271\n00:13:12.787 --> 00:13:16.470\nWhat we call data in transit, and\nso we've talked about data at rest.\n\n272\n00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.227\nData in transit is the idea of being able\nto effectively safeguard data when it's on\n\n273\n00:13:20.227 --> 00:13:23.500\nthe move, because at some point we're\ngoing to take it from where it sits\n\n274\n00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.610\nin the storage, and\nwanna access it to use it.\n\n275\n00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.840\nAt that point now we\nhave to think about that.\n\n276\n00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.730\nSo preventing the content of the data\nfrom being exposed during transmission\n\n277\n00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:33.710\nis what data in transit is all about.\n\n278\n00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.400\nWe can use encryption here as well.\n\n279\n00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.430\nSo cryptography is equally important here.\n\n280\n00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.140\nWe can do what's called link encryption,\nor\n\n281\n00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.420\nwe can do what's called\nend to end encryption.\n\n282\n00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:42.799\nWe have a couple of options, right?\n\n283\n00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.020\nWhen we think about link encryption\nwhat we're thinking about ultimately,\n\n284\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.590\nis encryption of the data all the way\nalong the communication pathway.\n\n285\n00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.660\nThis is performed by service providers.\n\n286\n00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.160\nSo this is gonna be done when we hit\nthe router on our side of the network,\n\n287\n00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.130\nwhich is the gateway device that\neffectively demarcates local from remote.\n\n288\n00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.850\nAnd from that point,\nas we get on the circuit to go external,\n\n289\n00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:08.090\nwe are then effectively on\na shared network with other people\n\n290\n00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:12.140\non a common carrier network, which is\ngonna be managed by a service provider.\n\n291\n00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.620\nOn that network the service provider\nwill implement link encryption.\n\n292\n00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.230\nIt will implement all the traffic\nthat moves from routers,\n\n293\n00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.040\nbetween routers ultimately to the end\npoint where the other router will be that\n\n294\n00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.320\nyou wanna alight on and effectively stop,\nand that's your end point where you're\n\n295\n00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.410\ngonna access whatever the local solution\nis you wanna get to on that side.\n\n296\n00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.227\nBetween routers, between end points,\n\n297\n00:14:30.227 --> 00:14:32.854\non a common network is where\nlink encryption takes place.\n\n298\n00:14:32.854 --> 00:14:36.550\nSo it's the carrier provider that\nhas to implement link encryption.\n\n299\n00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.410\nIt's very important for\nus to think about that.\n\n300\n00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.780\nVersus end to end encryption.\n\n301\n00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.870\nNow end to end encryption,\nwe talked about this, and\n\n302\n00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:46.390\npeople sometimes say well isn't end to\nend encryption logically the encryption\n\n303\n00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.040\non the wire between the provider and you?\n\n304\n00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.103\nWell yeah, but it's more than that,\nbecause link encryption is really\n\n305\n00:14:52.103 --> 00:14:55.732\nthe encryption between the end points that\nthe provider is creating the circuit for.\n\n306\n00:14:55.732 --> 00:15:00.234\nEnd to end encryption is gonna be\nencryption that starts with the end user,\n\n307\n00:15:00.234 --> 00:15:02.804\nhence the one end, or\nat one end point, and\n\n308\n00:15:02.804 --> 00:15:07.806\nstarts in the application layer of the OSI\nmodel where we access the data in theory,\n\n309\n00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:10.940\nand store and safeguard and\nuse it securely.\n\n310\n00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.880\nAnd if you're not up on your OSI model,\n\n311\n00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.690\nboy have we got a conversation coming\nup for you, at some point soon.\n\n312\n00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.987\nMike's even got a costume and everything.\n\n313\n00:15:17.987 --> 00:15:20.738\nHe's gonna come dancing\nout as the OSI model, and\n\n314\n00:15:20.738 --> 00:15:24.230\ntake off one layer at a time,\nand deconstruct the OSI model.\n\n315\n00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.470\nIt's gonna be very exciting.\n\n316\n00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:26.770\nMake sure you tune in for that.\n\n317\n00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.370\nSo end to end encryption is\nstarting with one end point, and\n\n318\n00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.480\nends at the other side\nof that transmission.\n\n319\n00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.120\nSo it's gonna happen from the end users\nperspective as they start to access data,\n\n320\n00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.880\ncreate it, store it securely.\n\n321\n00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.672\nSafeguard it with application level\nencryption inside of a program, and\n\n322\n00:15:42.672 --> 00:15:46.843\nthen deconstruct that data, send it\nsomewhere, store it, transmit it, etc.\n\n323\n00:15:46.843 --> 00:15:50.654\nAnd then reconstruct it on the other side\nin an application that will then allow\n\n324\n00:15:50.654 --> 00:15:52.629\nthem to be able to see the data securely.\n\n325\n00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:54.421\nThis is end to end encryption.\n\n326\n00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:58.421\nIt's not just about the transmission\non the wire between two end points.\n\n327\n00:15:58.421 --> 00:16:02.010\nMeaning link-based encryption\nbetween a router and another router.\n\n328\n00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:02.900\nIt's broader than that.\n\n329\n00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.234\nIt encompasses the entire usage pattern of\nthat data from the user in the application\n\n330\n00:16:07.234 --> 00:16:11.090\nlayer of the OSI Model to the other\nendpoint, wherever we're going.\n\n331\n00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.520\nThat's end-to-end encryption.\n\n332\n00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.840\nWanna make sure we understand and\nno the difference between the two.\n\n333\n00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.060\nIt's very important.\n\n334\n00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.740\nSo, when we think about data in transit,\n\n335\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.669\nwe're thinking about the risks\nassociated with moving data.\n\n336\n00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.800\nI don't have one with me, but if I was to\npull out a USB drive, stick it into my\n\n337\n00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.660\nlaptop, make a copy of some information,\nand then hand that over to Mike and\n\n338\n00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:33.970\ngive it to him and say hey Mike, here's\na file, I'm effectively transmitting data.\n\n339\n00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:38.360\nSo if I don't encrypt the data on that\nUSB drive, then somebody, theoretically,\n\n340\n00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.140\ncould find that USB drive and get a copy\nof the data I gave to Mike as one example.\n\n341\n00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:42.710\nRight?\n\n342\n00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.770\nSo maybe something as simple as that or\nmaybe something more complex.\n\n343\n00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.820\nWhat if Im on a wireless network as we\nare right now, for instance, and Mike and\n\n344\n00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:54.160\nI share a communication\nwirelessly over that network?\n\n345\n00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.180\nI'm transmitting data to\nhim using a chat program.\n\n346\n00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.250\nMaybe I'm going to use Skype for business.\n\n347\n00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:03.040\nOr I'm gonna use AOL instant messenger,\nI love saying aim that's so\n\n348\n00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.340\ncool, AOL instant messenger,\nYahoo messenger, or whatever.\n\n349\n00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.900\nDoesn't matter what it is I'm\ngonna send him a message some how.\n\n350\n00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.730\nThat is data in transit that's moving\nacross a wireless network, but\n\n351\n00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.270\nit's still moving across a network.\n\n352\n00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:19.060\nIf we're not encrypting that transmission,\nusing a secure protocol, and or\n\n353\n00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.300\ntunneling it or both, then in theory\nsomebody monitoring our communications,\n\n354\n00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:26.110\nwith a wireless network sniffer,\nwill be able to see that traffic,\n\n355\n00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:27.320\nwill be able to read it.\n\n356\n00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:31.040\nSo it's not just about data that's\nin storage form that's being\n\n357\n00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.190\nhauled back and being used.\n\n358\n00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.350\nIt's about any transmission,\non any network,\n\n359\n00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.390\nanywhere that has to be protected.\n\n360\n00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:41.180\nThis is the broad encompassing thought\nprocess around data in transit and\n\n361\n00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.480\nthe risks associated with it.\n\n362\n00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.350\nWe have to be thinking\nabout secure protocols, and\n\n363\n00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:47.700\nwe have to be thinking about secure\ncommunication mechanisms as part of that.\n\n364\n00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.920\nIt's very, very important.\n\n365\n00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.720\nSo there's a broad level of\nrisk we have to address here.\n\n366\n00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.600\nSo recommendations, use encryption.\n\n367\n00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.610\nI'm done, by the way,\nthat was the only thing I have to say.\n\n368\n00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.180\nRight?\nYou know it's not complicated,\n\n369\n00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.340\nI mean I try to make fun\nof it because it is funny.\n\n370\n00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.580\nBut it's not any more difficult then that.\n\n371\n00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.690\nThe recommendation to secure\ndata in transit is very simple.\n\n372\n00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:07.300\nEncrypt everything.\n\n373\n00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.690\nIf you encrypt everything, chances are\ngood that the only people that are gonna\n\n374\n00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.230\nread it are you, and\nthe person you're sending it to.\n\n375\n00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.170\nBecause if anybody else captures that\nstream and they will, there's no\n\n376\n00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.570\ndoubt about that, if they do, they're\ngonna get a garbled amount of garbage and\n\n377\n00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:23.080\nas a result of that they're not gonna be\nable to read what it really means and\n\n378\n00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.940\nunderstand what it really says and\nget the true intent of the data.\n\n379\n00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:31.540\nSo if you apply encryption, you're gonna\neffectively protect the data in transit.\n\n380\n00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:35.100\nNow then the question becomes, okay,\nsmart guy, yeah I'll provide encryption,\n\n381\n00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.700\nbut what does that really mean?\n\n382\n00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.300\nWell we've got a whole conversation, or\nwhole set of conversations coming up for\n\n383\n00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.310\nyou when we talk about cryptography.\n\n384\n00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:44.280\nWe are talking about it here at a very\nhigh level, very broad right now.\n\n385\n00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.260\nWe're gonna drill into that in much\nmore depth in a couple of our upcoming\n\n386\n00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:51.070\nepisodes, when we get into the domain\nthat specifically deals with that.\n\n387\n00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.570\nAnd I work in telecommunications security,\nand we're gonna apply cryptography and\n\n388\n00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.620\ntalk about it there.\n\n389\n00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:57.820\nWe'll talk about it as well\nin systems engineering.\n\n390\n00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.740\nOne of the other domains of the CEBK,\n\n391\n00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.460\nthe current CIS's peabody of knowledge,\nwe'll talk about it in depth.\n\n392\n00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:04.870\nWe're gonna break it down for you.\n\n393\n00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.740\nWe're gonna explain what algorithms are.\n\n394\n00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.970\nHow encryption works.\n\n395\n00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:11.390\nWhat is the difference between\nsymmetric and asymmetric encryption?\n\n396\n00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.050\nWhy is it important to\nuse one versus the other,\n\n397\n00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:15.560\ndepending on what you are looking to do?\n\n398\n00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.970\nAll those things will become clear to you,\n\n399\n00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.700\nI promise you we are gonna\ntalk about all of them.\n\n400\n00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.250\nBut for now, we are just talking the high\nlevel about the fact that if you apply\n\n401\n00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:26.110\nencryption, you are already well out in\nfront, you are gonna be ahead of the game.\n\n402\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.620\nAnd then it's a matter of making\nsmart choices, obviously.\n\n403\n00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.520\nChoosing the right encryption algorithms,\n\n404\n00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:33.980\nunderstand the difference between\nsymmetric and asymmetric solutions,\n\n405\n00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:38.650\nprivate key only, public/private key,\ndigitally signed versus encrypt.\n\n406\n00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:42.420\nUse hashing to create integrity,\nproof of origin, non-repidiation.\n\n407\n00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.630\nWe'll get into all of this.\n\n408\n00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.400\nBut if you just have in your mind over all\nthat we should use encryption whenever and\n\n409\n00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.730\nwherever possible you've already\ndone the most important thing.\n\n410\n00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.560\nYou've started to think securely and\n\n411\n00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:55.440\nyou've started to think about implementing\nsecurity systems in a way that will lead\n\n412\n00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.400\nthe information that transits through\nthem to be much more secure over time.\n\n413\n00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.920\nThis is obviously going\nto be very important.\n\n414\n00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:04.130\nSo be thinking about things like\nthat when you're on the web.\n\n415\n00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.040\nHow to you encrypt traffic on the web?\n\n416\n00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:10.280\nWe're accessing a web page, this stream,\nfor instance, that you guys\n\n417\n00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.340\nare effectively listening to and watching\nright now, by the way is my hair okay?\n\n418\n00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:18.510\nSo when you're watching us right now, is\nthis going to be a secured communication?\n\n419\n00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.500\nAre we broadcasting to you effectively?\n\n420\n00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.470\nUsing a secured channel to do that?\n\n421\n00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:24.020\nWell, of course we should be.\n\n422\n00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.280\nAnd hopefully we are.\n\n423\n00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:29.105\nBut even if we're not, could you\nmake that transmission more secure?\n\n424\n00:20:29.105 --> 00:20:29.915\nOf course you could.\n\n425\n00:20:29.915 --> 00:20:32.995\nYou could choose to use a secure\nprotocol to engage the transmission\n\n426\n00:20:32.995 --> 00:20:35.035\nas supposed to one that's not secured so\n\n427\n00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:39.145\nyou could use https instead of http\nto access the content as one example.\n\n428\n00:20:39.145 --> 00:20:43.785\nYou could SSL and or TLS to kind of\nyou know, next generation of SSL,\n\n429\n00:20:43.785 --> 00:20:45.455\nTransport Layer Security.\n\n430\n00:20:45.455 --> 00:20:49.005\nYou could use digital certificates to\nvalidate your origination point and\n\n431\n00:20:49.005 --> 00:20:52.410\nthe authenticity of the information\nthat somebody sends you.\n\n432\n00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:54.860\nYou can actually do a variety\nof different things.\n\n433\n00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.550\nYou may tunnel this transmission.\n\n434\n00:20:56.550 --> 00:21:00.520\nWe'll talk about VPNs, and\ntalk about protocols, and L2TP, and\n\n435\n00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.870\nPPTP, and\nall that good stuff at some point later.\n\n436\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.300\nAll those things are gonna\nhelp you to be more secure.\n\n437\n00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:10.890\nAll those things are gonna be a result of\nyou deciding to make a transmission for\n\n438\n00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:15.010\ndata in transit more secure by\napplying multiple levels of controls\n\n439\n00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:19.490\nmultiple layers of safeguards in order to\nmake the system ultimately more secure,\n\n440\n00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:20.370\nmore resilient.\n\n441\n00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.560\nPicking encryption algorithms\nis really important.\n\n442\n00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:25.870\nYou've got to pick wisely, as we often\nsay, you've got to choose wisely.\n\n443\n00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:30.840\nRemember that scene in Indiana Jones,\nthe one where he's looking for\n\n444\n00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.480\nthe Holy Grail, where he finally finds the\nprotector of the Grail, the two brothers,\n\n445\n00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.930\nthe one's dead, the old guy.\n\n446\n00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:40.000\nAnd he's in there and the bad actor comes\nin, the guy who's the Nazi comes in.\n\n447\n00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.760\nAnd says, hey, I'm gonna find the grail.\n\n448\n00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.040\nAnd the doctor, the female,\ngives him the cup.\n\n449\n00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.000\nSets him up right?\n\n450\n00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.720\nKills him.\n\n451\n00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.140\nAnd then in Deadpan,\nwhich is what I love, in Deadpan the old\n\n452\n00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.640\nknight turns to Indiana Jones and\nsays he chose poorly, right?\n\n453\n00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.975\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You know, because he shrivels up and\n\n454\n00:21:55.975 --> 00:21:56.965\ndries up and flies away.\n\n455\n00:21:56.965 --> 00:21:58.805\nSo, don't be that guy, right?\n\n456\n00:21:58.805 --> 00:21:59.885\nChoose wisely.\n\n457\n00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:04.005\nWhen you pick encryption algorithms,\nmake sure that your picking algorithms\n\n458\n00:22:04.005 --> 00:22:07.435\nas we already talked about a little bit\nthat are going to stand the test of time.\n\n459\n00:22:07.435 --> 00:22:10.255\nYou know when you think about\nusing an algorithm today,\n\n460\n00:22:10.255 --> 00:22:11.865\nit's not about whether\nit can be broken today.\n\n461\n00:22:11.865 --> 00:22:14.880\nI mean it is, it's a part of it, don't get\nme wrong, but it's not just about that.\n\n462\n00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.870\nIt's about whether that algorithm\ncan stand the test of time for\n\n463\n00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:18.760\nthe retention period.\n\n464\n00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.800\nAnd this is why we force you to think\nabout the fact that retention periods\n\n465\n00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:26.210\nshould be reviewed, as well as\ntechnology implemented to safeguard data\n\n466\n00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:30.240\nshould be reviewed at least once\nevery six months or once a year.\n\n467\n00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.490\nBecause you may find that\nduring the course of that year,\n\n468\n00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.940\nchanges in technology have led that\nalgorithm to be considered to potentially\n\n469\n00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.710\nbe something that could be broken.\n\n470\n00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:42.720\nAnd if that's the case, then you have\nto figure unencrypting the data.\n\n471\n00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.530\nReencrypting it with\na new algorithm solution.\n\n472\n00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:47.620\nAnd then repurposing that\ndata to be stored again for\n\n473\n00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:51.200\nthe remainder of that period, but\nwith new and updated technology.\n\n474\n00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.930\nThis becomes very important as a CISSP.\n\n475\n00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:57.280\nRemember, it's our ultimate job,\nit's our responsibility.\n\n476\n00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.420\nWe talk a lot about due care and\ndue diligence.\n\n477\n00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:03.070\nWe have to exercise due care\nin choosing our algorithms.\n\n478\n00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:06.940\nWe have to be duly diligent in order to\nmake sure that we are continuing to offer\n\n479\n00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.460\nthe right level of protection\nthroughout the retention period.\n\n480\n00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.810\nAnd if we're not, we have to reassess, and\n\n481\n00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:14.040\nthen use due care to\nchoose a new solution.\n\n482\n00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.520\nReimplementing it, and then be diligent\nthroughout the remainder of that period.\n\n483\n00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.180\nIt's very important to understand due care\nand due diligence in any combination,\n\n484\n00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.130\nin any situation, and\nbe able to understand what they mean.\n\n485\n00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:28.480\nIn this case, they mean that you should\nmake good choices up front, but you should\n\n486\n00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.910\nalso examine those choices over the long\nterm, and reevaluate and reassure yourself\n\n487\n00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:38.000\nthat those are still good choices two,\nthree, four, five, seven, ten years later.\n\n488\n00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.940\nAnd if not,\nyou should make changes accordingly.\n\n489\n00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.980\nSo this is very important,\nit's a thought process.\n\n490\n00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.600\nWhen we think about it, we already\ntalked a bit about wireless networks and\n\n491\n00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.270\nthe web and things like that and\nhow to safeguard data there.\n\n492\n00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.260\nYou don't discount that,\ndon't forget about that.\n\n493\n00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.950\nDon't think to yourself, oh yeah, no, our\ndata never goes across wireless networks.\n\n494\n00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:54.720\nWe'll only use that for guest access.\n\n495\n00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.254\nWell, yeah you do.\n\n496\n00:23:55.254 --> 00:23:58.981\nOkay that's fine, but\ndo guests that are on your network through\n\n497\n00:23:58.981 --> 00:24:02.390\na wireless connection access\ndata on a secure system?\n\n498\n00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.110\nBecause if they can do that, guess what.\n\n499\n00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:06.420\nYour data's going across\nthe wireless network, right?\n\n500\n00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.918\nAnd so again it's the idea of\nunderstanding where data lives and\n\n501\n00:24:09.918 --> 00:24:11.450\nhow data is accessed.\n\n502\n00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:17.670\nAnd if you're not sure, I often talk about\nmy or with my customers, with my students.\n\n503\n00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:19.590\nThe customer experience journey map.\n\n504\n00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:21.490\nAnd you may or\nmay not have heard of this concept.\n\n505\n00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:22.770\nIt's sort of big in retail.\n\n506\n00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.230\nIt's sort of big in sales.\n\n507\n00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.350\nIt's the idea of understanding\nthe customer experience,\n\n508\n00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:28.040\nmapping out all of the touch points and\n\n509\n00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.810\nthen figuring out how to manage them\nto ultimately make a better experience.\n\n510\n00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:35.750\nSo when I talk about that with my\ncustomers in regards to data, what I\n\n511\n00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:41.220\ntalk about with data at rest and data in\ntransit protection is, map out the data.\n\n512\n00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.190\nUnderstand the journey of the data.\n\n513\n00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.940\nWhere does data live?\n\n514\n00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.110\nHow does it move from where it lives\nto where it's ultimately gonna be\n\n515\n00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.230\nused and back again?\n\n516\n00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.880\nAnd if you don't understand all\nthe touchpoints along that journey,\n\n517\n00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.680\nyou're not architecting, you're\nimplementing good security solutions.\n\n518\n00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:57.510\nBecause somewhere along that path\nsomething is gonna go wrong.\n\n519\n00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.110\nThe question is where,\nthe question is why.\n\n520\n00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.860\nIf you're not understanding the path,\n\n521\n00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.960\nyou're not gonna understand how to\nanswer the where and the why question.\n\n522\n00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.740\nAnd a result, somebody's gonna\ntake the data away from you and\n\n523\n00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.100\nthey're gonna own it and\nyou're not gonna have it any longer.\n\n524\n00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.820\nThat's just a fact of life, right.\n\n525\n00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.950\nSo think about that and understand that.\n\n526\n00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:16.700\nIt's very, very important for you when we\nthink about wireless networks we think\n\n527\n00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.070\nabout those things to make\nsure we understand them.\n\n528\n00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:23.410\nWhen we began this conversation I\ntalked about handling requirements and\n\n529\n00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.110\nreally framed it in regards to\nhandling requirements around data.\n\n530\n00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.350\nSo, I want to circle\nback to the general idea,\n\n531\n00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:30.480\nget us up above a level\nbeyond cryptography for\n\n532\n00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.420\na few minutes and really just talk about\nhandling requirements more generally.\n\n533\n00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.890\nAs we begin to think about what\nthose mean we think about media.\n\n534\n00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:38.180\nRight.\nSo where do we put the data?\n\n535\n00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.140\nWe've talked about this.\n\n536\n00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.610\nIs it removable media?\n\n537\n00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.120\nIs it gonna be fixed media?\n\n538\n00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.780\nYou're writing it to a DVD of\nsome kind that's not rewritable.\n\n539\n00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.770\nIt is removable, but it's fixed,\nit's gonna be in that form and not change.\n\n540\n00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.360\nIs it going to be stored\nelectronically somewhere?\n\n541\n00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:54.420\nIs there a physical copy of\nit in a vault somewhere else?\n\n542\n00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:57.365\nI use a lot of movie references when I\nteach so I'm going to use another one now.\n\n543\n00:25:57.365 --> 00:25:59.190\nSo you ever see Reds?\n\n544\n00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:02.680\nThe movie with Bruce Willis and\nMorgan Freeman and all of those.\n\n545\n00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.660\nRight, the spy movie.\n\n546\n00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:04.630\nSo it's a great movie.\n\n547\n00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.750\nAt a certain point in the movie,\nspoiler alert,\n\n548\n00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.670\nif you havent seen the movie\nstop watching right now.\n\n549\n00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.190\nSo at a certain point in the movie,\nBruce Willis who is kind of, you know,\n\n550\n00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.930\nthe focus of the first,\ncuz there were two movies.\n\n551\n00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:17.068\nHe's the focus of the first one.\n\n552\n00:26:17.068 --> 00:26:19.645\nHe's a retired CIA super spy, right?\n\n553\n00:26:19.645 --> 00:26:24.500\nSo he's kind of the guy who could do\nanything, go anywhere kind of thing.\n\n554\n00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.450\nHe's retired.\n\n555\n00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:29.560\nAnd then he gets dragged back in to this\nwhole life, because of some circumstances.\n\n556\n00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.310\nSo, at a certain point,\nthey have to break in.\n\n557\n00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:35.880\nHe and the love interest that he develops,\nthis girl who's helping him, have to break\n\n558\n00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:42.800\ninto the CIA to effectively access\nhis personnel file to be able to find\n\n559\n00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.830\nsome information buried in his past that\nleads them to understand what's happening.\n\n560\n00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:50.650\nSo, they go down to the vault because\nthe records are, you know, not electronic.\n\n561\n00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:54.100\nHe doesn't have a real electronic\nfile because he retired.\n\n562\n00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:56.280\nHe's effectively now like a paper file.\n\n563\n00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.220\nSo they have to go into the vault,\nand in order to get into the vault,\n\n564\n00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:04.180\ncuz the vault door is not working, the\naccess is not working, he punches a hole\n\n565\n00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:09.180\nin the drywall, rips the controller out\nof the wall, and opens the vault door.\n\n566\n00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.490\nAnd then Ernest Borgnine, if you know who\nthat is, a very famous older character\n\n567\n00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.310\nactor, is sitting there as like the keeper\nof the vault, he's got all the files.\n\n568\n00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:17.370\nHe says oh, wow, it's so great to see you.\n\n569\n00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.300\nAnd he pulls a file out of\nthis big filing cabinet.\n\n570\n00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.970\nThe file's like, this big, and\nthis high, but it's all paper.\n\n571\n00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.670\nAnd he throws it on the desk,\nand they open it up, and\n\n572\n00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:27.400\nalmost everything in there is redacted.\n\n573\n00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.300\nAll you see is this stack of\npaper with black lines on it,\n\n574\n00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.830\nthere's nothing that you can see.\n\n575\n00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.530\nBut it's just really funny\nbecause he has to go get the file\n\n576\n00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.870\nbecause the only file that exists is\nthis old paper file, stored in a vault,\n\n577\n00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.950\nlocked up in the bottom of this building.\n\n578\n00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:41.270\nSo sometimes it's that.\n\n579\n00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.430\nIt's really just paper.\n\n580\n00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:44.650\nBut more and\nmore today it's going to be media.\n\n581\n00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:47.570\nIt's going to be electronic bits and\nbytes that we have to account for.\n\n582\n00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:53.970\nWhen you store data in multiple places and\nyou then are managing that data centrally,\n\n583\n00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:56.510\nis the management going to apply\nequally to all the copies of the data?\n\n584\n00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:58.090\nThis is something else\nwe have to think about.\n\n585\n00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.372\nSo, when we think about mobile devices and\nmobile device management,\n\n586\n00:28:01.372 --> 00:28:04.928\nis our data policy gonna extend to mobile\ndevices and safeguard the data there\n\n587\n00:28:04.928 --> 00:28:07.849\nas well as safeguarding the data\nthat's in the system itself?\n\n588\n00:28:07.849 --> 00:28:11.641\nAnd if we don't reach out and touch the\ndata there, are we really doing a good job\n\n589\n00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:14.652\nof management, with handling and\nrequirements around that?\n\n590\n00:28:14.652 --> 00:28:15.420\nWe may or may not be.\n\n591\n00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.590\nThat's gonna be important.\n\n592\n00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.530\nAre we marking the data and\nclassifying it?\n\n593\n00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.660\nWe talked about this as well and\nwhy marking and\n\n594\n00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.640\nclassification is so important.\n\n595\n00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.440\nThe data has to be marked\nat a certain level.\n\n596\n00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.230\nSo, we understand it's to be\ntreated in a certain way.\n\n597\n00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:29.680\nDo we have special handling\nrequirements for the data?\n\n598\n00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.385\nYeah, you can only go into the secure\nvault and see the data in there.\n\n599\n00:28:32.385 --> 00:28:33.917\nYou can't remove the data from the system.\n\n600\n00:28:33.917 --> 00:28:34.661\nThose kind of things.\n\n601\n00:28:34.661 --> 00:28:36.018\nThose will be handling requirements.\n\n602\n00:28:36.018 --> 00:28:37.740\nVery important thing about it as well.\n\n603\n00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.610\nWe already talked extensively\nabout storing, and\n\n604\n00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.380\nwhere we store data and\nhow to manage that.\n\n605\n00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:47.820\nOne of the things that often happens,\nespecially if we have NAS devices,\n\n606\n00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:52.770\nor storage area network devices, where we\nstore large volumes of data, is that we\n\n607\n00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.140\nhave web interfaces today that allow us to\nconfigure and program these systems and\n\n608\n00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.920\nset them up for management as well\nas configuration and security.\n\n609\n00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:03.010\nThat's all good, but the problem is that\nwe're not securing the web interface,\n\n610\n00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:06.470\nand all we do is focus on the physical\nsecurity of the device itself.\n\n611\n00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.040\nYou know, the network connection, and\nthe device is sitting on a shelf,\n\n612\n00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.220\nlet's make sure we safeguard that,\nlet's lock up the room,\n\n613\n00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.940\nlet's not let people in there physically.\n\n614\n00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.380\nBut if we let people in there logically\nthrough the web to connect without proper\n\n615\n00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.430\nsecurity protocols we've effectively\ndone the same thing as putting it out\n\n616\n00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.755\nin the middle room with a big sign on it\nthat says free data please come and take.\n\n617\n00:29:22.755 --> 00:29:24.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, because effectively if\n\n618\n00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.470\na user can get into the web interface and\nreconstruct or control and change\n\n619\n00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:32.230\nthe security settings on the system, they\neffectively own the data and they can copy\n\n620\n00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.560\nit and move it and do whatever they\nwant with it and we would never know.\n\n621\n00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.210\nSo these are all things we have to\nthink about and really be aware of.\n\n622\n00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:38.340\nWe finally have to think about and\n\n623\n00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:41.980\nultimately wrap up our conversation\nin this area with destruction.\n\n624\n00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.100\nHow do we safeguard data?\n\n625\n00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.030\nThat's all important.\n\n626\n00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:46.130\nHow do we get rid of data,\nhow do we destroy it?\n\n627\n00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:50.530\nWhether we're gonna by, in fact we're\nusing a magnetic field to clear the data,\n\n628\n00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.470\nwhether we're gonna override it\nseveral times by scrambling the bits\n\n629\n00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:57.460\neffectively and moving them around in such\na way that they no longer are associated.\n\n630\n00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.560\nWhether we're gonna physically destroy the\ndata by putting the drive into a shredder,\n\n631\n00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:05.080\na hammer mill or liquefying it in\na furnace or something like that.\n\n632\n00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.150\nUsing thermite to actually melt the drive.\n\n633\n00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:08.325\nThere's a cool demo for you.\n\n634\n00:30:08.325 --> 00:30:09.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You'll have to YouTube and\n\n635\n00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.140\nlook that one up.\n\n636\n00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.420\nThat's really neat, right?\n\n637\n00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:13.128\nSo, you know?\nThe idea is, ultimately,\n\n638\n00:30:13.128 --> 00:30:16.549\nthat we have to figure out how to destroy\ndata commensurate with the level of\n\n639\n00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:18.034\nprotection the data requires.\n\n640\n00:30:18.034 --> 00:30:21.281\nIf the data is not sensitive, we don't\nhave to go to the trouble of liquefying it\n\n641\n00:30:21.281 --> 00:30:24.199\nwith a thermite grenade strapped to\nthe side of the hard drive, right?\n\n642\n00:30:24.199 --> 00:30:25.328\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All we have to do\n\n643\n00:30:25.328 --> 00:30:28.810\nis just hit the Delete button and\nensure that the data is gone.\n\n644\n00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:30.130\nNow we know data is still there.\n\n645\n00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.350\nThere's remnant data, people can get it,\nbut if we're not really worried about that\n\n646\n00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:35.920\nand all we want to do is make it\ndisappear from the file system so\n\n647\n00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.840\nnobody can easily find it.\n\n648\n00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.380\nThen that's probably\nokay that's good enough.\n\n649\n00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.370\nBut if we know we need stronger\nprotection, we have to do other things.\n\n650\n00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:45.086\nThe point is,\nmake sure that the end of the lifecycle,\n\n651\n00:30:45.086 --> 00:30:47.805\nthe destruction and\nthe decommissioning of the data,\n\n652\n00:30:47.805 --> 00:30:51.469\nis gonna be governed by the same policy\nand the same level of protection for\n\n653\n00:30:51.469 --> 00:30:55.161\nthat data, as it was during its\nlifecycle when we're actually using it.\n\n654\n00:30:55.161 --> 00:30:57.888\nSo we wanna make sure we apply that\nthought process all the way through.\n\n655\n00:30:57.888 --> 00:30:58.562\n>> Very good.\n\n656\n00:30:58.562 --> 00:31:02.817\nAnother great episode there, a look at\ndata handling requirements throughout its\n\n657\n00:31:02.817 --> 00:31:06.888\nlifetime, through creation, storage and\nthen at the end, the destruction or\n\n658\n00:31:06.888 --> 00:31:10.740\nremoval of that data and also a look\nat data in its different forms, right.\n\n659\n00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.830\nData at rest versus data in motion.\n\n660\n00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.690\nAnd it's gonna be different\nthe way we handle it.\n\n661\n00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.730\nWe might find one solution to those both,\nor we might need to handle it a little\n\n662\n00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.750\ndifferently if it's at rest\nversus when it's in motion.\n\n663\n00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:25.150\nAnd of course pop culture references,\nwe always love those, Adam.\n\n664\n00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:26.550\nSo thank you for those.\n\n665\n00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.430\n>> I try, I try.\n\n666\n00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:28.510\nIt's the socks.\n\n667\n00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.952\nIt's just all about the socks.\n\n668\n00:31:29.952 --> 00:31:33.340\n>> [LAUGH] I hope everybody enjoyed\nwatching, that's gonna do it for this one.\n\n669\n00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.740\nSigning out, oh let me tell them too,\nI forgot to let them know,\n\n670\n00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:40.250\nif you guys want to see Adam in one of\nhis classes, you want to attend one live,\n\n671\n00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:44.165\nmake sure you send us an e-mail\nat seeAdam at it.pro.tv.\n\n672\n00:31:44.165 --> 00:31:46.300\nThat being said we're gonna sign off.\n\n673\n00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.640\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n674\n00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.992\n>> I'm not.\n\n675\n00:31:48.992 --> 00:31:49.991\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n676\n00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:51.349\n>> Take

00:00:19.820\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing our CISSP.\n\n4\n00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.100\nSpecifically, we're gonna be looking\nat secure design principles.\n\n5\n00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.090\nWe're gonna talk about implementing it and\nmanaging an engineering process\n\n6\n00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.450\nusing secure design principles, and here\nto help us with that is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.410\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.920\n>> Good, good.\n\n9\n00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.405\nI'm feeling very secure today.\n\n10\n00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:36.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sorry.\n\n11\n00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.946\n>> Hopefully engineered to be that way,\nwe'll see how that goes.\n\n12\n00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:40.840\nSo, let's talk a little\nbit about implementing and\n\n13\n00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.670\nmanaging an engineering life cycle using\nsecurity design principles, which if you\n\n14\n00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.700\ncould say three times quickly without\nscrewing up you get a gold star for it.\n\n15\n00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.470\nSo systems engineering models and\n\n16\n00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.840\nprocesses is really what\nwe're talking about.\n\n17\n00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.600\nWhen we think about systems engineering,\nwe're thinking about stepping back and\n\n18\n00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.160\nlooking at a slightly different\nperspective than the CISSP,\n\n19\n00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.880\nit's really taken and\nthought about up until now.\n\n20\n00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.250\nWhen I say up until now, what I mean\nis not just in our episodes and\n\n21\n00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.720\nour conversations until now, but\nactually as a refocusing and\n\n22\n00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.470\na repurposing of the thought\nprocess of the CISSP holistically.\n\n23\n00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.960\nThe rebranding of the CISSP in terms of\nthe changing of the number of domains, and\n\n24\n00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.610\nthe information in those domains\nthat occurred in early 2015,\n\n25\n00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.050\nin April of 2015,\nreally changed several things.\n\n26\n00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.470\nA lot of things stayed the same.\n\n27\n00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.130\nWe went from ten domains down to eight.\n\n28\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.420\nWhat we called the bodies of knowledge or\nthe common bodies of knowledge.\n\n29\n00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.540\nDomains are what we\ngenerically refer to them as.\n\n30\n00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.170\nWe went from ten to eight.\n\n31\n00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.600\nAll the information that was originally\nin the ten domains is still in the eight\n\n32\n00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.226\ndomains in one form or another,\nre-purposed, moved around,\n\n33\n00:01:45.226 --> 00:01:46.850\nshuffled if you will.\n\n34\n00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.320\nBut we've also added an entire\ndiscussion area on systems engineering.\n\n35\n00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.360\nWe've incorporated some of the things,\nsuch as cryptography,\n\n36\n00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.540\nthat were stand-alone domains before,\ninto this domain.\n\n37\n00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.200\nSo we've now just simply\ntaken cryptography,\n\n38\n00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.130\ninstead of having it stand on its own,\nwe've incorporated it up into this domain.\n\n39\n00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.700\nWell, we've added new material with\nregards to systems engineering,\n\n40\n00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.570\nan area that the CISSP should be familiar\nwith, should have knowledge of and\n\n41\n00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.350\nshould be, at least at some level, able\nto apply in terms of the principles and\n\n42\n00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.060\nthe design guidelines that systems\nengineering will bring to the table for\n\n43\n00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.450\nus to think about when we add security\nto the systems engineering piece.\n\n44\n00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.375\nAnd there is some interesting work being\ndone in the space both in the ISO area and\n\n45\n00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:33.495\nin the NIST area in terms of developing\nstandards, we'll talk about some of them.\n\n46\n00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:35.486\nThe ISO 15288 standard, and\n\n47\n00:02:35.486 --> 00:02:40.230\nthe NIST standard that is also supporting\nsecurity-based system engineering.\n\n48\n00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.870\nSo we'll mention some of those and\nsome of the others that exist out there.\n\n49\n00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.279\nBut the beginning of our\ndiscussion in this domain\n\n50\n00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.510\nis really gonna take the approach of what\ndoes it mean to be a systems engineer?\n\n51\n00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.900\nWhat is that thought process?\n\n52\n00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.470\nWhat are the design elements?\n\n53\n00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.620\nWhat are we doing?\n\n54\n00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.710\nAre we really becoming an architect?\n\n55\n00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.510\nAre we really becoming somebody\nwho's building things?\n\n56\n00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.780\nAre we an electrical engineer?\n\n57\n00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.280\nI get that question sometimes.\n\n58\n00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.970\nI have to be an electrical\nengineer now to be a CISSP,\n\n59\n00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.190\nabsolutely not unless you want to be.\n\n60\n00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.830\nBut what you need to understand\nis that there's a bigger,\n\n61\n00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.510\nbroader world out there than simply just\nthe nuts and bolts of access control and\n\n62\n00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.250\nthe nuts and bolts of making\nsure that data is classified and\n\n63\n00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.860\nthat we manage assets and\nhave documentation for everything.\n\n64\n00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.990\nWe need to have a lot more in terms of the\ndepth of the conversations around how we\n\n65\n00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.150\nbuild secure systems to make sure that\nas we architect, as we design and\n\n66\n00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.765\nwe think through and\n\n67\n00:03:31.765 --> 00:03:36.395\nultimately implement the designs that\nare what we call enterprise architecture.\n\n68\n00:03:36.395 --> 00:03:39.640\nThe designs that build out entire\nsystems for us to work with\n\n69\n00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.870\nthat we're always thinking about\nsecurity and we're bolting security on.\n\n70\n00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.590\nAnd we're adding security into the mix and\nall those conversations.\n\n71\n00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.430\nThat's truly what the security systems\nengineering perspective is all about and\n\n72\n00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.900\nthat's the thought process\nwe're gonna examine here for\n\n73\n00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.890\na few minutes as we\nbegin our conversation.\n\n74\n00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.465\nSo when you think about systems\nengineering models and processes,\n\n75\n00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:01.861\nwe think about the ISO standard,\nthe ISO 15288 standard.\n\n76\n00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:04.160\nWe're gonna take a look at\nthat quickly on the web.\n\n77\n00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.310\nSo we're gonna put that up for you, in\njust a minute we'll be able to see that.\n\n78\n00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.440\nWhat you'll see there, and\nMike will be able to zoom in I'm sure for\n\n79\n00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.820\nus there in just a moment.\n\n80\n00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.108\nWhat we're looking at, not quite\nthat much, but there we go, good.\n\n81\n00:04:14.108 --> 00:04:16.280\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> This is live, after all, remember.\n\n82\n00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.530\nRight up to the top of the screen.\n\n83\n00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.264\nSo what you'll see there, it's actually\ngo right to the top, actually.\n\n84\n00:04:21.264 --> 00:04:24.500\nWhoops, stop, I want them to see\nthe ISO logo, see that it's a website.\n\n85\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.370\nSo what you're looking\nat is the ISO store.\n\n86\n00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.510\nThe ISO store is gonna be where you can go\nto buy and get access to ISO standards.\n\n87\n00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.890\nNow what you need to understand is\nthat almost every ISO standard,\n\n88\n00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.850\nthere are a small handful that\ndon't require you to purchase,\n\n89\n00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.510\nbut almost without exception all of them\nare going to require that you spend money.\n\n90\n00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.860\nThis one is probably just over $200 US,\nI think.\n\n91\n00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.780\nAnd so if you wanted to get access to\nthe 15288:2015 standard you're gonna\n\n92\n00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.220\nhave to spend some money.\n\n93\n00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.940\nNow let me clear about this.\n\n94\n00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.450\nNo, actually stay right there,\ngo right back up, stay right there.\n\n95\n00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.200\nPerfect.\n\n96\n00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.340\nSo what we're gonna see is that I'm not\nworried about how much it costs and\n\n97\n00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.280\nthe fact that you can buy it.\n\n98\n00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.240\nWhat I want you to see\nis a couple of things.\n\n99\n00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.367\nFirst of all I want you to notice\nthe naming convention, ISO/IEC/IEEE.\n\n100\n00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:14.867\nISO, the International Standards\nOrganization, is what ISO stands for.\n\n101\n00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:19.663\nIt's gonna be able to provide to\nus general guidance that is going\n\n102\n00:05:19.663 --> 00:05:23.771\nto be stitched together by\nan agreement by a committee.\n\n103\n00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:28.997\nAnd the working groups in the ISO area are\ngonna be assigned a certain grouping or\n\n104\n00:05:28.997 --> 00:05:33.070\na certain functionality that\nthey have to engage around.\n\n105\n00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.290\nThis one, the 15288 standard,\nis all about systems and\n\n106\n00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.660\nsoftware engineering, system life cycle\nprocesses, that's the official title.\n\n107\n00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.670\nSo the 15288 number is the designation\nof the working group standard.\n\n108\n00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.389\nAnd then the colon and the year is\nthe reference to when the standard was\n\n109\n00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.101\nactually formally passed out and\nmade available,\n\n110\n00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:56.102\nwhich means that 15288:2015 is the 2015\nversion of the 15288 standard.\n\n111\n00:05:56.102 --> 00:05:59.060\nThere was an earlier 2008\nversion of that standard, but\n\n112\n00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.150\nthat's been replaced by the 2015 version.\n\n113\n00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.330\nYou'll notice, off to the right,\nunderneath the name,\n\n114\n00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.700\ndirectly across horizontally from\nAbstract, there is a Preview button.\n\n115\n00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.170\nAnd if you were to click on the Preview\nbutton, and Mike will do that for us,\n\n116\n00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.860\nit'll take us out there real quick,\nit opens a separate page,\n\n117\n00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.140\nit'll take just a minute to load.\n\n118\n00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.830\nAnd what we're gonna see is that you can\nactually preview the standard online\n\n119\n00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.870\nfor free.\n\n120\n00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.740\nBut Preview is not exactly\nall it's cracked up to be.\n\n121\n00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:28.620\nWhat you're really getting\nis a small preview, right.\n\n122\n00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.262\nAnd what you're getting really,\nas I trip over my tongue here and\n\n123\n00:06:31.262 --> 00:06:32.545\nforget what I was about to say.\n\n124\n00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:33.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What you're really getting with\n\n125\n00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:38.080\nthe preview as Mike scrolls through it,\nis the table of contents and there's a nav\n\n126\n00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.760\nbar on the left that actually allows\nus to navigate as well, scrolling down.\n\n127\n00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.740\nBut you're really seeing just the table of\ncontents, the listing of all the material\n\n128\n00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.210\nin the standard, and the ability\nto just see what's there by page.\n\n129\n00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.080\nYou're not able to click through and\n\n130\n00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.460\nactually read any of the content when it\ngets to the hey, this is the good part,\n\n131\n00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.140\nthis is where the stuff starts, you'll see\nthat basically we stopped the preview at\n\n132\n00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.320\nthat point and you're invited to spend\nsome money and click the buy button.\n\n133\n00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.270\nSo just understand that\nyou would have to buy and\n\n134\n00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.990\npay money to get access to these\nstandards, unless your company\n\n135\n00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.335\nalready has them or you know\nsomebody that can give them to you.\n\n136\n00:07:09.335 --> 00:07:11.455\nI want to be clear and\nI've said this before,\n\n137\n00:07:11.455 --> 00:07:14.105\nin several areas as we've\nshown you ISO standards.\n\n138\n00:07:14.105 --> 00:07:17.505\nYou don't need to actually read\nthe standard in order to be prepared for\n\n139\n00:07:17.505 --> 00:07:21.495\nthe information necessary to take and\npass the CISSP exam.\n\n140\n00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:23.425\nWe're just simply showing\nyou how to go out and\n\n141\n00:07:23.425 --> 00:07:27.675\nfind the standards if you want to follow\nup and read up more about them later.\n\n142\n00:07:27.675 --> 00:07:30.350\nObviously, you can now go out and\nfigure out how to do that.\n\n143\n00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:31.340\nSo this is really just for\n\n144\n00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.030\ninformation purposes in other words,\nto make sure you're comfortable with that.\n\n145\n00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.612\nSo the ISO, if we could go back to the\nfirst webpage or Mike, not the preview but\n\n146\n00:07:38.612 --> 00:07:39.988\nthe actual one that lists it.\n\n147\n00:07:39.988 --> 00:07:43.662\nSo the other thing that's nice is that\nit provides an abstract, which is like\n\n148\n00:07:43.662 --> 00:07:47.221\na typically a two or three paragraph\nsummary of what the standard covers and\n\n149\n00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:50.949\nit gives you a little detail as to what\nthe standard is designed to focus on, and\n\n150\n00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:54.423\nyou could see that there, along with\ninformation on the working group.\n\n151\n00:07:54.423 --> 00:07:55.643\nYou can see information about it.\n\n152\n00:07:55.643 --> 00:07:58.009\nHow big the standard is, 108 pages.\n\n153\n00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:01.910\nWhat stage it's in, you can look at\nthe calendar to track the actual stages of\n\n154\n00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:05.228\nthe standard when it's being released,\nthings of that nature.\n\n155\n00:08:05.228 --> 00:08:07.829\nSo there's a lot of useful information\nthat you can find there, so\n\n156\n00:08:07.829 --> 00:08:09.647\nit's definitely something\nto take a look at.\n\n157\n00:08:09.647 --> 00:08:12.849\nSo when we think about\nthe ISO 15288 standard,\n\n158\n00:08:12.849 --> 00:08:15.467\nwhat we think about is\nthe ability to look at\n\n159\n00:08:15.467 --> 00:08:20.129\nsystems engineering standards that\nhave been created internationally and\n\n160\n00:08:20.129 --> 00:08:24.451\nare gonna be used to drive systems\nengineering throughout the globe.\n\n161\n00:08:24.451 --> 00:08:25.772\nIn other words, in theory,\n\n162\n00:08:25.772 --> 00:08:29.408\nanyone who wants to use the ISO standards\nto engage in systems engineering will\n\n163\n00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:32.160\nbuy a copy of that and\nuse the guidance in there to develop and\n\n164\n00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.653\ndesign their systems engineering\nprocesses and alignment accordingly.\n\n165\n00:08:35.653 --> 00:08:39.365\nThere are four key categories,\nfour key lifecycle stages or\n\n166\n00:08:39.365 --> 00:08:41.856\ncategories the ISO standard speaks to.\n\n167\n00:08:41.856 --> 00:08:45.407\nAgreement, organizational\nproject enabling,\n\n168\n00:08:45.407 --> 00:08:49.726\ntechnical management and\nthe idea of the technical design.\n\n169\n00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:53.955\nAnd so we're thinking about the\noverarching categories of what it is to\n\n170\n00:08:53.955 --> 00:08:57.632\ncreate a systems engineering solution and\nbuild the system.\n\n171\n00:08:57.632 --> 00:09:02.280\nNow systems engineering, to be clear,\nin the ISO standard is about building\n\n172\n00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.073\nsecure designs or secure systems or\nsoftware engineering principles into your\n\n173\n00:09:07.073 --> 00:09:11.813\ndevelopment model, but it doesn't speak\ndirectly to security in the title.\n\n174\n00:09:11.813 --> 00:09:13.601\nWe definitely focus on engineering.\n\n175\n00:09:13.601 --> 00:09:17.316\nWe focus on system design,\nSDLC or software design.\n\n176\n00:09:17.316 --> 00:09:21.239\nAlso SDLC, but\nwe add the security piece in.\n\n177\n00:09:21.239 --> 00:09:24.503\nIt is not only discussed in\npassing in the standard, but\n\n178\n00:09:24.503 --> 00:09:27.985\nit's up to the CISSP to bring\nthat to the table and add it in.\n\n179\n00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:31.468\nSo we're gonna add some additional\nthings when we wanna add security into\n\n180\n00:09:31.468 --> 00:09:34.501\noverarching good system or\nsoftware design to make it secure and\n\n181\n00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:37.815\nthere will be additional thoughts that\nwe have to bring to the table and\n\n182\n00:09:37.815 --> 00:09:39.351\nthink about in order to do that.\n\n183\n00:09:39.351 --> 00:09:43.318\nIf we could take a look at one of\nthe models that helps us to do that,\n\n184\n00:09:43.318 --> 00:09:46.364\nwe would choose as system engineers or\nas CISSPs.\n\n185\n00:09:46.364 --> 00:09:50.620\nWe'd wanna take a look at the V model and\nmaking sure that the V model is, and\n\n186\n00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.065\nthis is an example of a systems\nengineering model that is very\n\n187\n00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:57.129\npopular in the system\nengineering discussion area.\n\n188\n00:09:57.129 --> 00:10:01.359\nAnd the V model name because,\nobviously, takes a shape of a V.\n\n189\n00:10:01.359 --> 00:10:05.436\nBut more importantly, the idea behind\nthe V model as you can see is that as we\n\n190\n00:10:05.436 --> 00:10:09.579\nlook at the left, we will see that\nthe activities is on the left-hand side of\n\n191\n00:10:09.579 --> 00:10:12.212\nthe V are gonna be labeled\nproject definition.\n\n192\n00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:14.568\nThere's an arrow moving\nfrom top to bottom,\n\n193\n00:10:14.568 --> 00:10:18.164\nthat moves down to concept of\noperations that's typically referred\n\n194\n00:10:18.164 --> 00:10:22.132\nto as the CONOPS in the language of\nsystem of engineering, requirements and\n\n195\n00:10:22.132 --> 00:10:26.291\nArchitecture into Detailed Design,\nthat's all Project Definition of work.\n\n196\n00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:29.228\nThen at the bottom,\nwe have a yellow Implementation.\n\n197\n00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:33.603\nThat is going to be a time arrow that\nmoves through the bottom and then up on\n\n198\n00:10:33.603 --> 00:10:38.776\nthe right-hand side, integration testing\nor Integration Testing Verification,\n\n199\n00:10:38.776 --> 00:10:42.977\nSystem Verification and Validation,\nOperation and maintenance.\n\n200\n00:10:42.977 --> 00:10:45.890\nThose are all activities labeled on\nthe right with Project Testing and\n\n201\n00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:46.540\nIntegration.\n\n202\n00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.842\nSo those are activities that are allow\nus to engage in Project Testing and\n\n203\n00:10:50.842 --> 00:10:55.709\nIntegration capabilities or activities and\nthen you will see moving from right to\n\n204\n00:10:55.709 --> 00:11:00.080\nleft across the top of the diagram in\nyellow is an arrow, Verification and\n\n205\n00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.952\nvalidation.\n\n206\n00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:04.958\nWhat's called V and V activities within\nthe system engineering discussion.\n\n207\n00:11:04.958 --> 00:11:10.538\nSo the V model helps us lay out\nwhat we do to define a project,\n\n208\n00:11:10.538 --> 00:11:14.895\nimplement through a schedule and\nthen test and\n\n209\n00:11:14.895 --> 00:11:18.262\nverify and create the capability.\n\n210\n00:11:18.262 --> 00:11:22.412\nMapping that we need to have to ensure\nthat all the things we've designed\n\n211\n00:11:22.412 --> 00:11:26.429\nare actually gonna be implemented\nproperly through Verification and\n\n212\n00:11:26.429 --> 00:11:28.212\nValidation in order to build.\n\n213\n00:11:28.212 --> 00:11:31.375\nAnd then ultimately, manage and\ndeploy a system that goes in\n\n214\n00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:34.663\noperation that is aligned with\nnot only the requirements, but\n\n215\n00:11:34.663 --> 00:11:37.968\nalso the security needs of\nthe system that we have spec'd out.\n\n216\n00:11:37.968 --> 00:11:42.186\nIn fact, we sat with out stakeholders and\nsaid in requirements in architecture, hey,\n\n217\n00:11:42.186 --> 00:11:45.834\nthis is what we need we've agreed and\nnow we're gonna go out and build that,\n\n218\n00:11:45.834 --> 00:11:49.596\nimplement it, test it and validate it,\noperate and maintain it and verify and\n\n219\n00:11:49.596 --> 00:11:53.643\nvalidate that what we're doing is actually\nwhat the stakeholders had additionally\n\n220\n00:11:53.643 --> 00:11:54.845\ndecided that we needed.\n\n221\n00:11:54.845 --> 00:11:59.151\nSo the V model is a very great way for us\nto visualize how systems engineering and\n\n222\n00:11:59.151 --> 00:12:01.510\nall the phases of it\nkind of come together.\n\n223\n00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.728\nSo that's what we're seeing\nhere with one model or\n\n224\n00:12:03.728 --> 00:12:05.956\nat least an example of one\nmodel such as the V model.\n\n225\n00:12:05.956 --> 00:12:09.604\nNow you may have heard of other models\nthat are involved with SDLC, system or\n\n226\n00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:11.373\nsoftware development life cycles.\n\n227\n00:12:11.373 --> 00:12:13.289\nYou may have heard of the waterfall model.\n\n228\n00:12:13.289 --> 00:12:16.604\nYou may have heard of the spiral model or\nthe iterative model,\n\n229\n00:12:16.604 --> 00:12:18.977\nit's sometimes referred to differently.\n\n230\n00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:23.418\nYou may have heard of methodologies\nlike agile scrum or rad or jad,\n\n231\n00:12:23.418 --> 00:12:26.050\nrapid application development.\n\n232\n00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:28.190\nYou may have heard of\nthese kind of models.\n\n233\n00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.490\nSo there are different frameworks and\nmodels out there and\n\n234\n00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:34.470\nmany of them are well-known, but some of\nthem are specific to a certain area or\n\n235\n00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:37.520\nfocus and the V model is\nspecific to system engineering,\n\n236\n00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.530\njust as one example to show you.\n\n237\n00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.785\nSo when we think about key system\nengineering, technical processes and\n\n238\n00:12:42.785 --> 00:12:44.128\nwhat's involved with them.\n\n239\n00:12:44.128 --> 00:12:47.515\nWe are, as we saw in the V model gonna\nthink about thinks like requirements\n\n240\n00:12:47.515 --> 00:12:51.070\ndefinition, requirements analysis,\nwe're gonna talk to stakeholders,\n\n241\n00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.235\nfind out what they need.\n\n242\n00:12:52.235 --> 00:12:54.991\nWhen I asked Mike in one of our\nfirst episodes together, hey,\n\n243\n00:12:54.991 --> 00:12:58.013\nwhat's going to be the requirement\nthat you have to build a system or\n\n244\n00:12:58.013 --> 00:13:01.315\nwhat sort of requirement or problem\nthat you have that you wanna address.\n\n245\n00:13:01.315 --> 00:13:05.804\nMike told me I wanna make sure keep people\nthat aren't authorized to see content\n\n246\n00:13:05.804 --> 00:13:07.214\nin the ITProTV library.\n\n247\n00:13:07.214 --> 00:13:10.581\nWe keep them out of there, we only wanna\nmake sure authorized people get in there.\n\n248\n00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:14.313\nSo I've asked him and he's worked with me\nto figure out what the requirements are,\n\n249\n00:13:14.313 --> 00:13:15.340\nwe've defined them.\n\n250\n00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:19.162\nI said, we would take that to the next\nlevel and we would do some analysis on it.\n\n251\n00:13:19.162 --> 00:13:21.694\nBreak it down a little,\nbecause it was a little high level.\n\n252\n00:13:21.694 --> 00:13:23.785\nWhat do we mean by authorized users?\n\n253\n00:13:23.785 --> 00:13:26.105\nWhat do we mean by non-authorized users?\n\n254\n00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:27.649\nHow do we grant access?\n\n255\n00:13:27.649 --> 00:13:29.065\nWhat does access actually mean?\n\n256\n00:13:29.065 --> 00:13:30.551\nDoes it mean over the web?\n\n257\n00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:33.141\nDoes it mean that they can download\nvideos and watch them later?\n\n258\n00:13:33.141 --> 00:13:36.229\nDoes it mean that they may be able\nto get a transcript of the video?\n\n259\n00:13:36.229 --> 00:13:39.541\nThere's all these different things\nthat levels of access may imply.\n\n260\n00:13:39.541 --> 00:13:41.443\nSo we need to understand\nthat a little bit more.\n\n261\n00:13:41.443 --> 00:13:43.776\nWe would walk-through that definition and\n\n262\n00:13:43.776 --> 00:13:47.122\nanalysis solution at some of\nthe steps in system engineering.\n\n263\n00:13:47.122 --> 00:13:51.548\nWe'd also look at architectural design,\nhow would we then go out and actually\n\n264\n00:13:51.548 --> 00:13:55.857\nstart to draft a schematic, if you will,\na plan for what that may look like.\n\n265\n00:13:55.857 --> 00:14:00.720\nDoes it look like a complicated\nsystem that has to be managed in\n\n266\n00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.348\nmodular componentized format?\n\n267\n00:14:03.348 --> 00:14:06.637\nDoesn't look like a very simple\nsystem that may just have on or\n\n268\n00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:08.479\ntwo entry points and exit points?\n\n269\n00:14:08.479 --> 00:14:10.097\nWe don't know,\nwe've gotta start sketching that out and\n\n270\n00:14:10.097 --> 00:14:10.997\nthinking about what it will be.\n\n271\n00:14:10.997 --> 00:14:13.933\nWe have to think about then\nimplementation, integration and\n\n272\n00:14:13.933 --> 00:14:15.744\nverification as well as validation.\n\n273\n00:14:15.744 --> 00:14:18.914\nThese are all activity phases\nthat we will go through.\n\n274\n00:14:18.914 --> 00:14:22.573\nImplementation is all about making sure\nthat we are building everything and\n\n275\n00:14:22.573 --> 00:14:26.004\nthen integration is about making sure\nwe bring everything together and\n\n276\n00:14:26.004 --> 00:14:29.909\nthat it works together, because you wanna\nbuild different parts of the system.\n\n277\n00:14:29.909 --> 00:14:34.835\nThat's gonna be the idea of modular\ndesign and modular component management.\n\n278\n00:14:34.835 --> 00:14:37.358\nWe're then gonna integrate,\nwe're gonna put them together,\n\n279\n00:14:37.358 --> 00:14:40.314\nmake sure that they effectively fit\ntogether and that they work together.\n\n280\n00:14:40.314 --> 00:14:44.738\nNow we have to verify and validate that\nthat integration has happened properly at\n\n281\n00:14:44.738 --> 00:14:46.830\nthe system level, at the unit level.\n\n282\n00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:49.454\nSo we're gonna talk about different\nlevels of verification and validation.\n\n283\n00:14:49.454 --> 00:14:52.193\nAnd ultimately then,\nwe're gonna think about transitioning.\n\n284\n00:14:52.193 --> 00:14:56.189\nGoing into live operation and\nmaintaining that system over time and so\n\n285\n00:14:56.189 --> 00:15:00.873\nthis is gonna be the kind of thing that we\nhave to be thinking about and deciding on.\n\n286\n00:15:00.873 --> 00:15:04.105\nAs we begin to go down the road of system\nengineering, we have to lay out all\n\n287\n00:15:04.105 --> 00:15:07.516\nthe thought processes around these areas\nand understand how to manage them.\n\n288\n00:15:07.516 --> 00:15:11.210\nBecause we don't wanna get into the middle\nof this conversation after we've asked\n\n289\n00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.064\nMike, hey, what are the requirements?\n\n290\n00:15:13.064 --> 00:15:16.641\nWe've analyzed them or we've laid\nout a design, Mike's approved it.\n\n291\n00:15:16.641 --> 00:15:20.276\nWe don't wanna then go build something and\nfind out that Mike has changed his mind.\n\n292\n00:15:20.276 --> 00:15:24.084\nWe also don't wanna go build something,\nintegrate it all, set it all up,\n\n293\n00:15:24.084 --> 00:15:27.299\nverify it and then find out we\nleft out an important component.\n\n294\n00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:30.978\nEither because Mike didn't tell us or\nhe did, but maybe it didn't make it into\n\n295\n00:15:30.978 --> 00:15:34.068\nthe design or maybe it did, but\nwe didn't build it the right way.\n\n296\n00:15:34.068 --> 00:15:36.244\nThere's lots of reasons\nwhy that could happen.\n\n297\n00:15:36.244 --> 00:15:40.800\nHowever, that does happen, we gotta\nmake sure we're constantly referring to\n\n298\n00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.045\nthe requirements in the design plan and\n\n299\n00:15:43.045 --> 00:15:46.457\nwe're building what we often\nrefer to as building to spec.\n\n300\n00:15:46.457 --> 00:15:50.117\nWe're gonna build to the specification\nrequirements that the shareholder or\n\n301\n00:15:50.117 --> 00:15:53.111\nstakeholder has given us and\nthen we're gonna validate that And\n\n302\n00:15:53.111 --> 00:15:56.562\nmultiple steps along the way to insure\nthat we're doing the right thing.\n\n303\n00:15:56.562 --> 00:15:58.938\nNobody wants to get to the end\nof that bill process and\n\n304\n00:15:58.938 --> 00:16:01.746\nfind out that you're missing\nan entire functional element or\n\n305\n00:16:01.746 --> 00:16:04.560\nsome sort of functional\nrequirement was overlooked.\n\n306\n00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:07.080\nBecause that's gonna lead to\nall sorts of complications and\n\n307\n00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.750\ncan lead to very expensive delays.\n\n308\n00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.050\nSo that's gonna be something\nto think about as well.\n\n309\n00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:14.390\nSecuring information and systems, in\nother words, when we think about systems\n\n310\n00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:18.640\nengineering, is really as much about\nthe people as it is about the technology.\n\n311\n00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.790\nAnd the operational aspects\nof how the two interact.\n\n312\n00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.840\nAnd we wanna make sure we're thinking\nabout all those things together\n\n313\n00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.160\nas we're thinking about how to engage in\nthis dialogue around systems engineering.\n\n314\n00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.960\nSome of the things that we wanna be\nfocused on with regard to system\n\n315\n00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.800\nengineering are broader and are out beyond\njust the ISO conversation and the V model.\n\n316\n00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.360\nThere's other guidance out there,\nin other words, so\n\n317\n00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.840\nwe may want to think about as well.\n\n318\n00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.070\nWe have to think about the generally\naccredited or generally accepted\n\n319\n00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.050\nprinciples and practices for\nsecuring information technology systems.\n\n320\n00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:48.020\nWe'll find this in one of\nthe NIST documents, and\n\n321\n00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.350\nwe've shown you how to find\nthis documents before.\n\n322\n00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:52.970\nWe're not gonna take you back out there\nright now, we've done that several times.\n\n323\n00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.860\nBut just reminding you of the fact\nthat we've gone to the NIST website,\n\n324\n00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.030\ntaken a look at that.\n\n325\n00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:02.460\nNIST SP800-14 specifically is the standard\nwe'd want to be thinking about here.\n\n326\n00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.990\nIt is gonna be the foundation that we\ntypically build on in terms of providing\n\n327\n00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:11.430\ninformation, technology security programs\nand they way in which we can implement and\n\n328\n00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:12.650\nthink through those.\n\n329\n00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.680\nThe document, if you go and\ntake a look at it, has eight principles,\n\n330\n00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.990\neight guiding principles and\n14 practices that when taken together,\n\n331\n00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.420\nform a very significant baseline or\nfoundation for us to build off of\n\n332\n00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.110\nin order to be able to create information\ntechnology security solutions.\n\n333\n00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:30.040\nSo, want to be thinking about that.\n\n334\n00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.710\nThere's also the common criteria.\n\n335\n00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:35.040\nWe want to go take a look at the common\ncriteria, we're gonna go out and\n\n336\n00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.220\nactually take a look at the website.\n\n337\n00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:40.210\nYou can see it up on the screen in\nfront of you through the magic of\n\n338\n00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.390\nteamwork here and the magic of being\nable to switch to a web browser.\n\n339\n00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:46.600\nWe're gonna show you what's called\nthe Common Criteria Portal.\n\n340\n00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.890\nThe Common Criteria is also\nactually an ISO standard.\n\n341\n00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.479\nThe ISO name or\nthe ISO reference number for\n\n342\n00:17:53.479 --> 00:17:57.776\nthe Common Criteria is 15408, 15408.\n\n343\n00:17:57.776 --> 00:18:02.683\nAnd the ISO standard that equals\nthe Common Criteria has been around for\n\n344\n00:18:02.683 --> 00:18:03.730\nsome time.\n\n345\n00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:07.430\nThe Common Criteria has a very\ninteresting and kind of colorful history.\n\n346\n00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:11.720\nIt comes to us out of several iterations\nof information security architectures.\n\n347\n00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.595\nWe'll talk a little bit more about some of\nthem as we go a little bit later on into\n\n348\n00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:19.356\nthe discussions or into some of the other\nepisodes that are gonna come up with\n\n349\n00:18:19.356 --> 00:18:23.295\nregards to systems engineering or you'll\nhear me talk about the orange book and\n\n350\n00:18:23.295 --> 00:18:24.869\nsomething known as the TCSEC.\n\n351\n00:18:24.869 --> 00:18:28.376\nAnd you'll hear me talk about\nsomething known as the ITSEC and\n\n352\n00:18:28.376 --> 00:18:31.420\nthen ultimately we get\ninto the Common Criteria.\n\n353\n00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:35.090\nThat's the third generation of that\ninformation security architecture and\n\n354\n00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.660\ninformation security thought process,\n\n355\n00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.790\nwhich is the one that\nwe currently use today.\n\n356\n00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:41.550\nThe others are a little bit older,\nreally not used much anymore.\n\n357\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.800\nWe'll talk about them as\nhistorical footnotes.\n\n358\n00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.810\nBut the Common Criteria is gonna allow\nus to document security requirements,\n\n359\n00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:48.390\ndocument and\n\n360\n00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.400\nvalidate security capabilities, and\npromote international cooperation.\n\n361\n00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.570\nWe should all join hands and sing Kumbaya.\n\n362\n00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.440\nAnd international cooperation\nin the area of IT security.\n\n363\n00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.870\nWhat it really is designed to do is\nallow vendors to submit their solution,\n\n364\n00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:07.920\nwhether it is an individual piece\nof equipment or an entire system\n\n365\n00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.940\nwith regards to things like SEM\nsolutions or, perhaps, an information\n\n366\n00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:18.270\nsecurity management software package,\na firewall, whatever it may be.\n\n367\n00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:23.590\nThe vendor is gonna submit that product\nto the Common Criteria testing regime.\n\n368\n00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.670\nThe Common Criteria testing regime\nis run by independent laboratories\n\n369\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.760\naround the world.\n\n370\n00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.440\nThey are then, the vendor's gonna pay for\n\n371\n00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.300\nthe process to get the actual\nproduct certified.\n\n372\n00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.060\nAnd they're gonna specify what the\ncapabilities and what the requirements for\n\n373\n00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.610\nusage of that system are.\n\n374\n00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:43.250\nAnd as a result of that,\nonce they get certified or the product is\n\n375\n00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:48.060\ncertified in the Common Criteria, it's\ngiven a certain level of certification.\n\n376\n00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.440\nAnd we'll talk about what those\nlevels are a little bit later.\n\n377\n00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.540\nWe're not gonna get into them now,\n\n378\n00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.060\nbut you'll see that they\nare gonna be referred to as EALs.\n\n379\n00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.390\nAnd we'll talk about what those are and\n\n380\n00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.330\nthey go from level one\nthrough level seven.\n\n381\n00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:00.738\nAnd we'll talk about it and\nshow them to you in a later episode and\n\n382\n00:20:00.738 --> 00:20:02.894\nexplain to you what they are and\nwhy they're important.\n\n383\n00:20:02.894 --> 00:20:07.394\nBut as we go up the chain what we're\neffectively gonna see is we go from EL1\n\n384\n00:20:07.394 --> 00:20:09.680\nall the way down to EL7.\n\n385\n00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.240\nWe get more secure,\nwe get more verification of design\n\n386\n00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.920\nin the Common Criteria and as a result of\nthat a product that's certified at EAL\n\n387\n00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:20.780\nlevel one is kind of an entry\nlevel product, right?\n\n388\n00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:26.080\nA product that's certified at EAL level\nfive is gonna be not just more secure but\n\n389\n00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.210\nit's gonna actually have specific criteria\nassociated with it to make it more secure.\n\n390\n00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.400\nWith regards to how\nthe product is designed.\n\n391\n00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.400\nNow we verify and validate that design,\nand that's really what the Common Criteria\n\n392\n00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.930\nprocess is all about, is that verification\nand validation of the claims that\n\n393\n00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.600\nthe vendor is making with regards to the\nsecurity capabilities of their product.\n\n394\n00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:50.520\nSo remember, 154 right, the ISO standard\nfor the common criteria, 15408.\n\n395\n00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.680\nWant to just make sure\nyou know what that is.\n\n396\n00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.950\nWe also want to think about\na document like NIST SP 800-27.\n\n397\n00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:01.320\nThis is going to allow us to be able to\nunderstand how to create the security\n\n398\n00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.330\nbaseline, so we often need to be able to\nbuild in order to start out from a certain\n\n399\n00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:10.272\nposition, and then engineer security\ninto our discussions everywhere we go.\n\n400\n00:21:10.272 --> 00:21:15.130\nThe NIST document talks about five\nlife-cycle planning phases specifically\n\n401\n00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.730\nfor the engineering of system security.\n\n402\n00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:22.090\nInitiation, development acquisition,\nimplementation, operation and\n\n403\n00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.460\nmaintenance, and disposal.\n\n404\n00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.260\nYou should have heard these before,\nthey should sound familiar to you.\n\n405\n00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.980\nWe've talked about this exact thought\nprocess, this exact life-cycle,\n\n406\n00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:34.180\nwith regards to several conversations\nwe've had in prior episode.\n\n407\n00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.350\nThis is not, in other words,\n\n408\n00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.650\nthe first time I've mentioned\nThis five life cycle phase.\n\n409\n00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.350\nAnd not the first time I've\nmentioned them in this exact order.\n\n410\n00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:46.080\nSo initiation, development acquisition,\nimplementation, operation, and\n\n411\n00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.910\nmaintenance, and finally disposal.\n\n412\n00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.920\nWe've talked about these\nfive phases in one form or\n\n413\n00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.960\nanother across several different\nconversations and other words.\n\n414\n00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.570\nAnd they actually come to us\nfrom this 800 27 rev a or\n\n415\n00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:59.420\nrevision a which is where\nthose actually are found.\n\n416\n00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:00.907\nWhen we think about secure architectures,\n\n417\n00:22:00.907 --> 00:22:03.204\nwe want to think about the characteristics\nthat often make them up.\n\n418\n00:22:03.204 --> 00:22:05.922\nWe want to think about the fact\nthat there should be some sort of\n\n419\n00:22:05.922 --> 00:22:08.864\nsecurity methodology associated\nwith the secure architecture.\n\n420\n00:22:08.864 --> 00:22:13.362\nThere should be some sort of view or\nviewpoint that that architecture helps us\n\n421\n00:22:13.362 --> 00:22:17.850\nto understand and therefore use and\nconsume with regards to security.\n\n422\n00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:21.760\nIf I say to you I want to build a better,\nmore secure operating system\n\n423\n00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.420\nI can't just say that, I have to\nspecify what that actually entails.\n\n424\n00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.290\nAm I gonna focus on putting\nsecurity tools into the operating\n\n425\n00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.540\nsystem that allow you to be more secure?\n\n426\n00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.390\nAm I gonna focus on trying to find any and\nall unknown bugs, and discover them in\n\n427\n00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:39.500\nthe code before I release the code to you,\nmaking the code base itself more secure?\n\n428\n00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.268\nAm I gonna reverse engineer all the\nproblems that we have today with modern\n\n429\n00:22:43.268 --> 00:22:44.378\noperating systems?\n\n430\n00:22:44.378 --> 00:22:48.300\nFigure out how to solve those, and build\nthose solutions into the operating system.\n\n431\n00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.176\nRendering all those problems obsolete\nbecause we've effectively dealt with them\n\n432\n00:22:52.176 --> 00:22:54.289\nby making the operating\nsystem more secure.\n\n433\n00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:56.469\nThere's lots of different ways\nI can take that conversation.\n\n434\n00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:01.260\nPoint is the viewpoint and the methodology\naround that has to be clear.\n\n435\n00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.800\nSo that we understand what security\narchitecture provides to us.\n\n436\n00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.950\nYou're CISSPs, we often are faced with\ndecision points with the organization\n\n437\n00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.460\nwith regards to security.\n\n438\n00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:12.370\nWe're ask to provide guidance.\n\n439\n00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:13.800\nShould I do this, should I do that?\n\n440\n00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.760\nWill the business be better\noff if I manage risk this way?\n\n441\n00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:19.220\nOr if I implement this,\nsafe guarded this counter measure?\n\n442\n00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.240\nI don't know if I'm making\nthe right decision.\n\n443\n00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:22.410\nRight, I'm not sure what to do and\n\n444\n00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.010\nI'm not quite sure when I stand at\nthe fork in the road, which way to go.\n\n445\n00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.440\nThis is what the CISSP\nstruggles with every day.\n\n446\n00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.880\nAnd if you're still sure you wanna be one,\nthen please continue watching and\n\n447\n00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.150\nfeel free to have the rest of this dialog.\n\n448\n00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:36.220\nBut if you're not, this is a good\ntime to decide, you know what?\n\n449\n00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.620\nI'd rather go do something else.\n\n450\n00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.240\nBut, you're not gonna\nbe that time of person.\n\n451\n00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:39.930\nI know you're not.\n>> That's right.\n\n452\n00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:40.851\n>> Cuz you're gonna see this through.\n\n453\n00:23:40.851 --> 00:23:44.364\nBut I'm trying to paint out an actual and\nrealistic picture for\n\n454\n00:23:44.364 --> 00:23:48.413\nyou because the reality of being a CISSP\nis not just about taking an exam.\n\n455\n00:23:48.413 --> 00:23:49.799\n>> Answering a bunch of questions and\n\n456\n00:23:49.799 --> 00:23:52.633\nthen putting a bunch of letters after\nyour name on your business card.\n\n457\n00:23:52.633 --> 00:23:55.283\nThere is that and that's a really\ngood feeling, don't get me wrong.\n\n458\n00:23:55.283 --> 00:23:56.665\nThat's very, very important.\n\n459\n00:23:56.665 --> 00:24:00.147\nIt's a big accomplishment and\nyou should celebrate that, but\n\n460\n00:24:00.147 --> 00:24:03.694\nthe hard work starts when you put\nthose letters after your name,\n\n461\n00:24:03.694 --> 00:24:08.426\nbecause then what you're expected to do\neveryday is provide authoritative guidance\n\n462\n00:24:08.426 --> 00:24:12.783\nand insightful understanding of systems\nwith regards to your organization.\n\n463\n00:24:12.783 --> 00:24:16.699\nAnd guide the organization and\nguide its people, it's processes,\n\n464\n00:24:16.699 --> 00:24:21.021\nits systems and it's information to\nthe best possible solution that you can\n\n465\n00:24:21.021 --> 00:24:22.912\nfind with regards to security and\n\n466\n00:24:22.912 --> 00:24:26.854\nthe management of confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability.\n\n467\n00:24:26.854 --> 00:24:31.184\nAnd so you're constantly on watch, you're\nconstantly on guard against threats and\n\n468\n00:24:31.184 --> 00:24:32.881\nvulnerabilities and concerns.\n\n469\n00:24:32.881 --> 00:24:34.390\nYou have too look at new information.\n\n470\n00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:35.831\nFigure out new technologies.\n\n471\n00:24:35.831 --> 00:24:37.161\nYou have to implement new policies.\n\n472\n00:24:37.161 --> 00:24:40.800\nYou have to do all these\nthings in order to be a CISSP.\n\n473\n00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.286\nAll in addition to doing all that,\nall while figuring out how to make sure\n\n474\n00:24:44.286 --> 00:24:47.544\nthe stuff you've all ready done is\nstill being done the right way and\n\n475\n00:24:47.544 --> 00:24:51.115\nthat nobody's screwed that up,\nbecause that can easily happen as well.\n\n476\n00:24:51.115 --> 00:24:55.337\nSo security architecture's are very\nimportant, because the allow us to frame\n\n477\n00:24:55.337 --> 00:24:59.495\nthe conversation with regards to how we\nare going to attempt to create a plan and\n\n478\n00:24:59.495 --> 00:25:00.829\nexecute on that vision.\n\n479\n00:25:00.829 --> 00:25:03.766\nThis is the design that we\nlay into the organization,\n\n480\n00:25:03.766 --> 00:25:06.971\neffectively overlaying security\ninto everything we do.\n\n481\n00:25:06.971 --> 00:25:10.807\nIt comes to us through what's known as\nESA, Enterprise Security Architecture and\n\n482\n00:25:10.807 --> 00:25:13.456\nthis is one of the things that\nCIS are charged with doing.\n\n483\n00:25:13.456 --> 00:25:15.290\nSo, it's a very important thought process.\n\n484\n00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.972\nWe have another ISO standard\nthat we can take a look at.\n\n485\n00:25:17.972 --> 00:25:22.559\nThis one is ISO 21827:2008,\nyou can see it there.\n\n486\n00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:25.226\nWe're gonna zoom in there just\na little bit to let you see that.\n\n487\n00:25:25.226 --> 00:25:27.261\nThis one is called the SSE-CMM or\n\n488\n00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:31.698\nthe System Security Engineering\nCapability Maturing Model standard,\n\n489\n00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:33.817\nthat's what the ISO standard is.\n\n490\n00:25:33.817 --> 00:25:38.343\nThe capability maturity model,\ngenerically when we think about capability\n\n491\n00:25:38.343 --> 00:25:42.589\nmaturity models is something that\nallows us to look at the progression or\n\n492\n00:25:42.589 --> 00:25:47.044\nthe growth of an organization over time\ngoing from one known state to another\n\n493\n00:25:47.044 --> 00:25:51.501\nthrough probably of developer designed\nstates and we get more successful,\n\n494\n00:25:51.501 --> 00:25:55.569\nmore mature, more organized with\nevery phase that we pass through.\n\n495\n00:25:55.569 --> 00:25:59.345\nThat's the generic idea behind the CMM,\na capability maturity model.\n\n496\n00:25:59.345 --> 00:26:02.735\nWhen we apply it to security or\nSystem Security Engineering,\n\n497\n00:26:02.735 --> 00:26:06.906\nwe're thinking about how we go from a less\nto a more secure state over time and\n\n498\n00:26:06.906 --> 00:26:09.143\nthe building blocks in order to do that.\n\n499\n00:26:09.143 --> 00:26:12.941\nSo we're thinking about how,\nin this case, with this ISO standard, we\n\n500\n00:26:12.941 --> 00:26:17.455\ncan apply the capability maturity thought\nprocess to System Security Engineering.\n\n501\n00:26:17.455 --> 00:26:20.992\nThat's really what the ISO\n21827 standard is all about and\n\n502\n00:26:20.992 --> 00:26:23.491\nthat's what it helps us to do, ultimately.\n\n503\n00:26:23.491 --> 00:26:27.755\n>> Well, Adam, a lot of great information\nthere, just a lot of information when it\n\n504\n00:26:27.755 --> 00:26:31.207\ncomes to implementing and\nmanaging that engineering process and\n\n505\n00:26:31.207 --> 00:26:35.475\nmaking sure we're using those good secure\ndesign principles, but a lot of great\n\n506\n00:26:35.475 --> 00:26:39.012\nreferences that we can go out and\nuse to help us get started in that.\n\n507\n00:26:39.012 --> 00:26:40.033\nSo thank you for that, Adam.\n\n508\n00:26:40.033 --> 00:26:44.663\nRemember, if you guys want to\nattend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n509\n00:26:44.663 --> 00:26:47.647\nshoot us an email at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n510\n00:26:47.647 --> 00:26:49.209\nThat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n511\n00:26:49.209 --> 00:26:50.764\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n512\n00:26:50.764 --> 00:26:53.857\n>> And I'm Adam, I'm gonna go in the back\nand tinker and design a better Mike for\n\n513\n00:26:53.857 --> 00:26:54.485\nnext episode.\n\n514\n00:26:54.485 --> 00:26:55.302\n>> Whoa.\n[LAUGH]\n\n515\n00:26:55.302 --> 00:26:56.451\n>> We'll see you soon.\n\n516\n00:26:56.451 --> 00:27:03.120\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:19.232\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing our CISSP and\n\n4\n00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:23.589\nspecifically we're gonna be looking\nat security model concepts.\n\n5\n00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.360\nAnd we got a few different\nmodels we want to go over and\n\n6\n00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.770\nhere to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:29.760\nHow ya doing Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.970\n>> I'm good.\nDid everybody bring their Lego with them?\n\n9\n00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If not if you don't have go out and\n\n10\n00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.490\nbuy a set.\n\n11\n00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.190\nWe're talking about models and\nhow to build stuff.\n\n12\n00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.660\n>> Whew.\n>> We're really not that far off\n\n13\n00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.400\nactually, right?\n\n14\n00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.910\nSo it's not going to be quite that but\nit's going to be something similar.\n\n15\n00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.890\nWhat we're going to do is talk about the\nfundamental concepts of security models.\n\n16\n00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.540\nAnd in order to start that conversation\nwe've actually got to talk\n\n17\n00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.080\nabout some of the building blocks and\ncomponents that make up the system\n\n18\n00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.900\nbefore we can talk about the entire\nmodel of what that system will be.\n\n19\n00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.110\nAnd so when we think about common system\ncomponents, we think often about memory.\n\n20\n00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.283\nThink about CPU.\n\n21\n00:00:58.283 --> 00:01:00.276\nWe think about networking.\n\n22\n00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:02.180\nWe think about storage.\n\n23\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.500\nThese are the common building blocks\nof any modern computing system.\n\n24\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.470\nSo let's start with memory.\n\n25\n00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.690\nLet's talk a little bit about.\n\n26\n00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.490\nCommon system components, and\nmemory and processing and\n\n27\n00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.110\nwhat processors do, what memory does.\n\n28\n00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.910\nWe know memory's where we store things,\nright?\n\n29\n00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.480\nSo when we have RAM inside of a system, we\nhave Random Access Memory that's dynamic.\n\n30\n00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.680\nIt's powered and based on it being\npowered, it stores things for\n\n31\n00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.260\nthe time the power is supplied.\n\n32\n00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.320\nWe have ROM, Read Only Memory,\nthat is gonna be considered to be static.\n\n33\n00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.990\nMeaning whether or not there is power\napplied to that particular memory chip.\n\n34\n00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.110\nIt will store certain information in it.\n\n35\n00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.750\nThat information typically is not\nmodified unless we use a special\n\n36\n00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.280\nprogram of some kind.\n\n37\n00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.620\nSome sort of updating program\nlike maybe a firmware updater or\n\n38\n00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.350\nsome sort of program that can burn in and\nactually write to the ROM chip.\n\n39\n00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.190\nSo we have different kinds of memory.\n\n40\n00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.520\nSame thing with processors, right?\n\n41\n00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.710\nWe have CPUs, we would call them that.\n\n42\n00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.580\nCentral Processing Unit\nis what CPU stands for.\n\n43\n00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.770\nAnd the idea behind a processor is\neffectively thinking about it being\n\n44\n00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.490\nthe brains of the computer.\n\n45\n00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.720\nIt's where the actual execution\nof activity takes place.\n\n46\n00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.150\nMemory is where we hold that information\nwhen we are actually using it.\n\n47\n00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.230\nBut the actual execution of process\nto generate data, to manipulate data,\n\n48\n00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.740\nto work with it, to change it,\n\n49\n00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.490\nto modify it in some way takes places\nthrough the actual CPU or processor or\n\n50\n00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.990\nprocessors if there's more than one\nphysical or logical within the system.\n\n51\n00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.450\nAnd so when we think about common system\ncomponents, when we think about processing\n\n52\n00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.770\nand processors, we think typically about\nforming tasks the processors engage in.\n\n53\n00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.490\nThey fetch,\nthey retrieve information from memory.\n\n54\n00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.190\nSo the fetching capability is the process\nfor getting something from memory and\n\n55\n00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.040\nthen effectively using it somewhere else,\nright?\n\n56\n00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.080\nWe talk about decoding, deciphering,\nto understand what something has\n\n57\n00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.600\na meaning to represent or\nsomething that has to be done.\n\n58\n00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.010\nSo we will decode an instruction,\n\n59\n00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.340\nto effectively decipher it to\nunderstand what has to happen with it,\n\n60\n00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.060\nbecause that instruction is typically\npresented in some sort of a language,\n\n61\n00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.460\nwhether it's machine language or\nanother kind of programming language.\n\n62\n00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.380\nAnd the system has to\neffectively translate that\n\n63\n00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.710\ninto a process that it understands,\na language that it can carry out.\n\n64\n00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.010\nWe talk about executing,\ncarrying out instructions.\n\n65\n00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.690\nWhen I execute something,\nI'm effectively carrying out an activity.\n\n66\n00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.190\nSo if I ask Mike to give me\na piece of information and\n\n67\n00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.090\ntell me what time it is right now,\nMike, however he would come up with\n\n68\n00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.050\nthat information, would relay it to me,\nhe would be executing my request, right?\n\n69\n00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.600\nHe would be effectively providing\nme with that information.\n\n70\n00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.780\nSo that's the example we would think\nof when we think about executing,\n\n71\n00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.500\nit's going out and\ncarrying out some sort of activity.\n\n72\n00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.700\nAnd then store it, we store the results of\nexecution, so that way we could use it,\n\n73\n00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.270\nand then use it drive either\nanother fetching, another decoding,\n\n74\n00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.410\nanother executing, or another some sort\nof process within the processor itself.\n\n75\n00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.470\nSo we think about fetching,\ndecoding, executing, and storing.\n\n76\n00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.400\nThese are the four distinct main tasks or\n\n77\n00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.400\nprocessor capabilities that CPUs or\nprocessors have within a system.\n\n78\n00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.520\nI want to make sure you\nknow what they are.\n\n79\n00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.760\nI want to be able to just\nexplain them to you briefly.\n\n80\n00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.790\nI gave you a sentence or two a summary of\nwhat they do, and having a good working\n\n81\n00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.360\nknowledge of that is gonna be important\nfor you as you think about preparing,\n\n82\n00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.150\nat least with regard to this information,\nanyway, preparing yourself and\n\n83\n00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.660\nstudying for this particular part\nof the CISSP body of knowledge.\n\n84\n00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.530\nWhen we think about increasing\nperformance within a system,\n\n85\n00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.460\nwe're also thinking about ways\nthat the processor itself\n\n86\n00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.640\ncan be made to work faster,\ncan be made to do more work in less time.\n\n87\n00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.960\nWe think about multitasking and\nmultithreading, traditionally.\n\n88\n00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.620\nMultitasking is the ability to be able to\ndo more than one thing at the same time.\n\n89\n00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.650\nSo I can, the classic example, right, of\nwalking and chewing gum that we often hear\n\n90\n00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.520\nabout is an idea behind multitasking or\nan example of multitasking.\n\n91\n00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.550\nWhen I walk and chew gum,\nI'm doing two things at the same time.\n\n92\n00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.860\nI may not do them well, you never wanna be\naround me when I'm doing those things cuz\n\n93\n00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.640\nI'm not quite as surefooted\nas some people are.\n\n94\n00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.750\nBut multitasking generically is\nthe idea of doing more than one\n\n95\n00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.090\nthing at the same time.\n\n96\n00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.950\nMultithreading, a little bit different,\npeople often confuse the two.\n\n97\n00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.560\nMultithreading is the idea of being able\nto execute multiple threads or process\n\n98\n00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.810\nrequests to examine and therefore execute\ninformation in the CPU at the same time.\n\n99\n00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.760\nThey could relate to a single process,\nthey could relate to multiple processes.\n\n100\n00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.980\nWe're not sure what they relate to,\nwe are just using multiple threads or\n\n101\n00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.120\nexecution requests, and carrying them\nout simultaneously within the CPU.\n\n102\n00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.490\nThat's what multithreading\nis gonna represent.\n\n103\n00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.360\nSo multithreading is the idea of\nthe processor working on more than one\n\n104\n00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.000\nrequest at the same time.\n\n105\n00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.150\nWhereas multitasking is the ability for\n\n106\n00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.110\na system to engage in more than\none activity at the same time.\n\n107\n00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.040\nIf you wanna just think about\nthe logic of summarizing that.\n\n108\n00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.030\nMike's keeping me honest here, but\noff camera he's looking at me going,\n\n109\n00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.090\nare you almost there, you got it that's\nright, just one more word, you're good.\n\n110\n00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.320\nSo make sure we know the definition and\nthe difference between those two terms,\n\n111\n00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.850\nmulti threading and multi tasking.\n\n112\n00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.100\nVery important as comparison point for\nyou.\n\n113\n00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.260\nIn addition to the four key\ntasks that processors engage in\n\n114\n00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.010\nprocessors have a lot of key\nfeatures associated with them.\n\n115\n00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.140\nA lot of modern processors\nare tamper detection, or\n\n116\n00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.720\nhave rather I meant to say tamper\nresistant, are tamper resistant, and\n\n117\n00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.160\nhave tamper detection\nswitches built into them.\n\n118\n00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.130\nSo that should can't simply go in and\nmess around with the instruction sets,\n\n119\n00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.950\nthe software that actually tells\nthe processor how to work and what to do.\n\n120\n00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.940\nSo we have built in security features and\n\n121\n00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.585\ncapabilities that prevent us from being\nable to modify those instructions.\n\n122\n00:06:24.585 --> 00:06:27.535\nWe also have crypto\nacceleration capabilities.\n\n123\n00:06:27.535 --> 00:06:31.263\nMany modern processors will have\non board crypto accelerators,\n\n124\n00:06:31.263 --> 00:06:35.204\nlittle computer chips that can\noffload cryptographic operations.\n\n125\n00:06:35.204 --> 00:06:38.246\nSo they can engage in those\nactivities while the CPU\n\n126\n00:06:38.246 --> 00:06:40.807\nfocuses on the things CPUs need to do.\n\n127\n00:06:40.807 --> 00:06:44.957\nProcessing information, fetching from\nmemory, decoding information and\n\n128\n00:06:44.957 --> 00:06:47.697\nthen storing the results of that for\nfuture use.\n\n129\n00:06:47.697 --> 00:06:51.037\nThey usually will have some sort of\nbattery backup associated with them.\n\n130\n00:06:51.037 --> 00:06:52.907\nSo we'll have a CMOS, right?\n\n131\n00:06:52.907 --> 00:06:54.550\nThe BIOS.\n\n132\n00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.590\nBattery, the CMOS battery in the system,\nso that way we can back up\n\n133\n00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.920\nthe instructions for\nthe operational components of the system.\n\n134\n00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.030\nAnd we'll also, on the CPU itself,\n\n135\n00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.950\nhave different levels of cache that we\nmay use to accelerate various things.\n\n136\n00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.670\nAnd we may back those up\nwith a battery backup, so\n\n137\n00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.100\nthat way we can keep and\nstore the information in cache, and\n\n138\n00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.180\noperate the system in different\npower states and things like that.\n\n139\n00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.145\nWe have secure boot capabilities, so\nwe typically will have some sort of\n\n140\n00:07:20.145 --> 00:07:24.230\nBIOS-based password that we can\nboot up with and securely boot up.\n\n141\n00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.360\nThis may be something like the BitLocker\ncapability in Windows, for instance,\n\n142\n00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.780\nwhich is how we implement this.\n\n143\n00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.699\nWe have a BIOS-based, or\n\n144\n00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:35.350\na low-level initialization of\nthe security-based hardware and\n\n145\n00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.060\nsoftware, so that way when you boot up\nyou have to provide a boot-on password.\n\n146\n00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.330\nOr a bootup on password.\n\n147\n00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.420\nLet me try that again.\n\n148\n00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.870\nA boot on, no, a password on boot,\nthat's what I'm trying to say backwards.\n\n149\n00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.135\nA password on boot, stop laughing at me!\n\n150\n00:07:48.135 --> 00:07:49.400\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> A password on\n\n151\n00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.520\nboot in order to be able to.\n\n152\n00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.320\nYou try standing up here and talking\nwithout a script for 30 minutes and\n\n153\n00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.410\nget everything right every time.\n\n154\n00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.410\n>> I like my side of the podium.\n\n155\n00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:56.081\n>> I know you do, right?\n\n156\n00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:59.713\nSo a password on boot is what I'm trying\nto say, which is the idea that we would be\n\n157\n00:07:59.713 --> 00:08:02.389\nprompted, in effect, right,\nwhen the system boots up.\n\n158\n00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:06.314\nGoes to its power on, self-tests the post\ngoes into the BIOS, starts booting up.\n\n159\n00:08:06.314 --> 00:08:07.976\nWe have security software and\n\n160\n00:08:07.976 --> 00:08:11.901\neffectively APIs plugins that allow\nthe operating system to interact\n\n161\n00:08:11.901 --> 00:08:15.638\nwith the hardware to low level to\nprovide security capabilities.\n\n162\n00:08:15.638 --> 00:08:19.580\nWe may have antivirus software scanning\ntaking place in the BIOS as well at that\n\n163\n00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.162\nlevel against the CPU and against\nthe hardware as well as the software,\n\n164\n00:08:23.162 --> 00:08:25.870\noperating at that level as\nwe initialize the system.\n\n165\n00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:29.320\nSo there's lots of different things that\nare gonna go on there and the processor,\n\n166\n00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:32.481\nit's a really complicated piece of\narchitecture when you think about it.\n\n167\n00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:35.671\nThis hardware that we just take for\ngranted that sits in our system and\n\n168\n00:08:35.671 --> 00:08:39.081\ndoes all these things that effectively\nacts as the brain of the computer,\n\n169\n00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:42.931\nit's actually a pretty complicated piece\nof equipment and we don't often stop and\n\n170\n00:08:42.931 --> 00:08:44.984\nthink about just how\ncomplicated it may be.\n\n171\n00:08:44.984 --> 00:08:46.846\nI mentioned we also have storage and\n\n172\n00:08:46.846 --> 00:08:50.639\nwe talked about the idea that we have\neither local storage, hard drive.\n\n173\n00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:51.580\nWe may have it remote.\n\n174\n00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.347\nWe may store something in the cloud or\n\n175\n00:08:53.347 --> 00:08:56.824\nmay use external storage such as a USB\ndevice or something like that, but\n\n176\n00:08:56.824 --> 00:09:00.717\nwe also have memory and people often\nforget that memory is effectively storage.\n\n177\n00:09:00.717 --> 00:09:03.677\nIt's just a very specific and\nvery special kind of storage.\n\n178\n00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:06.962\nWe talked about there being dynamic,\nas well as static kinds of memory.\n\n179\n00:09:06.962 --> 00:09:10.166\nRAM and ROM, you should just be familiar\nwith the difference between the two.\n\n180\n00:09:10.166 --> 00:09:14.741\nAnd obviously, understand the capabilities\nof each in the sense that dynamic storage.\n\n181\n00:09:14.741 --> 00:09:18.265\nSo RAM based storage is gonna be wiped\nout when we power down the system,\n\n182\n00:09:18.265 --> 00:09:21.637\nwhereas ROM based storage,\nstatic based storage is not wiped out.\n\n183\n00:09:21.637 --> 00:09:24.754\nThe information on a ROM chip will stay\nthere even though the power has been\n\n184\n00:09:24.754 --> 00:09:25.769\nremoved from the chip.\n\n185\n00:09:25.769 --> 00:09:27.545\nSo, I wanted to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n186\n00:09:27.545 --> 00:09:29.739\nWhen we think about memory and storage,\n\n187\n00:09:29.739 --> 00:09:33.037\nwe have to think about how we\nprotect data within the system.\n\n188\n00:09:33.037 --> 00:09:36.217\nSo it's one thing to say,\nit's in RAM, but it's dynamic.\n\n189\n00:09:36.217 --> 00:09:37.576\nWe power off, it's gone.\n\n190\n00:09:37.576 --> 00:09:38.296\nWell, we know that.\n\n191\n00:09:38.296 --> 00:09:41.058\nWe know that if it's in RAM,\nit's gonna be static.\n\n192\n00:09:41.058 --> 00:09:44.135\nSo it's stored, it's gonna be staying\nthere when the power is removed.\n\n193\n00:09:44.135 --> 00:09:45.064\nSo that's all good, but\n\n194\n00:09:45.064 --> 00:09:47.815\nthat's not the only thing we have to\nworry about with memory protection.\n\n195\n00:09:47.815 --> 00:09:51.380\nWe have to worry about segmentation,\npaging and protection keys.\n\n196\n00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.109\nLet's talk about what these concepts are.\n\n197\n00:09:53.109 --> 00:09:57.603\nWith segmentation, we effectively\nare dividing the computer memory into\n\n198\n00:09:57.603 --> 00:10:01.026\naddressable areas and\nwe are then able to put information\n\n199\n00:10:01.026 --> 00:10:05.537\ninto those addressable areas and\nthen use that area to store information.\n\n200\n00:10:05.537 --> 00:10:06.581\nThat's pretty straightforward.\n\n201\n00:10:06.581 --> 00:10:10.025\nBut what segmentation also gives\nis the ability to write to or\n\n202\n00:10:10.025 --> 00:10:13.940\nread from a specific memory space,\nwhich allows us then to safely and\n\n203\n00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:17.398\nsecurely store data while it's\nbeing processed in the CPU.\n\n204\n00:10:17.398 --> 00:10:20.292\nAnd while the CPU is fetching it,\npulling it back from memory,\n\n205\n00:10:20.292 --> 00:10:22.710\nit knows exactly where to go to get it.\n\n206\n00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:25.823\nSo that way, we don't inadvertently\npull information that we don't need, but\n\n207\n00:10:25.823 --> 00:10:28.983\nalso don't pull information that we don't\nwant and this is obviously gonna allow\n\n208\n00:10:28.983 --> 00:10:31.440\nus to manage information as\na result of that very effectively.\n\n209\n00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.015\nPaging is the idea that we could\ndivide the memory address space\n\n210\n00:10:35.015 --> 00:10:39.278\nin equal size blocks called pages and\nwe store information in those pages.\n\n211\n00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:42.551\nYou may think the page in generically\nas being the paging file or\n\n212\n00:10:42.551 --> 00:10:44.650\nthe slop file that we often talk about and\n\n213\n00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:48.696\nrefer to when we think about operating\nsystems and the same general concept.\n\n214\n00:10:48.696 --> 00:10:53.194\nIn the sense that, we are writing data\nthat needs to be in memory into a space on\n\n215\n00:10:53.194 --> 00:10:57.556\na hard drive in a predefined amount of\nspace to offset the fact we don't have\n\n216\n00:10:57.556 --> 00:11:02.056\nenough room in memory, in RAM to be able\nto keep all the data in the memory pages\n\n217\n00:11:02.056 --> 00:11:04.789\nor blocks that have been\nformed by the system.\n\n218\n00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:08.352\nIn other words, if we loose enough\naccess to RAM or to memory,\n\n219\n00:11:08.352 --> 00:11:10.072\nbecause we just use it all up.\n\n220\n00:11:10.072 --> 00:11:13.371\nWe have to put that other stuff somewhere\nelse, that's one kind of paging.\n\n221\n00:11:13.371 --> 00:11:16.395\nThat's not necessarily the memory\nprotection paging that we're\n\n222\n00:11:16.395 --> 00:11:17.155\ntalking about.\n\n223\n00:11:17.155 --> 00:11:19.799\nWhen we're talking about\nmemory protection paging,\n\n224\n00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:23.591\nit's the idea of being able to divide\nmemory into equal segments and blocks and\n\n225\n00:11:23.591 --> 00:11:26.751\nthen reading and writing to and\nfrom those blocks contiguously or\n\n226\n00:11:26.751 --> 00:11:30.046\nperhaps, non-contiguously being\nable to access data on demand.\n\n227\n00:11:30.046 --> 00:11:35.180\nWe'll talk about something later called\naddress space layout randomization,\n\n228\n00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.256\nwhich allows us to randomly put\ndata into various memory spots or\n\n229\n00:11:39.256 --> 00:11:41.384\npages, so that we scatter data.\n\n230\n00:11:41.384 --> 00:11:45.112\nAnd as a result of doing that unless we\nhave the map that tells us where we put\n\n231\n00:11:45.112 --> 00:11:48.502\nthe data, it's very hard for\nus to reconstitute what the data is.\n\n232\n00:11:48.502 --> 00:11:51.580\nAnd because of that,\nwe are safely storing data or\n\n233\n00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:55.258\nkeeping the processes in\nthe system unaware of where it is.\n\n234\n00:11:55.258 --> 00:11:58.623\nSo if a rogue process actually starts\nup and tries to access that data,\n\n235\n00:11:58.623 --> 00:12:00.660\nit doesn't have the memory map.\n\n236\n00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.490\nIt doesn't know where the data is and\nit can't find it.\n\n237\n00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:05.637\nSo it can't access the data\nunless we allow it to,\n\n238\n00:12:05.637 --> 00:12:07.900\njust another way we can\nexecute memory protection.\n\n239\n00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.176\nIt's pretty complicated stuff\nwhen you think about it, right.\n\n240\n00:12:10.176 --> 00:12:10.837\n>> It is.\n\n241\n00:12:10.837 --> 00:12:13.380\n>> And we also have something\nknown as protection key.\n\n242\n00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:17.303\nProtection key divides physical memory\nup into blocks of a particular size.\n\n243\n00:12:17.303 --> 00:12:20.777\nSo it's very similar to paging,\nbut the idea is that each of those\n\n244\n00:12:20.777 --> 00:12:24.014\nhas an associated numerical\nvalue called a protection key.\n\n245\n00:12:24.014 --> 00:12:27.479\nAnd the idea then is that each\nprocess is then gonna be given access\n\n246\n00:12:27.479 --> 00:12:30.881\nto a certain amount of memory based\non the use of that shared key,\n\n247\n00:12:30.881 --> 00:12:34.482\nthat key that effectively gives\nyou access to those memory blocks.\n\n248\n00:12:34.482 --> 00:12:38.150\nAnd by using protection key, it's very\nsimilar to the idea of using a private\n\n249\n00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:42.102\nkey, what we would think of asymmetric key\nand we'll talk more about that in some of\n\n250\n00:12:42.102 --> 00:12:45.508\nour coming episodes when we get to\ncryptography as a discussion topic.\n\n251\n00:12:45.508 --> 00:12:50.265\nWe're going to use effectively a private\nkey to access secure memory spaces and\n\n252\n00:12:50.265 --> 00:12:54.809\nonly allow the process, the running\napplication or running process that is\n\n253\n00:12:54.809 --> 00:12:58.937\naccessing the memory to have access\nto that data if they have the key.\n\n254\n00:12:58.937 --> 00:13:00.934\nThey don't have the key,\nthey can't access the data.\n\n255\n00:13:00.934 --> 00:13:05.395\nAs a result again, we keep bad processes,\nmalware, things like that that may get\n\n256\n00:13:05.395 --> 00:13:09.082\ninto the system from accessing\nsensitive data stored in real time,\n\n257\n00:13:09.082 --> 00:13:10.519\ndynamically available.\n\n258\n00:13:10.519 --> 00:13:14.656\nCuz in theory, the logic is the malware\nprocess won't have the key at least it\n\n259\n00:13:14.656 --> 00:13:16.640\nshouldn't, anyway, hopefully.\n\n260\n00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.233\nSo this is called protection keying,\n\n261\n00:13:18.233 --> 00:13:20.483\nthese are different memory\nprotection techniques.\n\n262\n00:13:20.483 --> 00:13:23.833\nWe wanna make sure we're aware of them and\nunderstand how they work,\n\n263\n00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:26.834\nbecause it is important as we said,\nas we begin to talk about,\n\n264\n00:13:26.834 --> 00:13:29.635\nthinking about systems and\nhow they are built securely.\n\n265\n00:13:29.635 --> 00:13:32.730\nWe have to understand all the moving\nparts and the processes to go and\n\n266\n00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:36.532\nmaking them to work together and how they\ncan safely exchange information is really\n\n267\n00:13:36.532 --> 00:13:38.451\nwhat we are talking about on this regard.\n\n268\n00:13:38.451 --> 00:13:41.726\nAddress space layout\nrandomization as I said, ASLR.\n\n269\n00:13:41.726 --> 00:13:46.031\nSo I mentioned a moment ago, the idea of\nrandomly scattering data within the memory\n\n270\n00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:50.152\nmap and then keeping track of where we put\nit, so we can pull it back together when\n\n271\n00:13:50.152 --> 00:13:52.943\nwe need it, but\nnot giving anybody else access to it.\n\n272\n00:13:52.943 --> 00:13:53.707\nIn other words,\n\n273\n00:13:53.707 --> 00:13:56.878\nthe process that owns the data will\nscatter it across the memory map.\n\n274\n00:13:56.878 --> 00:14:01.018\nMarking where it puts it, but not giving\naccess to any other processes for that\n\n275\n00:14:01.018 --> 00:14:04.986\ndata unless they go through and request\naccess and are authorized to do so.\n\n276\n00:14:04.986 --> 00:14:08.202\nAddress space layout randomization,\ncalled ASLR.\n\n277\n00:14:08.202 --> 00:14:10.900\nIt's used in more modern versions\nof Windows operating systems.\n\n278\n00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.155\nSo for instance, in Windows 2008, in 2012,\n\n279\n00:14:14.155 --> 00:14:19.060\nin 2016, server 2016, we use ASLR\namong other protection mechanisms.\n\n280\n00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.266\nWe also wanna think about storage,\nwe talked about RAM as being a kind of\n\n281\n00:14:22.266 --> 00:14:24.413\nstorage, but\nwe also have secondary storage.\n\n282\n00:14:24.413 --> 00:14:28.290\nI mentioned cache or\nmemory caches, that's C-A-C-H or\n\n283\n00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:31.856\ncache as some people often refer to it,\nbut the cache or\n\n284\n00:14:31.856 --> 00:14:37.190\nmemory cache is gonna be an onboard,\ntypically on the processor.\n\n285\n00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:40.771\nSmall area of memory that is used to\nstore instructions that are being used\n\n286\n00:14:40.771 --> 00:14:44.408\nconstantly and are in the middle of\nbeing processed and are in transition,\n\n287\n00:14:44.408 --> 00:14:45.057\nif you will.\n\n288\n00:14:45.057 --> 00:14:47.658\nWe store information we need\non a regular basis there, so\n\n289\n00:14:47.658 --> 00:14:49.295\nwe can pull it back in very quickly.\n\n290\n00:14:49.295 --> 00:14:50.462\nFetching from the cache,\n\n291\n00:14:50.462 --> 00:14:53.706\nin other words is quicker than fetching\nfrom another area of the system.\n\n292\n00:14:53.706 --> 00:14:57.367\nAnd so we use it as just kind of scrap\nmemory areas where we could store things\n\n293\n00:14:57.367 --> 00:15:00.811\nthat are constantly in flux,\nthat's what the processor uses it for.\n\n294\n00:15:00.811 --> 00:15:04.872\nSo it holds data not currently being used\nby the CPU, but is gonna be needed at some\n\n295\n00:15:04.872 --> 00:15:09.083\npoint and we can store various levels of\ninformation in different levels of cache.\n\n296\n00:15:09.083 --> 00:15:12.577\nThere may be a level one or a level one\nand level two or level one, level two and\n\n297\n00:15:12.577 --> 00:15:14.553\nlevel three cache built into your system.\n\n298\n00:15:14.553 --> 00:15:16.399\nSo, it really just depends\non the chip architecture.\n\n299\n00:15:16.399 --> 00:15:19.498\nSo you could think about those things and\nobviously, how that will work.\n\n300\n00:15:19.498 --> 00:15:21.646\nWe may also have what's\nknown as virtual memory.\n\n301\n00:15:21.646 --> 00:15:25.837\nVirtually memory is often referred\nto ask either paging or swapping.\n\n302\n00:15:25.837 --> 00:15:27.846\nWe mentioned that just\na couple of minutes ago.\n\n303\n00:15:27.846 --> 00:15:31.796\nThe idea of paging or swapping is the idea\nof being able to use the hard drive to\n\n304\n00:15:31.796 --> 00:15:34.532\nbe able to offset the lack\nof space in the actual RAM.\n\n305\n00:15:34.532 --> 00:15:37.493\nIf we run out of room in memory,\nwe gotta put stuff somewhere.\n\n306\n00:15:37.493 --> 00:15:39.594\nWe write it to the hard drive and\nthen pull it back.\n\n307\n00:15:39.594 --> 00:15:42.032\nSo, sometimes this is referred\nto as virtual memory.\n\n308\n00:15:42.032 --> 00:15:44.981\nThis is done by using secondary storage.\n\n309\n00:15:44.981 --> 00:15:48.395\nIn effect, we're writing data\nto a secondary storage device.\n\n310\n00:15:48.395 --> 00:15:51.463\nTypically, a local hard drive, that's\nmore often than not where we put that.\n\n311\n00:15:51.463 --> 00:15:54.946\nSo when you hear virtual memory, we're\nreally thinking about paging or swapping.\n\n312\n00:15:54.946 --> 00:15:56.711\nThat's what it's often referred to as.\n\n313\n00:15:56.711 --> 00:15:58.290\nWe also think about firmware.\n\n314\n00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.239\nWhich as I mention is ROM, or\nat least one type of ROM anyway.\n\n315\n00:16:01.239 --> 00:16:04.929\nWhich are the instructions of\nthe operations to either use a piece of\n\n316\n00:16:04.929 --> 00:16:09.659\nhardware, or perhaps a function within the\nsystem that requires access to hardware,\n\n317\n00:16:09.659 --> 00:16:12.510\nhas to access the firmware\nin order to operate.\n\n318\n00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.740\nFirmware's just operating instructions,\nthat's generically what it is.\n\n319\n00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.010\nIt's typically gonna be sitting on ROM,\nbecause it has to be there all\n\n320\n00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.320\nthe time whether there's\npower on the system or not.\n\n321\n00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.900\nImagine the problem we would have if we\nput our firmware into RAM, and in order to\n\n322\n00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.090\naccess the hardware, you have to power\non to read the access instructions.\n\n323\n00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:31.390\nBut in order to do that,\n\n324\n00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.280\nyou have to be able to see\nthe access instructions to power on.\n\n325\n00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.660\nThis would be a bit of\na catch-22 if you will.\n\n326\n00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.250\nNot to physically apply power\nto the system, that's easy.\n\n327\n00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:43.030\nBut to initialize the system when\npower hits the circuits is what we're\n\n328\n00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.660\ntalking about.\n\n329\n00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.840\nAnd the instructions to do that\nare what firmware represents.\n\n330\n00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.180\nSo, it has to be stored in read-only\nmemory so we can gain access to it even\n\n331\n00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:53.220\nthough there's not power applied\nto the system initially.\n\n332\n00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:56.800\nAnd as power comes on, we're able to then\nautomatically read that information,\n\n333\n00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.830\nread it into the memory of the system.\n\n334\n00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:02.750\nAnd then start operating against it in\norder to configure the hardware, or\n\n335\n00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:04.390\nwhatever needs to happen\nas a result of that.\n\n336\n00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:05.790\nSo, that is called firmware.\n\n337\n00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:10.820\nGenerically, you often think of\nthat as the BIOS in your computer.\n\n338\n00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:11.760\nIt's more than that,\n\n339\n00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.350\nbecause there could be firmware associated\nwith certain types of hardware as well.\n\n340\n00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:18.960\nBut generically, you often think\nof the firmware as being the BIOS,\n\n341\n00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.510\nthat's what people often will say, they're\nkind of interchangeable in that respect.\n\n342\n00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.460\nAnd then we have to think about adding an\noperating system on top of this hardware\n\n343\n00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.560\nthat's chugging away under the hood.\n\n344\n00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.970\nWe got to install some software that\nlets us interact with it cuz what we do\n\n345\n00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.340\nis go through the POST,\nthe power-on self-test.\n\n346\n00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.570\nBooting up a system with\nno operating system in it,\n\n347\n00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:36.810\nwe don't get very far, right?\n\n348\n00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:39.630\nYou basically get a warning on\nthe screen that about ten or\n\n349\n00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.730\n15 seconds in says sorry,\nno operating system present.\n\n350\n00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:46.811\nRight, hit control, alt, delete or F1 or\nwhatever the keystroke is to reboot but\n\n351\n00:17:46.811 --> 00:17:50.486\nwe really can't show you anything\nelse because there's no information,\n\n352\n00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:54.780\nno operating system instructions that tell\nus how to effectively get beyond the POST.\n\n353\n00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.490\nSo this is something else you\nwant to consider and think about.\n\n354\n00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.350\nSo operating systems have to\nbe added into the mix as well.\n\n355\n00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:03.640\nWe also have in the operating system\nsomething known as the system kernel.\n\n356\n00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.860\nThe system kernel is effectively\ngonna be the core functionality\n\n357\n00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.300\nof the operating system.\n\n358\n00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:14.390\nYou know Windows today is probably made\nup of several million lines of code.\n\n359\n00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:19.310\nWe yearn for the days back in DOS where I\ncould say it was several lines of code,\n\n360\n00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.240\ncuz there wasn't much\nmore to it than that.\n\n361\n00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.820\nBut it certainly was only a few hundred or\nmaybe 1,000 or more.\n\n362\n00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.650\nCertainly wasn't more than that early on.\n\n363\n00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.880\nWe've grown exponentially\nin terms of the size and\n\n364\n00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.130\ncomplexity of the operating\nsystems we use today.\n\n365\n00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.890\nBut the system kernel has always\nbeen a concept that's been there.\n\n366\n00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:37.850\nIt's been the secure center, the absolute\nbare minimum core requirements\n\n367\n00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:41.180\nthat are necessary to run that OS and\nsecure the instructions to do so.\n\n368\n00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.540\nAnd that's what the system\nkernel represents.\n\n369\n00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.880\nSo what the system kernel\ndoes is several things.\n\n370\n00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.030\nIt loads and runs the binary program.\n\n371\n00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.020\nIt ultimately schedules task swapping.\n\n372\n00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:54.150\nSo it loads and runs the core underlying\nfunction that creates the OS itself.\n\n373\n00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.950\nSchedules task swapping,\nallocates memory and\n\n374\n00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.840\nultimately tracks physical location\nof files on the hard drive.\n\n375\n00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.590\nThese are the four things that the system\nkernel is responsible for doing.\n\n376\n00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:05.420\nOne more time, just so\nwe know what they are.\n\n377\n00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.865\nLoads and runs binary programs,\nschedules task swapping,\n\n378\n00:19:08.865 --> 00:19:13.255\nallocates memory, and tracks physical\nlocation of files on the hard drive so\n\n379\n00:19:13.255 --> 00:19:17.779\nwe can find them with a graphical file\nbrowser of some kind, Windows Explorer,\n\n380\n00:19:17.779 --> 00:19:19.965\nInternet Explorer, whatever it is.\n\n381\n00:19:19.965 --> 00:19:23.160\nAnd we can pull those files up when\nnecessary and show you what's in them and\n\n382\n00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.285\nwhere they're located.\n\n383\n00:19:24.285 --> 00:19:26.290\nThis is what the system kernel does.\n\n384\n00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.550\nHow all this comes together\nobviously is the system engineer and\n\n385\n00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.150\narchitecture design that we talk about\nbecause the engineering about putting all\n\n386\n00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.380\nthis together and\nmaking it work is complicated.\n\n387\n00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.460\nAnd the architecture and the design\nthat drives that is also complicated.\n\n388\n00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.090\nBut putting them all together allows\nthe operating system to run and\n\n389\n00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.120\nto interact with the hardware, and\nto tell the hardware what to do and\n\n390\n00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.220\nhow to do it, and\nto access the information necessary\n\n391\n00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.630\nto carry out requests that are coming\nfrom applications, programs,\n\n392\n00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.210\nand user requests within the system\nat any given moment in time.\n\n393\n00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:00.430\nSo this is how they all come together\nin effect and work together.\n\n394\n00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:03.570\nWhen we think about all of this,\nwe often think about architecture.\n\n395\n00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.890\nNow this may be a system architecture,\n\n396\n00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.210\njust a very straightforward design for\none system.\n\n397\n00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.660\nIf we add security into the mix,\nwhich we often do in our conversations,\n\n398\n00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.030\nwe may be thinking about\na security architecture.\n\n399\n00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:17.410\nOverlaying security on top of that and\nhow security becomes part of the system.\n\n400\n00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:21.710\nWhen we broaden that architecture\nout to the entire organization,\n\n401\n00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.315\nwe often think of that as the enterprise,\nwe think about something that I've\n\n402\n00:20:24.315 --> 00:20:28.720\nreferred to before known as the ESA,\nthe Enterprise Security Architecture.\n\n403\n00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.980\nThis is the architecture for the entire\norganization from a security standpoint.\n\n404\n00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:36.460\nSo we can have different levels of\narchitecture, different levels of design.\n\n405\n00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.720\nDifferent levels of capabilities\nthat we talk about and manage.\n\n406\n00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.010\nAnd at every level we're\nadding capabilities,\n\n407\n00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.930\nwe're adding functionality,\nwe're also adding complexity.\n\n408\n00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:48.320\nBut we wanna be thinking about the fact\nthat, an enterprise system, or\n\n409\n00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.800\nan enterprise security architecture,\nis gonna be a lot broader, but\n\n410\n00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:55.010\nalso a lot more complicated to\nfigure out how to get right\n\n411\n00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.020\nthen a security architecture for\nan individual machine.\n\n412\n00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.150\nA security architecture for\n\n413\n00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:02.950\none machine, it's a sub-component of\nthe enterprise security architecture.\n\n414\n00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.330\nBut, it's a very small part\nof a very big picture.\n\n415\n00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:08.040\nSo let's talk practicality here for\nas minute, let's talk real world.\n\n416\n00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.360\nSo what does an ESA sound like,\nwhat does it look like,\n\n417\n00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.230\nwhat does it actually entail?\n\n418\n00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:16.130\nWell, it could entail you describing all\nthe services that the business is going to\n\n419\n00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.970\noffer to customers,\none example and one part of this.\n\n420\n00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:25.740\nSo cloud based services, virtualization,\npatch management, electronic content\n\n421\n00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.920\nmanagement, file and print, email,\nmobile device support, remote access.\n\n422\n00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.990\nI could go on and on.\n\n423\n00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.090\nThese are all things that\nyou would provide and\n\n424\n00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.190\ngive users of your systems access to use.\n\n425\n00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:38.780\nWe forgot VoIP, put VoIP in there.\n\n426\n00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:42.060\nVoIP would be another big area,\nbig bucket we'd want to have.\n\n427\n00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:43.450\nWe want to have networking.\n\n428\n00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.490\nWe wanna have storage,\nwe wanna have security.\n\n429\n00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.570\nThese are all services that\nwould also go in there.\n\n430\n00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:53.940\nName resolution, LDAP, right, some sort\nof lightweight directory access protocol.\n\n431\n00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.520\nAll these things would go in there.\n\n432\n00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.080\nAnd so, all of those will be parts of\nthe enterprise security architecture.\n\n433\n00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.970\nWe will have detailed specifications\nto help us to figure out\n\n434\n00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:03.780\nhow to have all those\nthings work together,\n\n435\n00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.170\nas well as what the design capabilities\nof the system should render to.\n\n436\n00:22:07.170 --> 00:22:09.730\nIn other words,\nwhat should the system do ultimately.\n\n437\n00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:13.440\nAnd the architecture helps us to\nestablish not just the priorities but\n\n438\n00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.820\nalso the offerings as well as\nhow these things come together\n\n439\n00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.770\nto actually implement the system and\noperate on behalf\n\n440\n00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:23.500\nof the users to provide those capabilities\nto anybody that wants to use the system.\n\n441\n00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.570\nThis is all that the enterprise\nsecurity architecture is about.\n\n442\n00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.140\nWhen we think about the idea of being able\nto bring all this together, we think about\n\n443\n00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:33.050\narchitecture integration as kind of\nthe thought process we're talking about.\n\n444\n00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:36.780\nYou have the idea of taking all these\nmoving parts and pieces of the system,\n\n445\n00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:41.370\nthe CPU, the memory, the storage,\nthe different kinds of memory.\n\n446\n00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:45.780\nThe ability to be able to lay\nin security on top of all that.\n\n447\n00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.210\nAnd we integrate the architectural\ncomponents to build a holistic system.\n\n448\n00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:54.780\nThis is really what ultimately\na security engineer is part of, but\n\n449\n00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.250\nreally what a system engineer does.\n\n450\n00:22:56.250 --> 00:23:00.460\nBecause the security engineer brings\nthe security conversation to the table but\n\n451\n00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.150\nthe systems engineer puts\nthat system together.\n\n452\n00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.890\nAnd the two may be one in the same,\nyou may be both the system and\n\n453\n00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.090\nsecurity engineer.\n\n454\n00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:10.540\nBut they often are different functions,\nthey often are separated from each other.\n\n455\n00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.375\nAnd what we have to think about is\nthe fact that although we know security's\n\n456\n00:23:13.375 --> 00:23:16.265\nimportant, we may not always\nbuild it in every time and\n\n457\n00:23:16.265 --> 00:23:18.285\nfocus on it from start to finish.\n\n458\n00:23:18.285 --> 00:23:21.955\nBecause the people doing the architecture,\npeople doing the design, people doing\n\n459\n00:23:21.955 --> 00:23:25.475\nthe integration may not be the same\npeople that understand and do security.\n\n460\n00:23:25.475 --> 00:23:26.975\nThis can be a challenge for us.\n\n461\n00:23:26.975 --> 00:23:29.615\nAs CISSPs, we're good at security.\n\n462\n00:23:29.615 --> 00:23:33.005\nWe may or may not be good at systems\ndesign and system engineering,\n\n463\n00:23:33.005 --> 00:23:34.810\nit just may not be something you do.\n\n464\n00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:39.240\nMany CISSPs understand the conceptual\nideas we've just talked about but\n\n465\n00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.050\nthat doesn't mean they go out and\nbuild systems on a regular basis.\n\n466\n00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.630\nIt means they create policies that help to\nmanage those systems, probably do that.\n\n467\n00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.209\nIt means that they actually\nmay be involved in managing\n\n468\n00:23:48.209 --> 00:23:51.079\nthe teams that implement those systems,\nprobably do that.\n\n469\n00:23:51.079 --> 00:23:55.399\nThey maybe involved in drafting not just\nthe policy but maybe the procedures as\n\n470\n00:23:55.399 --> 00:23:58.344\nwell as the controls that\nare gonna be used to audit and\n\n471\n00:23:58.344 --> 00:24:01.571\nmake sure those procedures\nare being followed properly.\n\n472\n00:24:01.571 --> 00:24:03.313\nProbably do elements of that.\n\n473\n00:24:03.313 --> 00:24:06.099\nBut again you may not actually\nbuild the system start to finish.\n\n474\n00:24:06.099 --> 00:24:08.260\nIt's a highly specialized set of skills.\n\n475\n00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.470\nSo we want to just be aware of that and\n\n476\n00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.120\nbe thinking about that as\npart of the overarching\n\n477\n00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.890\nthought process that we talked about\nwith architecture integration.\n\n478\n00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.790\nWe also want to be thinking about\ncommon security services that are gonna\n\n479\n00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.800\nbe provided, when we think about security,\nwe think about things.\n\n480\n00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.020\nSome of them I already mentioned.\n\n481\n00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:24.660\nBut we think about things\nlike access control.\n\n482\n00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.380\nWe think about integrity services.\n\n483\n00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.620\nWe think about cryptographic services.\n\n484\n00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.270\nWe think about boundary control.\n\n485\n00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.600\nWhat is the external boundary?\n\n486\n00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.040\nWhat's the internal boundary?\n\n487\n00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.290\nMaybe creating a DMZ would be one way\nto think about boundary control and\n\n488\n00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:37.960\ndifferentiating between them.\n\n489\n00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.680\nA DMZ stands for\ndemilitarized zone, by the way.\n\n490\n00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.970\nThis is the area we create\nwhere we exclude the external\n\n491\n00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.120\npart of the network from seeing\nthe internal part of the network directly.\n\n492\n00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.878\nBut rather build a common area that's\nnot quite private, not quite public.\n\n493\n00:24:50.878 --> 00:24:54.346\nAnd then we allow information to be\nexchanged inside that area securely and\n\n494\n00:24:54.346 --> 00:24:55.960\nconfidentially typically.\n\n495\n00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.610\nBut we have firewalls typically on either\nside of that boundary so that way we can\n\n496\n00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:02.580\ndifferentiate and demarcate what\nis internal, what is external.\n\n497\n00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:06.730\nThis is what the DMZ represents, and\nboundary control is one security service\n\n498\n00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.050\nthat we may be providing as part\nof an integrated architecture.\n\n499\n00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:12.320\nWe also wanna think about security zones,\nand\n\n500\n00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.195\nI mentioned the DMZ as one\nexample of a security zone.\n\n501\n00:25:15.195 --> 00:25:19.375\nSecurity zones allow us to specify\nwhat takes place in that area.\n\n502\n00:25:19.375 --> 00:25:22.865\nIs it highly confidential information,\ndo we have to process it securely?\n\n503\n00:25:22.865 --> 00:25:25.935\nOr can we let people walk around and\nsee whatever's there because it's just\n\n504\n00:25:25.935 --> 00:25:28.615\npublicly available,\nwe don't worry about it.\n\n505\n00:25:28.615 --> 00:25:32.625\nA security zone is really just that area\nthat we specify certain activity and\n\n506\n00:25:32.625 --> 00:25:34.425\ncertain behaviors will or\nwill not be allowed within.\n\n507\n00:25:34.425 --> 00:25:37.630\nThis is something else you want to\nthink about and be aware of as well.\n\n508\n00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.790\nAnd we also have certain kinds of\nframeworks that help us to guide through\n\n509\n00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:42.490\nthese architecture discussions.\n\n510\n00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:46.120\nWe have guidance, in other words, we can\nadd to the mix and give to the security\n\n511\n00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.478\npractitioner, the security professional,\nthe security architect.\n\n512\n00:25:49.478 --> 00:25:51.929\nSo that they can figure out\nhow to do these things and\n\n513\n00:25:51.929 --> 00:25:55.160\nlearn from the examples that\nhave already gone before them.\n\n514\n00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.960\nThings like the Zachman Framework,\n\n515\n00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.920\nthe Zachman Framework is one kind\nof framework that exists out there.\n\n516\n00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:03.520\nIt is a framework that allows us to\nunderstand how to do security architecture\n\n517\n00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.650\nand security design.\n\n518\n00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:06.861\nThere's also SABSA, SABSA, stands for\n\n519\n00:26:06.861 --> 00:26:10.284\nSherwood Applied Business\nSecurity Architecture framework.\n\n520\n00:26:10.284 --> 00:26:12.542\nSABSA is just another framework\nthat exists out there.\n\n521\n00:26:12.542 --> 00:26:16.951\nIt's a holistic lifecycle framework for\ndeveloping security architecture and\n\n522\n00:26:16.951 --> 00:26:20.721\nlooking at different levels of\nintegration that we have to achieve.\n\n523\n00:26:20.721 --> 00:26:24.379\nThere are going to be a total of six\narchitectural views in the SABSA\n\n524\n00:26:24.379 --> 00:26:29.080\nmodel that are used to represent different\nelements of architectural design.\n\n525\n00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.880\nAnd so we can apply that level\nof detail if we choose to.\n\n526\n00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.000\nThere's also something known as TOGAF,\nthe open group architecture framework.\n\n527\n00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.520\nTOGAF is a very popular framework as well,\nagain, for security architecture.\n\n528\n00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.910\nYou can look up any or all of these\nframeworks simply by going out on the Web\n\n529\n00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.220\nand reading up about them\nif you're interested.\n\n530\n00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.710\nYou would have to have just a general\nsense of the fact that there\n\n531\n00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.910\nare frameworks that exist and\ncan be applied.\n\n532\n00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:53.510\nBut I wouldn't spend a huge amount of time\ntrying to spend the intricate details\n\n533\n00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.370\nof any of these frameworks if I was you.\n\n534\n00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:59.080\nIn this particular area,\nthis particular discussion element,\n\n535\n00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.740\nwe really just want to raise awareness\noverall of the fact that security\n\n536\n00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.850\narchitecture is made up of\nvarious components and parts.\n\n537\n00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:06.960\nAnd there are handbooks or\nguidebooks, if you will,\n\n538\n00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.070\nframeworks can fill in this category of\nknowledge for us to give guidance to us,\n\n539\n00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.510\nbut they may not be necessarily\nsomething you specialize in.\n\n540\n00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:17.340\nAnd you would not wanna spend a huge\namount of time getting familiar with them,\n\n541\n00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.300\nwith regards to trying to prepare for\nthe CISSP exam.\n\n542\n00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.780\nBut knowledge of them would be\nvery helpful and very beneficial.\n\n543\n00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.240\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n544\n00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.690\nThere may be something like ITIL.\n\n545\n00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:30.040\nWe've talked about ITIL in some of our\nprior episodes, IT infrastructure library.\n\n546\n00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.370\nITIL itself is a customer service,\ncustomer-centered framework\n\n547\n00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.680\nwith regards to how to manage\nthe provisioning of IT services.\n\n548\n00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.200\nBut it also deals with security\naspects of the architecture, and\n\n549\n00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.630\ncreating a service-oriented\narchitecture is part of\n\n550\n00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:45.660\nhow we would create an enterprise\nsecurity architecture.\n\n551\n00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:48.390\nSo ITIL can offer some\nguidance to us as well.\n\n552\n00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:51.330\nAnd the five stages of ITIL,\nwe've talked about them before,\n\n553\n00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.720\nare probably worth mentioning\nagain here quickly.\n\n554\n00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:59.670\nThe idea of being able to go in and think\nabout service strategy, service design,\n\n555\n00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:04.640\nservice transition, service operation,\nas well as continual service improvement,\n\n556\n00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:07.450\nthese are the five areas\nof the ITIL framework.\n\n557\n00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:11.985\nAnd as we think about ITIL, we think about\nthe way we go from strategy all the way\n\n558\n00:28:11.985 --> 00:28:16.066\nthrough to inventing and\ndesigning that model, that's the design.\n\n559\n00:28:16.066 --> 00:28:19.343\nWe think about transitioning building,\nwe think about operation, so\n\n560\n00:28:19.343 --> 00:28:20.607\nwe think about going live.\n\n561\n00:28:20.607 --> 00:28:24.039\nAnd then we think about constantly\nre-envisioning that and revisiting that,\n\n562\n00:28:24.039 --> 00:28:27.220\nso we do continual service\nimprovements to make it better.\n\n563\n00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.700\nAnd so as a result of that,\nthat's what we're ultimately gonna do when\n\n564\n00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.690\nwe think about ITIL,\nthat whole holistic vision.\n\n565\n00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.800\nThe whole holistic solution\nis what comes to bear there.\n\n566\n00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.440\n>> Very good, Adam, that's a great\nlook at security model concepts.\n\n567\n00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.840\nI know we got more to go,\nwe haven't finished,\n\n568\n00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.260\nwe haven't even come close,\nmaybe to getting through all of that.\n\n569\n00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.104\nBut a great start, we got to look at some\nof those core components in a system.\n\n570\n00:28:49.104 --> 00:28:52.439\nWe talked about system security\narchitecture as well as enterprise\n\n571\n00:28:52.439 --> 00:28:54.779\nsecurity architecture and\nthen we broke down or\n\n572\n00:28:54.779 --> 00:28:58.814\nwe mentioned some of those frameworks that\nyou might be interested in that can help\n\n573\n00:28:58.814 --> 00:29:01.467\nyou if you have to get involved\nin the design process.\n\n574\n00:29:01.467 --> 00:29:05.460\nGreat information, looking forward to\nthe next episode but for this one.\n\n575\n00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.750\nAnd that's gonna have to do it,\nwe are out of time.\n\n576\n00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.940\nRemember, if you guys want to\nattend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n577\n00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.830\nmake sure you shoot us\na message at

They then look at specific models including Bell–LaPadula, Biba, and Clark-Wilson. They also talk about requirements, both functional and non-functional, and how to gather this information. They finish up by discussing certification and accreditation, and looking at evaluation systems used to rank the security and confidence we have in a system.",

--> 00:00:19.300\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\ntoday we're doing our CISSP.\n\n4\n00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.590\nAnd specifically,\n\n5\n00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.070\nwe're gonna be continuing on our\nconversation on Security models.\n\n6\n00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.370\nSo we're just gonna dive\nright back into it.\n\n7\n00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.060\nAnd here for that is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.870\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:29.440\n>> Good.\nGood.\n\n10\n00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.240\nI should do my whole swimming and\ndiving thing.\n\n11\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.520\nRight in.\n\n12\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.280\nSo let's get started.\n\n13\n00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.470\nLet's jump in as Mike was saying.\n\n14\n00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.460\nSo we wanna talk about types\nof security models and\n\n15\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.530\nreally define that a little bit more, give\nus a sense of what those models look like.\n\n16\n00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.550\nAnd speaking of models, what we're gonna\ndo is actually take a look right now\n\n17\n00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.890\nWhile we're talking about them,\nput a bullet list up so\n\n18\n00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.230\nwe can talk through them with you.\n\n19\n00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.240\nIt's always good to see them.\n\n20\n00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.900\nIt's always good to understand them, but\nit's better to have a list and then be\n\n21\n00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.800\nable to hear the definition, and associate\nthe definition with the model type.\n\n22\n00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.570\nSo we've got five we're gonna go through.\n\n23\n00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.180\nYou'll see them in the screen,\non the screen in front of you.\n\n24\n00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.790\nLet's start with state machine model.\n\n25\n00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.640\nThe state machine model is effectively\ngonna describe The behavior of a system\n\n26\n00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.970\nas it moves between one state at another.\n\n27\n00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.790\nIn effect as the machine is\ngonna be doing various things\n\n28\n00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.810\nwe're gonna be using the state machine\nmodel to describe what they are going from\n\n29\n00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.860\none known state to another known state.\n\n30\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.470\nThe purpose essentially is to define\nthe actions that should be permitted\n\n31\n00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.070\nto allow the system to carry out certain\nactivities and do certain things.\n\n32\n00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.520\nBut keeping in mind we\nare always focused on security.\n\n33\n00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.770\nSo we wanted to find those actions in\nthose states from a security stand point.\n\n34\n00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.460\nSo that we never leave the system or\noperate the system or\n\n35\n00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.090\nin any way interact with it in a way that\nis unsecure or nonsecure, or insecure,\n\n36\n00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.420\nwhatever term would make sense there.\n\n37\n00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.510\nThe goal is to preserver the security of\nthe system at all times in other words.\n\n38\n00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.670\nThat's what the state machine\nmodel helps us to understand.\n\n39\n00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.900\nA multi level lattice model,\nitem number two on our list.\n\n40\n00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.730\nDescribe strict layers of subjects and\nobjects, remember that subjects and\n\n41\n00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.640\nobjects are what we often use,\nthe terms we use, to interact between or\n\n42\n00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.320\nto talk about the difference between.\n\n43\n00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.970\nUsers and data, subjects are users\ntraditionally in our discussion,\n\n44\n00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.980\nobjects typically is going\nto be used to refer to data,\n\n45\n00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.600\nkeeping in mind that a service, an\napplication may proxy, may make a request,\n\n46\n00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.950\non behalf of a user, so a service or\nan application may also be a subject.\n\n47\n00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.350\nAt certain points in time.\n\n48\n00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.100\nBut, generically, subjects are seen as\nusers, objects are gonna be seen as data.\n\n49\n00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.990\nSo multi-level lattice models\ndescribe strict layers of object and\n\n50\n00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.750\nsubject interaction, and defines, clearly,\nthe rules allowed or not allowed.\n\n51\n00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.820\nThe rules, in other words,\nof operation, and\n\n52\n00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.505\nhow we interact between subjects and\nobjects.\n\n53\n00:02:42.505 --> 00:02:46.600\nMulti-level Lattice models are really\ngonna define for us unequivocally\n\n54\n00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.730\nWhat subjects and objects, users and data,\ncan do when they interact with each other.\n\n55\n00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.060\nAnd we do so based on what we know as\nrules, and we'll talk more about that and\n\n56\n00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.945\nhow that works in a bit.\n\n57\n00:02:54.945 --> 00:02:57.860\nNon-interference models.\n\n58\n00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.900\nThe goal here is to be able to\neffectively ensure that inputs,\n\n59\n00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.340\nwhat we call high level actions.\n\n60\n00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.660\nHigh level actions are inputs.\n\n61\n00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.710\nSo high level actions do not determine\nwhat low level users can see,\n\n62\n00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.200\nin other words, output.\n\n63\n00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.370\nSo what we're dealing with here with\nnon interference models is making sure\n\n64\n00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.990\nthat high level actions or\ninputs that are coming into the system\n\n65\n00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.980\nare not going to exclusively\ndetermine what users get to see.\n\n66\n00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.220\nIn other words we have to make sure\nthat a non interference model's,\n\n67\n00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.400\nThat we are not allowing input to\neffectively block or modify or\n\n68\n00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.160\nallow or disallow output to\nusers exclusively by itself.\n\n69\n00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.300\nWe have to mix in other things,\nin other words, right?\n\n70\n00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.840\nSo, a non-interference model would\nsay that, if I hit the Delete key\n\n71\n00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.650\nthat I should not delete a system file\nwithout first prompting in effect, right?\n\n72\n00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.200\nTo give the user some input and as a\nresult rather take input from the system,\n\n73\n00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.540\ngive output to the user in a way that does\nnot automatically execute that activity,\n\n74\n00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.160\nbut rather Gives them\nthe ability to interact, and\n\n75\n00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.050\ngives them information that they\ncan then use to make a decision.\n\n76\n00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.890\nThis is the non-interference model.\n\n77\n00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.600\nWe also have the matrix-based models,\ngoing down the list.\n\n78\n00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.740\nSo a matrix-based model.\n\n79\n00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.960\nWe think here about\nan access control matrix,\n\n80\n00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.560\nthis really what a matrix-based\nmodel was going to be talking about.\n\n81\n00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.790\nAn access control matrix, excuse me,\nis a two-dimensional table.\n\n82\n00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.110\nEffectively a table that allows subjects\nand objects to be related to each other.\n\n83\n00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.950\nSo the idea is that we\nwould have subjects.\n\n84\n00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.180\nWe would have users, or groups of users.\n\n85\n00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.510\nAnd we would have data.\n\n86\n00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.100\nThink of it as maybe as a list\nof users on one side, and\n\n87\n00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.240\na list of files on the other.\n\n88\n00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.800\nRight.\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n89\n00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800\n>> And effectively how the two interact.\n\n90\n00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.790\nDoes Billy have read\nonly access to file one?\n\n91\n00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.790\nOr does Billy have full control?\n\n92\n00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.110\nThat would be the idea behind\na matrix-based model or\n\n93\n00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.800\nan access control matrix that allows us\nto relate subjects and objects together\n\n94\n00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.120\nto allow us to understand how ultimately\nthe two interact, or in some cases how\n\n95\n00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.870\nthey don't interact cuz want to make\nsure we're aware of that as well.\n\n96\n00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.520\nInformation flow models,\nthe last model down on the list.\n\n97\n00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.000\nThis focuses on how\ninformation is allowed or\n\n98\n00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.750\nnot allowed to move between\nindividual objects.\n\n99\n00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.820\nIn other words, excuse me, between\nindividual subjects, rather, excuse me.\n\n100\n00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.980\nInformation flow models are really how\ninformation is allowed to be processed and\n\n101\n00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.960\nmoved and\nshared among users within the system.\n\n102\n00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.680\nWhat is the flow?\n\n103\n00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.460\nWhat is the process of that information\nmoving from place to place?\n\n104\n00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.580\nSo we're looking at information and\nmanagement of information.\n\n105\n00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.100\nAnd how that information is then\ncontrolled is what information flow models\n\n106\n00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.980\nare all about.\n\n107\n00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.820\nSo we wanna be thinking about all\nof these five kinds of models,\n\n108\n00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.960\nmaking sure we understand what they are.\n\n109\n00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.960\nMaking sure we have a good understanding\nof them, because the types of security\n\n110\n00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.020\nmodels that we use, the five models that\nare listed that we went through with you,\n\n111\n00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.040\nand the definitions of them,\nare gonna be fair game on the exam.\n\n112\n00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.790\nYou may very well be asked a question or\ntwo about them, or may have to apply\n\n113\n00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:03.870\nthe right model, given a certain\nsituation or some sort of a scenario.\n\n114\n00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.600\nAnd you may have to choose the appropriate\nmodel based on the description\n\n115\n00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.770\nof the services or\nthe information that's being provided,\n\n116\n00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.190\nso you do wanna make sure\nyou're familiar with them.\n\n117\n00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.070\nDefinitely go back over the definitions\nof each, wanna make sure we have a good\n\n118\n00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.860\nworking knowledge of them as we continue\nnot only our conversations, but\n\n119\n00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.710\nas you ultimately continue to study and\nprepare for this information.\n\n120\n00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.068\nIn addition to the types\nof security models.\n\n121\n00:06:26.068 --> 00:06:30.880\nWe also want to talk about some specific\nexamples of certain kind's of model's.\n\n122\n00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.980\nWe want to talk about two\nmodel's in particular.\n\n123\n00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.880\nWe're gonna spend a couple of minute's on\nwhich we're going to present to you here\n\n124\n00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.340\nin just a moment in chart form.\n\n125\n00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.550\nBut let me just set them up quickly\nbefore we actually put the chart up.\n\n126\n00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.154\nSo the idea here is that we're gonna talk\nabout something known as the Bell–LaPadula\n\n127\n00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:46.640\nmodel, we're gonna talk\nabout the Biba model.\n\n128\n00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.110\nNow I wasn't completely honest with you.\n\n129\n00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.720\nSo let me backup cuz I like you guys,\nyou've been very nice.\n\n130\n00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.355\nYou listen to Mike's horrible jokes and\nyou laugh at them anyway.\n\n131\n00:06:53.355 --> 00:06:54.150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I wanna make\n\n132\n00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.360\nsure we understand actually what\nthe models are really called.\n\n133\n00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.210\nThe Bell-LaPadula model's actually called\nthe Bell-LaPadula confidentiality model.\n\n134\n00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.450\nAnd the Biba model is actually\ncalled the Biba integrity model.\n\n135\n00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.240\nAnd this is an important distinction.\n\n136\n00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.640\nWhen we think about the building blocks\nare the pillars of information security.\n\n137\n00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.720\nWe have talked extensively about\nconfidentiality and integrity.\n\n138\n00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.220\nWe know availability is there as well, but\n\n139\n00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.320\nwe're not focusing on\navailability models right now.\n\n140\n00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.310\nSo, it's gonna focus on\nconfidentiality and integrity.\n\n141\n00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.300\nConfidentiality is all about\nkeeping information secure and\n\n142\n00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.540\nkeeping it hidden from people that\nare not authorized to see it.\n\n143\n00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.440\nIntegrity is all about making sure\nthat information is not modified\n\n144\n00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.168\nwithout our consent,\nwithout our knowledge.\n\n145\n00:07:32.168 --> 00:07:37.400\nSo the Bell-LaPadula model is focused on\nconfidentiality, focused on information\n\n146\n00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.700\nsecurity, and not exposing information\nunnecessarily to unauthorized individuals.\n\n147\n00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.763\nThe Biba integrity model is focused on\nintegrity, ensuring that information,\n\n148\n00:07:47.763 --> 00:07:52.610\ndata, has not been modified without\nour knowledge and without our consent.\n\n149\n00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.750\nSo this is what the two models do.\n\n150\n00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.370\nSo, first thing we need to know is\nexactly what each model is focused on.\n\n151\n00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.550\nSecond thing we need to know\nis how we compare the two,\n\n152\n00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.030\nand what are the differences and\nwhat are the similarities?\n\n153\n00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.813\nSo, we're gonna put up a nice chart we\ncreated for you to take a look at that.\n\n154\n00:08:07.813 --> 00:08:10.370\nAnd that's gonna help us to\nwalk through the comparison,\n\n155\n00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.839\nthe difference between the two.\n\n156\n00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:15.820\nAnd so what you're going to see on the\nscreen in front of us is gonna be a three\n\n157\n00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.654\ncolumn chart.\n\n158\n00:08:16.654 --> 00:08:21.604\nOn the extreme left, we're going to have\nthe property, and the properties is either\n\n159\n00:08:21.604 --> 00:08:25.473\na simple property, a star property,\nor an invocation property.\n\n160\n00:08:25.473 --> 00:08:28.119\nThose are gonna be the three\nrunning down the left hand side.\n\n161\n00:08:28.119 --> 00:08:33.066\nNow the properties as you will see with\none exception, the invocation property,\n\n162\n00:08:33.066 --> 00:08:36.591\nwhich is not used in Bell-LaPadula,\nbut is used in Biba.\n\n163\n00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:41.270\nBut certainly, the simple-property and\nthe *-property are used in both models.\n\n164\n00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.590\nBLP, at the top of the header on\nthe second column, it stands for\n\n165\n00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:49.357\nBell-LaPadula model, so\nthe Bell-LaPadula model.\n\n166\n00:08:49.357 --> 00:08:50.633\nBiba is Biba.\n\n167\n00:08:50.633 --> 00:08:53.149\nAnd so\nthe simple properties is used in both.\n\n168\n00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:54.809\nThe star properties used in both.\n\n169\n00:08:54.809 --> 00:08:57.388\nInvocation property only used in Biba.\n\n170\n00:08:57.388 --> 00:09:01.613\nSo having said that, let's go thru here\nand I'm actually gonna ask Mike to make\n\n171\n00:09:01.613 --> 00:09:05.480\na slight alteration for this chart\nin real time, while we're talking.\n\n172\n00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.375\nSo we're gonna see if Mike can\nfollow directions here as we go.\n\n173\n00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:10.098\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, I'm gonna tell you what I want\n\n174\n00:09:10.098 --> 00:09:13.634\nyou to highlight in bold, because what\nwe're gonna do is bold the information in\n\n175\n00:09:13.634 --> 00:09:17.276\nparenthesis at the end of each day, then\nfor simple-property and star property.\n\n176\n00:09:17.276 --> 00:09:19.297\nThat way we can really\nfocus our attention on it.\n\n177\n00:09:19.297 --> 00:09:22.243\nMake sure everybody understands\nthat that's the key takeaway.\n\n178\n00:09:22.243 --> 00:09:24.492\nSo, Mike's gonna do that for\nus as we start talking.\n\n179\n00:09:24.492 --> 00:09:27.327\nHe'll do that as we go, and\nyou'll see it appear there on the screen.\n\n180\n00:09:27.327 --> 00:09:28.792\nAnd then we'll talk about what it is.\n\n181\n00:09:28.792 --> 00:09:31.136\nAll right, so,\nlet's start with the simple-property.\n\n182\n00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:33.013\nAnd let's look at the Bell-LaPadula model.\n\n183\n00:09:33.013 --> 00:09:34.836\nSo, center column.\n\n184\n00:09:34.836 --> 00:09:36.761\nWe're gonna talk about\nthe simple property.\n\n185\n00:09:36.761 --> 00:09:41.811\nThe simple-property effectively says as\nyou can see on the screen That a subject,\n\n186\n00:09:41.811 --> 00:09:43.626\nremember a subject is a user.\n\n187\n00:09:43.626 --> 00:09:46.877\nA subject cannot read or access an object.\n\n188\n00:09:46.877 --> 00:09:48.330\nObjects are data.\n\n189\n00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:54.228\nSo a user cannot read or\naccess data of a higher classification.\n\n190\n00:09:54.228 --> 00:09:58.791\nIn plain old fashioned, and I'll use a\nword here, simple, as in simple property,\n\n191\n00:09:58.791 --> 00:10:03.185\nin simple language what is the simple\nproperty indicate for Bell-LaPadula?.\n\n192\n00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:06.269\nWe sum it up by using the bolded\nstatement in the parentheses,\n\n193\n00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:10.145\nwhich is probably the best way to remember\nthis, which is you cannot read up.\n\n194\n00:10:10.145 --> 00:10:14.433\nSo if you think about the logic of\nBell-LaPadula focused on confidentiality.\n\n195\n00:10:14.433 --> 00:10:16.372\nLet's talk about what no\nread up really means.\n\n196\n00:10:16.372 --> 00:10:20.949\nWhat no read up really means is the idea\nthat a user at a lower level of security\n\n197\n00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:25.812\nclearance should not be able to see data\nat a higher level of security clearance or\n\n198\n00:10:25.812 --> 00:10:30.607\nclassification, because we are exposing\nand breaking the confidentiality of\n\n199\n00:10:30.607 --> 00:10:33.857\nthat data by allowing them\nto read about their level.\n\n200\n00:10:33.857 --> 00:10:36.398\nSo, standard model,\nlevel one, two and three.\n\n201\n00:10:36.398 --> 00:10:38.814\nLayer one is the lowest,\nlayer three is the highest.\n\n202\n00:10:38.814 --> 00:10:42.176\nUsers at level one, data's at level two.\n\n203\n00:10:42.176 --> 00:10:45.253\nShould a user at level one be\nable to see data at level two?\n\n204\n00:10:45.253 --> 00:10:49.246\nNot according to the simple property in\nthe Bell-LaPadula model because we don't\n\n205\n00:10:49.246 --> 00:10:49.995\nallow read up.\n\n206\n00:10:49.995 --> 00:10:52.519\nWe don't want to expose higher level,\n\n207\n00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:56.502\nmore confidential data to a user\nthat is not cleared to see it.\n\n208\n00:10:56.502 --> 00:10:59.908\nThat's what the simple property\nimplies for Bell-LaPadula.\n\n209\n00:10:59.908 --> 00:11:02.525\nLet’s work our way down\nthe column as opposed to over.\n\n210\n00:11:02.525 --> 00:11:03.998\nOkay, so, if you could bold write.\n\n211\n00:11:03.998 --> 00:11:05.601\nMike's gonna bold that for us.\n\n212\n00:11:05.601 --> 00:11:08.648\nSo, let's look at the star property.\n\n213\n00:11:08.648 --> 00:11:12.949\nMiddle of the column under Bell-LaPadula,\nthe star property says the subject.\n\n214\n00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:14.743\nRemember, subject is a user.\n\n215\n00:11:14.743 --> 00:11:19.127\nA user can only save an object,\ncan only interact with it and\n\n216\n00:11:19.127 --> 00:11:23.169\nsave data at the same or\nhigher classification level.\n\n217\n00:11:23.169 --> 00:11:28.290\nIn effect, what we're saying is we\nwill not allow you to write data down.\n\n218\n00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.387\nNot write it down as\nin make note of it but\n\n219\n00:11:30.387 --> 00:11:32.683\nwrite it down to a lower\nlevel in the model.\n\n220\n00:11:32.683 --> 00:11:35.189\nAnd so\nthink about the logic of this as well.\n\n221\n00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:39.359\nIf a user can only save data at\nthe level they are at, or above,\n\n222\n00:11:39.359 --> 00:11:43.933\nwhat we're doing is not allowing\ndata to be exposed by being written\n\n223\n00:11:43.933 --> 00:11:47.972\nto a lower level of classification\nby saying no write down.\n\n224\n00:11:47.972 --> 00:11:52.565\nWe're effectively safeguarding data by\nensuring the data stays at the level or\n\n225\n00:11:52.565 --> 00:11:54.769\nabove that it has been classified at.\n\n226\n00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:57.698\nSo let's go back to our three\ntier model for just a second.\n\n227\n00:11:57.698 --> 00:11:59.499\nLevel one, level two, level three.\n\n228\n00:11:59.499 --> 00:12:01.933\nOne is the lowest, three is the highest.\n\n229\n00:12:01.933 --> 00:12:05.047\nIf data exists at level two of the model,\n\n230\n00:12:05.047 --> 00:12:08.994\na user must exist at level two to see it,\nno read up.\n\n231\n00:12:08.994 --> 00:12:12.311\nSo the level of the data and\nthe user is equal in our example here.\n\n232\n00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:13.529\nWe’re both at level two.\n\n233\n00:12:13.529 --> 00:12:18.941\nWhat the star property says is that a user\nat level two, accessing data at level two,\n\n234\n00:12:18.941 --> 00:12:23.591\ncan see the data, but they cannot write\nit down to level one exposing it to\n\n235\n00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:28.035\nusers that would not be able to read it,\nbecause we block reading up.\n\n236\n00:12:28.035 --> 00:12:32.468\nThat effectively breaks the simple\nproperty if the star property would allow\n\n237\n00:12:32.468 --> 00:12:34.453\nyou to write data to a lower level.\n\n238\n00:12:34.453 --> 00:12:39.268\nSo the idea is that they mutually\nreinforce one another in effect.\n\n239\n00:12:39.268 --> 00:12:45.255\nAnd as a result, they block us from\nbreaking the confidentiality of the data.\n\n240\n00:12:45.255 --> 00:12:47.499\nThis is what Bell-LaPadula focuses on.\n\n241\n00:12:47.499 --> 00:12:49.298\nIt's all about confidentiality.\n\n242\n00:12:49.298 --> 00:12:50.820\nNow we're gonna stop here for\njust a second.\n\n243\n00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.065\nWe're not gonna do anything other\nthan just listen for a moment.\n\n244\n00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.725\nI'm gonna share a little secret with you.\n\n245\n00:12:55.725 --> 00:12:59.821\nThe secret is that the Bell-LaPadula\nmodel focusing on confidentiality,\n\n246\n00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:02.318\nas we've just talked about,\nworks this way.\n\n247\n00:13:02.318 --> 00:13:04.952\nNow as we start to talk about Biba,\nwe move to the right, and\n\n248\n00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:06.398\nwe'll do this in just a second.\n\n249\n00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:07.880\nWhen we talk about integrity,\n\n250\n00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.788\nhopefully you're gonna pick\nup on something very quickly.\n\n251\n00:13:10.788 --> 00:13:15.269\nBiba is the exact mirror\nopposite of Bell-LaPadula.\n\n252\n00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:19.072\nAnd so when we say for Biba,\nwith the simple property,\n\n253\n00:13:19.072 --> 00:13:23.384\nwe say no read down,\nwhereas Bell-LaPadula said no read up.\n\n254\n00:13:23.384 --> 00:13:26.808\nWe say with the star property for\nBell-LaPadula, no write down.\n\n255\n00:13:26.808 --> 00:13:31.666\nWe say for Biba, no write up because\nBiba is focusing on integrity,\n\n256\n00:13:31.666 --> 00:13:35.603\nthe exact opposite operation\nfrom confidentiality.\n\n257\n00:13:35.603 --> 00:13:38.009\nAnd so\nthey're mirror opposites of one another.\n\n258\n00:13:38.009 --> 00:13:40.848\nAnd if you learn one model,\nand know the shortcut,\n\n259\n00:13:40.848 --> 00:13:45.287\nno read up, no write down sentence for\nthat model, you already know the other.\n\n260\n00:13:45.287 --> 00:13:46.703\nAll you have to do is invert it.\n\n261\n00:13:46.703 --> 00:13:47.958\nMake it the exact opposite.\n\n262\n00:13:47.958 --> 00:13:52.103\nAnd on the exam, you'll be able to\nanswer questions on either one, so\n\n263\n00:13:52.103 --> 00:13:54.509\nI've just cut down your work by 50%.\n\n264\n00:13:54.509 --> 00:13:56.425\nI'm throwing down the mike,\nwe're done here.\n\n265\n00:13:56.425 --> 00:13:57.748\nI'm leaving, right?\n\n266\n00:13:57.748 --> 00:13:59.412\nSo think about the logic of this.\n\n267\n00:13:59.412 --> 00:14:01.162\nI'm going to walk you\nthrough Biba right now but\n\n268\n00:14:01.162 --> 00:14:02.878\njust think about the logic\nof what I just said.\n\n269\n00:14:02.878 --> 00:14:04.773\nBecause we focus on integrity,\n\n270\n00:14:04.773 --> 00:14:09.700\nwe're making sure information is not\nmodified without our knowledge or consent.\n\n271\n00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.616\nWe're not focused on keeping it secret,\nwe don't care if you read it.\n\n272\n00:14:12.616 --> 00:14:14.716\nWe wanna make sure you don't modify it.\n\n273\n00:14:14.716 --> 00:14:17.365\nThat's what we're focus on now,\nso let's take a look.\n\n274\n00:14:17.365 --> 00:14:21.865\nSo the Biba model says for simple\nproperty, a subject remember a user,\n\n275\n00:14:21.865 --> 00:14:26.524\ncan not observe, can not see an object or\ndata of a lower integrity level.\n\n276\n00:14:26.524 --> 00:14:30.177\nThere’s that trigger for our mind again,\nintegrity, we're focused on integrity.\n\n277\n00:14:30.177 --> 00:14:34.364\nIn other words, you can not read down,\nbecause if you read down,\n\n278\n00:14:34.364 --> 00:14:36.813\nyou can potentially modify the data.\n\n279\n00:14:36.813 --> 00:14:39.756\nAnd as a result,\nyou will change the integrity of the data.\n\n280\n00:14:39.756 --> 00:14:41.288\nWe don't want to read down.\n\n281\n00:14:41.288 --> 00:14:47.152\nThe star property says a subject,\nsecond row in the column there under Biba.\n\n282\n00:14:47.152 --> 00:14:49.585\nA subject user cannot modify,\n\n283\n00:14:49.585 --> 00:14:53.805\ncannot change an object Of\na higher integrity level.\n\n284\n00:14:53.805 --> 00:14:54.583\nNo writing up.\n\n285\n00:14:54.583 --> 00:14:58.297\nAgain, we're focused on making\nsure you don't make changes to\n\n286\n00:14:58.297 --> 00:15:00.922\nthe data unless you're\nauthorized to do so.\n\n287\n00:15:00.922 --> 00:15:04.806\nData at a higher level than you is data\nthat you're not supposed to interact with,\n\n288\n00:15:04.806 --> 00:15:07.130\nso therefore you should\nnot be able to change it.\n\n289\n00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.732\nThat's what we think about.\n\n290\n00:15:08.732 --> 00:15:12.148\nSo Biba focused on integrity.\n\n291\n00:15:12.148 --> 00:15:14.676\nBell-LaPadula focused on confidentiality.\n\n292\n00:15:14.676 --> 00:15:16.598\nWe're not gonna worry about\nthe invocation property.\n\n293\n00:15:16.598 --> 00:15:17.260\nIt's there.\n\n294\n00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:19.341\nBut really the focus of Bell-LaPadula and\n\n295\n00:15:19.341 --> 00:15:22.015\nBiba is really about the simple\nproperty and the star.\n\n296\n00:15:22.015 --> 00:15:24.534\nBecause those two\nare shared by both models.\n\n297\n00:15:24.534 --> 00:15:26.936\nThe invocation property is unique to Biba.\n\n298\n00:15:26.936 --> 00:15:30.264\nSo, we don't tend to spend a lot of\ntime on that one which translates into\n\n299\n00:15:30.264 --> 00:15:31.749\na whisper so nobody can hear me.\n\n300\n00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:34.386\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don't worry about it for the exam.\n\n301\n00:15:34.386 --> 00:15:35.929\nBut I didn't say that.\n\n302\n00:15:35.929 --> 00:15:40.192\nSo just make sure you know of\nthe simple-property and the star property.\n\n303\n00:15:40.192 --> 00:15:41.830\nThose are going to be\nthe two most important ones.\n\n304\n00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.398\nNow, the reason we highlighted and\nput in brackets and parentheses,\n\n305\n00:15:45.398 --> 00:15:48.922\nthe little memory trigger for you,\nis to give you a little mnemonic.\n\n306\n00:15:48.922 --> 00:15:53.374\nA memory device as we call it that helps\nyou to summarize the function of the rule\n\n307\n00:15:53.374 --> 00:15:54.933\nwith regards to the model.\n\n308\n00:15:54.933 --> 00:15:57.413\nIn other words,\nmake sure you know the no read up,\n\n309\n00:15:57.413 --> 00:16:01.213\nno write down as opposed to knowing\nthe statement about what the model does.\n\n310\n00:16:01.213 --> 00:16:03.253\nThey both effectively mean the same thing.\n\n311\n00:16:03.253 --> 00:16:06.313\nBut one's a lot easier to remember\nthan the other more often than not.\n\n312\n00:16:06.313 --> 00:16:11.640\nRight, so this is the Bel-LaPadula and\nthe Biba models.\n\n313\n00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.680\nWe want to make sure that we understand\nhow the two models are going to\n\n314\n00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.300\neffectively operate.\n\n315\n00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.450\nSo very important for us.\n\n316\n00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:22.260\nHopefully, the chart proves to be a good\nway for you to summarize and study.\n\n317\n00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:25.730\nIf you want to make your own chart\nwith that, make a flashcard, do that,\n\n318\n00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.210\nby the way, that will be a real great\nway for you to think about studying.\n\n319\n00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.350\nDo we ever talk in any of\nour episodes generically?\n\n320\n00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.520\nAnd I don't know if you do.\n\n321\n00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.690\nI have not, but I'm just thinking jointly.\n\n322\n00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:39.860\nDo we ever talk about, not just study\nhabits and study dos and don'ts,\n\n323\n00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:42.930\nwe certainly talk about some of those,\nI'm gonna throw one out to you right now.\n\n324\n00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:45.400\nBut do we talk about the use\nof a program like Quizlets or\n\n325\n00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:47.710\nsomething to create flash cards for\nreview?\n\n326\n00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.980\n>> Yeah I think in A+ they\nmention electronic flash cards.\n\n327\n00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.570\n>> Okay, so just maybe something for\n\n328\n00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:54.175\nyou to think about if you're not\nfamiliar with what we're talking about.\n\n329\n00:16:54.175 --> 00:16:57.685\nGo out and Google as Mike just\nsaid electronic flashcards.\n\n330\n00:16:57.685 --> 00:17:00.135\nQuizlit is an app that let you do that for\nfree.\n\n331\n00:17:00.135 --> 00:17:01.185\nWorks on the iPad.\n\n332\n00:17:01.185 --> 00:17:03.655\nWorks on a bunch of different program,\nplatforms.\n\n333\n00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:06.615\nBut it's a great way to summarize all\nthe information we're giving you.\n\n334\n00:17:06.615 --> 00:17:09.395\nMaking your notes and\nthen be able to test yourself on them so\n\n335\n00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:10.555\nthat we can go through and studies.\n\n336\n00:17:10.555 --> 00:17:12.715\nSo, just something for\nyou to think about here.\n\n337\n00:17:12.715 --> 00:17:14.615\nSo some additional models\nthat we wanna talk about.\n\n338\n00:17:14.615 --> 00:17:16.037\nWe're not gonna throw up a chart for\nthese.\n\n339\n00:17:16.037 --> 00:17:17.595\nI'm just gonna name them and\ntell you what they do.\n\n340\n00:17:17.595 --> 00:17:19.715\nThe Clark-Wilson integrity model.\n\n341\n00:17:19.715 --> 00:17:22.220\nClark-Wilson is gonna build on Biba.\n\n342\n00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.305\nBiba focuses on integrity, but\n\n343\n00:17:24.305 --> 00:17:30.030\nClark-Wilson is gonna focus on what we\ncall all three major goals of integrity.\n\n344\n00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.020\nBiba only focuses on one of\nthe key goals of integrity,\n\n345\n00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.940\nit doesn't focus across all three.\n\n346\n00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.690\nSo in this case, Clark-Wilson comes along\nand says, hey, I'm gonna improve on that.\n\n347\n00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.160\nLet me focus on all three goals.\n\n348\n00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.240\nLet me share with you what the goals\nof the integrity process are.\n\n349\n00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.150\nNumber one,\n\n350\n00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.590\npreventing unauthorized users from making\nmodifications to data or programs.\n\n351\n00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:50.540\nWell that's clearly what\nBiba is focused on.\n\n352\n00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.330\nSo we know they focus on that one.\n\n353\n00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:54.260\nClark-Wilson focuses on that.\n\n354\n00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.420\nBut it also focuses on\ntwo additional ones.\n\n355\n00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.920\nPreventing unauthorized, excuse me,\n\n356\n00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.800\npreventing authorized users from making\nimproper or unauthorized modifications.\n\n357\n00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.870\nBiba kinda hints at that and\nspeaks to that a little bit.\n\n358\n00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.930\nYou could make the argument that Biba\nkinda focuses on both in theory.\n\n359\n00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.170\nThe third one, maintaining internal and\nexternal consistency of data and programs\n\n360\n00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:17.700\nis really where Clark Wilson adds value,\nbecause it adds that one to the mix.\n\n361\n00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.770\nBecause Biba really doesn't address\nthat particular one overall.\n\n362\n00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:24.350\nSo preventing unauthorized users from\nmaking modifications, preventing\n\n363\n00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:28.590\nauthorized users from making improper\nmodifications and maintaining internal and\n\n364\n00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.310\nexternal consistency of data\nare the three functions of integrity.\n\n365\n00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.660\nClark Wilson focuses on all three,\n\n366\n00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.630\nplease make sure you know that\nClark Wilson focuses on all three.\n\n367\n00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:40.240\nYou should definitely know what they are,\nall right?\n\n368\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.600\nThe Leitner models, yet another model,\ncombines elements of Bell-LaPadula and\n\n369\n00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:44.760\nBiba together.\n\n370\n00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.610\nEffectively bringing them together.\n\n371\n00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.760\nThinking about assigning\naccess based on job role.\n\n372\n00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.200\nSo job function or\njob role is classified in Lipner.\n\n373\n00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.910\nIt's really the only thing you\nneed to know about Lipner per se.\n\n374\n00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.830\nThere's also something\ncalled the Brewer Nash or\n\n375\n00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:59.050\ninformally called the Chinese wall model.\n\n376\n00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:04.930\nThis is where we put up effectively\nsome sort of a break between places or\n\n377\n00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:09.170\nareas inside of an organization that\nmay have conflicting information.\n\n378\n00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:13.220\nSo the classic example of this is a law\nfirm that will potentially, in the pursuit\n\n379\n00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.670\nof a case, be hired to be both the defense\nand the prosecuting attorneys.\n\n380\n00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:21.740\nAnd the firewall, the Chinese wall\nbetween the two sides of the firm,\n\n381\n00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.910\nhas to be firmly in place so\nthat information about the defense and\n\n382\n00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:28.750\nthe prosecution is not gonna be shared\ninadvertently behind the scenes.\n\n383\n00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.680\nThis is what's called the Chinese Wall or\nBrewer Nash model.\n\n384\n00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.170\nIt's about conflict of interest.\n\n385\n00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.080\nThat's really what we're preventing and\nwhat we're ultimately focusing on.\n\n386\n00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.550\nThere's also something known\nas the Graham Denning model.\n\n387\n00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:43.140\nThe Graham Denning model is primarily\nconcerned with how subjects and\n\n388\n00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:44.350\nobjects are created.\n\n389\n00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:48.023\nSo how do we instantiate and\nauthorize and create users and data, and\n\n390\n00:19:48.023 --> 00:19:49.590\nhow do we control them?\n\n391\n00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:52.070\nHow subjects are assigned rights or\nprivileges, and\n\n392\n00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.080\nhow ownership of objects is managed.\n\n393\n00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:58.090\nThese are things that the Graham Denning\nModel is effectively gonna be focused on.\n\n394\n00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:59.130\nAgain, just another model.\n\n395\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.190\nOne of the many security models we have.\n\n396\n00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:03.700\nHarrison Reusal Almond, yet another model.\n\n397\n00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.870\nVery similar to the Graham Denning Model,\n\n398\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:09.209\nit is gonna be focused on the kinds of\nthings that Graham Denning does as well.\n\n399\n00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.000\nAll these models, and\nthere are many more of them by the way,\n\n400\n00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.560\nthese are just the select sampling that\nwe've offered for you on today's menu.\n\n401\n00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.340\nRight?\n\n402\n00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:21.265\nBut, the menu, or these security model du\njour, I guess is what we would call that.\n\n403\n00:20:21.265 --> 00:20:23.264\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, the idea behind all these models is\n\n404\n00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:26.980\nthat they are going to explain to us or\nhelp us to understand through explaining\n\n405\n00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.643\nto us different elements of functionality\nwith regards to confidentially,\n\n406\n00:20:30.643 --> 00:20:34.455\nwith regards to integrity, with regards\nto subject and object interactions.\n\n407\n00:20:34.455 --> 00:20:36.240\nThis is what security\nmodels are focused on and\n\n408\n00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.110\nwhat we have to make sure we\nunderstand with regards to them.\n\n409\n00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.556\nWhen we think about security models,\n\n410\n00:20:40.556 --> 00:20:43.186\nwe also have to think about the idea\nof understanding requirements.\n\n411\n00:20:43.186 --> 00:20:46.215\nWe've talked a lot about gathering\nrequirements and understanding them,\n\n412\n00:20:46.215 --> 00:20:48.070\ndefining them, documenting them.\n\n413\n00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:52.570\nCapturing and analyzing requirements, the\nmodels help us to do this by explaining to\n\n414\n00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:57.040\nus this capabilities or these capabilities\nwill exist in this particular model and\n\n415\n00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.620\nwe'll focus on them and\nif you have these requirements this\n\n416\n00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.110\nparticular model will be a good model for\nyou to consider.\n\n417\n00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.460\nSo if you have integrity requirements and\nneeds.\n\n418\n00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.570\nSomething like Biba or Clark-Wilson.\n\n419\n00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:09.930\nIf you have confidentiality requirements\nand needs, Bell-Lapadula, right?\n\n420\n00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.590\nSo understanding requirements\nis very important.\n\n421\n00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.070\nBut we have to define what\nkind of requirements we have.\n\n422\n00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.230\nWe have two specific types of\nrequirements we want to be aware of.\n\n423\n00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.520\nWe have functional requirements and\nnonfunctional requirements.\n\n424\n00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:24.785\nFunctional requirements address what\nthe design must do or accomplish.\n\n425\n00:21:24.785 --> 00:21:28.752\nNon-functional requirements focus on\nqualities of the service, enhancing,\n\n426\n00:21:28.752 --> 00:21:32.090\nin effect, reliability and\nperformance, things of that nature.\n\n427\n00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:35.805\nSo functional requirements are all\nabout exactly what the design must do.\n\n428\n00:21:35.805 --> 00:21:38.750\nNon-functional requirements about\nthe best way to get that done and\n\n429\n00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.700\nadd value in the process,\nis what we would often talk about.\n\n430\n00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.840\nSo different types of requirements.\n\n431\n00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.150\nHow do we capture requirements?\n\n432\n00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.960\nMore often than not we ask questions.\n\n433\n00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:52.170\nWe go off and we engage in interviewing,\nand we hold workshops, and\n\n434\n00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:55.460\nwe ask people to give us information\nabout what they wanna accomplish.\n\n435\n00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.630\nAnd we write that down.\n\n436\n00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:00.390\nAnd then we distill that into a set of\nrequirements that we then run by people to\n\n437\n00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:01.810\nensure that we've captured them correctly.\n\n438\n00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:03.660\nIf you're very good as listening and\n\n439\n00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.400\nvery good at taking notes and remembering\nwhat you've heard, then you're probably\n\n440\n00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.610\ngonna be very good as requirements\ncapturing and requirements gathering.\n\n441\n00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.860\nIf you're not, then you may need to get\nsome people to help you because you\n\n442\n00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.060\nmay miss pertinent facts\nthat are very important.\n\n443\n00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.250\nSo if you're one of those people\nthat has the conversation about,\n\n444\n00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.270\nall this stuff is said and\nthen turn around to somebody and say,\n\n445\n00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:22.960\nwhat, what did you just, what,\nI wasn't paying attention, I'm sorry.\n\n446\n00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.750\nYou don't want to do requirements\ngathering for a living.\n\n447\n00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.150\nThat's not gonna be a really\ngood outcome for you, right?\n\n448\n00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:28.480\nSo my wife hates that, by that way.\n\n449\n00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.670\nCuz I'm one of those people\nthat you could talk to me,\n\n450\n00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:34.380\nI will be off doing five other things\nin a different room of the house.\n\n451\n00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.760\nYou could say two words, I will hear them.\n\n452\n00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.630\nI won't acknowledge them,\nbut I know what you said.\n\n453\n00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:42.000\nAnd then I'll play those back for you at\nany point in time when you ask on demand-\n\n454\n00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.940\n>> You aren't listening to me.\n\n455\n00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.440\n>> Exactly like you said it.\n\n456\n00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.730\nSo she'll say something to me, and\nshe'll accuse me of not listening.\n\n457\n00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:51.300\nI'll turn around and straight-faced\nexplain to her exactly what she just said.\n\n458\n00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.080\nShe walks out of the room frustrated,\nshe can't stand when I do that.\n\n459\n00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.530\nBecause I'm just that way,\nthat's how I'm wired.\n\n460\n00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.790\nBecause being a teacher especially for\nso many years.\n\n461\n00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.230\nYou have to get very\ngood at understanding and\n\n462\n00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.890\nlistening to what's going on in your\nclassroom so you can manage it.\n\n463\n00:23:04.890 --> 00:23:05.470\nRight?\n\n464\n00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.660\nI have the benefit, right now,\n\n465\n00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.320\nof having Mike here with me to\nobviously have a convention with and\n\n466\n00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.905\ntalk to, but there's really nobody in the\nstudio with us while we're talking to you.\n\n467\n00:23:12.905 --> 00:23:14.415\nThere's no audience, per se.\n\n468\n00:23:14.415 --> 00:23:15.315\nAll of you are virtual.\n\n469\n00:23:15.315 --> 00:23:16.195\nYou're remote.\n\n470\n00:23:16.195 --> 00:23:18.385\nAnd as a result,\nyou're not interacting with us directly.\n\n471\n00:23:18.385 --> 00:23:21.015\nYou may be sending us\nchats on the chat screen.\n\n472\n00:23:21.015 --> 00:23:22.205\nWe may be keeping up with you there.\n\n473\n00:23:22.205 --> 00:23:24.415\nBut it's not really the same\nthing as being in front of us.\n\n474\n00:23:24.415 --> 00:23:27.675\nWhen I have a studio full of live people,\nand I'm interacting with them,\n\n475\n00:23:27.675 --> 00:23:30.855\nor a classroom full of live people,\nI gotta actually really listen and\n\n476\n00:23:30.855 --> 00:23:32.930\npay attention to what's\nhappening while I'm teaching.\n\n477\n00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:33.820\nMy students hate that as well.\n\n478\n00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.830\nIt's the last question,\nparrot it back exactly.\n\n479\n00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.080\nWhat are you?\n\n480\n00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.260\nIt's crazy!\n\n481\n00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:42.530\nSo if you're good at that, you're\nreally good at requirements gathering.\n\n482\n00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.420\nI happen to suck at requirements\ngathering, but I'm really good at that, so\n\n483\n00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.410\njust so you know.\n\n484\n00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.695\nSo it's not a 100% guarantee for\neverything.\n\n485\n00:23:48.695 --> 00:23:51.745\nAll right, so information systems\nsecurity evaluation models, right.\n\n486\n00:23:51.745 --> 00:23:54.077\nWanna think about the role\nthat these models play and\n\n487\n00:23:54.077 --> 00:23:55.405\nhow they help us to do things.\n\n488\n00:23:55.405 --> 00:23:57.765\nSecurity policy obviously very important.\n\n489\n00:23:57.765 --> 00:24:00.905\nTalked about this, documents and\nsecurity requirements.\n\n490\n00:24:00.905 --> 00:24:04.819\nSecurity models themselves are going to be\nused to implement the thought process and\n\n491\n00:24:04.819 --> 00:24:07.411\nthe specification for\nthe functional requirements and\n\n492\n00:24:07.411 --> 00:24:11.480\nnon-functional requirements we need to\naccomplish the goals of the policy.\n\n493\n00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.930\nAnd then as a result of that,\n\n494\n00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.310\nwe can manage towards the idea of\nhow to implement a secure system.\n\n495\n00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:19.210\nThis is really how all this\ncomes together for us, right?\n\n496\n00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.410\nAnd in order to do that, we have to\nthink about evaluation criteria.\n\n497\n00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.570\nHow do we measure what security is?\n\n498\n00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:27.400\nHow do we think about those things and\nwhat's that gonna look like?\n\n499\n00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:31.110\nNot quite yet but we're gonna get to that\nwhole conversation about how to do this.\n\n500\n00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:34.040\nBut first we have to think about what\nthe criteria is for just a second, right?\n\n501\n00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.560\nWhen we think about evaluating criteria.\n\n502\n00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.410\nIt's kind of like saying,\nI want to bake something.\n\n503\n00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:39.770\nWell, what do you want to bake?\n\n504\n00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.500\nWe got to be a little bit more specific.\n\n505\n00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.720\nSo, the criteria we evaluate are going\nto be the requirements that we\n\n506\n00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.140\nthink of when we build the system.\n\n507\n00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:47.860\nDoes it do this?\n\n508\n00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.470\nDoes it do that?\n\n509\n00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.420\nIs it meeting that specification?\n\n510\n00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.310\nBut, also the functional elements.\n\n511\n00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:55.090\nThe features and\ncapabilities of the system.\n\n512\n00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.500\nThat's really what we have to evaluate.\n\n513\n00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.310\nSo, evaluation criteria\n\n514\n00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:03.330\nis really going to be about making sure\nthat whatever the process or function or\n\n515\n00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:07.640\nsystem is that we're looking at,\nevaluating means effectively to examine.\n\n516\n00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.500\nThat the criteria we use to do\nthat are gonna be the things\n\n517\n00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:11.150\nthat we want to accomplish.\n\n518\n00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.340\nAccomplish ultimately.\n\n519\n00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.770\nWhat are the goals are designed to\ncreate or to effectively address?\n\n520\n00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.440\nAnd if it does those things we\nshould evaluate the system and\n\n521\n00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.530\nunderstand whether it does\nthem in a certain way or not.\n\n522\n00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.120\nIf it doesn't we should\nbe aware of that as well.\n\n523\n00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:27.360\nSo evaluation criteria\nis really about assuring\n\n524\n00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:29.500\nthe person who's gonna use the system and\n\n525\n00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.880\nmeet certain specific criteria, certain\nspecific requirements have been met.\n\n526\n00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.070\nAnd that they can rely on those\nrequirements being there at all times.\n\n527\n00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:38.450\nThis is very important.\n\n528\n00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.120\nSo we want to make sure we think\nabout evaluation criteria.\n\n529\n00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.610\nBut we also want to make sure we think\nabout certification and accreditation.\n\n530\n00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:47.910\nIt's a set of terms we often\nhear about in the government,\n\n531\n00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.360\nperhaps in the military sectors.\n\n532\n00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.410\nCertainly in the United States and\nother government and\n\n533\n00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.310\nmilitary areas around\nthe world we hear of this.\n\n534\n00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.350\nBut we don't often hear\nabout certification and\n\n535\n00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.860\naccreditation in the private sector.\n\n536\n00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.790\nIt's not something that's\ndone as often there.\n\n537\n00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.800\nSo we wanna think about that,\nwanna think about what it is.\n\n538\n00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.510\nDo you know the difference\nbetween certification and\n\n539\n00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:03.430\naccreditation, by the way?\n\n540\n00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.990\n>> I do not.\n\n541\n00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:05.170\n>> You do not.\n\n542\n00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:05.680\nNeither do I.\n\n543\n00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.990\nI was hoping you did so\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n544\n00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:07.820\n>> figure that out and\n\n545\n00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.330\ntell all those nice people out there\nwho don't know either what it is.\n\n546\n00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:12.100\nAll right, so\nsince Mike is not willing to step up and\n\n547\n00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.870\nhelp us out here let's talk about what\ncertification and accreditation is.\n\n548\n00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:18.470\nSo, lucky for you I do happen to\nreally know what the difference is.\n\n549\n00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:20.640\n>> Somehow I knew.\n>> Somehow Mike knew that I knew.\n\n550\n00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.900\nThat's why we didn't\nhave to worry about that.\n\n551\n00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.590\nSo the idea was sort was certification\nof accreditation was actually very\n\n552\n00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:25.370\nstraight forward.\n\n553\n00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:27.610\nPeople often make it out\nto be more than it is.\n\n554\n00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:29.340\nWhen we are certifying a system,\n\n555\n00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.020\nwe are crediting a system when\nwe talk about it in those terms.\n\n556\n00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.850\nRemember, we've been talking broadly\nabout system engineering, right?\n\n557\n00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.350\nDesigning systems,\nfiguring out how to architect them.\n\n558\n00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:40.680\nAnd so certification of accreditation\nis all about this process.\n\n559\n00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.930\nBut it's about different stages.\n\n560\n00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.140\nAnd specifically different\noutcomes in the process.\n\n561\n00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:47.620\nWhen we certify a system\nwe are effectively saying\n\n562\n00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:52.580\nthat the system has been delivered and\nis being given to that particular person.\n\n563\n00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.140\nWhoever is the stake holder.\n\n564\n00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.680\nThe person who is going to\neffectively accept the system.\n\n565\n00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.020\nWe are certifying,\nwe're saying it does these things.\n\n566\n00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:02.900\nSo if you said I have five requirements\nand I certify the system, I need to\n\n567\n00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:06.230\ncertify that it meets all five or I have\nto stipulate that we skipped two and\n\n568\n00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.770\nit is only going to be three of the five,\nwhatever that is.\n\n569\n00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:12.280\nSo certification is effectively\n\n570\n00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.950\nthe statement of what the system\ndoes when it is being delivered.\n\n571\n00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.310\nAnd we have to give that\nfunctional statement,\n\n572\n00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.090\nwhat the system is capable of doing.\n\n573\n00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:24.870\nWe have to give that to the stakeholder,\nand they have to sign off on that,\n\n574\n00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.930\nthey have to accept\nthe system certification.\n\n575\n00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.270\nBecause if they accept\nthe system certification,\n\n576\n00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.060\nthey accept the system as delivered.\n\n577\n00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.540\nThey then can go ahead and decide to\nturn the system on and operate it.\n\n578\n00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.310\nWhen they do that they\nare accrediting the system.\n\n579\n00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:42.500\nAccreditation is the act of acceptance\nof the system as delivered.\n\n580\n00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.670\nAs certified in order to then operate\nthe system with all the bells, whistles,\n\n581\n00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.290\nbumps, and the works that go with it.\n\n582\n00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:53.180\nIt's the act of the stakeholder\naccepting the system as certified for\n\n583\n00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.770\nactual operation,\nthat's what accreditation is.\n\n584\n00:27:55.770 --> 00:28:00.480\nSo systems must be certified\nin order to be accredited, but\n\n585\n00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:04.520\nnot all systems are accredited\nonce they are certified.\n\n586\n00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.970\nSo think about the logic of that.\n\n587\n00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.000\nIn order to operate a system,\nit must be first certified.\n\n588\n00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.920\nOkay, we get that.\n\n589\n00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.870\nYou gotta tell me what the system's\ncapable of doing before I decide whether\n\n590\n00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.270\nI wanna turn it on and do that.\n\n591\n00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.130\nThat's certification.\n\n592\n00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:17.520\nWhen we certify a system,\n\n593\n00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.850\nthat's not a guarantee that\na system will be accredited.\n\n594\n00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.710\nThat's not a guarantee that\nthe stakeholder will accept the system as\n\n595\n00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.980\ndelivered and\nchoose to operate the system.\n\n596\n00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.960\nBecause now what we're really\ntalking about is acceptance of risk.\n\n597\n00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.510\nAnd we have to link the idea\nof risk to certification and\n\n598\n00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:33.920\naccreditation, because just\nbecause the system is certified\n\n599\n00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.590\ndoesn't mean that we want to\noperate that system that way.\n\n600\n00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:39.940\nWe may not be willing to accredit\nthe system, to turn it on,\n\n601\n00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:41.250\ngiven the certification.\n\n602\n00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:46.000\nWe may feel that's not acceptable, or the\nsystem may have taken so long to become\n\n603\n00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.380\na viable system to be certified that it no\nlonger meets the operational criteria and\n\n604\n00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.310\nso we're not going to accredit it,\ngive it the right to operate,\n\n605\n00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:54.540\nin order to turn it on.\n\n606\n00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:57.410\nBecause if we did it wouldn't meet\nthe mission objectives we have.\n\n607\n00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:00.390\nSo this is a potential conundrum,\na potential problem for us.\n\n608\n00:29:00.390 --> 00:29:02.190\nSystems can be certified, but\n\n609\n00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.780\ncertification does not necessarily\nequate to accreditation.\n\n610\n00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.270\nSo I want to think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n611\n00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:10.210\nIt's very, very important as we\ncontinue this thought process of\n\n612\n00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:14.130\n\"Hey how do I effectively know whether a\nsystem does what I want it to do, right\"?\n\n613\n00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:16.160\nThe evaluation criteria tell us that, but\n\n614\n00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.590\nwe also have to map to the requirements\nassociated with that to understand that.\n\n615\n00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:23.490\nAnd we go through different certification\nphases in order to be able to figure out\n\n616\n00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.740\nwhat that ultimately looks like, and\nwe walk through that process certifying\n\n617\n00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:30.140\nsystems, and then maybe ultimately\ncrediting them as we go.\n\n618\n00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.030\nIf management decides to accept\nthe system as delivered.\n\n619\n00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:33.740\nAs certified and\n\n620\n00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.910\naccept the risk of running it,\nwe say the system has been accredited.\n\n621\n00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:38.410\nVery important for us to think about.\n\n622\n00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.150\nCan we go ahead and maybe just squeeze in,\noh I don't know, five more minutes of\n\n623\n00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.830\na conversation around-\n>> Absolutely.\n\n624\n00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.340\n>> Information types, or should we\ngo ahead and maybe come on back for\n\n625\n00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:46.970\nanother episode?\n\n626\n00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:47.480\nWhat do you think?\n\n627\n00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:48.370\n>> Oh, I think we just keep on going.\n\n628\n00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:48.920\n>> Just keep on going.\n\n629\n00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.440\n>> How about you guys?\n\n630\n00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.200\nI'm loving it.\n>> All right.\n\n631\n00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.510\nYou guys loving it?\n\n632\n00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.450\nWe're not getting any feedback,\nno love either way.\n\n633\n00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.260\nBut we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna push through.\n\n634\n00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.380\nWe're just about at the point\nwhere we're out of topics, but\n\n635\n00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.030\nwe have three more things\nwe have to talk about.\n\n636\n00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:00.950\nI'm gonna squeeze them in here for\nyou really quickly,\n\n637\n00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.880\nand then we're gonna wrap up this episode.\n\n638\n00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.340\nSo when we think about certification\naccreditation, we also want to think about\n\n639\n00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.960\nis, we go back to that idea, circle\nback to the idea of evaluation criteria.\n\n640\n00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.600\nAnd we're gonna bring that forward, we're\ngonna talk about the different ways in\n\n641\n00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.250\nwhich we effectively develop\nevaluation criteria.\n\n642\n00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:18.060\nThere have been three systems\nover time that have been used for\n\n643\n00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.480\ninformation security evaluation criteria.\n\n644\n00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.530\nThe original one is something I\ntalked about in the earlier episode\n\n645\n00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.860\nthat's paired with this,\nthe part one of part two.\n\n646\n00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.785\nWe talked quickly about the TCSEC,\nwhat's known as the Orange Book.\n\n647\n00:30:28.785 --> 00:30:32.135\nAnd we talked about the ITSEC and\nwe talked about the Common Criteria.\n\n648\n00:30:32.135 --> 00:30:34.845\nWe actually showed you\nthe Common Criteria web portal.\n\n649\n00:30:34.845 --> 00:30:37.635\nSo I wanna go back through those\nright now and quickly explain them.\n\n650\n00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:41.625\nThe TCSEC stands for Trusted\nComputer System Evaluation Criteria.\n\n651\n00:30:41.625 --> 00:30:45.175\nIt's commonly called the Orange Book\nbecause there was a series of books\n\n652\n00:30:45.175 --> 00:30:49.235\nout by IBM back in the 1970s that\nhelped us to understand system and\n\n653\n00:30:49.235 --> 00:30:50.610\nsecurity architecture.\n\n654\n00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:52.950\nEveryone of them had\na color coded cover and\n\n655\n00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:56.360\nthe bulk of them had been lost to the\nthe mist of time but the Orange Book and\n\n656\n00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.190\nthe red book were the two\nthat really stood out.\n\n657\n00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:59.950\nThe Orange Book became the basis for\n\n658\n00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:04.480\nthe TCSEC the red book was called the TNI\nthe Trusted Network Interpretation\n\n659\n00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.920\nthey talked about how to set up trusted or\nsecure networks.\n\n660\n00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.320\nIf you're interested in finding out\nmore about them Actually go out and\n\n661\n00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:11.950\nGoogle the Orange Book,\nor rather, excuse me,\n\n662\n00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:15.550\nGoogle the Rainbow series, which is\nthe name for the entire series of books.\n\n663\n00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:18.200\nBut Google the Rainbow series, you'll\nactually find a copy of them online.\n\n664\n00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.610\nThey are digitized,\nyou can actually download them today and\n\n665\n00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.540\nyou could take a look at them, but there's\nreally no reason to look at them any more,\n\n666\n00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.660\nwe really don't use them for anything,\nthey're just a historical footnote.\n\n667\n00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.710\nBut the Orange Book was\nthe book that came up with or\n\n668\n00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:32.700\nallowed us to come up with what's known as\nthe TCSEC, the Trusted Computing System,\n\n669\n00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.050\nor Computer System, Evaluations Criteria.\n\n670\n00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.820\nThis was the United States DOD,\nDepartment of Defense,\n\n671\n00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:40.880\ntake on how to build\nsecure computing systems.\n\n672\n00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.854\nUnique to their environmental operational\nin our operational variables and\n\n673\n00:31:44.854 --> 00:31:47.000\nall things they do inside their systems.\n\n674\n00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.761\nReally not widely used outside of\nthe US government and the military but\n\n675\n00:31:50.761 --> 00:31:55.160\nit was the first general thought process\nwe had about evaluation system criteria.\n\n676\n00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:58.854\nThe summer of the Orange Book evaluation\ncriteria we have a chart for, we're gonna\n\n677\n00:31:58.854 --> 00:32:02.100\nquickly just show you what they are,\njust so you could see what they are.\n\n678\n00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.274\nYou'll see them there,\nwe have Evaluation Division on the left,\n\n679\n00:32:05.274 --> 00:32:08.970\nwe have Evaluation Class in the middle,\nwe have Degree of Trust on the right.\n\n680\n00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:12.800\nWe're gonna scroll down a little in a\nmoment cuz there is some stuff down below.\n\n681\n00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.780\nAnd actually,\nlet's scroll down to the bottom and\n\n682\n00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.240\ncome back up cuz we start at the bottom.\n\n683\n00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:21.840\nSo evaluation division on the left,\nwhich is D for very, very lowest class,\n\n684\n00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:25.400\nminimal protection, is gonna be\nclassified as evaluation criteria,\n\n685\n00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.310\nevaluation class level D1.\n\n686\n00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.700\nMinimal protection provides\nthe lowest degree of trust,\n\n687\n00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.980\nlowest degree of security in other words.\n\n688\n00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:37.480\nWe work our way up from class D1\nall the way up through C and B and\n\n689\n00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.020\nup ultimately to A.\n\n690\n00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.580\nTo A1 at the top of the list,\nwe can scroll back up.\n\n691\n00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.750\nA1 at the top of the list, which is\nverified protection, verified design, and\n\n692\n00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.560\nthe highest degree of trust.\n\n693\n00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.150\nA1 systems are considered to be\nartificially intelligent systems by\n\n694\n00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:55.200\ntoday's standards, meaning systems that\nare capable of learning on their own and\n\n695\n00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:57.240\ndeveloping awareness on their own.\n\n696\n00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.290\nThat would be considered to be\nan A1 Verified Design system.\n\n697\n00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:05.260\nSo we have this ranking model in the TCSEC\nthat's based on an alphabetical ranking,\n\n698\n00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.000\nA, B, C, D.\n\n699\n00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.200\nD being the lowest, A being the highest.\n\n700\n00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.670\nAnd sub-levels within there.\n\n701\n00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:13.400\nSo if you look at B, Mandatory Protection,\nfor instance, you'll see B1, B2,\n\n702\n00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.220\nand B3 as we go up.\n\n703\n00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:22.754\nAnd B1 is going to be less secure than B2,\nand B3 is more secure than B2 etc.\n\n704\n00:33:22.754 --> 00:33:24.430\nSo you get the idea as we move up.\n\n705\n00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:28.990\nSo the idea ultimately is that we go from\nD all the way through A with the TCSEC.\n\n706\n00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:32.270\nThis is one set of evaluation criteria.\n\n707\n00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.590\nWe also have what's known as the ITSEC.\n\n708\n00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:37.000\nWe don't have a chart for ITSEC,\nbut we're going to stay here for\n\n709\n00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.650\njust a second, because we're going to show\nyou another chart in just a minute for\n\n710\n00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:41.770\nthe common criteria.\n\n711\n00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.340\nSo that way we get to stay here\ninstead of flipping back and forth.\n\n712\n00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.808\nAnd having you see me for\na second, then not seeing me again.\n\n713\n00:33:46.808 --> 00:33:51.420\nSo the ITSEC is what happens when\nthe other areas of the world,\n\n714\n00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.620\nsome of the other countries get together\nand say we want our own standard too.\n\n715\n00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:57.170\nWe want to evaluation criteria standard.\n\n716\n00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:00.725\nAnd so they create something that's based,\ninitially, on the TC SEC but\n\n717\n00:34:00.725 --> 00:34:03.930\nhas a little bit of a slightly different\ntake, they call that the ITSEC,\n\n718\n00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:07.850\nInformation Technology\nSecurity Evaluation Criteria.\n\n719\n00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:12.068\nThe ITSEC was used by a group of countries\nbut not internationally agreed upon and\n\n720\n00:34:12.068 --> 00:34:13.070\nrecognized.\n\n721\n00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.952\nNot everybody thought\nthe ITSEC was a good idea.\n\n722\n00:34:15.952 --> 00:34:20.970\nThe ITSEC had requirement\nlevels from E1 through E6, so\n\n723\n00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:26.910\nyou saw E1, E2, E3 instead of D1 or\nA1 or B2 or D3 or whatever.\n\n724\n00:34:26.910 --> 00:34:28.810\nSo we have that with the ITSEC.\n\n725\n00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.800\nThat didn't stick around very long,\nit was there for a few years.\n\n726\n00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:33.370\nNot everybody got together and\nagreed on it.\n\n727\n00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:36.590\nSo instead, we moved to what's\nknown as the common criteria.\n\n728\n00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:42.040\nCommon criteria, remember, is ISO\nstandard 15408, so what we're going to do\n\n729\n00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:47.420\nis show you what the evaluation\ncriteria for, the common criteria are.\n\n730\n00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:51.710\nThe common criteria uses the concept of\nwhat are known as protection profiles.\n\n731\n00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:55.910\nA protection profile is effectively\na set of common functional and\n\n732\n00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:58.370\nassurance requirements that are evaluated.\n\n733\n00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:03.310\nAnd then as a result of that we ascribe\nan EAL, a Evaluation Assurance Level,\n\n734\n00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:06.190\nthat's what EAL stands for,\nan EAL ranking or\n\n735\n00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:11.195\nlevel, to that particular product\nfrom EAL 1 all the way through EAL\n\n736\n00:35:11.195 --> 00:35:14.640\n7as you can see as we scroll down\ntowards the bottom of the list.\n\n737\n00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.210\nGoing from lowest to ultimately\nhighest level of confidence.\n\n738\n00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:21.740\nAnd so we are gaining confidence\nas we go higher in the model, and\n\n739\n00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:25.630\nyou can see that each in the middle,\nin the long-name column in the middle,\n\n740\n00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:31.320\neach EAL level has a kind\nof formality to it.\n\n741\n00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.790\nIt's either functionally tested or\nstructurally tested or\n\n742\n00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:36.870\nmethodically tested and checked.\n\n743\n00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:40.080\nOr semi-formally verified,\nyou get the sense of that.\n\n744\n00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.780\nSo as we scroll down and as we move\nthrough all the different levels,\n\n745\n00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:47.570\nright, the idea is that we're\ngetting more protection, and\n\n746\n00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:51.890\nas a result of that more confidence in\nthe system that we are ultimately gonna\n\n747\n00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:56.720\ncertify and use because it meets\nhigher criteria for being accepted.\n\n748\n00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:02.150\nSo formally verified and designed and\ntested systems which is EAL, level number\n\n749\n00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:07.500\n7 is going to be a system that is\nrigorously tested, formally verified,\n\n750\n00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:14.040\nand ultimately is going to be an\nincredibly secure system, one that is most\n\n751\n00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:18.660\nlikely gonna operate the highest levels\nof security in most modern systems today.\n\n752\n00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:21.410\nWhereas as an EAL certified\nsystem at level 1 or\n\n753\n00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:23.600\n2 is a relatively low level system.\n\n754\n00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.030\nOne that has a very low\nlevel of confidence in it.\n\n755\n00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:29.270\nIf you want more information on the common\ncriteria, we'd invite you and encourage\n\n756\n00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:34.370\nyou to go out and to ultimately look\nat the ISO standard as I talked about.\n\n757\n00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:38.100\nThe ISO standard for\nthe common criteria, 15408.\n\n758\n00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:39.580\nGo out to the common criteria portal.\n\n759\n00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:41.850\nWe've shown you that in\none of the prior episodes.\n\n760\n00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.500\nAnd dig around a little bit,\nread up more about it and understand it.\n\n761\n00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:49.040\nI'll put this in perspective,\nthe TCSEC, ITSEC, and common criteria\n\n762\n00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:53.830\nare all different evaluation systems that\ncould be used to use evaluation criteria\n\n763\n00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:56.990\nto rank the security and confidence and\ntrust we have in a system.\n\n764\n00:36:56.990 --> 00:37:00.990\nThe most modern format that we use\ntoday for that is the common criteria.\n\n765\n00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:03.760\nAnd that's the one you want\nto make sure you're aware of.\n\n766\n00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.440\n>> Very good, Adam.\n\n767\n00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.030\nI tell you what,\n\n768\n00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:07.940\nI'm gonna have to agree with one of our\nchat members out there at this point.\n\n769\n00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:10.590\nWe talked about continuing on or\ncalling it short.\n\n770\n00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.080\nWe all said we loved it.\n\n771\n00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.450\nBrains are bleeding at this point.\n\n772\n00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:16.150\nA lot of information but fantastic stuff.\n\n773\n00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.370\nI think I could sit here and\nlisten to you forever.\n\n774\n00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:19.290\nGood stuff, we loved it.\n\n775\n00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.605\n>> Don't threaten if you're\nnot willing to back that up.\n\n776\n00:37:21.605 --> 00:37:22.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay.\n\n777\n00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.260\n>> All right, well a great look again.\n\n778\n00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.240\nKind of rounding out our look\nat those security models.\n\n779\n00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.670\nA lot of great graphics there to really\nhelp us wrap our brain around those.\n\n780\n00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:32.830\nWe'll give us any of those\nweb pages we talked about.\n\n781\n00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:35.260\nI'll make sure I put links for\nthem in the notes.\n\n782\n00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.920\nAnd I'll throw those charts that we\nmade and those lists we've made,\n\n783\n00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.250\nthose will be out there as well.\n\n784\n00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:41.960\nSo if you wanna go back and\nlook at any of those, looking for\n\n785\n00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:44.640\nthem up there on our\nwebsite in the show notes.\n\n786\n00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:48.092\nAll right, well remember,\nif you guys wanna see Adam or\n\n787\n00:37:48.092 --> 00:37:52.729\nattend one of his live classes,\nshoot us an email, SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n788\n00:37:52.729 --> 00:37:54.360\nThat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n789\n00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.190\nSigning off, I'm Mike

--> 00:00:17.095\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:21.935\nToday we're doing our CISSP, and\nspecifically, we're going to be getting\n\n5\n00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:26.926\ninto our controls and capabilities in\nregards to some of the security models and\n\n6\n00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:30.821\nstandards that we've been going\nover in previous episodes.\n\n7\n00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:33.120\nAnd here to help us with this is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.000\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.628\n>> Good, good.\n\n10\n00:00:34.628 --> 00:00:38.140\nHope everybody is doing well\nthis fine December morning.\n\n11\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.830\nSo we're gonna talk a little\nbit about controls and\n\n12\n00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.470\ncountermeasures based on some standards.\n\n13\n00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.283\nWe've already mentioned some of these,\n\n14\n00:00:44.283 --> 00:00:47.234\nand we're just gonna basically treat\nthis more as a quick review and\n\n15\n00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:50.235\na focus on control elements associated\nwith it, as opposed to a hey,\n\n16\n00:00:50.235 --> 00:00:53.851\nwe've never heard these before, let's\nspend a lot of time talking about stuff.\n\n17\n00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.582\nSo when we think about controls,\nand let's just step back and\n\n18\n00:00:56.582 --> 00:01:00.590\ntalk about what a control theoretically\nis, before we talk about the standards.\n\n19\n00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.521\nA control, generically, is going to be\n\n20\n00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:08.270\na piece of guidance that we're\ngoing to recommend you implement,\n\n21\n00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.130\naccording to the standard,\nto achieve some sort of end result.\n\n22\n00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.544\nSo if I say to Mike in a conversation,\nhey,\n\n23\n00:01:13.544 --> 00:01:16.506\nwe're having this issue\nwith access control here.\n\n24\n00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:19.019\nPeople are just walking in and\nout of doors here, and\n\n25\n00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:22.105\nthey're not really paying attention\nto the signs that say hey,\n\n26\n00:01:22.105 --> 00:01:25.500\ndon't make a lot of noise, or\nhey, this room is being occupied.\n\n27\n00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.310\nSo we gotta come up with a control\nmechanism, some sort of way of\n\n28\n00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.440\ncurtailing that behavior and asking people\nto effectively do something different.\n\n29\n00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.070\nSo the controls we may come up with may\nbe some sort of a lock that only allows\n\n30\n00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.864\npeople with a cardkey or some sort of\naccess control like a key fob to come in.\n\n31\n00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:48.204\nWe may come up with putting a guard out\nfront that will only allow people through\n\n32\n00:01:48.204 --> 00:01:49.950\nif they're authorized.\n\n33\n00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.710\nWe may put a light over the door that\nsays, hey, we're recording, or hey,\n\n34\n00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.250\ndon't make noise when the light is on cuz\nwe know that's sometime effective as well.\n\n35\n00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.710\nSo we can do all these different\nthings that potentially would\n\n36\n00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.518\nallow people to understand they\nhave to act in a certain way, and\n\n37\n00:02:04.518 --> 00:02:05.772\nthis is really what a control implies.\n\n38\n00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:10.070\nIt's some sort of a item,\nsome sort of a thought process,\n\n39\n00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.040\nsome sort of a capability that we will\ndeploy in order to achieve an end result.\n\n40\n00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.310\nWe want to modify behavior,\neffectively constrain it in some way, and\n\n41\n00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.390\nthen act according to what the control\nallows us to do, or in some cases,\n\n42\n00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.420\nwhat it tells us we can't do.\n\n43\n00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.640\nAnd so with the thought process about\na control defined, what we really\n\n44\n00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.550\nwanna think about here is what\nare the controls that are important for\n\n45\n00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.040\ninformation security with regards to some\nof the standards we've already mentioned.\n\n46\n00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.470\nSo for instance, the ISO 27001 and\n\n47\n00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.360\n27002 standards that we've talked about\nthat help us to understand how to\n\n48\n00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.540\nbuild what's known as the ISMS, the\nInformation Security Management System,\n\n49\n00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.500\nwhich is effectively the overarching\ninformation security framework.\n\n50\n00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.110\nWe could call it\nthe Enterprise Security Architecture.\n\n51\n00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.510\nPeople refer to it different ways.\n\n52\n00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.060\nUltimately, how do we come up with the\ncontrols that will help us to frame that\n\n53\n00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.540\nconversation and enact the behavioral\nelements and enact the auditability\n\n54\n00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.950\nelements and enact the policy-based\nelements that ultimately frame what\n\n55\n00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.540\nthe Information Security Management System\nwill look like within the organization.\n\n56\n00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.000\nAnd so when we look at\nthese particular standards,\n\n57\n00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.318\nwe have a list of controls that help us\nbased on focus area to come up with those.\n\n58\n00:03:24.318 --> 00:03:28.906\nSo the key focus areas of the ISO 27001,\n27002 standard series\n\n59\n00:03:28.906 --> 00:03:33.198\nare gonna be general requirements,\nthis is one of the key areas.\n\n60\n00:03:33.198 --> 00:03:36.390\nSo what are the overarching thought\nprocesses that helps us to frame\n\n61\n00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.160\nthe ISMS conversation,\nmanagement responsibility?\n\n62\n00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.430\nHow do we oversee, how do we manage,\nhow do we ascribe and\n\n63\n00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.730\ntherefore portion accountability and\nresponsibility?\n\n64\n00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.880\nWhat are the internal ISMS\nauditing capabilities, so\n\n65\n00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.627\nhow do we keep track of\nthings that are going on?\n\n66\n00:03:52.627 --> 00:03:54.840\nHow do we know that things are happening,\nor that they're not?\n\n67\n00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.500\nWhat are our traceability, our visibility,\nand our auditability requirements?\n\n68\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.380\nManagement review of the ISMS,\nhow do we review what's going on?\n\n69\n00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.660\nMaking sure we understand the as is,\nbut also the to be state,\n\n70\n00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.400\nmaking sure we're aware\nof what's happening.\n\n71\n00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.640\nAnd how do we ultimately\nfocus on improvement?\n\n72\n00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.150\nThese are the key areas that\nwe use as guidelines for\n\n73\n00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.190\nposts along the journey towards\nbuilding an ISMS on the road.\n\n74\n00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.760\nThe general ISO thought process in 27001\n\n75\n00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.470\nis going to be let's shape and\nframe the dialogue around the ISMS.\n\n76\n00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.639\nWhat is it?\nHow do we define it?\n\n77\n00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.190\nWhy is it important?\n\n78\n00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.519\nIn 27002,\nwe're focusing on the control elements.\n\n79\n00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:37.498\nWhat are the controls that are going\nto allow us to effectively\n\n80\n00:04:37.498 --> 00:04:39.520\nachieve that end result?\n\n81\n00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.960\nWe have 14 focus areas in ISO 27002\nthat lay out various controls.\n\n82\n00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.780\nThere's well over 100 controls\nwithin the 14 focus group areas.\n\n83\n00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.410\nIn no particular order, let me be clear.\n\n84\n00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.420\nYou do not need to know\nall focus group areas.\n\n85\n00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.270\nThis is really just for your benefit.\n\n86\n00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.610\nI'm throwing some of them out there.\n\n87\n00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.770\nI'm not gonna enumerate all of them, so\ndon't stand there with a counter clicking\n\n88\n00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.030\noff, going oh wow, he only hit five,\nwhat's going on with the other nine?\n\n89\n00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.250\nIt's just a sampling for\n\n90\n00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.380\nyou to have a sense of the kind of\ncontrol areas that we focus on.\n\n91\n00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.020\nSo things such as compliance,\nvery important, human resource security,\n\n92\n00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.540\nasset management, cryptography,\nalways a popular one.\n\n93\n00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.570\nCommunication security, supplier\nrelationships, how do we manage supply\n\n94\n00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.820\nchain risk up and down through our\nachieved or rather our, help me out here.\n\n95\n00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.260\nControls, contracts is\nthe word I'm looking for.\n\n96\n00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.590\nSo how do we achieve that and result based\non contract relationships with vendors and\n\n97\n00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.720\nthe supply chain, so\nwe focus on supply chain risk.\n\n98\n00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.160\nInformation security policies, we talk\nabout physical environmental security.\n\n99\n00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.860\nThese are samplings of focus areas that we\nwill have control elements listed within,\n\n100\n00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.480\nwithin the ISO 27002 standard.\n\n101\n00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.880\nI'll remind you, and we've shown you this\nbefore that when you go out to take a look\n\n102\n00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.160\nat the standards,\nyou could see the overview of them.\n\n103\n00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.820\nWe took you out in a prior episode,\nshowed you the ISO catalog store.\n\n104\n00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.220\nWe showed you how to preview any\nof the standards that are there.\n\n105\n00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.540\nBut we also made it clear to you\nthat almost without exception,\n\n106\n00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.060\nall these standards require that you\npurchase them, and I'll remind you again.\n\n107\n00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.600\nWe don't expect you to read the standards\nin order to be able to take and\n\n108\n00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.800\npass the exam.\n\n109\n00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.480\nWe're not, in other words,\ntelling you you have to go out and\n\n110\n00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.440\nspend thousands of dollars to read\nthe material in order to pass this exam.\n\n111\n00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.750\nWhich is why I'm telling you that I\nwould not spend a great deal of time\n\n112\n00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.750\nfocusing on all of\nthe control category areas.\n\n113\n00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:29.500\nI would be generally familiar with what\nthe ISO 27001 and 2 standards represent,\n\n114\n00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.200\nI would have a one sentence or so\nsummary of the functional or the objective\n\n115\n00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.520\nof each of those particular standards,\nwhat is it used for, why is it important.\n\n116\n00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.140\nIf you can answer that,\nthat's a mile wide,\n\n117\n00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.390\ninch deep in terms of\nthe amount of knowledge.\n\n118\n00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.200\nIf you can go into all 14 control\nfocus areas and enumerate for\n\n119\n00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.570\nme the 114 controls that exist there,\nthat's awesome, but\n\n120\n00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.330\nthat's not what we're asking you\nto do to prepare for the exam.\n\n121\n00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.890\nThat's great if you're going\nto actually focus in this area\n\n122\n00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:00.140\nin the real world in your practice, then\nit's going to be very valuable knowledge.\n\n123\n00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.680\nBut it's not a requirement for\nyou to be successful, just to be clear.\n\n124\n00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.872\nWe also talked about COBIT\nas a framework before.\n\n125\n00:07:05.872 --> 00:07:08.698\nCOBIT is a ISACA framework for\nIT governance.\n\n126\n00:07:08.698 --> 00:07:12.154\nCOBIT also provides a set of very\nspecific control elements that\n\n127\n00:07:12.154 --> 00:07:14.843\nhelp us to craft\nthe organizational behaviour and\n\n128\n00:07:14.843 --> 00:07:18.558\nthe Enterprise Security Architecture\nwith regards to governance,\n\n129\n00:07:18.558 --> 00:07:22.938\nrisk and compliance, What we often have\nreferred to as GRC-based activities.\n\n130\n00:07:22.938 --> 00:07:24.750\nCOBIT is going to be available to you,\n\n131\n00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.120\nwe've shown you how to find\nthat framework as well,\n\n132\n00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.770\nat the ISACA website, isaca.org is where\nyou would start your journey there.\n\n133\n00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:33.430\nYou could Google COBIT, C-O-B-I-T,\n\n134\n00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:38.110\nand you will certainly find reference to\nthe most current version of the framework.\n\n135\n00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.222\nKeep in mind, these frameworks do\nget updated over time, we've kind of\n\n136\n00:07:41.222 --> 00:07:44.654\nhinted at that and talked to you about\nthat as well in some of our conversations.\n\n137\n00:07:44.654 --> 00:07:48.812\nSo when I may say now,\nISO 27002 is a 2013 or 2015 or\n\n138\n00:07:48.812 --> 00:07:52.431\n2020 standard,\nthat's the current version, but\n\n139\n00:07:52.431 --> 00:07:57.360\nthat doesn't mean that a year or\ntwo from now, that version may not change.\n\n140\n00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:59.298\nIt obviously updates over time, and\n\n141\n00:07:59.298 --> 00:08:03.674\nyou have to keep in mind that Whatever the\ncurrent version is at the time that you're\n\n142\n00:08:03.674 --> 00:08:07.650\nworking with it in the real world\nis what you would use to implement.\n\n143\n00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.780\nThe version at the time that\nyou're planning on taking the exam\n\n144\n00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.920\nis important in the sense that you\nobviously wanna be aware of it, but\n\n145\n00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.780\naware of what COBIT does is gonna\nbe really what you need to know.\n\n146\n00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.620\nAnd being aware of what COBIT represents,\n\n147\n00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.100\nis not gonna be impacted\nby a version change.\n\n148\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.050\nRight.\nCOBIT is still gonna be an IT governance\n\n149\n00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.561\nframework, regardless of\nwhether its version five or\n\n150\n00:08:26.561 --> 00:08:29.760\nversion six at the time you\nplan on taking the exam.\n\n151\n00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.950\nSo understand, I don't want you to get\ncaught up in the details, the minutia,\n\n152\n00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.300\nof the things we're mentioning that may\ndistract you from being successful.\n\n153\n00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:41.110\nWe want you to focus on the material\nthat's gonna make you successful,\n\n154\n00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.500\nhelp you to study for, prepare,\nultimately take and pass the CISSP exam.\n\n155\n00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.480\nThat's the primary goal of\nus spending time together,\n\n156\n00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.870\nother than the fact that Mike and\nI just like hanging out, right?\n\n157\n00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.500\nBut other than that,\nwe could talk about a lot of other stuff.\n\n158\n00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.340\nMy point is, it's critical for\n\n159\n00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.720\nyou to be focused on the information\nthat is gonna make you successful.\n\n160\n00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.320\nSo make sure that you understand\nhow to define these frameworks.\n\n161\n00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.920\nKnow what the key objectives are, but\ndon't spend a lot of time drilling into\n\n162\n00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.570\nthe details around them, until you\nactually put this knowledge into play for\n\n163\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.390\nreal, as you look to apply it\nin your job in the real world.\n\n164\n00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.360\nAnd if you're already doing that, so\nmuch the better, but if you're not,\n\n165\n00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.730\nmake sure you have that right level\nof expectation as you prepare for and\n\n166\n00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.820\nultimately study to take the exam.\n\n167\n00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.830\nWe also wanna mention PCIDSS,\n\n168\n00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:28.230\npeople have an interesting\nthought process around PCIDSS.\n\n169\n00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:32.760\nThey often view it as statutory,\nregulatory compliance, and it is not.\n\n170\n00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:38.030\nIt is a standard that exists that has\nbeen promulgated by the payment industry,\n\n171\n00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.950\nspecifically the credit card companies for\nthe most part, Visa, MasterCard,\n\n172\n00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:42.880\ngenerically.\n\n173\n00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:46.180\nThose kinds of companies\nare behind the PCIDSS standard.\n\n174\n00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.140\nIt is a group of control elements.\n\n175\n00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.430\nThere are several areas we're\ngonna talk about them and\n\n176\n00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.190\nshow them to you here in just a second.\n\n177\n00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:55.230\nAnd there are 12 specific\ncontrol objects or\n\n178\n00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.190\nobjectives that exist\nwithin PCIDSS standard.\n\n179\n00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.690\nBut people look at PCIDSS,\n\n180\n00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:03.700\nand often say oh I have to follow that,\nbecause it's a law.\n\n181\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.720\nNo you don't have to follow\nit because it's a law.\n\n182\n00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:10.110\nIt's not a law, it's a standard, meaning\nan industry group has come up with it.\n\n183\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.520\nThey've put it forward as a set\nof best practice guidelines for\n\n184\n00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.500\nbehavior they wanna encourage.\n\n185\n00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.550\nAnd all the people that\nwanna use their services,\n\n186\n00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.500\nhave to follow those standards\nif they wanna be able to use\n\n187\n00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.410\nthe payment gateway services\nthat these companies provide.\n\n188\n00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.550\nBut, at the end of the day,\nit is optional.\n\n189\n00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.900\nThere's no law in any country that\nsays you must implement this or else.\n\n190\n00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.740\nThere is a group of standards that, if\nyou wanna process electronic payments by\n\n191\n00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.810\ntaking credit cards, you must adhere to.\n\n192\n00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.500\nBut it's not the same thing\nas actually having a law.\n\n193\n00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.200\nSo I just want you to be aware that\nas we start of our conversation here.\n\n194\n00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.530\nThe PCI standards have been\ndeveloped by the PCI Council,\n\n195\n00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.150\nformerly called\nthe PCI Security Standards Council.\n\n196\n00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:51.180\nAnd the idea behind it as we said,\nis basically a set of standards, control\n\n197\n00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:56.040\nobjectives, behavioral items that help\nus to focus on making sure that we have\n\n198\n00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.400\nintegrity and confidentiality associated\nwith not only payment processing.\n\n199\n00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:06.930\nBut also the idea behind making sure\nthat we understand how to safeguard\n\n200\n00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:10.940\ninformation from customers, that is\ngathered during this particular exercise.\n\n201\n00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:15.160\nSo, if you go and conduct a transaction\nwith a credit card online, or\n\n202\n00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.690\nat a retailer in person, and\nyou pay with a credit card.\n\n203\n00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:22.360\nAnd that credit vendor is\na member of the PCIDSS alliance,\n\n204\n00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.380\nthen the processing agent, the company\nthat takes the payment from you\n\n205\n00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.540\nhas to follow these particular standards.\n\n206\n00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.680\nAnd you can see on the website we've put\nup there, we're just gonna drill in, or\n\n207\n00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.180\nexcuse me zoom in,\ngonna use the proper terminology.\n\n208\n00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.800\nJust gonna zoom in there\njust a little bit.\n\n209\n00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.450\nAnd you can see maintaining a payment\nsecurity solution is what PCIDSS\n\n210\n00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:40.500\nis all about.\n\n211\n00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.160\nIf we scroll down, you'll see that you'll\nbe able to download the PCI security.\n\n212\n00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.100\nIt's currently version 3.01 standard.\n\n213\n00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.455\nAnd we can see if we go down just\njust a little more right there,\n\n214\n00:11:50.455 --> 00:11:51.595\nno no yeah yeah, absolutely.\n\n215\n00:11:51.595 --> 00:11:55.025\nLet's go down to the chart,\ngo down just a little more, there we go.\n\n216\n00:11:55.025 --> 00:11:58.365\nMaybe, yeah I was gonna say just zoom\nout a little bit so we can get all 12.\n\n217\n00:11:58.365 --> 00:12:03.257\nSo you can see there that we basically\nhave all 12 control elements listed.\n\n218\n00:12:03.257 --> 00:12:06.447\nAnd what you'll see on the left, although\nthe header is cut off, but that's okay.\n\n219\n00:12:06.447 --> 00:12:07.577\nWe don't need to move down.\n\n220\n00:12:07.577 --> 00:12:10.707\nThe column on the left is going\nto be referred to as goals.\n\n221\n00:12:10.707 --> 00:12:13.577\nAnd those are going to be\nthe statements that are single sentence\n\n222\n00:12:13.577 --> 00:12:14.837\nstatements of the left.\n\n223\n00:12:14.837 --> 00:12:18.587\nAnd then the numbered items on the right,\ngrouped in order of, you know.\n\n224\n00:12:18.587 --> 00:12:22.087\nOne or two or three, depending on\nthe category, are going to be the PCIDSS\n\n225\n00:12:22.087 --> 00:12:26.700\nrequirement linked to the goal, that are\nactually the objectives that we implement.\n\n226\n00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.150\nIn order to safe guard and\ncreate confidentiality and integrity.\n\n227\n00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.320\nSo you could certainly take\na look at them at some point.\n\n228\n00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.170\nThey're obviously good for\nyou to be aware of.\n\n229\n00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.100\nBut there are, overall 12 PCIDSS\nrequirements in the framework.\n\n230\n00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.340\nThere are a total of, as you can take\na look, six goals that map them out.\n\n231\n00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.750\nAnd so together, this forms the basis for\nsecure processing, and\n\n232\n00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:50.390\nsecure payment gateway management,\nwithin the payment card industry today.\n\n233\n00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:54.000\nSo just being aware of PCIDSS is\nalso gonna be important for you.\n\n234\n00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.930\nAnd obviously the control objectives\nthat they will go ahead and forment or\n\n235\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:03.050\nput out for us to follow, are also gonna\nbe good knowledge for you at some level.\n\n236\n00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.700\nIf you've ever walked into a store,\npaid with a credit card and wondered, hey,\n\n237\n00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.260\nwhat actually happens to that information,\nright.\n\n238\n00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.250\nThey've got my account information.\n\n239\n00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:15.000\nThey may ask me for my pin, so I probably\nput my pin in, or they may ask me for\n\n240\n00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.680\nmy zip code to validate the transaction,\nbilling address, zip code.\n\n241\n00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.540\nOr postal code depending\non where you live.\n\n242\n00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:23.780\nAnd as a result of that,\nthat information goes somewhere.\n\n243\n00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.920\nIt goes into a database, it's stored,\nhas a transaction ID associated with it.\n\n244\n00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.290\nThere's obviously information that\nidentifies you as the customer\n\n245\n00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.550\nlinking back to the vendor\nthat owns the card,\n\n246\n00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:37.060\nso there's a lot of information floating\naround out there when you make a payment.\n\n247\n00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.940\nSo we wanna keep in mind, that we\nobviously have to have recommendations and\n\n248\n00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.850\nrequirements with regards to\ncontrol objectives, that help us to\n\n249\n00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.440\nsafeguard these transactions, and\nthis is what PCIDSS represents for us.\n\n250\n00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.000\nIn addition to talking about the control\nobjectives linked to some of\n\n251\n00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.260\nthe frameworks that we've been discussing,\nwe also want to take a couple minutes to\n\n252\n00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.800\ntalk about the security capabilities\nof information systems overall.\n\n253\n00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.150\nThis is also gonna be some\nimportant information, so\n\n254\n00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.920\nwe've talked a lot about\naccess control mechanisms.\n\n255\n00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.870\nI've mentioned several of the access\ncontrol models that exist.\n\n256\n00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:10.830\nWe've looked at security models,\nthe integrity model,\n\n257\n00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:16.210\nthe confidentiality model, the chinese\nfirewall, or chinese wall model.\n\n258\n00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.360\nWe've talked about Harrison,\nRuzzo, Ullman.\n\n259\n00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.230\nThese are all models,\n\n260\n00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:24.190\nsecurity models, that help us to focus on\naspects of security and security control.\n\n261\n00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:28.110\nWe've talked about access control\nmechanisms, such as multi or\n\n262\n00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:29.840\ndual factor authentication.\n\n263\n00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.350\nSomething you have,\nsomething you know, something you are.\n\n264\n00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.780\nWe combine them together.\n\n265\n00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.660\nWe've talked about access\ncontrol models that implement\n\n266\n00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.410\nsome of those security models.\n\n267\n00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.600\nWe've talked about\nmandatory access control.\n\n268\n00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.470\nDiscretionary access control.\n\n269\n00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.520\nI've mentioned temporal based\naccess control, time based.\n\n270\n00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.750\nThis would be something like a bank\nvault being closed at night,\n\n271\n00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:52.590\nlocked with some sort of secure\ncontrol mechanism electronically.\n\n272\n00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.220\nOpened up again the next morning.\n\n273\n00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.990\nThat's a temporal based\naccess control mechanism.\n\n274\n00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.120\nWe've talked about ruled based\naccess control mechanisms.\n\n275\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.380\nFirewalls are classic examples of this.\n\n276\n00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.530\nYou have a set of rules\nthat filter incoming and\n\n277\n00:15:04.530 --> 00:15:08.580\noutgoing traffic, and based on a match or\na lack of a match, you may or\n\n278\n00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.790\nmay not be able to gain\naccess to a system.\n\n279\n00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.610\nWe've talked about role\nbased access control.\n\n280\n00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:18.010\nAssigning access based on membership\nin a group, or assignment to a role.\n\n281\n00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.190\nSo there's lots of different\nways to achieve access control.\n\n282\n00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:24.840\nThe point is that we have a variety of\naccess control mechanism, and what we want\n\n283\n00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.170\nto understand, is that regardless of what\nmechanism or grouping of mechanisms we\n\n284\n00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:33.890\nuse, all systems need to have some form\nof access control associated with them.\n\n285\n00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:36.370\nIf we left everything wide open and\n\n286\n00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:41.060\nwe simply trusted to the good\nnature of the individuals that,\n\n287\n00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.400\nnot only that we work with, but the people\nthat live outside of our environment.\n\n288\n00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.945\nThose are the people we tend to\nhave to pay attention to more.\n\n289\n00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:50.415\nAlthough certainly we have seen\nexamples of insider threat activity\n\n290\n00:15:50.415 --> 00:15:51.440\nhappening as well.\n\n291\n00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.634\nAnd we do have to be cautious and\ncertainly verify everybody's\n\n292\n00:15:54.634 --> 00:15:59.032\nintentions But we really, if we just left\nthings open, didn't bother to effectively\n\n293\n00:15:59.032 --> 00:16:03.673\nauthenticate, didn't bother to effectively\nauthorize, didn't bother to effectively\n\n294\n00:16:03.673 --> 00:16:07.770\nidentify anybody, but simply said,\nanybody who would like this information,\n\n295\n00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.520\nwe're gonna leave it here on the table for\nyou, just come and get it.\n\n296\n00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.700\nIt's there, you can take it, no problem.\n\n297\n00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.560\nYour life will be a lot easier for us.\n\n298\n00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.130\nWe wouldn't have to sit up at night\nworrying about a lot of these things, but\n\n299\n00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.890\nwe also really wouldn't have any\nneed to be security professionals,\n\n300\n00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.560\nbecause we really wouldn't be\nworried about confidentiality.\n\n301\n00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.760\nClearly wouldn't be worried\nabout integrity, and\n\n302\n00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.411\navailability is pretty much\nguaranteed because it's there.\n\n303\n00:16:28.411 --> 00:16:30.370\nWe're just not getting in the way of it.\n\n304\n00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:34.280\nSo it would really be a different world is\nmy point, and since we don't want to live\n\n305\n00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.490\nin that world, at least I don't\nanyway because I like what I do.\n\n306\n00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.710\nAnd I like being able to help people\nfigure out how to make sure that stuff\n\n307\n00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.770\nis secure, and I'm sure you do as well,\nor you wouldn't wanna be a CISSP.\n\n308\n00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:49.320\nSo as a result of that, we all agree\nwe need access control mechanisms.\n\n309\n00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.130\nBecause of that,\nall systems should be able to do\n\n310\n00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:54.620\nthe things that are required\nto implement access control.\n\n311\n00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:58.070\nAnd specifically things like being able\nto differentiate between subjects and\n\n312\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.000\nobjects as an example.\n\n313\n00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.280\nWe've talked about subjects being users,\n\n314\n00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:06.580\nobjects traditionally being referred\nto as data, whatever the data may be.\n\n315\n00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:08.750\nThe focus of the subject action,\nin other words,\n\n316\n00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.590\nis the object, objects are gonna\nbe interactive with bi-subjects.\n\n317\n00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:17.043\nRemember, subjects are typically users,\nbut I made the point several times\n\n318\n00:17:17.043 --> 00:17:20.879\nthat subjects may also be classified\nas services that are acting or\n\n319\n00:17:20.879 --> 00:17:22.608\nproxying on behalf of a user.\n\n320\n00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:29.606\nWhen you go out to a web browser, you\ntype an HTTP www.itpro.tv and hit Enter.\n\n321\n00:17:29.606 --> 00:17:35.095\nWell, you're going to effectively ask\na web service using the HTTP protocol\n\n322\n00:17:35.095 --> 00:17:40.332\nto effectively go and use an HTTP GET\nrequest and effectively proxy on your\n\n323\n00:17:40.332 --> 00:17:45.680\nbehalf to go out and get whatever is\nat the far end of that conversation.\n\n324\n00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.740\nThe itpro.tv website or whatever the\nwelcome page is on the itpro.tv website.\n\n325\n00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.570\nAs a result of that,\nif there was a purple squirrel or\n\n326\n00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:57.880\na purple unicorn on that webpage,\nyou would see that.\n\n327\n00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.720\nBut the reality is, we don't know what's\nthere until the service goes out and\n\n328\n00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.400\ngets it from us.\n\n329\n00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.499\nI told you I would work that in somehow.\n\n330\n00:18:03.499 --> 00:18:05.685\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we would see that there.\n\n331\n00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:07.709\nThat's a little thing between Mike and I.\n\n332\n00:18:07.709 --> 00:18:10.060\nSo we will see whatever's at\nthe end point of that, but\n\n333\n00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.300\nis it really me the user\nmaking that request?\n\n334\n00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.570\nOr is the service on behalf of me?\n\n335\n00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.180\nWell, the reality is there's two\nsubjects in this conversation.\n\n336\n00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:22.130\nThere's the user subject, but then there's\nthe service request that is proxied on\n\n337\n00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.870\nbehalf of the user, that acts as a subject\n\n338\n00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.590\nin the exchange of information to\nactually bring back the web page.\n\n339\n00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.870\nSo we can talk about subjects\nbeing different kinds of subjects.\n\n340\n00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.260\nGenerically, accessed control mechanisms\nhave to be able to differentiate between\n\n341\n00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.530\nsubject and object.\n\n342\n00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.240\nIf we don't understand what\na user versus data is,\n\n343\n00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.630\nthere's no way to apply\naccess control is my point.\n\n344\n00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.946\nSo we wanna make sure we understand that.\n\n345\n00:18:43.946 --> 00:18:47.732\nWe have to make appropriate decisions as\nto whether or not subjects are authorized,\n\n346\n00:18:47.732 --> 00:18:51.090\nand therefore, should be able to see\nthe data, or whether they're not and\n\n347\n00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.290\nshould be denied access.\n\n348\n00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.110\nThis is also very important.\n\n349\n00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.585\nWanna assign unique identifiers\nto both subjects and objects,\n\n350\n00:18:57.585 --> 00:19:01.203\nmaking sure we can uniquely identify\none subject versus another.\n\n351\n00:19:01.203 --> 00:19:05.103\nIf there are two Adams in the user\ndatabase, two subjects called Adam,\n\n352\n00:19:05.103 --> 00:19:09.394\nI have to differentiate because the Adam\nthat is wearing the green Polo shirt is\n\n353\n00:19:09.394 --> 00:19:13.680\ngonna be different than the Adam that\nhas another color Polo shirt on.\n\n354\n00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.420\nOr if both Adams have a green Polo,\n\n355\n00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:18.370\nthen we have to figure out\na way to differentiate further.\n\n356\n00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:23.030\nSo we usually we use first name,\nlast name, first name, last, initial.\n\n357\n00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.110\nThat stuff works, but even that I\nmay still have two Adam Gordons or\n\n358\n00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.716\ntwo Adam Gs.\n\n359\n00:19:26.716 --> 00:19:30.182\nSo what we really rely on in most\nsystems is a unique identifier\n\n360\n00:19:30.182 --> 00:19:34.730\nthat is commonly called the GUID,\na Globally Unique Identifier in Windows.\n\n361\n00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:39.260\nIt's made up of a SID,\na security ID and a RID, a relative ID.\n\n362\n00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.790\nRelative ID gives you\nthe naming convention,\n\n363\n00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.600\nyour place in the world\nwithin the domain namespace.\n\n364\n00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.810\nSo that references part of your\nunique identity, and then the SID,\n\n365\n00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:51.395\nthe security identifier,\nis a unique multi-digit string,\n\n366\n00:19:51.395 --> 00:19:55.260\nan alpha-numeric string that\neffectively identifies you\n\n367\n00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:59.000\nas unique instance within that relative\nID space within the namespace.\n\n368\n00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.150\nThis is how it's done in Windows.\n\n369\n00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.330\nAnd we have a similar thought process\nin Linux and Unix-based systems.\n\n370\n00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.110\nWe have a relative ID that allows\nus to identify who you are.\n\n371\n00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:09.000\nThat GUID is going to be unique, and\n\n372\n00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.221\nultimately no matter how many Adam Gordons\nor how many Adam Gs or how many Adams in\n\n373\n00:20:13.221 --> 00:20:16.881\ngreen shirts we have, every one of\nthem will be seen as being unique.\n\n374\n00:20:16.881 --> 00:20:20.255\nAccess control mechanisms have to\nensure that this behavior occurs,\n\n375\n00:20:20.255 --> 00:20:24.142\nbecause otherwise, we'd have no way of\ndifferentiating between the different\n\n376\n00:20:24.142 --> 00:20:26.900\nAdams that are wearing shirts\nwithin the organization.\n\n377\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.970\nSo that's gonna obviously\npresent a challenge for us.\n\n378\n00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:33.120\nAnd we also have to authenticate all\nsubjects before we allow them to access\n\n379\n00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.120\ndata or to access objects.\n\n380\n00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.390\nThese are all things that access control\nmechanisms have to be able to do in order\n\n381\n00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:44.600\nto operate properly within our overarching\nEnterprise Security Architecture.\n\n382\n00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.390\nWe also have to have what is\nknown as complete mediation.\n\n383\n00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:51.900\nComplete mediation implies that no subject\nshould ever be able to gain access to\n\n384\n00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.936\nan object without authorization.\n\n385\n00:20:53.936 --> 00:20:58.639\nWe often talk when we're thinking about\naccess control about the concept of\n\n386\n00:20:58.639 --> 00:21:03.345\nidentification, authorization as\nhappening as part of that process, but\n\n387\n00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:05.270\nit happens a little bit later.\n\n388\n00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:09.390\nWhat we actually need to do\nis first identify, then we,\n\n389\n00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.750\nI was making up a new word,\nidenticate, that's so cool!\n\n390\n00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:12.750\n>> I like it.\n>> We're gonna put that on\n\n391\n00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:14.360\nvocabulary words for you.\n\n392\n00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.340\nSo we have to identify,\nthen we have to authenticate,\n\n393\n00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:22.540\nthen we have to authorize, that is the\nstep-by-step process that we go through\n\n394\n00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.840\nwith regards to identity access management\nand with regards to access control.\n\n395\n00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:31.350\nSo when we identify, we're asking you to\nprovide some sort of information that will\n\n396\n00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.670\nstipulate who you are.\n\n397\n00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:35.900\nIt's usually a username and a password,\nbut it could be other things as well.\n\n398\n00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.980\nYou may insert your smart card\ninto a smart card reader.\n\n399\n00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.490\nYou may provide a pin.\n\n400\n00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:42.530\nYou provide a biometrics scan.\n\n401\n00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.610\nYou may provide a challenge from\na challenge-response token, or\n\n402\n00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.484\na response to that, whatever it may be.\n\n403\n00:21:47.484 --> 00:21:50.631\nWhatever that is,\nyou're gonna identify yourself up front.\n\n404\n00:21:50.631 --> 00:21:54.020\nWe're then gonna authenticate\nthat identification request.\n\n405\n00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.980\nWe're gonna take that, we're gonna match\nit against what the known quantities\n\n406\n00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:01.240\nare that are stored in the LDAP directory\nsomewhere, using some sort of mechanism.\n\n407\n00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.140\nWhether it's a hash of the username and\npassword, whether it's comparison\n\n408\n00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:10.040\nof the token response and challenge\ninformation to make sure the token is\n\n409\n00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.850\nindeed providing the right response to\nthe right challenge at the right time,\n\n410\n00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.570\nif it's a synchronized token,\nthings of that nature.\n\n411\n00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:20.280\nIf it's a biometric scan, we're going\nto measure the information you provided\n\n412\n00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:25.160\nagainst the stored record in the database\nand make sure the two match.\n\n413\n00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.350\nWhatever that is we authenticate.\n\n414\n00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.150\nOnce we authenticate,\nwe then have to authorize.\n\n415\n00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:33.800\nAuthorization is the idea of\ngranting the user or the requestor,\n\n416\n00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.060\nwhoever the subject or whatever\nthe subject is, the right to engage in\n\n417\n00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.180\ncertain activity based on the fact that\nthey have authenticated successfully.\n\n418\n00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:44.271\nAnd then, that,\nwhatever that level of access is,\n\n419\n00:22:44.271 --> 00:22:47.575\nis granted to you when you\nengage in those activities for\n\n420\n00:22:47.575 --> 00:22:52.023\nwhat we call the time of the logon, or\ncommonly referred to as the session.\n\n421\n00:22:52.023 --> 00:22:53.416\nYou engage in a session.\n\n422\n00:22:53.416 --> 00:22:55.760\nActivities are gonna be based on session.\n\n423\n00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.950\nAnd as a result of that,\nyou're authenticated and\n\n424\n00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:00.980\nauthorized to engage in those\nactivities during that session.\n\n425\n00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.140\nYou log off, session disappears,\nyou log back in again,\n\n426\n00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.940\nyou reidentify, reauthenticate,\nreauthorize, you have a new session.\n\n427\n00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.700\nAnd we assign a unique session ID to\nthat session to track not just you,\n\n428\n00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:14.330\nbut everything that takes\nplace with regards to you and\n\n429\n00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:16.200\nyour interaction within the system.\n\n430\n00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.970\nSo everything is gonna be auditable,\neverything is traceable,\n\n431\n00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:20.560\nwe have visibility in\neverything in other words.\n\n432\n00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.690\nWe're always watching.\n\n433\n00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:25.030\nAnd complete mediation is\nthe idea that no subject\n\n434\n00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:29.020\nshould ever be able to gain access to an\nobject without authorization taking place.\n\n435\n00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:32.950\nIf you can, you've effectively\nbroken the authentication mechanism\n\n436\n00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:34.280\nbecause you're bypassing it.\n\n437\n00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:37.810\nAnd so we talk about the idea of\ncomplete mediation being very important.\n\n438\n00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.591\nSo we wanna think about that,\nkeep that in mind.\n\n439\n00:23:39.591 --> 00:23:44.152\nComplete mediation is normally seen as\nbeing the responsibility of the security\n\n440\n00:23:44.152 --> 00:23:48.375\nkernel, which implements a reference\nmonitor in order to be able to keep of\n\n441\n00:23:48.375 --> 00:23:49.460\ntrack of all this.\n\n442\n00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:53.213\nAnd these are terms, That we have\nnot really talked about before.\n\n443\n00:23:53.213 --> 00:23:57.152\nThe security kernel, we've talked about\nthe kernel in the operating system,\n\n444\n00:23:57.152 --> 00:24:00.975\nkind of the functional element that\nimplements some of the core capabilities\n\n445\n00:24:00.975 --> 00:24:02.294\nof the operating system.\n\n446\n00:24:02.294 --> 00:24:04.782\nThe security kernel can be\nthought of as that, but for\n\n447\n00:24:04.782 --> 00:24:07.287\nthe security functions\nwithin the OS specifically.\n\n448\n00:24:07.287 --> 00:24:11.172\nIt's the core functionality that we used\nto implement security functioning and\n\n449\n00:24:11.172 --> 00:24:14.658\nsecurity monitoring within the operating\nsystem or within the system,\n\n450\n00:24:14.658 --> 00:24:16.446\nwhatever it is we are talking about.\n\n451\n00:24:16.446 --> 00:24:20.811\nA reference monitor is effectively\nimplemented through the security kernel,\n\n452\n00:24:20.811 --> 00:24:25.108\nand it's a process that examines all\nattempts by subjects to access objects,\n\n453\n00:24:25.108 --> 00:24:26.230\nand mediates them.\n\n454\n00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.345\nIt implements mediation.\n\n455\n00:24:28.345 --> 00:24:31.270\nSo complete mediation is implemented\nthrough the reference monitor.\n\n456\n00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:35.253\nAnd it's a function of the security\nkernel if you understand and\n\n457\n00:24:35.253 --> 00:24:37.181\ncontract through that logic.\n\n458\n00:24:37.181 --> 00:24:40.119\nWhen we think about access management,\nwe're also thinking about,\n\n459\n00:24:40.119 --> 00:24:41.327\nnot just letting people in.\n\n460\n00:24:41.327 --> 00:24:44.056\nNot just identifying then,\nnot just authenticating them,\n\n461\n00:24:44.056 --> 00:24:45.349\nnot just authorizing them.\n\n462\n00:24:45.349 --> 00:24:47.713\nBut we also have to think about\nwhat it is they're going to do,\n\n463\n00:24:47.713 --> 00:24:48.948\nonce they come into the system.\n\n464\n00:24:48.948 --> 00:24:52.080\nThey're going to interact with objects,\nwith data, and they're going to do so\n\n465\n00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:52.920\nin a variety of ways.\n\n466\n00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.298\nIn one of our prior episodes,\nwe've talked about processors, CPU's,\n\n467\n00:24:57.298 --> 00:25:00.201\nbreaking them down,\nwhat their functions are.\n\n468\n00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:05.042\nThey fetch, they decode, they store, those\nare the things we talked about them doing.\n\n469\n00:25:05.042 --> 00:25:08.329\nWe also talked about memory and memory\nmanagement and the fact that we have\n\n470\n00:25:08.329 --> 00:25:11.722\ndynamic and static memory and how we\nwill use memory to store information and\n\n471\n00:25:11.722 --> 00:25:14.460\nthen retrieve it and\nuse it when we have a need for it.\n\n472\n00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:18.714\nSo we talked about the fact that memory\nis important as a security mechanism.\n\n473\n00:25:18.714 --> 00:25:22.378\nWe wanna make sure that when we're\nthinking about memory we're thinking about\n\n474\n00:25:22.378 --> 00:25:23.368\nmemory management.\n\n475\n00:25:23.368 --> 00:25:25.275\nThe management of data within memory,\n\n476\n00:25:25.275 --> 00:25:28.396\nthe management of information\nin other words stored in memory,\n\n477\n00:25:28.396 --> 00:25:32.177\nhas to be done securely because if we\nput stuff there and we don't protect it.\n\n478\n00:25:32.177 --> 00:25:36.543\nAnd we talked about things like address\nbased layout randomization, ASLR,\n\n479\n00:25:36.543 --> 00:25:38.029\nas a mechanism to do that.\n\n480\n00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:40.189\nWe talked about page keying.\n\n481\n00:25:40.189 --> 00:25:42.748\nDividing memory up into memory blocks or\npages, and\n\n482\n00:25:42.748 --> 00:25:46.648\nthen keying that access to that with a\nprivate key that effectively prevents you\n\n483\n00:25:46.648 --> 00:25:50.255\nfrom getting into that memory space\nunless you have a reason to be there and\n\n484\n00:25:50.255 --> 00:25:52.740\ncan provide the key to\nvalidate your access.\n\n485\n00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.128\nSo we've talked about different ways\nwe secure memory, and manage it.\n\n486\n00:25:55.128 --> 00:25:59.017\nWe just wanna remind you of the fact that\nthese are all gonna be part of access\n\n487\n00:25:59.017 --> 00:26:00.570\ncontrol mechanisms as well.\n\n488\n00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:03.859\nAnd these are things we have to\nthink about, and also, in our mind,\n\n489\n00:26:03.859 --> 00:26:04.975\nhave an awareness of.\n\n490\n00:26:04.975 --> 00:26:07.646\nAlso the ability for processors, for CPUs,\n\n491\n00:26:07.646 --> 00:26:11.040\nto operate security is also\na part of access control.\n\n492\n00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.266\nAgain, accessing information.\n\n493\n00:26:13.266 --> 00:26:17.686\nProcessing it through the system,\nusing access to gain information and\n\n494\n00:26:17.686 --> 00:26:19.720\nuse it is part of access control.\n\n495\n00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:24.096\nWe don't often think of the function of\na CPU being couched in the terms of access\n\n496\n00:26:24.096 --> 00:26:25.349\ncontrol management.\n\n497\n00:26:25.349 --> 00:26:28.770\nBut there are multiple layers of access\ncontrol taking place within the system.\n\n498\n00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:32.214\nWithin the processor,\nwe think about two distinct states,\n\n499\n00:26:32.214 --> 00:26:34.586\nor ways in which the processor can exist.\n\n500\n00:26:34.586 --> 00:26:38.865\nWe think about what's known as supervisory\nstate, often referred to as kernel mode,\n\n501\n00:26:38.865 --> 00:26:42.457\nand we think about problem state which\nis often referred to as user mode.\n\n502\n00:26:42.457 --> 00:26:46.430\nSupervisory mode or kernel mode is the\nlowest level functioning of the kernel.\n\n503\n00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:50.526\nThe idea behind it is that\nthe operating system kernel is gonna\n\n504\n00:26:50.526 --> 00:26:54.858\nexist at that level,\nexecute within the CPU when necessary, and\n\n505\n00:26:54.858 --> 00:27:00.015\nis gonna have complete and unfettered\naccess to the resources of the system.\n\n506\n00:27:00.015 --> 00:27:01.608\nIt can do everything.\nIt can access everything and\n\n507\n00:27:01.608 --> 00:27:02.546\nit can see everything.\n\n508\n00:27:02.546 --> 00:27:06.910\nIt has effectively what we would refer to\nin Linux and Unix as root level access.\n\n509\n00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:11.086\nIn a Windows system, we just call it\nadministrative access for full control.\n\n510\n00:27:11.086 --> 00:27:13.220\nBut the reality is,\nit's effectively the same thing.\n\n511\n00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.809\nIt has unrestricted access\nto everything in the system.\n\n512\n00:27:15.809 --> 00:27:18.438\nThe problem state, which if you\nthink about it is aptly named,\n\n513\n00:27:18.438 --> 00:27:20.770\nwhen we think about referring\nto it as user mode.\n\n514\n00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:24.383\nSo the problem state of\na processor [COUGH] excuse me,\n\n515\n00:27:24.383 --> 00:27:28.979\nor the user mode, is going to be\neffectively the idea behind the way\n\n516\n00:27:28.979 --> 00:27:32.938\nthe processor works with\nregards to user access to data.\n\n517\n00:27:32.938 --> 00:27:36.881\nIn other words, we effectively don't\ngive users compete, unfettered,\n\n518\n00:27:36.881 --> 00:27:40.826\naccess to hardware, and to the\ninfrastructure of the system, the same way\n\n519\n00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:44.643\nwe do when we have a supervisor, or\nkernel-mode access request because\n\n520\n00:27:44.643 --> 00:27:49.210\nthe kernel needs to operate without any\nrestrictions in order to do its job.\n\n521\n00:27:49.210 --> 00:27:52.659\nUser access, meaning things that\nare proxied on behalf of a user from\n\n522\n00:27:52.659 --> 00:27:56.586\nan application, hypothetically don't\nneed complete unfettered access but\n\n523\n00:27:56.586 --> 00:27:57.788\nhave to be controlled.\n\n524\n00:27:57.788 --> 00:28:01.280\nOtherwise they may lock open resources and\ncause the system to crash.\n\n525\n00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.815\nSo we have to think about a distinction\nin the processor state as well when we\n\n526\n00:28:04.815 --> 00:28:08.086\nthink about access control between\nsupervisory and problem state.\n\n527\n00:28:08.086 --> 00:28:10.420\nThis is also very important.\n\n528\n00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:13.010\nWhen we also want to think about\naccess control mechanisms,\n\n529\n00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:14.855\nwe want to think about process isolation.\n\n530\n00:28:14.855 --> 00:28:18.099\nWe've kind of walked up the chain and\nthe memory and\n\n531\n00:28:18.099 --> 00:28:20.901\nthe processor in terms\nof the CPU function.\n\n532\n00:28:20.901 --> 00:28:23.320\nWe think about process isolation.\n\n533\n00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:27.794\nWe think about applying a unique process\nID to every execution request and\n\n534\n00:28:27.794 --> 00:28:32.053\nthen being able to track that, but\nalso identifying each uniquely and\n\n535\n00:28:32.053 --> 00:28:33.944\nisolating it from the others.\n\n536\n00:28:33.944 --> 00:28:36.948\nSo, if you were to bring up task\nmanager in Windows, hypothetically,\n\n537\n00:28:36.948 --> 00:28:39.140\nright Ctrl+Alt+Delete, see task manager.\n\n538\n00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:43.704\nYou go look at the process tab, you will\nsee not every process in the system.\n\n539\n00:28:43.704 --> 00:28:45.620\nPeople often misunderstand\nwhat's in Task Manager.\n\n540\n00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:48.190\nYou're seeing all the processes\nthat are exposed to the GUI,\n\n541\n00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.126\nto the Windows-based environment, right?\n\n542\n00:28:50.126 --> 00:28:52.007\nGUI stands for graphical user interface.\n\n543\n00:28:52.007 --> 00:28:53.841\nIt's fun to say, by the way, GUI.\n\n544\n00:28:53.841 --> 00:28:54.561\nSay it with me, GUI.\n\n545\n00:28:54.561 --> 00:28:56.116\n>> GUI.\n\n546\n00:28:56.116 --> 00:28:57.486\n>> See there you go,\nMike enjoyed saying it.\n\n547\n00:28:57.486 --> 00:29:01.185\nSo the GUI only is going to represent\nthe processes that are exposed through\n\n548\n00:29:01.185 --> 00:29:01.940\nWindows.\n\n549\n00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.682\nThere are other processes that are running\nthat we commonly refer to as being hidden\n\n550\n00:29:05.682 --> 00:29:07.242\nwithin the Windows environment.\n\n551\n00:29:07.242 --> 00:29:08.900\nYou don't see them in Task Manager.\n\n552\n00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.828\nThey run, but you have to use\na command line interface to see them.\n\n553\n00:29:11.828 --> 00:29:16.958\nSomething like, pslist in Windows which is\nprocess list tool from the Winternals or\n\n554\n00:29:16.958 --> 00:29:20.365\nSysinternals tool set depending\non how far back you go.\n\n555\n00:29:20.365 --> 00:29:22.511\nYou may in Linux and Linux environments,\n\n556\n00:29:22.511 --> 00:29:25.698\nuse top or proc which are command\nline tools that can be used for\n\n557\n00:29:25.698 --> 00:29:29.990\ncommands out of command line, that can\nbe used to list all running processes.\n\n558\n00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:33.531\nYou will see that every process has\na unique ID, and you will see that we\n\n559\n00:29:33.531 --> 00:29:37.255\nisolate processes from each other in\norder to safeguard the integrity and\n\n560\n00:29:37.255 --> 00:29:40.918\nthe processing information that is\ncontained in those memory spaces for\n\n561\n00:29:40.918 --> 00:29:41.900\nthose processes.\n\n562\n00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.770\nSo we want to make sure that\nwe're aware of that concept.\n\n563\n00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:49.147\nAlso wanna make sure that we're thinking\nabout being able to effectively hide data,\n\n564\n00:29:49.147 --> 00:29:50.070\nand abstract it.\n\n565\n00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:53.582\nI wanna make sure we understand\nthat data is being hidden and\n\n566\n00:29:53.582 --> 00:29:57.300\nis also not going to be seen by\nanybody unless we allow them to.\n\n567\n00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:01.754\nSo this idea of kernel state and user\nstate are supervisor mode and user mode.\n\n568\n00:30:01.754 --> 00:30:05.461\nKernel state problem state those kind of\nthings, these are gonna be important for\n\n569\n00:30:05.461 --> 00:30:08.130\nus to consider and to think about as well.\n\n570\n00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:09.256\n>> Very good, Adam.\n\n571\n00:30:09.256 --> 00:30:11.340\nA lot of great information\nthere we got to see, and\n\n572\n00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.815\nsome information about the controls that\nare provided by the different frameworks\n\n573\n00:30:14.815 --> 00:30:16.310\nthat we've talked about.\n\n574\n00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:20.344\nWe also took a really in-depth\nlook at access control, and\n\n575\n00:30:20.344 --> 00:30:24.470\nhow we can differentiate between\nthe objects and subjects.\n\n576\n00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:25.870\n>> Subjects and objects.\n\n577\n00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:30.727\n>> The importance of being able to\nuniquely identify the different subjects\n\n578\n00:30:30.727 --> 00:30:35.907\nand objects, and how that process works,\nand that authentication process.\n\n579\n00:30:35.907 --> 00:30:38.820\nVery good stuff, Adam, appreciate that.\n\n580\n00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.495\nRemember, if you guys want to\nattend one of Adam's classes,\n\n581\n00:30:42.495 --> 00:30:46.114\nall you gotta do is shoot us an

00:00:17.370\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.880\nToday we're doing our CISSIP.\n\n5\n00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.610\nAnd specifically,\n\n6\n00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.220\nwe're gonna be getting into assessing and\nmitigating vulnerabilities.\n\n7\n00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.490\nAnd we've got vulnerabilities\nacross a wide range of areas.\n\n8\n00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.330\nAnd so we've got Mr. Adam Gordon here to\nhelp us out and see where they are and\n\n9\n00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.210\nwhat we can do to mitigate\nsome of those vulnerabilities.\n\n10\n00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.080\nWelcome, Adam.\n\n11\n00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.020\n>> Welcome, welcome, welcome indeed.\n\n12\n00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.570\nSo, let's talk about\naccessing vulnerabilities.\n\n13\n00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.750\nSpecifically we're going to talk\nabout accessing and mitigating,\n\n14\n00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.110\nin this case,\nvulnerabilities related to security.\n\n15\n00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.710\nArchitecture, design and\nsolution elements.\n\n16\n00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.085\nAnd, of course, always,\nwithout exception, socks, all right.\n\n17\n00:00:50.085 --> 00:00:51.010\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n18\n00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.694\n>> Socks.\n>> Gotta have the socks if you're\n\n19\n00:00:51.694 --> 00:00:52.270\ngoing to mitigate vulnerability.\n\n20\n00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.060\n>> Socks, socks, cool socks.\n\n21\n00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.430\nOrange and yellow and gray today.\n\n22\n00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.220\nSo, vulnerability is related to sock\nchoice, is all we're gonna talk about.\n\n23\n00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.670\nAll right, so all kidding aside,\nlet's get into our conversations here.\n\n24\n00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.340\nSo we're gonna focus on architecture.\n\n25\n00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.780\nWe've been talking about that for\nsome time,\n\n26\n00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.000\nit's been a theme for\nseveral of our episodes.\n\n27\n00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.240\nHow we build a secure infrastructure.\n\n28\n00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.240\nHow do we set up controls to do that?\n\n29\n00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.910\nHow do we identify risk?\n\n30\n00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.300\nHow do we shape and\ncontrol behavior with policy?\n\n31\n00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.060\nThese are things we've\nbeen talking a lot about.\n\n32\n00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.050\nWe have to identify common threats\nthroughout the organization,\n\n33\n00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.380\nthroughout the infrastructure.\n\n34\n00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.250\nIn order to be able to assess and\n\n35\n00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.260\nmitigate vulnerabilities, we have to\nfirst identify potentially what they are.\n\n36\n00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.150\nSo what are areas where\nwe may see threats in?\n\n37\n00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.440\nThe stuff's gonna be a very\nimportant question for\n\n38\n00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.510\nus to ponder as security professionals.\n\n39\n00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.290\nSo things such as hardware failure right?\n\n40\n00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.640\nThink about the fact that if you don't\nhave redundant power supplies and\n\n41\n00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.130\nyou lose the power supply\nin your server that\n\n42\n00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.360\nparticular solution is no longer\navailable to use until you fix that.\n\n43\n00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.560\nWhat if you lose a network card?\n\n44\n00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.010\nYou don't have redundant network cards for\na network team.\n\n45\n00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.480\nSo hardware failure can\nobviously be catastrophic.\n\n46\n00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.820\nWhat if somebody's able to\nmisuse their privilege?\n\n47\n00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.340\nTheir authentication allows\nthem to get in, right, but\n\n48\n00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.770\nthen authorization gives them more\nprivilege than they should have.\n\n49\n00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.810\nAll of the sudden they have full access\nwhen they should have read only.\n\n50\n00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.830\nThat can obviously lead to complications.\n\n51\n00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.820\nWhat about things like denial of service?\n\n52\n00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.290\nSomebody's able to launch an attack\nwhere they effectively can consume\n\n53\n00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.670\nall of the resources in one or\n\n54\n00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.320\nmore systems, allowing them to take that\nsystem offline, or impact availability.\n\n55\n00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.920\nThis would obviously lead to an issue and\na concern.\n\n56\n00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.760\nHacking, in general,\nis obviously always a concern.\n\n57\n00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.540\nYou know,\nthese are areas of common threats.\n\n58\n00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.510\nAnd we have to be identifying\nkey areas to focus on\n\n59\n00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.340\nas a result of focusing in on them.\n\n60\n00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.620\nWe can begin to craft not only the\nassessment regimes but also the mitigation\n\n61\n00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.150\nstrategies that help us to prevent\nthese things from becoming a reality.\n\n62\n00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.910\nSo when we think about\nsystem architecture,\n\n63\n00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.580\nwe have to think about emanation, this\nis one of the first areas we talk about.\n\n64\n00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.030\nWhen we thing about a computer system,\nmuch like the laptop I'm using for\n\n65\n00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.409\ninstance where I have my notes and\nI'm talking to you.\n\n66\n00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.490\nThis laptop or any computer for\nthat matter, any computing device\n\n67\n00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.720\nis going to radiate out beyond\nthe boundary of the shell of the system.\n\n68\n00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.440\nElectronic eminance, in other words.\n\n69\n00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.780\nInformation is coming off of this\nsystem through electronic radiation,\n\n70\n00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.720\nspecifically what we call electronic\nsignals that you can pick up in effect.\n\n71\n00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.230\nAnd you can reproduce within a couple\nof feet of the machine, depending on\n\n72\n00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.670\nthe strength of the machine and certain\nparameters associated with how it's built.\n\n73\n00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.570\nSystem emanations,\nin other words, can be a problem\n\n74\n00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.130\nbecause if somebody's able to pick them up\nand reproduce them, they affectively can\n\n75\n00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.420\nsee the information on my screen,\neven though they're not looking at it.\n\n76\n00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.020\nNow, this is not something\nthat's normally done every day.\n\n77\n00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.850\nThis is not something that you\ncould just walk up to a computer.\n\n78\n00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.657\nSit down five feet away,\npoint your computer at the screen and do.\n\n79\n00:03:38.657 --> 00:03:42.891\nYou need special equipment to pick up\nthis electromagnetic radiation and\n\n80\n00:03:42.891 --> 00:03:44.340\nthen reproduce it.\n\n81\n00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.810\nBut the point is, it can be done.\n\n82\n00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.330\nIt bleeds everywhere, much like\na wireless signal, it's there for\n\n83\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.310\nthe taking if you know how to find it.\n\n84\n00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.250\nSo in order to protect\nagainst emanation threats,\n\n85\n00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.530\nwe use something known\nas tempest shielding.\n\n86\n00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.720\nAnd tempest shielding is effectively\ngoing to allow us to be able to\n\n87\n00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.580\nuse technology that will absorb\nthe electromagnetic radiation,\n\n88\n00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.710\nthe emanations that come from\nthe hard drive, the CPU, the memory.\n\n89\n00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.380\nAll electronic devices create\nthis electromagnetic radiation.\n\n90\n00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.350\nAnd as a result of that tempest\nshielding absorbs it and\n\n91\n00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.250\neffectively stealths the machine.\n\n92\n00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.120\nPrevents the radiation from\nseeping out and being read or\n\n93\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.010\nbeing seen out beyond the boundary\nof the border of the device.\n\n94\n00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.390\nWe talk about a Faraday cage with\nregards to tempest shielding.\n\n95\n00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.582\nFaraday cage is going to be a specific\nkind of protection device that uses\n\n96\n00:04:31.582 --> 00:04:32.897\ntempest technology.\n\n97\n00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:38.574\nYou see this in secure systems where the\ncomputer device, whether it's the monitor,\n\n98\n00:04:38.574 --> 00:04:44.109\nthe CPU, the tower, all the device\nperipherals, the keyboard, the mouse, etc.\n\n99\n00:04:44.109 --> 00:04:47.994\nThe mouse pad because let's not forget\nmouse pads are confidential purveyors of\n\n100\n00:04:47.994 --> 00:04:51.620\ninformation we must classify them\nalong with the rest of the system.\n\n101\n00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.600\nSo, we put the entire system in effect\ninto a Faraday cage, into a shell.\n\n102\n00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.310\nAnd this is a special metallic device that\nwe effectively insert the system into.\n\n103\n00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.950\nIt is effectively gonna look just like\na cage that sits around the system.\n\n104\n00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.470\nIt absorbs all\nthe electromagnetic radiation,\n\n105\n00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.340\npreventing the information from\nseeping out beyond the cage.\n\n106\n00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.730\nSo you see this in secure networks,\n\n107\n00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.780\nit's not something you\nwould run into every day.\n\n108\n00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.930\nBut when we talk about\nprotective shielding,\n\n109\n00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.590\nwe talk about Tempest technology,\nwe talk about Faraday cages specifically\n\n110\n00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.540\ndealing with emanations,electromagnetic\nradiation coming off of the box.\n\n111\n00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.190\nWe also have to think about\nknowing a little bit about, or\n\n112\n00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.660\nthink about, the concept of\nwhat's known as a state attack.\n\n113\n00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.680\nA state attack or attacks that\ndeal with the state of the system\n\n114\n00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.010\nare going to also commonly\nbe called race conditions.\n\n115\n00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.122\nYou may hear them referred to in that way.\n\n116\n00:05:37.122 --> 00:05:40.050\nThis takes advantage of effectively\nhow a system is able to process or\n\n117\n00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.810\nhandle multiple requests.\n\n118\n00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.695\nSo for instance,\nlet's say that I ask Mike.\n\n119\n00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:50.025\nMike's gonna be our equivalent\ncomputing device in our example here.\n\n120\n00:05:50.025 --> 00:05:52.845\nSo, if I ask Mike to do three things for\nme.\n\n121\n00:05:52.845 --> 00:05:56.655\nMike, I need you to go open the door,\nget me a glass of water and\n\n122\n00:05:56.655 --> 00:05:58.995\nalso bring me back a double espresso,\nright?\n\n123\n00:05:58.995 --> 00:06:04.055\nSo, if I ask Mike to do those three things\nand then Mike goes and opens the door and\n\n124\n00:06:04.055 --> 00:06:08.225\nthen gets the espresso and comes back\nin before he brings back the water.\n\n125\n00:06:08.225 --> 00:06:12.700\nIf you remember I said open door,\nget water, get espresso in that order.\n\n126\n00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.820\nIf Mike brings me the espresso,\nforgets the water, has to go back and\n\n127\n00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.310\nget it again,\nhe's executed those requests out of order.\n\n128\n00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.030\nThe way in which those execution\nrequests are carried out by the system,\n\n129\n00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.500\nthe way in which we see\ninformation showing up.\n\n130\n00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.890\nAnd the ordering or sequencing of\nthose requests can be examined.\n\n131\n00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.320\nAnd if we then are able to understand\nwhat happens in or out of sequence,\n\n132\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.910\nwe may be able to tell something\nabout the system and how it operates.\n\n133\n00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.710\nAnd if we can then divulge\ncertain information or derive and\n\n134\n00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.760\neffectively understand and analyze\nthe system to see certain information\n\n135\n00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.060\nas a result of that,\nwe can then begin to form a mechanism or\n\n136\n00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.490\na thought process around how\nwe may attack the system.\n\n137\n00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.424\nSo race conditions look at the order\nin which CPU processing takes place,\n\n138\n00:06:56.424 --> 00:06:59.543\nthe order in which effectively\nrequests are carried out.\n\n139\n00:06:59.543 --> 00:07:01.789\nI just want to note for\neverybody out there, for\n\n140\n00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:04.575\nthe record Mike has not gone and\ngotten me my espresso yet.\n\n141\n00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:06.220\n[LAUGH] Just pointing that out.\n\n142\n00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.920\nJust have a little bit of failure of\ncommunication taking place here today.\n\n143\n00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.790\nBut that's okay,\nwe're gonna work through this.\n\n144\n00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.010\nThat's not a problem.\n\n145\n00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.330\nAll right, so state attacks are all\nabout race conditions, right?\n\n146\n00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.200\nI wanna make sure we understand that\na race condition is about the idea behind\n\n147\n00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.380\nunderstanding how systems\nprocess information,\n\n148\n00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.600\nwhat order they process in and\nunderstanding that there may be valuable\n\n149\n00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.840\ninformation we can derive\nby examining that and\n\n150\n00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.540\nunderstanding that that may then lead\nus to be able to compromise a system.\n\n151\n00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.340\nThe mechanics of how that happens\nare not so critical for you.\n\n152\n00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.450\nI know you may be excited to\nunderstand how that works.\n\n153\n00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.450\nAnd I'm not suggesting you\nshouldn't research that.\n\n154\n00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.500\nBut let me be clear,\n\n155\n00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.060\nwe're not going to ask you to explain\nthis kind of an attack on an exam.\n\n156\n00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.070\nWe're simply going to ask whether or\nnot you are aware of it,\n\n157\n00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:46.940\nand if you have to define it, or\n\n158\n00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.580\napply the knowledge to a scenario,\nmake sure you understand what it is.\n\n159\n00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.497\nWe're not going to ask you how\nto carry one out in other words.\n\n160\n00:07:52.497 --> 00:07:54.876\nThis is not a practical hacking exam.\n\n161\n00:07:54.876 --> 00:07:57.617\nThis is a exam about information\nsecurity management.\n\n162\n00:07:57.617 --> 00:07:59.949\nSo I just want to make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n163\n00:07:59.949 --> 00:08:02.178\nIn addition,\nwe talk about covert channels.\n\n164\n00:08:02.178 --> 00:08:05.454\nCovert channels are gonna be\ncommunications mechanisms, effectively,\n\n165\n00:08:05.454 --> 00:08:06.650\nthat are hidden from view.\n\n166\n00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.804\nSo if I'm able to communicate with\nsomebody normally using the phone,\n\n167\n00:08:10.804 --> 00:08:14.490\nI pick up the phone, I call you up,\nwe have a conversation.\n\n168\n00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.040\nThat's an understood, well established,\nwell documented communication mechanism.\n\n169\n00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.570\nIt's not a covert channel.\n\n170\n00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.070\nIt's what we would call an overt channel,\nobviously available and out for\n\n171\n00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.990\neverybody to see in public view.\n\n172\n00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:28.240\nA covert channel would be if nobody but\nyou and\n\n173\n00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.380\nI both knew that we each\nhad a two-way pager.\n\n174\n00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.090\nWe'll reach back into the textbook\nof old school technology, right?\n\n175\n00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.170\nFor years,\nwhen I was in the music business, for\n\n176\n00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:41.260\nyears I carried a two way sky pager, so\nyou have the you know, one 800 number.\n\n177\n00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:41.860\nYou could call me.\n\n178\n00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.600\nI still remember the number, by the way.\n\n179\n00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.000\nAnd you could call me, and\nup to about four lines of text,\n\n180\n00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.760\nyou could send me a message.\n\n181\n00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.530\nBecause you know back in the 80s,\nright, back in the day.\n\n182\n00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:50.430\nTell you how old I am.\n\n183\n00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:53.450\nBack in the 80s when I was doing this,\nand I was in the music business and\n\n184\n00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.660\nI was you know, working and\ndoing all sorts of stuff.\n\n185\n00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.270\nThat was really the only way\nyou get a hold of people.\n\n186\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.600\nThere were really no cell\nphones back in the early 80s.\n\n187\n00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.370\nIf theyre were,\nthey were incredibly expensive.\n\n188\n00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:04.630\nYou didn't really have them in the way\nwe do today where everybody has one,\n\n189\n00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:06.555\nbecause Apple has taken over the world.\n\n190\n00:09:06.555 --> 00:09:08.580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They said that that was important so\n\n191\n00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.786\nnow everybody has one, but\nback then you didn't have that.\n\n192\n00:09:11.786 --> 00:09:15.520\nAn overt mechanism for communication back\nthen would have been a two way pager,\n\n193\n00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:17.280\nor a pager that you can page people on.\n\n194\n00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.080\nToday, you just don't have those things.\n\n195\n00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.889\nWhen I say a pager to my\nstudents they look at me and go,\n\n196\n00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:23.150\nwhat the hell are you talking about.\n\n197\n00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.190\nI also talk about rotary dial phones,\nand they're like, you're a dinosaur.\n\n198\n00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.650\nWhat are you talking about?\n\n199\n00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:33.280\nSo a two-way pager would be\nan example of a covert channel.\n\n200\n00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.880\nIf only you and I,\nlet's say hypothetically,\n\n201\n00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.400\nwere having this conversation, and\n\n202\n00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.510\nboth of us had a pager and we knew each\nother's numbers, but nobody else did,\n\n203\n00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.110\nwe could send each other\ninformation over the pager.\n\n204\n00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.640\nBut nobody else knew about\nthat communication mechanism,\n\n205\n00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.490\nthat would be considered a covert channel,\nsomething that is secret.\n\n206\n00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.330\nIt's only known, basically, to one or\n\n207\n00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.100\nmaybe two parties that can\nengage in communication.\n\n208\n00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.930\nWhen we turn that into the conversation\nabout security in the system,\n\n209\n00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.780\nwhat we're really talking about\nis something like a back door,\n\n210\n00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.390\nsomething that is only known to maybe\none individual, typically a hacker\n\n211\n00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.410\nthat could take advantage of that,\nbut may not be known to anybody else.\n\n212\n00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.350\nSo that's what a covert channel will be.\n\n213\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:10.780\nAnd so we talk about specifically\ntwo kinds of covert channels.\n\n214\n00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.160\nThe TC sec, if you remember the orange\nbook that we defined as part of\n\n215\n00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.520\nthe rainbow series, was the TC sec.\n\n216\n00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.840\nThe TC sec is gonna define for\nus, or did define for us,\n\n217\n00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.530\ntwo specific covert channels.\n\n218\n00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.010\nStorage channels and timing channels.\n\n219\n00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.650\nSo storage covert channels are ways in\nwhich we communicate through storage\n\n220\n00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:29.700\nmechanisms without anybody knowing.\n\n221\n00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.810\nSo, can we use white space or\n\n222\n00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.660\nslack space in the drive to\neffectively hide information and\n\n223\n00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.440\nmake it available to a hacker that\nmay use it to control the system?\n\n224\n00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.460\nAs one example.\n\n225\n00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.180\nIf you're not familiar with white space or\nslack space,\n\n226\n00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:45.900\nthis is the area of the hard drive that\nis where we can store information, but\n\n227\n00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.190\nis not available to the file system.\n\n228\n00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:52.510\nSo, we don't show you that information\nwhen you open the file explorer.\n\n229\n00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.130\nIt's there, in other words, but you're\nnot able to see it with the graphical\n\n230\n00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.130\ninterface from within\nthe operating system.\n\n231\n00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.870\nSo this is one of the ways we can do that.\n\n232\n00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.830\nA timing channel, a covert timing\nchannel may have to do with\n\n233\n00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.410\nthe way we execute commands, as we were\ntalking about just a moment ago where\n\n234\n00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.720\nwe talk about state attacks and\nrace conditions.\n\n235\n00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.880\nA race condition is an example of using\na timing channel, a covert timing channel,\n\n236\n00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.260\nto execute an attack.\n\n237\n00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.590\nSo timing channels look at the way\nwe execute information, or\n\n238\n00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:17.970\nwe execute processes.\n\n239\n00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:19.100\nIs there a way to get in there?\n\n240\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.490\nIs there a way to modify that?\n\n241\n00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.070\nIs there a way to control that?\n\n242\n00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.320\nAnd is there a way to tell\nwhat the system function is?\n\n243\n00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.920\nAnd therefore weaknesses as\na result of looking at timing.\n\n244\n00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.890\nThese are the two covert\nchannels that are accepted and\n\n245\n00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:33.030\ndefined, and you should be aware of\nthem as two examples of covert channels.\n\n246\n00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.700\nWe also have to think\nabout older technology,\n\n247\n00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.420\nsuch as mainframes and\nthin client computing.\n\n248\n00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.000\nYeah, we still have\nmainframe computers around.\n\n249\n00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.530\nThey're not as prevalent\nas they once were, but\n\n250\n00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.450\nwe certainly still have a lot of them.\n\n251\n00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.840\nThings like AS 400s, for instance,\nif you work in that space,\n\n252\n00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.790\nare probably very common for\nsome of you in your data centers.\n\n253\n00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.550\nSo the idea behind that technology\n\n254\n00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.400\nis that it has some advantages from\na security perspective, right?\n\n255\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.890\nAll of the processing takes place\non that central computer and\n\n256\n00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:02.370\nwe go to that mainframe system to get\nthe data and to analyze, and access it.\n\n257\n00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.730\nIn other words, we don't have copies of\ndata laying around on local systems when\n\n258\n00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.990\nwe're working on mainframes.\n\n259\n00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.390\nSo it's easier for\nus to be able to secure the data and\n\n260\n00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.410\ncontrol the processing cuz it\nall takes place in one place.\n\n261\n00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:16.360\nAnd we effectively just use frontend\nsystems to access the data and\n\n262\n00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.060\ninteract with it, but\nit never stays on the front end system.\n\n263\n00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.372\nIt is always resonant there.\n\n264\n00:12:20.372 --> 00:12:22.820\nAnd so on the back end system rather,\non the main frame, so\n\n265\n00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.930\nas a result because it's\na centralized computing environment,\n\n266\n00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.590\nwe wanna think about the fact that from an\narchitecture and a security perspective,\n\n267\n00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.625\nvulnerabilities there are significantly\nless than they would be in the modern\n\n268\n00:12:33.625 --> 00:12:36.280\nde-centralized computing\nsystems that we have today,\n\n269\n00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.100\nwhere on my laptop I may\nhave a complete copy of\n\n270\n00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.780\nall the sensitive confidential data\nthat exists in the organization,\n\n271\n00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:46.560\neven though there's multiple copies up\non a file server or in different places.\n\n272\n00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.120\nI may also have a copy locally.\n\n273\n00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:52.010\nIf my laptop is compromised, that data's\ncompromised, even though it may exist in\n\n274\n00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:55.370\nfour or five other locations and\nis securely stored there.\n\n275\n00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.030\nSo we have to think about\nthe implications of a centralized\n\n276\n00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:02.850\nversus decentralized architecture as\npart of the conversation here as well.\n\n277\n00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:05.910\nWhen we talk about mainframes,\nwe also have to think about middleware.\n\n278\n00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:10.380\nMiddleware is the bridging software that\nis often used today to effectively allow\n\n279\n00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.270\nus to get to mainframe systems, but\nto use them with a Web-enabled front end.\n\n280\n00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:19.000\nSome sort of web API, or web interface\nthat allows us to access the mainframe,\n\n281\n00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.210\nand to use the data there, but to use it\nwith modern computers and modern programs.\n\n282\n00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:25.750\nWhen in effect, the mainframe was\nreally designed to be working\n\n283\n00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:27.926\nin a very different kind\nof computing environment.\n\n284\n00:13:27.926 --> 00:13:31.750\nDumb terminals with thin client computers\nwould've been used years ago, and\n\n285\n00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.130\nthey really would've run a very minimal\noperating system, and they would have just\n\n286\n00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.650\nreally been probably command shell\nenvironment, not a graphical interface.\n\n287\n00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.500\nI don't know if you remember years ago,\nI'm gonna date myself horribly here again,\n\n288\n00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.290\nbut I was going to\ncollege back in the 80s,\n\n289\n00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.370\nwe won't tell you what part of the 80s,\nbut it was earlier rather than later, but\n\n290\n00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.660\nwhen I was in college in the 80s and\nI would go back and go and do research for\n\n291\n00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.790\na term paper, things like that,\nwhen I was working on my degrees.\n\n292\n00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:58.230\nI would go to this mythical place,\nwe used to call it a library.\n\n293\n00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.070\nIt's a beautiful place, boys and girls.\n\n294\n00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.590\nThey don't exist anymore.\n\n295\n00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:04.480\nIt was a collection of books that you\ncould actually take out and hold in your\n\n296\n00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:09.160\nhand and read, not electronic devices that\nyou use to read books on like we do today.\n\n297\n00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.550\nSo I would go to the library to\ndo research, as many people did,\n\n298\n00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.200\nI'm sure some of you still do.\n\n299\n00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.180\nBut when you went to the library,\nthe card catalogue, right?\n\n300\n00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:19.190\nIf you went to an earlier\nversion of the library,\n\n301\n00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.820\nthe original version,\nit was all actual physical cards.\n\n302\n00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.490\nThat's why they call it a card catalogue.\n\n303\n00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:25.990\nAnd you had it in these long\nfiling cabinet drawers.\n\n304\n00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.510\nAnd you would look up using\nthe Dewey Decimal System,\n\n305\n00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.630\nanother great invention that has come and\ngone.\n\n306\n00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:33.880\nYou would use the Dewey Decimal System and\nyou would look up your book, and then you\n\n307\n00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.990\nwould go search for it in the stacks and\nsee whether it was there or not.\n\n308\n00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.210\nBut then they converted all\nthat into an online catalogue.\n\n309\n00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.100\nAnd so the main frame system\nthat would host that was this\n\n310\n00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.750\nmassive computer sitting somewhere,\na vax system, whatever it was,\n\n311\n00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.750\nand you would have these dumb terminals,\nthese green CRT, or amber CRT screens.\n\n312\n00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:53.070\nThe kind you would see at doctor's\noffices years ago as well.\n\n313\n00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.200\nAnd you would go and type in what\nyou wanted, and it would go and\n\n314\n00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.090\nsearch in the mainframe and bring it back.\n\n315\n00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:01.640\nSo, the middle ware that we use today\neffectively takes that system and\n\n316\n00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.570\nbrings it into the modern world by giving\nyou the ability to interact with it\n\n317\n00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.770\nusing a windows graphical environment\nto be able to get to the data.\n\n318\n00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.130\nThis is what middleware does.\n\n319\n00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.000\nMiddleware is good, but the problem is,\nmiddleware is software, and\n\n320\n00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.910\nlike any software, there are potentially\nare bugs and vulnerabilities\n\n321\n00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:20.320\ninherent in it and we have to understand\nthat and be aware of that as we look and\n\n322\n00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.780\nassessment and mitigate ultimately\nvulnerabilities within these systems.\n\n323\n00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.100\nEmbedded systems are another\narea we have to worry about.\n\n324\n00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.130\nWhen you go and you go to a retailer and\n\n325\n00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.260\nthey are going to be able to provide\nsome transactional data for you.\n\n326\n00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:33.090\nYou want to look up\nsomething in inventory.\n\n327\n00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:37.200\nThey have an embedded POS, a point of sale\nsystem they use at cash registers and\n\n328\n00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.090\nthings like that.\n\n329\n00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:42.210\nSo if you go to Home Depot, you go to\nTarget, you go to Lowes, you go anywhere,\n\n330\n00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:45.820\nwhatever these major retailers are,\nBest Buy, doesn't matter.\n\n331\n00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.160\nWhen you go to any of them,\n\n332\n00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.520\nright, the idea is that you're gonna ask\na sales associate hey, do you have this?\n\n333\n00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:54.065\nThey look it up on their\ncash register/terminal.\n\n334\n00:15:54.065 --> 00:15:57.570\nThey're using an embedded POS,\na point of sales system, right,\n\n335\n00:15:57.570 --> 00:15:58.766\nin order to look it up.\n\n336\n00:15:58.766 --> 00:16:02.655\nWhen you go check into a hotel The\nreservation system that runs on the front\n\n337\n00:16:02.655 --> 00:16:06.919\ndesk computers is using an embedded POS,\nan embedded point of sales system, and\n\n338\n00:16:06.919 --> 00:16:08.660\nan embedded operating system.\n\n339\n00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:13.060\nProbably a Windows system, and maybe\nWindows CE, version six, version seven,\n\n340\n00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:13.970\nwhatever it is.\n\n341\n00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:17.351\nIt's pre-installed into that system and\nruns Windows but it's a unique and\n\n342\n00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:20.523\nstripped down version of Windows that\nwon't run on normal PCs because it\n\n343\n00:16:20.523 --> 00:16:24.390\ndoesn't operate the same way, it doesn't\nhave the same capabilities in other words.\n\n344\n00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:28.540\nSo, embedded systems provide a very\nsmall set of capabilities in a small,\n\n345\n00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.470\nlimited form factor and are used\nspecifically to achieve certain results.\n\n346\n00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.720\nIn this case, be able to sell and\nprocess certain things, look up inventory,\n\n347\n00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.770\nwhatever it may be.\n\n348\n00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.920\nAgain, these systems may also have\nvulnerabilities we have to mitigate.\n\n349\n00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.910\nThey have to be patch managed\nlike everything else does, but\n\n350\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.790\npatching them will take a different form\nbecause we have to get certain patches\n\n351\n00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.638\nfrom vendors in order to\nintegrate them into the systems.\n\n352\n00:16:48.638 --> 00:16:54.390\nThere maybe a issue associated with\nsecurity in those systems, with\n\n353\n00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.820\nregards to user log ons and authentication\nthat we have to watch out for.\n\n354\n00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.650\nIn other words, if somebody doesn't\nlog out of that system, and\n\n355\n00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.140\nwe don't have a control in place\nthat automatically session times out\n\n356\n00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.700\nthen somebody can walk up and gain access\nto that system when you're not there.\n\n357\n00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:11.110\nAnd as a result, they can potentially\ngain access to transactional data,\n\n358\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:13.480\nthey can manipulate inventory,\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n359\n00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:17.440\nSo what you often see in these systems\nwhen somebody walks away from a terminal,\n\n360\n00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.730\nthey have to log out specifically,\nthey go through a log out process.\n\n361\n00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.430\nThey effectively zero out the terminal so\nit's not in use.\n\n362\n00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.990\nThen you have to log back on.\n\n363\n00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.500\nSo if you've even seen somebody walk up\nto a cash register, there's a busy line\n\n364\n00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.510\nwherever you are, and they walk up and\nthey have to go through a whole set up\n\n365\n00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:35.710\nprocess to bring the system up for you to\nthen go and pay and have a shorter line.\n\n366\n00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.700\nThat's because they're logging\nback into the POS system, and\n\n367\n00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.410\neffectively activating the terminal.\n\n368\n00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.160\nAnd so\nthis is what we see with embedded systems.\n\n369\n00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.970\nWe have to be aware of this as well.\n\n370\n00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.100\nWhen we think about all\nthese kind of systems,\n\n371\n00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.850\nwe also have to bring mobile\ndevices into the picture, right?\n\n372\n00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.310\nBecause no conversation\nabout vulnerabilities and\n\n373\n00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.255\nassessment of mitigation would be complete\nwithout talking about all the different\n\n374\n00:17:54.255 --> 00:17:55.415\nplatforms we have.\n\n375\n00:17:55.415 --> 00:17:57.945\nWe've spoken about mobile devices\nin certain areas already.\n\n376\n00:17:57.945 --> 00:18:00.855\nWe want to understand the thing about\nthe fact that when we talk about mobile\n\n377\n00:18:00.855 --> 00:18:03.545\ndevices, we may be talking\nabout tablets or laptops.\n\n378\n00:18:03.545 --> 00:18:07.375\nThese'll run common operating systems\ntoday that obviously we are well aware of,\n\n379\n00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:11.375\nwe can manage and understand but we're\nalso potentially talking about mobile\n\n380\n00:18:11.375 --> 00:18:15.400\ndevices such as phones and\nwe often call them smartphones today.\n\n381\n00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.330\nMy question about smart phones is this,\nand I often see the iron in things so\n\n382\n00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.710\nI'm gonna make an observation here.\n\n383\n00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.370\nIf they're so\n\n384\n00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:25.550\nsmart, why can't they manage themselves\nand never have a problem with security?\n\n385\n00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.260\nI don't know.\n\n386\n00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:26.940\nI'm just saying.\n\n387\n00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:29.200\nIf they were that smart,\nthey'd be able to do that.\n\n388\n00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:32.380\nBut since they're not that smart,\nwe have mobile device management and\n\n389\n00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:36.130\nwe have the ability to be able to do\npatch management and security mitigation\n\n390\n00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:40.050\non these devices through policy-based\napplication of management solutions.\n\n391\n00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:43.220\nAnd so we have to be thinking about\nthe fact that in the mobile world,\n\n392\n00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.200\nat least in the phone based mobile world,\n\n393\n00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.390\nwe have at least four competitive\nsystems that we have to worry about.\n\n394\n00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:52.070\nRight, we have Blackberry today,\nwe have Android based systems,\n\n395\n00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:55.180\nwe have Apple based systems, and\nwe have Windows mobile based systems.\n\n396\n00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.030\nSo as a result,\nwe have at least four different platforms\n\n397\n00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.510\nin the handheld smartphone market, that\nwe potentially have to become aware of,\n\n398\n00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.680\nunderstand, and figure out how to manage\nand mitigate security vulnerabilities for.\n\n399\n00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.910\nI saw an interesting study in\nthe last couple days that came\n\n400\n00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:13.680\nout about the potential, looking ahead to\nsome of the new technology advances in\n\n401\n00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.160\nthe iPhone platforms and things that\nlike that are continuing to come out.\n\n402\n00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.210\nThe potential for security vulnerabilities\non the apple platform increasing\n\n403\n00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.580\nas they continue to add new\nfunctionality and build out new things.\n\n404\n00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.860\nJust the jump to biometric support\nalone has opened up potentially new\n\n405\n00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.660\nvulnerabilities on the apple platform.\n\n406\n00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.755\nSo the reality is, for everything we do,\nthe more complex you make a system,\n\n407\n00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:36.660\nthe more vulnerabilities\nwe often introduce into it.\n\n408\n00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.114\nAnd this is something we have to think\nabout as well, as we have an app for\n\n409\n00:19:40.114 --> 00:19:43.410\neverything, as my children\nare often very fond of telling me.\n\n410\n00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.730\nDaddy, there's an app for that.\n\n411\n00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.250\nYeah, I don't care about apps,\nI run Blackberry technology.\n\n412\n00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.730\nI don't use a lot of apps.\n\n413\n00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.100\nI use a phone that's actually meant for\nbusiness.\n\n414\n00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.550\nAs opposed to a computing device that\nis a consumer product that's meant for\n\n415\n00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:56.610\nfun and games.\n\n416\n00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.790\nBut I'll get off my soapbox and\nget back to what we're talking about.\n\n417\n00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.600\nSo when there's an app for everything,\n\n418\n00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.570\nwe want to understand that apps in\nof themselves are software programs.\n\n419\n00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.920\nThey bring functionality with them,\nbut they also bring liability.\n\n420\n00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.200\nThey bring risk on top of the risk\nwe already see in the platform.\n\n421\n00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.760\nBut we have to be thinking about\nall these things as we assess and\n\n422\n00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.730\nmitigate vulnerabilities.\n\n423\n00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:19.590\nBecause if we're mitigating\nthe vulnerability on the phone,\n\n424\n00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:23.250\nby managing the operating system\nitself and patching that.\n\n425\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:27.920\nBut we're not mitigating and assessing the\nvulnerabilities in the compiled code, ie.,\n\n426\n00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.600\nthe apps that we are running.\n\n427\n00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.370\nWe've only done half the job.\n\n428\n00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.340\nAnd as a CISSP, if we have corporate\nowned devices that are being given to\n\n429\n00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.870\nindividuals in the company and\nwe're not managing them effectively,\n\n430\n00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.040\nwe're allowing apps to run and\nbe installed without our knowledge, and\n\n431\n00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.580\nwe've effectively opened that\nplatform up to compromise.\n\n432\n00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.250\nAnd we see repeat examples of\nthis throughout time where apps,\n\n433\n00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.940\neven though they go through all\nthe security processes in whatever vendor\n\n434\n00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:56.500\nstore Google Store,\nthe Android Play Store, the iTunes Store,\n\n435\n00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.280\nwhatever it is,\neven the Microsoft Windows store.\n\n436\n00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.880\nAll three of them have had security\nfailures where app have been certified\n\n437\n00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.030\nonly later to to find out\nthey contain malware.\n\n438\n00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.570\nNobody's perfect is my point, right?\n\n439\n00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:11.521\nAnd I'm not suggesting any one vendor\nis better or worse than any other, but\n\n440\n00:21:11.521 --> 00:21:15.715\nI am pointing out to you, that if you rely\nexclusively on a vendor to do their job,\n\n441\n00:21:15.715 --> 00:21:17.840\nAnd you don't double check and verify.\n\n442\n00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.060\nYou're gonna have a problem.\n\n443\n00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.630\nBecause it,\nat some point they're gonna get it wrong.\n\n444\n00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.770\nAnd I'm not suggesting you may be\nable to verify the integrity and\n\n445\n00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:28.660\nthe lack of malware in an application\nthat may be beyond your capabilities.\n\n446\n00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.550\nYou may have to make some educated\ndecisions about whether to trust\n\n447\n00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.420\nthe vendor or not.\n\n448\n00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.420\nAnd then hope for the best.\n\n449\n00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.915\nBut what I am suggesting to you\nis that if you don't have a plan,\n\n450\n00:21:36.915 --> 00:21:40.070\nif you haven't thought through what\nwill happen if something like that\n\n451\n00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:44.790\ndoes occur and the vendor gets it wrong,\nand you're not prepared to react, you're\n\n452\n00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.570\ngonna have a significant challenge on your\nhands that's gonna be worse than if you've\n\n453\n00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.780\nalready thought through the likelihood of\nthe fact that the vendor may screw up and\n\n454\n00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:56.530\nget it wrong, and as a result of that,\nwhat will happen when that does.\n\n455\n00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:59.620\nMitigation and assessment of\nvulnerabilities and planning to deal with\n\n456\n00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.140\nthem, is not always about figuring\nout how to stop it before it starts.\n\n457\n00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.790\nWe have to accept\na certain amount of risk.\n\n458\n00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.380\nWe've talked about how we deal with risk.\n\n459\n00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.220\nWe can accept if you remember, right?\n\n460\n00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.720\nWe can avoid.\n\n461\n00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.540\nWe can transfer or we can mitigate.\n\n462\n00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.290\nWe've been focusing heavily on mitigation.\n\n463\n00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:17.430\nI will continue to in some of our upcoming\nepisodes in this particular topic area.\n\n464\n00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.760\nOh, you want to keep in mind if we're\nnot gonna avoid risk altogether.\n\n465\n00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.840\nIf we're gonna allow users to\ndownload apps on mobile platforms\n\n466\n00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.960\nwe're gonna accept the certain amount of\nrisk because we're not gonna be able to\n\n467\n00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.400\nverify the integrity.\n\n468\n00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.680\nAnd the likelihood that there is or\nis not malware in that particular app\n\n469\n00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.870\nmay be unknown to us at the time we allow\nthe app to effectively be installed.\n\n470\n00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:38.500\nWe may have to wait and\nsee, in other words.\n\n471\n00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.170\nBut if we're planning for\n\n472\n00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.660\nultimately what the bad outcome could be,\nyou know, the boy scout motto, right?\n\n473\n00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.000\nAlways be prepared.\n\n474\n00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.620\nSo if we are always prepared, then\nthe likelihood of that mitigation strategy\n\n475\n00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.410\ngoing into effect quickly is a lot higher\nthan you sitting around wondering what\n\n476\n00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.600\nwent wrong, and why Apple or Android got\nit wrong and who you're gonna blame.\n\n477\n00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.340\nYou can blame them all day,\nit's not gonna solve your problem.\n\n478\n00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.870\nThe malware's still there and\nit's still spreading.\n\n479\n00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.750\nSo you wanna think about that,\nkeep that in mind,\n\n480\n00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.480\nand obviously be aware of that as well.\n\n481\n00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.030\nWhen we often talk about these systems and\nwe think about vulnerabilities,\n\n482\n00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.810\nyou also have to think about what's\nknown as a single point of failure.\n\n483\n00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.660\nWhat is the key area,\n\n484\n00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.440\nthe weak link, in this particular\nprocess chain that we have to focus on.\n\n485\n00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:19.390\nIs it the fact that you only have\na single power supply on a server?\n\n486\n00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.310\nAnd that server may be your main file and\nprint server.\n\n487\n00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.920\nAnd if it's crunch time at the end of\nthe month, you're generating reports and\n\n488\n00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.700\nthat server gets overloaded, overheats and\n\n489\n00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.620\nfails, then that's a single\npoint of failure for you.\n\n490\n00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.650\nSo anything that is not redundant\npotentially is a single point of failure\n\n491\n00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:35.390\nMake sure we know that.\n\n492\n00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:40.160\nOne of the things we often do, we talked\nabout in this regard is carrying out\n\n493\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.400\nwhat's called a single\npoint of failure audit.\n\n494\n00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.580\nGoing through your systems and\nlooking for single points of failure and\n\n495\n00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:47.520\ndocumenting and identifying them.\n\n496\n00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.797\nAnd then figuring out whether or\nnot should gonna offset them and\n\n497\n00:23:49.797 --> 00:23:51.877\nmitigate them through creating\nwere done in strategies.\n\n498\n00:23:51.877 --> 00:23:55.638\nThings like the application of a RAID,\nsolutions and some sorts of technology.\n\n499\n00:23:55.638 --> 00:23:58.376\nAnd we'll identify RAID\nlevels at some point later.\n\n500\n00:23:58.376 --> 00:24:01.435\nBy using a mirroring strategy,\nRAID level one, for instance,\n\n501\n00:24:01.435 --> 00:24:05.130\nis one way to create redundancy for\ninformation storage locally on a system.\n\n502\n00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:08.260\nThat would be a good example of dealing\nwith a single point of failure if the hard\n\n503\n00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.120\ndrive or the controller were\nto fail within the system.\n\n504\n00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.810\nYou could do RAID,\n\n505\n00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:15.270\nor RAID-1 with duplexing which would\nbe both controllers and drives, right.\n\n506\n00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.030\nI got that right, right?\n\n507\n00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:16.910\n>> Yes you did.\n>> Okay, good.\n\n508\n00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.051\nI was really worried about that.\n\n509\n00:24:18.051 --> 00:24:18.996\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah I can tell.\n\n510\n00:24:18.996 --> 00:24:20.211\n>> Oh my God what am I gonna call that?\n\n511\n00:24:20.211 --> 00:24:23.420\nAll right, so you know, things like RAID-1\nand duplex should be good examples.\n\n512\n00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.430\nWe might have dual memory cards, I\nmentioned that earlier with the NIC team.\n\n513\n00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.950\nA NIC team is the joining of two or\nmore cards together so\n\n514\n00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:33.080\nthat we can fail over to a card if one\nwere to stop working for some reason.\n\n515\n00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.660\nWe might have redundant power supplies, we\nmight have UPS's and backup scenarios for\n\n516\n00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.530\ngeneration of power, things like that.\n\n517\n00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.860\nAll of these will eliminate\nsingle points of failure,\n\n518\n00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.170\nwant to make sure you're aware of that.\n\n519\n00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:46.880\nAlso, keep in mind there's a human single\npoint of failure element we have to\n\n520\n00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.940\nthink about and\nalso understand and document.\n\n521\n00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.520\nWhat if somebody's walking around with\nknowledge in their head that nobody else\n\n522\n00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.350\nknows?\n\n523\n00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:55.180\nWe talked about this with the Fred\nexample, one of our earlier\n\n524\n00:24:55.180 --> 00:25:00.330\ndiscussions when we talked about having\na solution for a retention period\n\n525\n00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:04.000\nthat would match the expectation of the\nrequirement of keeping the data secure.\n\n526\n00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.130\nIf we use 15-year-old technology\nto implement the encryption or\n\n527\n00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.920\nto build the system that's gonna use that\nand then 20 or 15 years later when we get\n\n528\n00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.730\nto the end of the cycle, Fred, who's the\nengineer who built it, is no longer there,\n\n529\n00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:19.980\nand nobody got the info out of\nFred's head, was the example.\n\n530\n00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.950\nFred is now the single point of failure,\n\n531\n00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:24.890\nbecause effectively nobody knows\nhow to work that system any more.\n\n532\n00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.290\nAnd you effectively allow the information\nto escape the boundary of the organization\n\n533\n00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:30.590\nand not be captured anywhere.\n\n534\n00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.840\nSo we can also have a human\nsingle point of failure,\n\n535\n00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.140\nyou want to think about that and\nbe aware of that, as well.\n\n536\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:39.570\nWe've talked about computers in general,\ndesktops, laptops, all sort of computers.\n\n537\n00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:43.050\nAll of them have the ability to have\nthreats and vulnerabilities in them and\n\n538\n00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:46.520\nwe have to mitigate and assess those\nthreats and vulnerabilities, obviously.\n\n539\n00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.940\nAre we running things like\nlicensed operating systems,\n\n540\n00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.240\nnot running pirated software,\nin other words.\n\n541\n00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.120\nVery important because pirated software,\naside from being illegal and\n\n542\n00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.900\nobviously that's not a good thing at all.\n\n543\n00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.310\nBut aside from that, it usually has\nmalware or some sort of spyware in it, so\n\n544\n00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:03.710\nit's not just that you're breaking\nthe law, which is obviously very bad.\n\n545\n00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:06.890\nBut it could also lead to infection of\nmultiple systems which could easily\n\n546\n00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.250\nalso be a problem.\n\n547\n00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.810\nDo we have intrusion detection and\nintrusion prevention systems running?\n\n548\n00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:13.140\nAre we using firewalls?\n\n549\n00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.510\nAre we doing patch management?\n\n550\n00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:17.660\nThese are all things we think about in\nthis area with regards to desktops,\n\n551\n00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.140\nlaptops, servers, clients,\nthings of that nature.\n\n552\n00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.050\nWe've talked about mobile devices\nextensively already as well, we\n\n553\n00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.640\ntalked about server based solutions, all\nthese areas have to be brought to bear or\n\n554\n00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.650\nwill it be part of\nthe conversation we're having.\n\n555\n00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.710\nWe should also think about data flow and\n\n556\n00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:35.750\nhow data moves through a system with\nregards to assessing vulnerabilities and\n\n557\n00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:38.030\nassessing and\nthen ultimately mitigating them.\n\n558\n00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.940\nDo we understand the data flow pathways?\n\n559\n00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.640\nIn other words, have we mapped\nout the data flow in our systems?\n\n560\n00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.720\nDo we have what's called\na data flow diagram?\n\n561\n00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.835\nIf we do, we should be able to, and\nI often see this when I go into customer's\n\n562\n00:26:48.835 --> 00:26:52.110\nemergency operation centers, or\nKNOX, or I walk in their offices.\n\n563\n00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:55.380\nYou know, they have the huge plotter\nprintout on the wall, right?\n\n564\n00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.580\nYou know, they've go the 20 by 20,\nor whatever it is, and\n\n565\n00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.810\nthey've got the network map with all\nthe servers and everything laid out.\n\n566\n00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:03.350\nThe routing guys, or routing girls,\ntypically have that as well,\n\n567\n00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.960\nthey'll have the routing topology\nprinted out and laid out.\n\n568\n00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.110\nThe web hosting and database hosting\nareas have their own, that kind of thing.\n\n569\n00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.900\nThese are schematics, they're diagrams\nabout how systems are wired together.\n\n570\n00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.930\nWhat I don't often see though,\nis the data flow diagram,\n\n571\n00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.420\nhow does that actually move\nthrough those systems?\n\n572\n00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:23.210\nIf we don't understand that, we also could\nhave a vulnerability in the problem for\n\n573\n00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.250\nnot creating multi-path redundancies so\n\n574\n00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:28.770\ndata can flow through more than one,\npathway to get from point A to point C.\n\n575\n00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.370\nThat could be an issue,\nif we are using multi-path redundancy but\n\n576\n00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.050\nwe are not implementing and testing and\nvalidating multi-pathing but\n\n577\n00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.050\njust assuming it's working the right way,\nwe could have a problem.\n\n578\n00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:43.530\nHad a customer that had a yearly annual\nfailover event that they would use for\n\n579\n00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:44.650\ntesting purposes.\n\n580\n00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:48.320\nUnder regulatory law, they had to test\nfail over at least once a year here in\n\n581\n00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.350\nthe United States, during the financial\nand banking services industry.\n\n582\n00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:55.030\nAnd so they were required to do a full on\ninterruption test at least once a year, so\n\n583\n00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.139\nthey went and did the test.\n\n584\n00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:00.190\nThis is the interesting part, not that\nthey did the test, it's what happened, so\n\n585\n00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.350\nthey did the test.\n\n586\n00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:05.050\nThey were able to fail the systems over\nto wha they thought was their emergency\n\n587\n00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:05.950\noperation center.\n\n588\n00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.940\nThe problem is, when they failed over, A)\n\n589\n00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:13.080\nthe traffic wasn't going to where it was\nsupposed to, B) they couldn't fail back.\n\n590\n00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.040\nAnd so what had happened, and it took them\nthree days to figure this out, so you\n\n591\n00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.650\ncould imagine the impact to their systems\nto finally figure out what the answer was.\n\n592\n00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:22.390\nAnd the answer is often very simple.\n\n593\n00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:24.420\nThe problem is incredibly complex, but\n\n594\n00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:27.300\nwhen we finally get down to it,\nit was actually a very simple answer,\n\n595\n00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.040\nalthough the problem hid the simplicity\nof the answer for three days.\n\n596\n00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.120\nWhat ultimately had happened was right\nbefore the failure, or, excuse me, right\n\n597\n00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.340\nbefore the failover and then the failure,\nthey had gone through a patch cycle and\n\n598\n00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.160\nhad updated patches and firmware\nacross their routing infrastructure.\n\n599\n00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.010\nCisco had put out a series of updates and\nthey had done that.\n\n600\n00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.630\nBecause of the nature of\ntheir failover topology,\n\n601\n00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.740\neverything had to be patched to the exact\nsame level or things wouldn't work.\n\n602\n00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.900\nYou can see where I'm going with this,\nright?\n\n603\n00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.780\nSo, they had patched but they didn't patch\nto the same level across all the systems.\n\n604\n00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:58.270\nAnd one of the systems that was\ncritical in the middle of the path\n\n605\n00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.630\neffectively was different\nthan all the others and\n\n606\n00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.740\nwent off effectively into space and\nnever came back.\n\n607\n00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.990\nAnd it took three days of debunking and\nworking with Cisco engineers\n\n608\n00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.120\nto troubleshoot and\nfigure out what had gone wrong.\n\n609\n00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.460\nBecause all the obvious\nthings are the paths there,\n\n610\n00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:14.250\nwe're using deterministic routing,\nare all the static paths there?\n\n611\n00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.730\nIs everything up we can ping all\nthe interfaces everything's working\n\n612\n00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.250\nall that was fine.\n\n613\n00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:21.460\nThey could move traffic back and\nforth in controlled conditions, but\n\n614\n00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.590\nthey couldn't fail it over and\nthen bring it back, that was the problem.\n\n615\n00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.220\nAnd they couldn't do that because one\nof the patches that had been applied,\n\n616\n00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.310\nthat was applied at a different\nlevel had changed the nature of one\n\n617\n00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:33.240\nof the ways in which this particular\ntechnology was supposed to work.\n\n618\n00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.480\nAnd it was a minute change,\nbut it was an important one.\n\n619\n00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:39.060\nThe failure there was not just doing\nthat before a major failover event, but\n\n620\n00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.400\nthe failure was that they had not\ndocumented properly what patch levels were\n\n621\n00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.580\napplied to every system.\n\n622\n00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:47.430\nWe've talked significantly in many\nrespects about the value of documentation,\n\n623\n00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:49.540\nhow important it is and\nwhy we have to keep up with it so.\n\n624\n00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.145\nJust wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that as well, right?\n\n625\n00:29:53.145 --> 00:29:57.485\nSo just keeping that in mind as we begin\nan obviously in this particular case\n\n626\n00:29:57.485 --> 00:30:00.085\nstart to wrap up our conversations\nin this particular episode.\n\n627\n00:30:00.085 --> 00:30:02.815\nBut we're going to have a lot\nmore to say about assessing and\n\n628\n00:30:02.815 --> 00:30:04.115\nmitigating vulnerabilities.\n\n629\n00:30:04.115 --> 00:30:07.095\nSo hopefully you're going to be sticking\naround for those conversations.\n\n630\n00:30:07.095 --> 00:30:08.966\nWe'll have a lot of interesting\nthings to continue to talk about.\n\n631\n00:30:08.966 --> 00:30:12.465\n>> Absolutely, I hope you boys and\ngirls, ladies and gentlemen out there,\n\n632\n00:30:12.465 --> 00:30:15.520\nif your head is swimming like mine,\nit;s a ton of information.\n\n633\n00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.870\nA lot of vulnerabilities kinda, I'm trying\nto think of a good way to say this,\n\n634\n00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:21.540\nit's almost mind boggling.\n\n635\n00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.710\nAnd we're not done,\nwe've got more to go over.\n\n636\n00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:27.920\nSo we're gonna have to come back for\npart two to finish up our assessing and\n\n637\n00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.250\nmitigating vulnerabilities in\nour security architecture.\n\n638\n00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:32.780\nRemember, if you guys want to see or\n\n639\n00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:37.240\nattend one of Adam's classes shoot\nus an email, see Adam at itpro.tv.\n\n640\n00:30:37.240 -->

00:00:20.870\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick and\nwe are continuing on with our CISSP.\n\n4\n00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.840\nAnd specifically in this episode, we're\ncontinuing our conversation on assessing\n\n5\n00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.090\nand mitigating vulnerabilities\nin our system architecture.\n\n6\n00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.480\nSo we're just going to\nget right back into it,\n\n7\n00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.960\nthere's a lot of stuff we got to talk\nabout and here is Miser Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.560\nHello everybody.\n\n9\n00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.972\nI gave you the official Bullwinkle\ngreeting before but nobody responded.\n\n10\n00:00:37.972 --> 00:00:41.000\n>> [LAUGH] They're all doing it at home,\nI'm sure.\n\n11\n00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.940\n>> Happy Vulnerability Mitigation Day.\n\n12\n00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.990\nAll right, so let's jump back in to\ntalk about what we're here to discuss.\n\n13\n00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.720\nSo we're gonna continue on with the theme\nwe've been going through in our prior\n\n14\n00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.630\nepisode, which is assessment of\nvulnerabilities, mitigation of them\n\n15\n00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.230\nin systems architecture, and\nsecurity related concerns.\n\n16\n00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.390\nWe've talked a lot about all the building\nblocks of systems in the prior episode.\n\n17\n00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.170\nWe're gonna jump in and\n\n18\n00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.550\ntalk about some of the things that\nnow run on top of those systems.\n\n19\n00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.400\nThings like data, big data, how we\nmanage data, cloud based systems and\n\n20\n00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.024\ncloud computing,\n\n21\n00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:11.320\nand things of that nature will be\nthe focus of our general discussions here.\n\n22\n00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.800\nSo when we think about data,\nwhat we first have to do and\n\n23\n00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.940\nwe've already talked about subject object,\nand the distinction between them.\n\n24\n00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.800\nWe talk about object related stuff,\nwe talk about data.\n\n25\n00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.790\nWe have to think about what kind\nof data we're talking about.\n\n26\n00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.020\nWe know it's bits and bytes.\n\n27\n00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.020\nWe know data, generically, is that,\nat least in a computer, anyway, but it can\n\n28\n00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.750\ntake lots of different capabilities,\nlots of different data classifications,\n\n29\n00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.900\nlots of different concerns to help\nunderstand and articulate what data is.\n\n30\n00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.120\nAnd as a result of that,\nfigure out how to manage it effectively.\n\n31\n00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.220\nWe talked a lot about the importance\nof classification of data.\n\n32\n00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.690\nIs data going to have a certain level\nof protection associated with it?\n\n33\n00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.830\nThe answer is yes.\n\n34\n00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.630\nWe need to understand\nthe meaning of the data and\n\n35\n00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.760\nthe impact of the data\nto the organization.\n\n36\n00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.180\nSo where do we store data?\n\n37\n00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.850\nLet's start with that.\n\n38\n00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.860\nWe typically put it, obviously,\n\n39\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.622\nclearly, in storage devices,\nwhether it is short-term in memory,\n\n40\n00:01:58.622 --> 00:02:02.220\nlong-term on a hard drive,\nout on a storage array, wherever it is.\n\n41\n00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.160\nIf we have a large volume of data,\n\n42\n00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.410\nwe often talk about putting\nthat into a data warehouse.\n\n43\n00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.390\nA data warehouse is simply just a very\nlarge database that is constructed in such\n\n44\n00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.660\na way that we can use special tools to\nable to interact with and manage the data.\n\n45\n00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.150\nWhen we're talking about petabytes or\n\n46\n00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.970\nterabytes of data, we're talking about\nprobably putting it into a data warehouse.\n\n47\n00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.193\nWhen we're talking about megabytes or\ngigabytes of data,\n\n48\n00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:26.125\nwe're most likely talking\nabout storing it locally.\n\n49\n00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:29.025\nAnd so the idea of using a data warehouse\n\n50\n00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:31.325\nis one way that we can\nassess vulnerabilities, and\n\n51\n00:02:31.325 --> 00:02:35.045\nthen come up with a mitigation strategy\nto manage data more effectively.\n\n52\n00:02:35.045 --> 00:02:39.250\nBecause by warehousing, putting large\nvolumes of data into a central system\n\n53\n00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.260\nthat can be access controlled,\ncan be continuously monitored, can be risk\n\n54\n00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.110\nassessed, can be audited, can be managed\nso that people can interact with it, but\n\n55\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.840\nwe can understand and log and create\ntraceability and create visibilit,y and\n\n56\n00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.102\ntherefore accountability around\nthose interactions is a good thing.\n\n57\n00:02:55.102 --> 00:02:58.740\nAnd so using data warehousing is going\nto be a mechanism that we should be\n\n58\n00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.440\nthinking about because it let's\nus combine data that may be\n\n59\n00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.920\nstored locally in different areas in\nthe system, that is harder to manage,\n\n60\n00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.930\nharder to keep track of in one location,\ncentralizing data storage and data usage,\n\n61\n00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.800\nalso centralizes data security, and it\nmakes it easier to keep track of things.\n\n62\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.220\nSo data warehousing may be a good\nthing for us to think about.\n\n63\n00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.960\nThe idea behind managing data is\nfairly straightforward, right?\n\n64\n00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.100\nPut the data in one place,\n\n65\n00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.030\napply access controls to it,\nfigure out who's coming and going,\n\n66\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.950\nwhat they're doing, and only show them\nthe data that they're supposed to see.\n\n67\n00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.600\nThat part's pretty straight forward.\n\n68\n00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.350\nBut what if we show you the data you're\nsupposed to see, but as a result of doing\n\n69\n00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.040\nthat, you may actually be able to figure\nout there's other data in the system.\n\n70\n00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.970\nBut, we're not showing it to you.\n\n71\n00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.290\nYou'd be a pretty smart\nperson if you could do that.\n\n72\n00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.410\nMike was actually practicing this\ntechnique while we were off camera, and\n\n73\n00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.370\nhe was doing something known as inference.\n\n74\n00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.500\nNow, what inference is, is the ability to\nbe able to deduce, to affectively infer\n\n75\n00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.870\nthat there is information available\nin the system that may be hidden,\n\n76\n00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.000\nthat we're not seeing,\nfrom other information that we are seeing.\n\n77\n00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.980\nSo for instance, if I was to give\nyou three pieces of information, and\n\n78\n00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.730\nI was to say to you my first name is Adam,\nI like colorful\n\n79\n00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.710\nsocks as you all well know, and\nas a result of being named Adam and\n\n80\n00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.650\nliking colorful socks, I'm going\nto be presenting to you today and\n\n81\n00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.100\ntalking to you about CISSP\nrelated information.\n\n82\n00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.890\nYou could probably deduce or\n\n83\n00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.180\ninfer several things from those\nthree pieces of information.\n\n84\n00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.160\nYou could deduce that I'm a very sharp and\n\n85\n00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.170\nsnazzy dresser who has a sense of fashion,\nbecause I wear colorful socks.\n\n86\n00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.150\nYou could deduce that I probably know\nsomething about CISSP and CISSP related\n\n87\n00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.740\ninformation, because I've been asked\nto present that to you here today.\n\n88\n00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.670\nYou may also deduce the fact that\nMike may have developed laryngitis,\n\n89\n00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.520\nbecause he's not able to speak, and\nso I have to speak on his behalf.\n\n90\n00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.630\nAny or all of those things may be\npossible for you to infer, or deduce,\n\n91\n00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.630\nfrom at least two of the three pieces of\ninformation that I've shared with you.\n\n92\n00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.360\nI never came right out and\ntold you any of those things.\n\n93\n00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.480\nI simply gave you basic information.\n\n94\n00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.250\nBut you are able to potentially infer or\n\n95\n00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.970\nunderstand that there may have been other\nthings that were there but just not said.\n\n96\n00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.740\nAnd this is the idea behind inference.\n\n97\n00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.070\nThe idea is that if we show you\ninformation during the normal course of\n\n98\n00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.300\ndata management, we show you a spreadsheet\nwith sales figures in it, but\n\n99\n00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.990\nthere are other columns in\nthe spreadsheet that are hidden.\n\n100\n00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.090\nYou may be able to deduce\ninformation about the value\n\n101\n00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.310\nof information in those columns if we're\nnot very careful about how we present\n\n102\n00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.780\nthe available information to you\nthat you're supposed to see, and\n\n103\n00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.450\nthe ways in which we do that have to\nreally be understood, have to monitored,\n\n104\n00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.310\nhave to be managed, have to be vetted,\nor we may inadvertently, by accident,\n\n105\n00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.070\nexpose information through inference that\nactually is suppose to be kept secret.\n\n106\n00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.250\nSo this is something we have to really\nthink about and be aware of cuz this poses\n\n107\n00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.730\na potential vulnerability, and a threat,\npotentially, to information security,\n\n108\n00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.760\nto confidentially, and\nof course, to integrity.\n\n109\n00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.080\nAnd this is something we have to\nthink about and obviously understand.\n\n110\n00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.030\nSo something to be concerned about.\n\n111\n00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.660\nAggregation is also something we have\nto think with regards to data and\n\n112\n00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.872\nthe management of data.\n\n113\n00:06:00.872 --> 00:06:05.900\nCombining non-sensitive data from separate\nsources together to create sensitive data\n\n114\n00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.270\nis what aggregation's all about.\n\n115\n00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.350\nWe can take out sensitive,\nnon-sensitive and\n\n116\n00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:12.870\nsimply say combining data from\ndifferent sources together\n\n117\n00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.072\nto understand additional data,\ncreate additional data, is aggregation.\n\n118\n00:06:17.072 --> 00:06:22.020\nWe're building a whole\nfrom different parts and\n\n119\n00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.450\neffectively by doing that, we are\nstitching together and creating a picture\n\n120\n00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.580\nof something, that under normal\ncircumstances, we may not be able to see.\n\n121\n00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.575\nSo I may be able to take data from several\ndifferent systems and aggregate it\n\n122\n00:06:33.575 --> 00:06:39.300\ntogether to create a picture of data that\ndoesn't normally exists in any one system.\n\n123\n00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:44.060\nBusiness intelligence, and\nspecifically big data analytical tools,\n\n124\n00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.670\ndata visualization tools,\nhelp us to do aggregation.\n\n125\n00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.000\nThey are good, and they are valuable,\nand they are meaningful for\n\n126\n00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.860\nus to use in systems.\n\n127\n00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.240\nBut if used incorrectly\nby the wrong people,\n\n128\n00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.570\nwith the wrong level of access,\nthey can lead to aggregation and\n\n129\n00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.850\nhas resulting aggregation, they could\nlead to the breach in confidentiality,\n\n130\n00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.580\nand the modification of data without\nour knowledge, the impact of integrity.\n\n131\n00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.460\nThey could also lead to\nlack of availability.\n\n132\n00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.138\nBecause people may then be able to deduce\nthat they should go and attack a system to\n\n133\n00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:13.654\ngain access to resources, and through\ndenial of service or something of that\n\n134\n00:07:13.654 --> 00:07:17.330\nnature, potentially render the data\nunavailable to us when we need it.\n\n135\n00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.420\nSo, in effect all three pillars\nof information security\n\n136\n00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.730\ncan be affected through aggregation.\n\n137\n00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.120\nThis is something to keep in mind.\n\n138\n00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.840\nWe also want to think about data mining.\n\n139\n00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.110\nData mining is the ability\nto be able to go out and\n\n140\n00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:32.160\ndiscover information at specifically\ntargeted data warehouses.\n\n141\n00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.340\nWe started the conversation by talking\nabout what a data warehouse is.\n\n142\n00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.390\nThink of Costco, but for data, right?\n\n143\n00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.140\nThat's a big data warehouse.\n\n144\n00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.800\nLots and lots of stuff on a lot of\nshelves you buy in bulk, right?\n\n145\n00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.010\nBulk information is there\nin multiple formats.\n\n146\n00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:49.850\nIf we go and mine through that\ninformation using tools that will extract\n\n147\n00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.282\nvalues through aggregation and inference,\n\n148\n00:07:52.282 --> 00:07:55.614\nwe could begin to see that we\nmay run into complications here.\n\n149\n00:07:55.614 --> 00:07:57.550\nWe have all the data sitting in one place.\n\n150\n00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.086\nIt's easy to protect it.\n\n151\n00:07:59.086 --> 00:08:00.437\nBut it's hard, potentially,\n\n152\n00:08:00.437 --> 00:08:04.003\nto know the value of what's there because\nwe may not really understand all the data.\n\n153\n00:08:04.003 --> 00:08:04.984\nThere's so much of it,\n\n154\n00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:08.480\nwhich is not maybe really understand\neverything that's going on with it.\n\n155\n00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.680\nAnd so, as a result of that,\nif somebody's able to get a tool\n\n156\n00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.030\nconnected to the data warehouse\nthat can do aggregation and\n\n157\n00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.110\nperform inference related activities,\nthey may able to do data mining.\n\n158\n00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.300\nAnd when they do data mining, they may\nbe able to find hidden value in the data\n\n159\n00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.430\nthat we're unaware of, and be able to gain\naccess to it without our knowledge and\n\n160\n00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.480\nthis obviously can lead to compromises\nas we've discussed as well.\n\n161\n00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.650\nSo, data mining can also\nbe a potential issue here.\n\n162\n00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.050\nOne thing about large scale\nparallel data systems,\n\n163\n00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:39.060\nthese huge massive online systems\nthat allow us to look at incredible\n\n164\n00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.510\nvolumes of data either through grid\ncomputing or just parallel processing.\n\n165\n00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:48.430\nThese are very large, very high end,\nvery complex systems that bring tremendous\n\n166\n00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:52.360\ncomputing power together in one or more\nlocations scattered throughout, let's say,\n\n167\n00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.000\ngeographically distributed architectures\nthat are brought together to\n\n168\n00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.510\nthen create effectively processing\npower at the point of contact.\n\n169\n00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.820\nYou could think of something\nlike the SETI program.\n\n170\n00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.080\nIf you're familiar the Search for\nExtraterrestrial Intelligence.\n\n171\n00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.830\nThe SETI program effectively\ncreates a parallel data structure,\n\n172\n00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.330\na parallel data processing system,\n\n173\n00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.810\na grid system, by asking you to\ndownload a little piece of software.\n\n174\n00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.860\nA little applet, a little application you\ncan run, so does the Human Genome Project.\n\n175\n00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.030\nThey both effectively work the same way,\nwhere you download a little application.\n\n176\n00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.510\nAnd then, what it does is it connects\nup to a mainframe system that is\n\n177\n00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.300\ngeographically gonna grab processing power\n\n178\n00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.650\nfrom all of these different local\ncomputers that are running the software.\n\n179\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.140\nAnd use that processing capability\non down cycles on your system,\n\n180\n00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.250\nto effectively coordinate processing\nof these incredibly complicated\n\n181\n00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:46.930\ncomputer program rums that have to\nbe done to map out the space map for\n\n182\n00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:48.900\nintelligence to process\nall the background noise.\n\n183\n00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.390\nOr, to map the human genome or\nsequence DNA, or things of that nature.\n\n184\n00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.020\nSo, distributed computing architectures\nare what we're talking about, these also\n\n185\n00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.720\npresent some interesting challenges for\nus but also some capabilities.\n\n186\n00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.860\nHow do we know how too secure data that is\nbeing processed from a thousand different\n\n187\n00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.370\ndistributed or non-centralized\nden points around the globe.\n\n188\n00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.210\nIt's very, very difficult to\nfigure out how to do that,\n\n189\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:12.910\nand it's even more difficult\nto do it successfully.\n\n190\n00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.840\nSo, these are also systems that we need\nto think about and be aware of as well.\n\n191\n00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.300\nSomething else for\nus to consider obviously, right?\n\n192\n00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.960\nThe challenge in these distributed\narchitectures are really trust.\n\n193\n00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.160\nHow do we trust all the endpoints?\n\n194\n00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.610\nHow do we know what's there?\n\n195\n00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:26.710\nHow do we ensure privacy?\n\n196\n00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.920\nHow do we know that data's being\nkept secure in all of these systems?\n\n197\n00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.830\nHow do we apply general\nsecurity thought processes\n\n198\n00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:34.350\nto this distributed architecture?\n\n199\n00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.300\nHow do we know that each endpoint is\nsecure and that the software that's been\n\n200\n00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.940\ndownloaded and\nrunning on it has not been compromised?\n\n201\n00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.240\nThese are things we have to think about,\nand obviously as a security professional,\n\n202\n00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.560\nwould have to keep in mind and\nbe aware of as well.\n\n203\n00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.170\nSo, we wanna think about these things.\n\n204\n00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:49.900\nThe ultimate thought process that\nthis leads up to is the idea of\n\n205\n00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.370\ntalking about cloud\ncomputing a little bit.\n\n206\n00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.870\nAnd what cloud computing is.\n\n207\n00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.400\nIt is a distributed architecture,\nobviously, we're gonna be able to access\n\n208\n00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.610\nit from multiple places and\nuse if from multiple locations.\n\n209\n00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.810\nSo, let's start with\na specific definition.\n\n210\n00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.780\nWhat I'm gonna do is\ncite the definition for\n\n211\n00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.230\ncloud computing that comes\nto us from the NUS document,\n\n212\n00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:11.940\nthe definition document NUS put out\naround the definition of cloud computing.\n\n213\n00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.570\nThis is the standard definition that\neverybody is going to agree on, for\n\n214\n00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:16.570\ncloud computing.\n\n215\n00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:19.480\nYou may hear different\ninterpretations of cloud computing.\n\n216\n00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.030\nBut ultimately,\n\n217\n00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.820\nthe one definition everybody agrees on is\nthe definition I'm about to read to you.\n\n218\n00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.590\nI don't normally read many things to you,\nand I am almost never read to you\n\n219\n00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.690\nwhile we are having our conversations\nduring anyone of our episodes.\n\n220\n00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:33.435\nWe're always talking, we're joking around,\nbut we're not reading to you, right?\n\n221\n00:11:33.435 --> 00:11:35.045\nSo, this is one of the only times,\n\n222\n00:11:35.045 --> 00:11:37.755\nyou're gonna see me stare down at my\nscreen to read to you for a minute.\n\n223\n00:11:37.755 --> 00:11:39.785\nBut I want to give you\nthe exact definition.\n\n224\n00:11:39.785 --> 00:11:41.995\nSo, that you understand\nexactly what it is.\n\n225\n00:11:41.995 --> 00:11:44.295\nAnd the importance of why it\nneeds to be framed a certain way.\n\n226\n00:11:44.295 --> 00:11:47.335\nSo, please start paying attention and\nplease listen.\n\n227\n00:11:47.335 --> 00:11:48.715\nPut on my reading voice.\n\n228\n00:11:48.715 --> 00:11:49.665\nNeed a smoking jacket.\n\n229\n00:11:49.665 --> 00:11:50.555\nAnd a pipe.\n\n230\n00:11:50.555 --> 00:11:52.235\nAll right.\nSo, a model for\n\n231\n00:11:52.235 --> 00:11:57.420\nenabling ubiquitous convenient on\ndemand network access to a shared\n\n232\n00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:02.320\npool of configurable computing resources\nthat can be rapidly provisioned and\n\n233\n00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.040\nreleased with minimal management effort or\nservice provider interaction.\n\n234\n00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:11.260\nThis cloud model is composed of\nfive essential characteristics,\n\n235\n00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.070\nthree service models, and\nfour deployment models.\n\n236\n00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.460\nNow, the good news is that you\ncan rewind that definition and\n\n237\n00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.280\nlisten to it as often as you would like.\n\n238\n00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.340\nIt's almost like a book on tape.\n\n239\n00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.060\nBut in addition,\nyou can also go look it up.\n\n240\n00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.580\nWe're not going to show you the NUS\ndocument, but I've mentioned several\n\n241\n00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:31.550\ntimes, we've shown you several times where\nNUS website is, if you want to go look for\n\n242\n00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.220\nthat definition, just go out to the NUS\nwebsite, and search for cloud computing.\n\n243\n00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.690\nAnd you will find the definition document\nthere, it's about 12 or 15 pages, so\n\n244\n00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:40.750\nit's very small.\n\n245\n00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:45.130\nBut it's gonna list that definition,\nit's also gonna through and list for\n\n246\n00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.760\nyou the five essential\ncharacteristics of cloud computing.\n\n247\n00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.830\nWe just talked about and\nwe're gonna put these up on the screen for\n\n248\n00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:50.910\nyou in just a minute.\n\n249\n00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:53.490\nIt's also gonna list for\nyou the three cloud service models.\n\n250\n00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:54.570\nAnd it's also gonna list for\n\n251\n00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.970\nyou the four cloud deployment models that\nwe can use in terms of architecture.\n\n252\n00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:01.480\nWe're gonna throw these up on\nthe screen for you right now, and\n\n253\n00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.070\ntalk through them so you can see them.\n\n254\n00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.350\nTake some notes on them, but\n\n255\n00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.280\nwe wanna make sure you're familiar\nwith all of this information.\n\n256\n00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:11.600\nBecause all of these are the definition\nof components, the building blocks\n\n257\n00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:15.730\nthat you need to be aware of in order to\ntalk knowledgeably about cloud computing.\n\n258\n00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.470\nSo, all of this is in the NUS document,\njust to make that clear and\n\n259\n00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:19.500\nto remind you that.\n\n260\n00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.780\nFive essential characteristics\nof cloud computing.\n\n261\n00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.542\nWe listed them in the definition, you'll\nsee them on the screen in front of you.\n\n262\n00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:27.520\nOn-demand Self-service.\n\n263\n00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.060\nThe ability to be able to go out and\nthrough a common interface\n\n264\n00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.580\nbe able to interact with and\nconsume the cloud service on demand,\n\n265\n00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.440\nwhen you need it in other words is one\nof the defining central characteristics.\n\n266\n00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.670\nBroad Network Access, you can get\nto the cloud from almost anywhere.\n\n267\n00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.490\nIt is available everywhere, broadly.\n\n268\n00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.450\nResource Pooling.\n\n269\n00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:51.350\nWe share resources and pool them together\nto form the cloud-based environments\n\n270\n00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:56.065\nthat we use, of compute resources,\nstorage resources, network resources.\n\n271\n00:13:56.065 --> 00:13:58.525\nThese are the resources\nof cloud computing.\n\n272\n00:13:58.525 --> 00:14:02.225\nRapid Elasticity, the ability\nto be able to scale up quickly.\n\n273\n00:14:02.225 --> 00:14:03.425\nPeople often forget this.\n\n274\n00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:06.655\nScaling down is also\npart of rapid elasticity.\n\n275\n00:14:06.655 --> 00:14:09.897\nSo, we can blow up quickly and\ndo what's called effectively\n\n276\n00:14:11.027 --> 00:14:14.417\nscaling up to be able to give\nyou additional resources, right?\n\n277\n00:14:14.417 --> 00:14:17.797\nWe would also be able to scale\ndown during periods of low usage.\n\n278\n00:14:17.797 --> 00:14:20.617\nSo, we could scale up and\nscale down under rapid elasticity.\n\n279\n00:14:20.617 --> 00:14:25.617\nWe also can scale out, meaning we can grow\nthe architecture is able to not just scale\n\n280\n00:14:25.617 --> 00:14:29.957\nup and scale down, but also scale out as\nnecessary, rapidly and quickly because of\n\n281\n00:14:29.957 --> 00:14:33.432\nresource pooling to accommodate\nadditional needs and additional users.\n\n282\n00:14:33.432 --> 00:14:38.250\nMeasured Services, we use metrics to be\nable to understand what you're consuming,\n\n283\n00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:42.210\nand effectively, the model for cloud is\nmore often than not, you pay as you go.\n\n284\n00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.850\nYou pay for what you use, in other words.\n\n285\n00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:48.800\nSo, it is a consumption model that is\nmeasured, and we are using metric in\n\n286\n00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.850\norder to be able to figure out how\nto manage ultimately, over time.\n\n287\n00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.630\nThese are the five essential\ncharacteristics of cloud computing.\n\n288\n00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.750\nLet's take a look at the three\ncloud service models.\n\n289\n00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.450\nThey're up on the screen in front of you.\n\n290\n00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.770\nYou probably are familiar with one or\nmore of them.\n\n291\n00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:08.200\nI'm sure you've heard of many\ndifferent things as a service.\n\n292\n00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.830\nWe have all sorts of\nthings today as a service.\n\n293\n00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.510\nBut the three that are established\nas definitional criteria,\n\n294\n00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.420\nthe three as a service models.\n\n295\n00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:20.580\nSaaS or Software, PaaS, platform, IaaS or\n\n296\n00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:24.870\nInfrastructure As A Service, are the three\noriginal ones that everybody agrees on.\n\n297\n00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.640\nAnd again, I'm not suggesting for\na minute that there aren't\n\n298\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.260\nother as a service areas, other as\na service models that are important.\n\n299\n00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.680\nYou may very well be consuming one or\nmore of them.\n\n300\n00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.760\nYou're actually consuming if you think\nabout it, learning as a service.\n\n301\n00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.350\nWhich is a new thought process in\nthe cloud enabled world of remote and\n\n302\n00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:46.280\ndistance learning, but\nas you're engaging through IT Pro TV and\n\n303\n00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.920\nusing our services to be able to\nlearn in interactive environments.\n\n304\n00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.250\nYou're effectively consuming\nlearning as a service.\n\n305\n00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.738\nThere are many different service models.\n\n306\n00:15:54.738 --> 00:15:58.863\nBut the three that are accepted, that\neverybody agrees on, that the definitions\n\n307\n00:15:58.863 --> 00:16:02.509\nare standardized for, are the three\nwe're gonna focus on and talk about\n\n308\n00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:06.612\nThose are the three you should be familiar\nwith, with regards to the CISSP exam.\n\n309\n00:16:06.612 --> 00:16:08.305\nSo, please be aware of that.\n\n310\n00:16:08.305 --> 00:16:10.530\nSaas, Software as a Service.\n\n311\n00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.380\nThis is the ability, actually,\nlet's do this the other way.\n\n312\n00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.490\nLet's start with IaaS, and\n\n313\n00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:18.060\nthe reason I'm gonna say that is that\nwhat we wanna do is walk up the stack\n\n314\n00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:21.460\nfinishing with SaaS, because SaaS\nactually will incorporate all three.\n\n315\n00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.530\nSo, we'll start with IaaS,\nInfrastructure as a Service.\n\n316\n00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.170\nBad presenter.\n\n317\n00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:27.120\nI should have thought of that and\ndone that the other way.\n\n318\n00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.930\nSo, Infrastructure as a Service.\n\n319\n00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:33.950\nThis is where you as a customer are gonna\nbe able to go to the cloud provider,\n\n320\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:37.200\nthe Googles, the Amazons,\nthe Microsofts of the world, and\n\n321\n00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.830\nyou're going to be able to rent\neffectively, for a monthly fee,\n\n322\n00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:44.472\nthe core infrastructure components\nthat allow you to run a network.\n\n323\n00:16:44.472 --> 00:16:48.364\nYou're gonna rent effectively one or\nmore computers, you're gonna\n\n324\n00:16:48.364 --> 00:16:53.170\nrent the computer itself, made up of\nthe CPU, the memory, the networking, and\n\n325\n00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:57.000\nthe storage components, the four resource\ngroups we provision cloud around, and\n\n326\n00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.380\nyou're gonna rent that from\nthe cloud service provider.\n\n327\n00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.220\nYou're gonna rent as many as you want.\n\n328\n00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.498\nAnd they're gonna give you\nthat infrastructure and\n\n329\n00:17:03.498 --> 00:17:07.316\nthey're then gonna say to you, Mr.\nCustomer, here's everything you wanted.\n\n330\n00:17:07.316 --> 00:17:10.270\nNow, you're gonna load your own operating\nsystem on it, so you have to pay for\n\n331\n00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.745\nsoftware licensing.\n\n332\n00:17:11.745 --> 00:17:13.220\nYou're gonna load your own data on it.\n\n333\n00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.940\nYou have to configure and\nmanage that system accordingly.\n\n334\n00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:20.350\nAnd you're then gonna be responsible for\nthe upkeep and management of that system.\n\n335\n00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:21.520\nIaaS is really just that.\n\n336\n00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.860\nIt's just infrastructure.\n\n337\n00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:27.330\nIt's computing infrastructure, nothing\nmore, as a service for a monthly fee.\n\n338\n00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.230\nWhen we move up to PaaS,\nPlatform as a Service.\n\n339\n00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:34.690\nWe are renting the infrastructure below\nthe platform, so the infrastructure\n\n340\n00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.700\nprovider, the cloud service provider, is\ngiving us all the stuff we just discussed.\n\n341\n00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:40.860\nBut they're also loading\nthe operating system for us.\n\n342\n00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.000\nSo, they're taking care\nof software licensing.\n\n343\n00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.010\nWe don't have to worry about that.\n\n344\n00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:47.650\nIn addition,\nthey are going to configure the system.\n\n345\n00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.060\nThey're gonna set it all up.\n\n346\n00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.512\nThey're gonna build it, they're gonna\nimage it, whatever they have to do.\n\n347\n00:17:51.512 --> 00:17:53.770\nThey're gonna take care of all of that.\n\n348\n00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:55.790\nAll we need to do,\nis once it's configured and\n\n349\n00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.260\nthey hand it to us,\nlogin obviously, right.\n\n350\n00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:58.980\nSo, we get our logon.\n\n351\n00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.960\nWe logon.\n\n352\n00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.660\nThe OS is already there.\n\n353\n00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.750\nNow, what we do, the customer,\nwe load our applications and our data, and\n\n354\n00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:09.850\nour development environments, and then\nwe manage them on top of the platform.\n\n355\n00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.050\nSo, the provider is giving\nus the full platform,\n\n356\n00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:15.520\ninfrastructure and\noperational system or OS.\n\n357\n00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.040\nWe are then loading everything else up and\nmanaging that.\n\n358\n00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.690\nSo, that's the break\npoint there with PaaS.\n\n359\n00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.280\nPaaS is traditionally seen\nas a dev environment, or\n\n360\n00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.760\nan application hosting\nenvironment on demand.\n\n361\n00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.450\nThat's usually what it's used for.\n\n362\n00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.350\nCompanies that want to do application\ndevelopment, that want to host their own\n\n363\n00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:34.250\ndatabases, run their own application\nservices, will use a PaaS model.\n\n364\n00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:36.010\nThat's traditionally what they use.\n\n365\n00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:40.550\nSaaS, Software as a Service, incorporates\ninfrastructure as well as platform.\n\n366\n00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:44.920\nAnd what you get there is the ability\nto basically rent all of that including\n\n367\n00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:49.360\nvendor based software,\nwhatever that may be, for a fee monthly.\n\n368\n00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.140\nSo, think about Office 365.\n\n369\n00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.329\nThink about Salesforce.com.\n\n370\n00:18:53.329 --> 00:18:56.710\nThese are Software as a Service models.\n\n371\n00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.350\nSpecifically, within Software as a Service\nwe have two distinct software models.\n\n372\n00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.440\nWe have hosted application management.\n\n373\n00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:07.225\nSo, we have an Office 365 model,\nwhere you can pay the provider to host or\n\n374\n00:19:07.225 --> 00:19:10.680\nSalesforce.com, where you could pay\nthe provider to host your data.\n\n375\n00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.530\nAnd they give you access\nto an application.\n\n376\n00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.140\nMicrosoft Exchange for email.\n\n377\n00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.195\nMicrosoft SharePoint for\nenterprise content management.\n\n378\n00:19:18.195 --> 00:19:20.720\nSalesforce.com for CRM.\n\n379\n00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.210\nThat's a hosted application model,\nwhere they host the entire application.\n\n380\n00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.975\nAnd all the infrastructure and\nplatforms support that goes with it.\n\n381\n00:19:26.975 --> 00:19:28.805\nThey do all the updates\nto the application.\n\n382\n00:19:28.805 --> 00:19:30.135\nThey do the patch management.\n\n383\n00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:31.825\nThey do the database management.\n\n384\n00:19:31.825 --> 00:19:33.285\nThey do the access control.\n\n385\n00:19:33.285 --> 00:19:34.985\nThey'll provide the back end for that.\n\n386\n00:19:34.985 --> 00:19:36.225\nYou will provision users, but\n\n387\n00:19:36.225 --> 00:19:39.355\nthey provide the actual enforcement\nmechanisms on the back end.\n\n388\n00:19:39.355 --> 00:19:40.735\nThey do all the logging.\n\n389\n00:19:40.735 --> 00:19:43.135\nThey do all the transactional monitoring.\n\n390\n00:19:43.135 --> 00:19:45.265\nThey do all the configuration management.\n\n391\n00:19:45.265 --> 00:19:46.235\nThey build the whole thing.\n\n392\n00:19:46.235 --> 00:19:48.800\nAll you do is put your data there and\nconsume.\n\n393\n00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:50.400\nAnd the other kind of SaaS model,\n\n394\n00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.970\nyou're renting just individual\napplication software.\n\n395\n00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:57.090\nThis is the Office 365 model, but\nspecifically, the Office portion of it,\n\n396\n00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:00.510\nwhere you download Microsoft Office and\ninstall it on demand.\n\n397\n00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.200\nWe call it on demand software.\n\n398\n00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.190\nAnd you install Microsoft Office,\nfrom the cloud, and\n\n399\n00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:09.350\nyou then run Office on your\nlocal machine for a monthly fee.\n\n400\n00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.640\nThat's the other kind of\nSaaS model that we have.\n\n401\n00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.140\nSo, Software as a Service effectively\nmeans you're renting the software.\n\n402\n00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.485\nAnd you're providing access to\nto the software in that model.\n\n403\n00:20:18.485 --> 00:20:21.975\nAs a result of having those\nthree software models,\n\n404\n00:20:21.975 --> 00:20:24.315\nwe still now have to talk about\nthe three cloud service models.\n\n405\n00:20:24.315 --> 00:20:25.915\nWe have one more list we have to go to.\n\n406\n00:20:25.915 --> 00:20:28.055\nWe have to talk about the cloud\ndeployment models, so\n\n407\n00:20:28.055 --> 00:20:29.985\nwe're gonna put those up on the screen.\n\n408\n00:20:29.985 --> 00:20:32.985\nAnd the cloud deployment models,\nallow us to shape and\n\n409\n00:20:32.985 --> 00:20:36.165\ndiscuss what type of\ncloud we're gonna use.\n\n410\n00:20:36.165 --> 00:20:36.985\nWe have four models.\n\n411\n00:20:36.985 --> 00:20:40.360\nNow, you may be familiar with the first\nthree, you may have heard of them.\n\n412\n00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:42.130\nProbably, haven't heard of\nthe fourth one as much.\n\n413\n00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:45.285\nCommunity cloud is not one that a lot\nof people know about or talk about.\n\n414\n00:20:45.285 --> 00:20:46.790\nSo,let's talk about all of them.\n\n415\n00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.750\nThe private cloud is going to\nbe the ability to run a cloud\n\n416\n00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.490\ninternal to your network, really just for\nyour team members, your employees,\n\n417\n00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.570\nnobody else from the outside\ncan get into it.\n\n418\n00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:59.640\nYou typically will either host\nit on-prem inside your company.\n\n419\n00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.740\nYou may pay somebody to host it for you.\n\n420\n00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.550\nMicrosoft, Google, Amazon,\ncan host private clouds for you as well.\n\n421\n00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.390\nYou will provision and manage that.\n\n422\n00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.900\nThat is what we would have thought of\nyears ago as an intranet, an internal\n\n423\n00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.972\nprivate network, is effectively\nnow re-branded as a private cloud.\n\n424\n00:21:14.972 --> 00:21:17.110\nI wanna get the gig where I sit in a room,\n\n425\n00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.475\nI come up with new innovative\nmarketing slogans.\n\n426\n00:21:19.475 --> 00:21:21.600\n>> Right?\n>> And I remake everybody's world.\n\n427\n00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.050\nIt's something new, but\nit's still the same thing.\n\n428\n00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:24.590\n>> The same thing.\n\n429\n00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:25.115\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah.\n\n430\n00:21:25.115 --> 00:21:26.130\n[LAUGH]\n\n431\n00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:27.160\n>> That's what I wanna do when I\n\n432\n00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:27.880\ngrow up, right?\n\n433\n00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.340\nSo, if anybody has that job out there.\n\n434\n00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.910\nSomebody email me, let me know.\n\n435\n00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.775\nI wanna come work for\nyou, if I can do that.\n\n436\n00:21:33.775 --> 00:21:36.260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so the public cloud, right?\n\n437\n00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.290\nPublic cloud, the biggest example we\nhave of the public cloud in the world is\n\n438\n00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:42.230\nthe internet or the worldwide web,\nand we've had that for many years.\n\n439\n00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.100\nAnd, again, we used to call public clouds,\nthe internet or\n\n440\n00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.410\nthe worldwide web because\nthat's what they were.\n\n441\n00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.700\nToday, we call it a public cloud.\n\n442\n00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.770\nIt is simply a cloud that is available\nto people, to individuals, right?\n\n443\n00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.010\nAnd they can get into it.\n\n444\n00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.790\nSome of them may have to log in and\nthey have to authenticate.\n\n445\n00:21:56.790 --> 00:21:57.380\nSome may not.\n\n446\n00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.630\nSome may just be open to everybody,\nregardless.\n\n447\n00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:03.372\nSo, think about for instance,\ngoing to Amazon.com,\n\n448\n00:22:03.372 --> 00:22:05.780\ngoing to CNN, going to ITPro.tv.\n\n449\n00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.740\nRight, whatever it is, all of that's\navailable through the public cloud.\n\n450\n00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.050\nYou get to it through the internet,\nthrough the world wide web.\n\n451\n00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:13.005\nYou access one or more websites.\n\n452\n00:22:13.005 --> 00:22:16.425\nThe majority of that material is\navailable to you without you logging in.\n\n453\n00:22:16.425 --> 00:22:19.875\nYou can go to the ITPro.tv website\nwithout being a member and\n\n454\n00:22:19.875 --> 00:22:22.685\nlook at demos of the shows and\nthings like that.\n\n455\n00:22:22.685 --> 00:22:25.315\nSo, you can see all that\nwithout having to be a member.\n\n456\n00:22:25.315 --> 00:22:30.052\nBut then, you may have to log in and go\nto the private side of that environment.\n\n457\n00:22:30.052 --> 00:22:33.442\nLog into an environment where we only\nhave contents available to members, and\n\n458\n00:22:33.442 --> 00:22:36.842\nthat may cross over into\nthe private side of the cloud.\n\n459\n00:22:36.842 --> 00:22:38.672\nAnd so, public and\nprivate clouds can commingle.\n\n460\n00:22:38.672 --> 00:22:41.602\nAnd that's often where we see\nwhat is known as a hybrid cloud.\n\n461\n00:22:41.602 --> 00:22:44.032\nA hybrid cloud is going to\ncombine the two together, or\n\n462\n00:22:44.032 --> 00:22:46.422\ncombine two of the three\ncloud models together.\n\n463\n00:22:46.422 --> 00:22:48.312\nBecause it could be private,\npublic, and or\n\n464\n00:22:48.312 --> 00:22:50.610\ncommunity that are joined\ntogether in a hybrid.\n\n465\n00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.890\nBut the idea of a hybrid simply means, we\njoin two of the three models together and\n\n466\n00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:57.540\nwe give access to both, in theory,\nthrough one sort of common model.\n\n467\n00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.970\nThe community cloud, ultimately,\n\n468\n00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:02.010\nthe last cloud model we talk about,\nis kind of interesting.\n\n469\n00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.380\nPeople often think of it as\njust being a private cloud.\n\n470\n00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.370\nIn effect, it is in one respect.\n\n471\n00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.010\nIt is a subset of the private cloud.\n\n472\n00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.970\nBut the way I often talk about\ncommunity cloud is the following.\n\n473\n00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:15.290\nPrivate clouds are gonna be only available\nto everybody in the organization.\n\n474\n00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:18.890\nSo, broadly available, but\nonly to the people in the organization.\n\n475\n00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:23.590\nSo, if you have a, let's say, a business,\nwe have 1000 team members, 1000 employees.\n\n476\n00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:27.020\nA private cloud will be available\nto all 1000 at the same time.\n\n477\n00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.150\nSo, services like email would be\navailable through the private cloud to\n\n478\n00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:31.254\neverybody in the organization.\n\n479\n00:23:31.254 --> 00:23:35.220\nEnterprise contact management, it's a file\nand print sharing, would be available\n\n480\n00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.770\nthrough a private cloud to everybody\nin the organization at the same time.\n\n481\n00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.440\nA community cloud is a cloud that\nis generated by a sub-group.\n\n482\n00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.080\nA group that has specific interests\nthat they want to deal with, and\n\n483\n00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:47.450\nprovide services around, within the cloud.\n\n484\n00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.930\nBut they only want it to be\nopen to members of that group.\n\n485\n00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:54.020\nSo, it's like a subset of the private\ncloud, so in some organizations,\n\n486\n00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.670\nwe often see that we have private cloud\nservices like I mentioned email, file and\n\n487\n00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.120\nprint sharing, things like that,\navailable to everybody.\n\n488\n00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:04.120\nAnd then, a group like sales and\nmarketing may go off on their own and\n\n489\n00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.890\ncreate a community cloud that\nis unique to their needs because\n\n490\n00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:11.560\nyou have things like social media\nservices, things like data analytics,\n\n491\n00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:15.040\nthings of that nature,\nmaybe unique to that particular group.\n\n492\n00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.930\nAnd they want to be able to have\na community cloud that's specifically\n\n493\n00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.670\ntailored for them, to offer those services\nonly to the members of that group.\n\n494\n00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:23.660\nAnd that's what a community\ncloud really does.\n\n495\n00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.450\nIt offers a limited, a focused, a group\nof people who share common concerns.\n\n496\n00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:31.970\nPartake of community cloud, and\nthen those people can exist and\n\n497\n00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.380\ninteract within that cloud.\n\n498\n00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.410\nRight?\nSo, this is how the definition\n\n499\n00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.690\nis ultimately going to\nplay out if you will.\n\n500\n00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.950\n>> All right, very good Adam.\n\n501\n00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.900\nAgain, a lot of information and\nI believe we're still not done\n\n502\n00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.600\nwith looking at vulnerabilities,\nassessing and mitigating vulnerabilities\n\n503\n00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.220\nin our security architecture, but\nwe're gonna save that for another one.\n\n504\n00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.370\nSo, we're gonna have a part three for\nthis episode, so\n\n505\n00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:54.830\nmake sure you come back for that one.\n\n506\n00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:57.090\nRemember, if you guys wanna attend\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n507\n00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:00.520\nshoot us an email, SeeAdam@ITPro.tv.\n\n508\n00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.718\nFor now, signing off, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n509\n00:25:02.718 --> 00:25:03.861\n>> I'm not.\n\n510\n00:25:03.861 --> 00:25:06.650\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n511\n00:25:06.650 -->

00:00:20.040\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\ntoday we're doing our CISSP content, and\n\n4\n00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.960\nspecifically, we're continuing on to\nassess and mitigate our vulnerabilities.\n\n5\n00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.600\nAnd we've got some good stuff coming up\nhere Adam, I know we got some terminology\n\n6\n00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.850\nwe've got to go over, and a few other\nthings, so we'll just get right into it.\n\n7\n00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.440\nHere's Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.625\n>> Vocabulary master Gordon to you sir.\n\n9\n00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:39.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, we're back.\n\n10\n00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.910\nLet's talk a little bit more about\naccessing and mitigating vulnerability.\n\n11\n00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.590\nWe've been having a very\ngood discussion so\n\n12\n00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.300\nfar in our other episodes about all\nthe things we have to do to think about\n\n13\n00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.656\nhow we're going to actually take\ncare of these issues and concerns.\n\n14\n00:00:50.656 --> 00:00:53.900\nWhat we're going to do now is drill\ndown a little bit on some vocabulary,\n\n15\n00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.620\nspecifically related to encryption and\ncryptography, that's going to\n\n16\n00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.240\nhelp us to better understand the whole\nthought process behind this approach.\n\n17\n00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.660\nThere's a lot of things that go on when we\nthink about encryption and cryptography.\n\n18\n00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.060\nLot of working parts, lot of language.\n\n19\n00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.500\nAnd, you know information security is\nas much about the language we speak,\n\n20\n00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.440\nas about the things we do.\n\n21\n00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.330\nAnd when it comes to preparing for,\nand ultimately being successful\n\n22\n00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.510\nto take a pass at the exam like the CISSP,\nvocabulary is crucial.\n\n23\n00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.380\nSo we're going to make sure we spend\nsome time going over definitions.\n\n24\n00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.840\nSpeaking of which, we probably want to\nmake sure that we can see the definition,\n\n25\n00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.020\nas opposed to just talking about them.\n\n26\n00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.316\nLook, it's magic, I tell you.\n\n27\n00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:30.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's magic.\n\n28\n00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's begin our conversation around\n\n29\n00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.530\nthe vocabulary with regards to encryption,\nwith regards to cryptography solutions.\n\n30\n00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.840\nLet's talk about key clustering,\nfirst one up on the list.\n\n31\n00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.790\nYou'll see key clustering talks about\ndifferent encryption keys ultimately\n\n32\n00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.650\ngenerating the same ciphertext\nfrom different plaintext.\n\n33\n00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.150\nSo what we're talking about\nthere is the idea of a key.\n\n34\n00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.490\nAn encryption key is effectively going to\nbe the magic ingredient when we talk about\n\n35\n00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.570\nusing cryptography.\n\n36\n00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.390\nIt's the thing that allows us to\neffectively encrypt or decrypt on demand.\n\n37\n00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.000\nI will talk, in a couple of minutes,\nabout the different kinds of keys and\n\n38\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.870\nwhat they are.\n\n39\n00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.020\nBut different encryption keys ultimately\ngenerate the same ciphertext.\n\n40\n00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.810\nCiphertext is just simply\nthe encrypted text.\n\n41\n00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.430\nIf we take an example of\nthe sentence the dog is blue,\n\n42\n00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.460\nwe run it through the encryption engine,\nout the back end comes cipher text.\n\n43\n00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.740\nWhat we put in on the front end, plain\ntext, is the message the dog is blue.\n\n44\n00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.890\nSo different keys generating\nthe same cipher text from\n\n45\n00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.460\nthe same plain text is a problem,\nbecause now we have a pattern, and\n\n46\n00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.240\nif we can latch onto a pattern, with\nanything having to do with encryption or\n\n47\n00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.100\ncryptography, we're going to find a way,\npotentially, not a guarantee, but\n\n48\n00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.440\npotentially find a way to exercise\nsome sort of an advantage and\n\n49\n00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.290\nmaybe break the cryptosystem.\n\n50\n00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.950\nSo key clustering is bad, because it\nallows the attacker to find patterns\n\n51\n00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.110\nthat could potentially lead to\nthe exposure of one or more keys.\n\n52\n00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.330\nSynchronous versus asynchronous\nencryption and or decryption requests.\n\n53\n00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.100\nLet's talk about how things are done.\n\n54\n00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.820\nSynchronous processes\nare done immediately.\n\n55\n00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.080\nWhen you do something,\n\n56\n00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.580\nor doing multiple things synchronously,\nyou're doing them immediately.\n\n57\n00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.090\nWhen something is asynchronous, you're\npeeling them up and doing them in some\n\n58\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.370\nsort of organized fashion, but\nthey're not going to happen immediately.\n\n59\n00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.170\nSo, you may submit a request, but it may\nbe cued up and it may take a minute or\n\n60\n00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.500\ntwo until it processes.\n\n61\n00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.960\nThat's what an asynchronous solution is.\n\n62\n00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.950\nA synchronous solution is happening\nin real time, as you submit it,\n\n63\n00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.980\nit's being done.\n\n64\n00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.420\nSo we often talk about\na digital certificate and\n\n65\n00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.040\nPKI when we automate the process of\nusing a certificate authority and\n\n66\n00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.750\nwe are submitting requests to the CA over\nthe web through a web server interface as\n\n67\n00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.360\nbeing synchronous, because the system will\nautomatically generate the certificate and\n\n68\n00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.790\nvalidate the request in line and\nin real-time.\n\n69\n00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.420\nAnd if you are then a legitimate user,\nwe'll issue you a certificate immediately.\n\n70\n00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.990\nWhen we are doing it manually, we talk\nabout it being asynchronous, because\n\n71\n00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.798\nthere's a delay and we queue it up and\nwe have to wait for it to be processed.\n\n72\n00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:55.220\nSo, want to make sure we just understand\nthe difference between the two.\n\n73\n00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.320\nThere are If we could just scroll\ndown just a little bit, there we go.\n\n74\n00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.200\nHash functions,\n\n75\n00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.210\na hash function is going to be the way\nin which we can establish integrity.\n\n76\n00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.480\nAnd we can also potentially establish that\ninformation has either been modified or\n\n77\n00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.320\nnot, with or without our knowledge.\n\n78\n00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.520\nSo the formal definition, a one-way\nmathematical operation reducing a message\n\n79\n00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.150\nor data file into a smaller fixed length\noutput or what we call a hash value.\n\n80\n00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.980\nWhat we really talk about with\nhashing is the ability to use\n\n81\n00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.370\nvariable amounts of data.\n\n82\n00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:31.510\nSo any size data input, plus a hashing\nalgorithm, equals a bit stream.\n\n83\n00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.640\nA fixed bit stream out the back end.\n\n84\n00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.230\nNow that's a formula, quote un-quote.\n\n85\n00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.080\nIt's not a formal formula, but it's kind\nof an informal way of thinking about what\n\n86\n00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.920\na hashing function actually does.\n\n87\n00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.200\nSo let's just walk through\na quick example here.\n\n88\n00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.395\nAgain, let's use the sentence\nthe dog is blue,\n\n89\n00:04:45.395 --> 00:04:48.210\nbecause it's an easy one to remember and\nit's easy to work with, right?\n\n90\n00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.710\nThe dog is blue.\n\n91\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.830\nFour words, not very, very complicated.\n\n92\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.610\nProbably a total of about 30 or\nso characters, right?\n\n93\n00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.970\nSo if we're going to take the dog is blue,\nrun it through a hashing algorithm,\n\n94\n00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.326\neither MD5 or SHA1 or\nsomething of that nature.\n\n95\n00:05:03.326 --> 00:05:06.940\nWhat we're going to do is take\nvariable size input, the dog is blue,\n\n96\n00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.610\nrun it through the hashing algorithm,\nand out the back end, depending on\n\n97\n00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.190\nthe algorithm we choose, comes a fixed\nbit stream representation of the data.\n\n98\n00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.410\nNot the data itself, and not\ncryptographically protecting the data, so\n\n99\n00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.820\nthat we are providing confidentiality, but\n\n100\n00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.450\nrather cryptographically hashing the data,\nso we provide integrity.\n\n101\n00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.420\nThat's what hashing is all about.\n\n102\n00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.870\nAnd so we don't spit out the back\nend cypher text when we hash,\n\n103\n00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.110\nbut rather a randomized.\n\n104\n00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.500\nWe'll put that in air quotes.\n\n105\n00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.410\nEverybody do air quotes with me.\n\n106\n00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:39.460\nThey're so much fun.\n\n107\n00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.405\nAir quotes.\n\n108\n00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:40.910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n109\n00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.390\nSo we are going to spit out\na randomized bit stream value.\n\n110\n00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.590\nIn the case of MD5, it would be 128 bits.\n\n111\n00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.170\nIn the case of SHY1, short for\nSHY160, it would be 160 bits.\n\n112\n00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.060\nSo it's an alpha numeric string.\n\n113\n00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.560\nAs and ones, Bs and zeros, Cs and ones,\nDs and zeros, whatever it may be.\n\n114\n00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.940\nSo letters and numbers.\n\n115\n00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.890\nAnd that's going to represent\nthe integrity check on the data.\n\n116\n00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.420\nSo hashing equals integrity.\n\n117\n00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:11.950\nThat's what you want to make sure you\ntake away from this conversation.\n\n118\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.770\nIn addition, what we then can\nto is use that integrity check,\n\n119\n00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.320\nthat hash, that bit stream output,\nto run forward or\n\n120\n00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.950\nbackwards and say, has the data\nbeen modified at any point in time?\n\n121\n00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:26.890\nWe can look at the data a month from now,\nrehash it.\n\n122\n00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:29.076\nIf the bit stream output\nis still the same,\n\n123\n00:06:29.076 --> 00:06:33.680\nit's always going to be 128 bits if\nwe use MD5, but it's the sequence and\n\n124\n00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.480\nordering of those bits that is really\nthe key to understanding integrity.\n\n125\n00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:43.190\nIf we get the identical hash,\nevery alpha and every numeric placeholder\n\n126\n00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.060\nis identical from a month ago, then we\nknow the data has not been modified.\n\n127\n00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.360\nIf we change the data, and\nall of a sudden, the As and\n\n128\n00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.990\nones and Bs and zeroes and the letter\nCs and threes and fives and nines and\n\n129\n00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.170\nwhatever are all different, then we\nknow the data has been compromised.\n\n130\n00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.670\nIt's been modified in some way.\n\n131\n00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.420\nWe don't know what modification,\nwe just know it has been modified.\n\n132\n00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.500\nSo there's a limit to what\nhashing tells us, to be clear.\n\n133\n00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.910\nThe most important thing it tells us,\n\n134\n00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.650\nthe only thing of value it tells\nus is that data has been modified.\n\n135\n00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.060\nNot what was done to modify it, but\nrather that it has been modified.\n\n136\n00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:20.440\nWe want to look at log files and\nother command and control mechanisms,\n\n137\n00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.180\ncontinuous monitoring, intrusion\ndetection, things of that nature,\n\n138\n00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.510\nto figure out the how and the what,\nwe're just now examining and\n\n139\n00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:33.030\nunderstanding that it actually has been\nmodified with a hash, just to be clear.\n\n140\n00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.730\nDigital signatures, oh that's a long one.\n\n141\n00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.930\nDigital signatures, right,\nprovides authentication of a sender and\n\n142\n00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.660\nintegrity of a sender's message.\n\n143\n00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.200\nA message, as you can see,\nis put into a hash function.\n\n144\n00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.810\nWell, we just talked about hash functions,\nso that's interesting.\n\n145\n00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.410\nSo what we're saying is in effect,\ndigital signature involves hashing.\n\n146\n00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.690\nThat's kind of interesting.\n\n147\n00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.296\nThen the hash value is encrypted\nusing the private key of the sender.\n\n148\n00:07:55.296 --> 00:07:56.754\nWell that sounds like it may be important.\n\n149\n00:07:56.754 --> 00:08:01.879\nSomebody's key, identifying\nthe specific person and a specific key.\n\n150\n00:08:01.879 --> 00:08:03.379\nHmm, he said suspiciously.\n\n151\n00:08:03.379 --> 00:08:04.879\nI wonder if that's important.\n\n152\n00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:05.586\nAnd that is.\n\n153\n00:08:05.586 --> 00:08:07.260\nWe're gonna talk about\nwhy in just a minute.\n\n154\n00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.840\nThe results of these two steps\nyielded individual signature.\n\n155\n00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.852\nI think we got to bullet points\nthere instead of periods.\n\n156\n00:08:12.852 --> 00:08:15.996\nNo, no, no.\nGo back up, go back up.\n\n157\n00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.230\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Not a big deal.\n\n158\n00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.550\nSo let's talk about digital signatures,\nright?\n\n159\n00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:20.200\nLet's break this down.\n\n160\n00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.780\nThis is actually three really\ncritical prices of information\n\n161\n00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.510\ninside of this paragraph.\n\n162\n00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:28.690\nSo we provide authentication of\na sender and integrity of a message.\n\n163\n00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:30.860\nSo digital signatures\nare doing two things.\n\n164\n00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.530\nThey are providing integrity, validating\nthat the message has not been not modified\n\n165\n00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:39.930\nin transit and they are providing both\nproof of origin and non-repudiation.\n\n166\n00:08:39.930 --> 00:08:44.140\nThey're are telling us that somebody\ndefinitely sent this message we can,\n\n167\n00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:49.400\nin theory, ascribe that understanding\nof that identity to the individual,\n\n168\n00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.290\nmeaning we can say, in theory,\nif Mike digitally signed a message,\n\n169\n00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.080\nthen I can say that Mike\nwas the one who sent it.\n\n170\n00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.960\nBut can I really?\n\n171\n00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.695\nThis is the interesting thing\nabout digital signatures, right?\n\n172\n00:08:59.695 --> 00:09:02.570\nWhat we can say beyond\nany reasonable doubt.\n\n173\n00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.050\nAnd we have to talk about doubt and\n\n174\n00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.450\nhow reasonable doubt is when\nwe talk about this stuff.\n\n175\n00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:11.290\nBeyond any reasonable doubt we can\nsay that Mike's user identity and\n\n176\n00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:14.950\nMike's private key was\nused to send the message.\n\n177\n00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.800\nBut we don't know if Mike was the person\nwho actually sat down at the keyboard and\n\n178\n00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.590\ntyped out the message and hit sent.\n\n179\n00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.010\nAs a matter of fact, we're not sure.\n\n180\n00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.580\nUnless we add some sort\nof additional control.\n\n181\n00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.670\nA dual factor authentication system,\nfor instance, or multi factor.\n\n182\n00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:35.600\nWhich will probably involve biometrics\nto beyond any reasonable doubt assure us\n\n183\n00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.900\nthat Mike was legitimately the person\nwho sat down at the keyboard and\n\n184\n00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.400\nactually did engage in this action.\n\n185\n00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.940\nWe wouldn't know for sure.\n\n186\n00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.590\nWe take it for granted and we assume\nthat Mike was the person that did this.\n\n187\n00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.730\nBut somebody could have, in theory,\nspoofed Mike's identity and\n\n188\n00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.390\ncarried out this activity\non behalf of Mike.\n\n189\n00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:57.110\nWe would not be able to tell\nthe difference because the credential and\n\n190\n00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.440\nkey are legitimately Mike's and\nthey belong to Mike.\n\n191\n00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.560\nAnd Mike's identity was legitimately used.\n\n192\n00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.950\nBut the problem is, we don't really know\nfor sure whose hand was on the keyboard.\n\n193\n00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:10.110\nSo we need to understand, again,\nthe limitation of what a signature or\n\n194\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.450\na hash can do for\n\n195\n00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:16.070\nus, and the things that we should be aware\nof that it may not be able to provide.\n\n196\n00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.620\nIt doesn't provide 100% lock or guarantee\n\n197\n00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.040\nthat the person that sent the message is\nthe person whose credential was used.\n\n198\n00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.840\nWe just make that leap of faith and\nwe assume that it is one and the same.\n\n199\n00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.830\nBut, without additional mechanisms\nwe may not be able to tell\n\n200\n00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.210\nbeyond any reasonable doubt.\n\n201\n00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.760\nBut, what it does do is it focuses\nus on the second sentence,\n\n202\n00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.240\nthe idea that because we\nare hashing the message and\n\n203\n00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.810\nwe're using the private key of\nthe sender to be able to do that through\n\n204\n00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:47.870\na hash in the signature, we are\neffectively creating an integrity check.\n\n205\n00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.060\nThe messages not been compromised,\nnot been modified in transit.\n\n206\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.810\nThe message that was sent in other\nwords was the message that you receive.\n\n207\n00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.860\nIn addition we can validate the identity,\n\n208\n00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.740\nagain within responsible limits,\nof the sendor.\n\n209\n00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:04.980\nAnd so if I go back to Mike, and say hey\nMike I check this message with the digital\n\n210\n00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.890\nsignature I downloaded your public key and\ndid a quick cache comparison and\n\n211\n00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.680\nI validated it was you that sent me this.\n\n212\n00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.870\nThanks for sending it to me and Mike says,\n\n213\n00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.570\nwhat are you talking about,\nI didn't send that message.\n\n214\n00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:19.620\nI'm going to say that's interesting,\n\n215\n00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.540\nbecause according to your\ndigital signature, you did.\n\n216\n00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.110\nRight?\nSo it provides non repudiation.\n\n217\n00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:30.610\nMike really can't deny that his\ncredential was used to send the message.\n\n218\n00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.320\nWhat Mike really should tell me is,\n\n219\n00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.040\nhey I'm not aware of the fact\nthat I sent that message.\n\n220\n00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.630\nSomebody may have used my credential\nwithout my knowledge because my username\n\n221\n00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:43.650\nand my private key were used even though\nI was not the one who actually wrote and\n\n222\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.980\nsent the message.\n\n223\n00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.650\nRight?\nSo Mike has to pay attention to what he\n\n224\n00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.690\ntells me.\n\n225\n00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.430\nI have to pay attention\nto what he's saying,\n\n226\n00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.160\nand we both have to make sure\nwe're saying the right thing.\n\n227\n00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:55.930\nMike also has to make sure he\nlocks his machine when he walks\n\n228\n00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:56.670\naway from it-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n229\n00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:58.090\n>> And doesn't leave Outlook open.\n\n230\n00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:00.550\nSo Mike has to practice\nbetter physical security.\n\n231\n00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.380\nBut the idea behind digital\nsignatures is just that.\n\n232\n00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:08.010\nIt allows us to understand in theory with\nthe integrity check that the message was\n\n233\n00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:12.770\nuncompromised and\nthat the sender whose identity was used.\n\n234\n00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:17.370\nThe user account on the private key cannot\nclaim they didn't engage in that activity,\n\n235\n00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.070\nbecause we have what's called\nnonrepudiation and proof of origin.\n\n236\n00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.220\nWe know they did,\nbecause their identity was used correctly.\n\n237\n00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.920\nThis is what digital symmetrics provide.\n\n238\n00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.750\nThey do this with a private key,\nvery important to understand that.\n\n239\n00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:31.670\nWe're about to talk about private,\nand private public key pairs.\n\n240\n00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.880\nSo symmetric encryption is\nwhere we use the single key,\n\n241\n00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:36.310\nwe call it the private key.\n\n242\n00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.790\nSometimes symmetric encryption\nis refereed to as single key or\n\n243\n00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.930\nprivate key encryption.\n\n244\n00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.050\nIt's all the same.\n\n245\n00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:45.980\nIt simply means we only have one key and\nthat key is given to the user,\n\n246\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:50.300\nwhoever that user is, it's issued to them,\nsimply stored in the LDAP directory along\n\n247\n00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.880\nwith their user information as\npart of their user profile.\n\n248\n00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.880\nSo, it's mapped in other\nwords we often say,\n\n249\n00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.200\nthe key is mapped to the user\naccount in the directory.\n\n250\n00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.660\nIn Windows, that would be\nthe Active Directory directory service,\n\n251\n00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.970\nwhat commonly call the active directory.\n\n252\n00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.800\nIn a Linux solution we may use OpenLDAP,\n\n253\n00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.290\nwe may just be using a non-Microsoft\nbased LDAP provider, it doesn't matter.\n\n254\n00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.560\nWe map the symmetric key to the user's\naccount for the user profile.\n\n255\n00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.960\nThe private key is meant to be kept\nsecure and not shared with anybody.\n\n256\n00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.110\nNow if you're paying attention\nto what I just said,\n\n257\n00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:26.240\nthey may start to have the bubbles\nturning up a little bit in your brain.\n\n258\n00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.610\nThey're gonna start firing off,\ngoing well wait a second.\n\n259\n00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:31.950\nLet's back up, because didn't Adam\njust talk about digital signatures and\n\n260\n00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:35.010\ndidn't he talk about using\nthe private key of the sender\n\n261\n00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:40.080\nto be able to digitally sign, and if we do\nthat aren't we exposing the private key?\n\n262\n00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.510\nAnd the answer is no, we're not and\nlet's talk about why.\n\n263\n00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.900\nEven though on the surface it\nmay sound like it is, right?\n\n264\n00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:49.770\nThe reason we're not doing that is that\nwe had talked about the fact that we\n\n265\n00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:54.350\nare not encrypting the message to provide\nconfidentiality with a digital signature.\n\n266\n00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:55.730\nWe are signing.\n\n267\n00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:57.340\nWe are providing integrity.\n\n268\n00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.450\nWe are hashing the message.\n\n269\n00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.890\nAnd if you remember, when we hash\nthe message, we're not worried about you\n\n270\n00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:06.685\nseeing the data, because we're not\nworried about keeping it secret.\n\n271\n00:14:06.685 --> 00:14:10.005\nWe're not worried about, in other words,\nproviding confidentiality.\n\n272\n00:14:10.005 --> 00:14:14.845\nSo the key can be used to create the hash\nbecause the hash function, can we go back\n\n273\n00:14:14.845 --> 00:14:18.955\nup to the hash function description,\njust up above, no earlier up, right there.\n\n274\n00:14:18.955 --> 00:14:23.365\nSo the hash function, if you remember,\nis a one-way mathematical operation.\n\n275\n00:14:23.365 --> 00:14:27.525\nIn other words, it is theoretically\npossible to reverse engineer a hash.\n\n276\n00:14:27.525 --> 00:14:29.270\nWe,never wanna say it's\nimpossible to do something,\n\n277\n00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:32.130\nbecause we know in theory there\nmay always be a way to do it.\n\n278\n00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.810\nBut we consider it to be so unlikely that\nyou could reverse engineer the hash and\n\n279\n00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.150\ngenerate the private key, that we're not\nworried about using the private key to\n\n280\n00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:44.040\ngenerate the hash, cuz we never\nactually send the private key.\n\n281\n00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.770\nWe simple send the data\ncombined with the product key\n\n282\n00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:54.850\nthrough a hashing algorithm as a 128,\n160, 256, 512, etc, bit stream of\n\n283\n00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:59.540\ncharacters that represent the data and\nthe key combined.\n\n284\n00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.090\nAnd being able to reverse\nengineer that is highly unlikely.\n\n285\n00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.480\nAnd so as a result of that,\nwe still keep the private key secure.\n\n286\n00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.990\nSo symmetric encryption is,\nindeed, focused on security and\n\n287\n00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.230\nuse of a single private key.\n\n288\n00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:15.400\nAsymmetric, two different but\nmathematically related keys.\n\n289\n00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.140\nWhen we say they're\nmathematically related,\n\n290\n00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.680\nyou could think of them as\neffectively being the key pair.\n\n291\n00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.020\nSo they are the public\nprivate key that we use,\n\n292\n00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.720\nare used to either encrypt or decrypt.\n\n293\n00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.040\nWe'll go the quick TV show reference\nthis time instead of a movie reference.\n\n294\n00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.640\nChanging things up a little bit for you.\n\n295\n00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.890\nRemember Justice League of America?\n\n296\n00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.450\nAwesome TV show, awesome cartoon.\n\n297\n00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.200\nSo the Justice League of America\nthey have the wonder twins, right?\n\n298\n00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.990\nDo you remember the wonder twins, right,\nthey would put the rings together,\n\n299\n00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:47.120\nshape of, right, and form of, why'd she\nalways want to be a bucket of water?\n\n300\n00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.546\nWhat the hell was going on with that,\nright?\n\n301\n00:15:48.546 --> 00:15:50.503\n>> The boy always picked\na very strange shape to be.\n\n302\n00:15:50.503 --> 00:15:53.213\n>> There was like a whole subtext\nto that conversation going on.\n\n303\n00:15:53.213 --> 00:15:54.629\nThey were brother and sister.\n\n304\n00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:57.378\nIt always combining in strange ways,\nit's kind of weird.\n\n305\n00:15:57.378 --> 00:15:59.202\nThen they had the whole crazy monkey gleek\n\n306\n00:15:59.202 --> 00:16:00.460\nrunning around-\n>> Oh, that's right!\n\n307\n00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.500\n>> Doing the crazy stuff.\n\n308\n00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.300\nYeah, it was a really fun time there\nback in 80's when all that was going on.\n\n309\n00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.900\nSo, wonder twin powers activate, right,\nthe idea of public-private keys.\n\n310\n00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.670\nYou have to join them together in\norder to be able to do something.\n\n311\n00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:16.440\nJust using one key by itself may\ngive us certain abilities, but\n\n312\n00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.328\nusing both keys together is\ngoing to become more powerful.\n\n313\n00:16:19.328 --> 00:16:20.540\nWe're going to take a look at how and\n\n314\n00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.235\nwhy that works a little bit later on\nin one of our other conversations.\n\n315\n00:16:24.235 --> 00:16:26.495\nMoving on, digital certificates.\n\n316\n00:16:26.495 --> 00:16:30.055\nThese are used to identify the certificate\nholder when conducting electronic\n\n317\n00:16:30.055 --> 00:16:30.705\ntransactions.\n\n318\n00:16:30.705 --> 00:16:32.195\nLet's draw that out a little bit.\n\n319\n00:16:32.195 --> 00:16:36.865\nWhat that really means is a digital\ncertificate is a digital form of identity\n\n320\n00:16:36.865 --> 00:16:40.505\nthat represents whoever is the holder,\nwhoever the certificate has been issued\n\n321\n00:16:40.505 --> 00:16:45.520\nto, in terms of providing trust and\nin terms of providing identity.\n\n322\n00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.940\nAnd also potentially things like\ndigital signature capabilities and\n\n323\n00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:54.790\nthe ability to validate for instance DLLs,\n\n324\n00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:58.410\nlines of code, things of that\nnature if we digitally sign.\n\n325\n00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:01.830\nWe may be using a certificate\nto authenticate a website or\n\n326\n00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.350\nauthenticate a web server.\n\n327\n00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:08.160\nWe may be using it to be able to digitally\nsign emails, things of that nature.\n\n328\n00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.520\nDigital certificates\nhave multiple functions.\n\n329\n00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:15.470\nThey effectively are going to be little\nminiature electronic documents that\n\n330\n00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:18.430\nproxy trust and\npresent identity on our behalf.\n\n331\n00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.540\nAnd we'll talk more\nabout how they work and\n\n332\n00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:24.200\nwhy they work the way they do in order for\nupcoming conversations as well.\n\n333\n00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.000\nThe certificate authority,\nwhat's known as the CA.\n\n334\n00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.630\nThe certificate authority\nis going to be able to\n\n335\n00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.580\nissue these digital certificates\nwe were just talking about.\n\n336\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.590\nIt actually manages the entire\nlife cycle of certificates.\n\n337\n00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:39.380\nIt will issue them as it says in\nthe definition, revoke them, and\n\n338\n00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.390\nmanage the overall usage and\n\n339\n00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.770\nauthentication of digital certificates\nacross the entire namespace or\n\n340\n00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:49.580\nacross the entire infrastructure that\ncertificates are going to be used through.\n\n341\n00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.670\nWe have different kinds of\ncertificate authorities.\n\n342\n00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:56.120\nWe have what is known as root CAs and\nwhat are known as subordinate CAs.\n\n343\n00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.450\nThey form a hierarchy.\n\n344\n00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.410\nThink about parent child relationship.\n\n345\n00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:03.012\nRoot CA sits at the top of\nthe hierarchy issuing certificates,\n\n346\n00:18:03.012 --> 00:18:06.860\nbut not to users typically,\nusually to other certificate authorities,\n\n347\n00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.930\nwhat we call the subordinate CAs.\n\n348\n00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.550\nAnd the subordinate CAs get their\ncertificate from a root, and\n\n349\n00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:16.130\nthen the root doesn't really talk\nto users or machines directly, but\n\n350\n00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:19.380\nsays to the subordinates hey,\nyou go ahead and talk to them and\n\n351\n00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.550\nyou issue certificates on\nmy behalf with my blessing,\n\n352\n00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.490\nwith my authority, and\nthen you give those certificates out.\n\n353\n00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.000\nSo we create what's\ncalled a chain of trust,\n\n354\n00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.810\nfrom the root through the subordinate\nto the end user, whoever that may be.\n\n355\n00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.700\nIf you go into your web browser,\nregardless of what browser you use,\n\n356\n00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.670\nit could be Internet Explorer,\ncould be Firefox, could be Chrome,\n\n357\n00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.120\ncould be Safari, doesn't matter what.\n\n358\n00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.260\nYou go into the appropriate area there and\nyou look for\n\n359\n00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.070\nthe certificates that are stored in\nthe web server, or excuse me, in the web\n\n360\n00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:50.550\nbrowser in the certificate store on\nthe local machine, you will find one or\n\n361\n00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:53.830\nmore certificates that have been issued\nthere and if you look at the intermediate\n\n362\n00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:57.360\nroot CA certificates you will see that\nthey have a trust chain that goes back up\n\n363\n00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:01.965\nto the root certificate authority or\nthe one that sits at the very top.\n\n364\n00:19:01.965 --> 00:19:03.915\nThis is how certificate authorities work.\n\n365\n00:19:03.915 --> 00:19:07.175\nRegistration authorities\nare going to be part of a PKI,\n\n366\n00:19:07.175 --> 00:19:12.135\na public key infrastructure solution\nthat involves certificate authorities.\n\n367\n00:19:12.135 --> 00:19:14.695\nThey are special kinds of systems.\n\n368\n00:19:14.695 --> 00:19:16.075\nThey may be used, they may not be.\n\n369\n00:19:16.075 --> 00:19:16.815\nThey are optional.\n\n370\n00:19:16.815 --> 00:19:19.825\nYou don't have to have a registration\nauthority to do PKI, but\n\n371\n00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:24.370\nyou do need to have a certificate\nauthority, one or more of them to do and\n\n372\n00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.670\nto issue PKI based certificates.\n\n373\n00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:31.330\nBut a registration authority effectively\nsteps in, as it says there, and deal with\n\n374\n00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:36.590\nmaking sure the information being provided\nto the CA is accurate and it validates\n\n375\n00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:40.920\nthis identity against the directory store\nin order to then effectively proxy on\n\n376\n00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.300\nbehalf of the certificate authority\nto handle all the heavy lifting\n\n377\n00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.310\nto then issue certificates and\nto allow certificates to be issued.\n\n378\n00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.750\nSo this is what a registration\nauthority does.\n\n379\n00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.450\nRemember they may be optional,\nyou may or may not need them.\n\n380\n00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:55.500\nWe've talked about plaintext and\ncyber text already.\n\n381\n00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.265\nPlaintext are clear text sometimes,\nlittle fast on the gun there Vanna.\n\n382\n00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:00.375\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Plaintext or\n\n383\n00:20:00.375 --> 00:20:04.640\nclear text is going to be the text that\nis going to go into the crypto system and\n\n384\n00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.568\ngoing to be encrypted or\nbeing ciphered in some way.\n\n385\n00:20:07.568 --> 00:20:10.480\nCiphertext, sometimes\nreferred to as a cryptogram,\n\n386\n00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.490\nis now going to be the text that\ncomes out the back end of the system.\n\n387\n00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.150\nThat is what is in ciphered.\n\n388\n00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.160\nThat is the stuff that we can't\nread because it's been encrypted.\n\n389\n00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.520\nCryptosystem, this represents\nthe entire cryptographic operation,\n\n390\n00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.340\nincluding algorithm, key, and\nkey management functions.\n\n391\n00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:31.030\nSo, the whole enchilada, as they say\nin South Florida, is the cryptosystem.\n\n392\n00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.180\nWe really do say that in\nSouth Florida by the way, we do.\n\n393\n00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.540\nSo the cryptosystem is the entire\ncapability of everything all together.\n\n394\n00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.040\nWe got to inject a little humor here and\nthere.\n\n395\n00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.640\nIt's a long day when all you're doing is\nstanding here in your socks and talking.\n\n396\n00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.870\nAlright to encryption and decryption.\n\n397\n00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.730\nWe also talked about\nthese functions already.\n\n398\n00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:52.360\nEncryption is actually to take plain text\nand run it through a crypto system and\n\n399\n00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.850\nultimately to encypher it,\ncreating cypher text.\n\n400\n00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:58.120\nDecryption is the process of\nrunning it backwards in effect.\n\n401\n00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.110\nWe take cypher text,\n\n402\n00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:02.560\nrun it through the crypto system, spit it\nback out the other side as plain text.\n\n403\n00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.470\nSo we've talked about encryption and\ndecryption as well.\n\n404\n00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:09.170\nThe key or the cryptovariable is going\nto be the input as we talked about.\n\n405\n00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:13.210\nThe secret ingredient that is going to be\nused to be able to drive the operation\n\n406\n00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.520\nof the cryptographic algorithm,\nremember it could be a private key or\n\n407\n00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.940\nit could be a private-public key\npair that we are talking about.\n\n408\n00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.298\nI've talked about non-repudiation as well.\n\n409\n00:21:22.298 --> 00:21:27.420\nNon-repudiation is given to us\nthrough using integrity controls,\n\n410\n00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:32.270\nthis allows us to understand that when we\nsee non-repudiation, or think about it,\n\n411\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:36.660\nthat the person that engaged in that\naction cannot deny having done so.\n\n412\n00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.380\nWe talked about the fact that Mike may not\nhave been the person with his hands on\n\n413\n00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.310\nthe keyboard, but\nwe know Mike's credential was used.\n\n414\n00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:43.990\nSo now we have to talk\nto Mike about whether or\n\n415\n00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.498\nnot he was really there,\nbe cause from our perspective,\n\n416\n00:21:46.498 --> 00:21:49.730\nnon-repudiation implies that\nbasically we think he was.\n\n417\n00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.240\nSo we've got to be aware of that and\nthink about that.\n\n418\n00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.630\nAn algorithm is simply going to\nbe the mathematical construct\n\n419\n00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.360\nthat we use to drive encryption or\ndecryption.\n\n420\n00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:01.140\nHashing for instance also uses algorithms.\n\n421\n00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.950\nI mentioned a couple.\n\n422\n00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.751\nI said md5 for instance, and Shy one.\n\n423\n00:22:04.751 --> 00:22:07.920\nThese are encryption algorithms,\nbut specifically, or excuse me,\n\n424\n00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.770\nthese are hashing algorithms that\nare specifically designed to do hashing.\n\n425\n00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.810\nWe have encryption algorithms such as AES,\n\n426\n00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:17.010\nthe advanced encryption\nstandard algorithm.\n\n427\n00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:21.520\nWe have DES, or triple DES,\nthe data encryption standard algorithm.\n\n428\n00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.610\nWe have idea.\n\n429\n00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:26.250\nWe have two fish, blow fish, red fish,\nblue fish, for those of you that are Dr.\n\n430\n00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:27.080\nSeuss fans.\n\n431\n00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.280\nWe have all sorts of algorithms\nthat are dealing with cryptography,\n\n432\n00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.720\nand specifically encryption,\n\n433\n00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.160\nand we'll talk about some of those in\nsome of our upcoming conversations.\n\n434\n00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.550\nContinuing on, we have cryptanalysis,\nthe study of techniques for\n\n435\n00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:41.019\nattempting to defeat\ncryptographic systems.\n\n436\n00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:45.610\nCryptanalysis is the study of and\nthe art and\n\n437\n00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.630\nscience of trying to break\ncryptographic systems.\n\n438\n00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.750\nSo to figure out how to steal keys,\nuse them to decrypt systems,\n\n439\n00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.800\nhow to break them using a variety of\ndifferent attacks, that's cryptanalysis.\n\n440\n00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.480\nCryptology down at the bottom there is\nthe science that deals with hidden,\n\n441\n00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.630\ndisguised or encrypted communications.\n\n442\n00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.710\nOne of my students once told\nme cryptology was the art and\n\n443\n00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:05.955\nscience of studying crypts.\n\n444\n00:23:05.955 --> 00:23:07.790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not really what we're\n\n445\n00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:08.640\ntalking about here.\n\n446\n00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.185\nThat's the Egyptian hieroglyphic\nclass down the down the hallway.\n\n447\n00:23:12.185 --> 00:23:13.850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, collision,\n\n448\n00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:17.130\nthis occurs when a hash function generates\nthe same output for different inputs.\n\n449\n00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.330\nWe don't want to have patterns,\nas we have often talked about, right.\n\n450\n00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.770\nAnything that is same,\n\n451\n00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:25.960\nanything that is going to repeat is not\ngood when we talk about encryption.\n\n452\n00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:31.570\nCollisions are bad, because collisions\nimply that something that is different,\n\n453\n00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:35.900\ntwo different things,\nhave generated the same end result.\n\n454\n00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:37.700\nAnd that is a problem, right?\n\n455\n00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.700\nThat is the problem.\n\n456\n00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.890\nBecause if we can see a pattern, if we\ncan get two different keys to generate\n\n457\n00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:45.285\nthe same end result, we now can\nfigure out how to break that system.\n\n458\n00:23:45.285 --> 00:23:47.500\nBecause now we have two pieces\nof very valuable information.\n\n459\n00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.962\nThe key space.\n\n460\n00:23:49.962 --> 00:23:53.456\nKey space represents a total number\nof possible values of all keys\n\n461\n00:23:53.456 --> 00:23:55.117\nin the cryptographic system.\n\n462\n00:23:55.117 --> 00:24:00.481\nIn other words, the key space is the\nentire mathematical construct, the value,\n\n463\n00:24:00.481 --> 00:24:05.455\nthe all up number of all the keys that\nare possibly available to us inside that\n\n464\n00:24:05.455 --> 00:24:11.160\ncryptosystem, we often represent this\nas a power of two, two to the 512th.\n\n465\n00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.530\nOr something like that,\ntwo with 512 zeros after it.\n\n466\n00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:18.080\nThat's a very large check for us to\nwrite or a very big check to write that.\n\n467\n00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.180\nTwo to the 512th power is going to\nbe two with 512 zeros after it.\n\n468\n00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.960\nA key space made of that\nkeys in it depending\n\n469\n00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.420\non the bit strength of\nthe algorithm being used.\n\n470\n00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.550\nIf it's a 4096 bit algorithm,\n\n471\n00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.310\nwe are talking about\nan incredibly large key space.\n\n472\n00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:36.260\nIf it's a 56 bit algorithm, we\nare talking about a very small key space.\n\n473\n00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.880\nSo, the key space is simply\nthe overall number of keys.\n\n474\n00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.100\nWork factor, the time and effort\nrequired to break a protective measure.\n\n475\n00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.300\nWork factor is a measure in time\nof how long you will have to work\n\n476\n00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.540\nto break the cryptosystem.\n\n477\n00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:53.480\nThat's usually a very long time depending\non how strong the cryptosystem is.\n\n478\n00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.770\nInitialization vector,\nwhat's commonly called an IV.\n\n479\n00:24:57.010 --> 00:25:00.210\nAn IV is effectively a random value.\n\n480\n00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.160\nIt's non-secret.\n\n481\n00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.910\nWe don't necessarily hide it from you.\n\n482\n00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.440\nIt's a non-secret value.\n\n483\n00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.830\nA binary vector is just fancy,\ncipher talk for mathematical information.\n\n484\n00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:15.070\nIt's just bits, that we stick into\nthe first run of the algorithm\n\n485\n00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:19.020\ntaking the first crack at the plain\ntext as we insert it into the system.\n\n486\n00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:23.370\nSo, effectively, we're padding some\nadditional information into that by doing\n\n487\n00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:27.700\nthat, what we're doing is inserting\nsome randomness into the encryption run.\n\n488\n00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.520\nAnd because of that, what then happens\nis that additional initialization vector\n\n489\n00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.240\nhas to be added to the mix,\n\n490\n00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.230\nwhen we reverse engineer in order to be\nable to get the right information back.\n\n491\n00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.370\nAnd get the plain text back\nfilling up the back end.\n\n492\n00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:44.210\nBecause we add the initialization\nvector with the data, and\n\n493\n00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.580\nthe key in the algorithm, and\nnow in order to unwind all of that.\n\n494\n00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.510\nYou need to know all of that,\nin order to do it the right way.\n\n495\n00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:54.000\nInitialization sectors by themselves\nare not necessarily very strong, but\n\n496\n00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.390\nwe mapped them to something\nknown as an X or function.\n\n497\n00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.970\nX oaring implies that we are going\nto take the output of on run, and\n\n498\n00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.920\nthen use it as the input for\nthe next to re encrypt.\n\n499\n00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.320\nAnd as we re encrypt multiple times,\n\n500\n00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:09.680\nwe're pushing that randomness\nfurther into the mix.\n\n501\n00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:15.270\nBy effectively wrapping it in multiple\nlayers of additional cryptography or\n\n502\n00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.780\nadditional encryption.\n\n503\n00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:21.390\nAnd we have to unwind every one of those,\nXOR'ing the opposite way, to unencrypt and\n\n504\n00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:24.520\ndo so successfully,\nby knowing the pattern and the sequence.\n\n505\n00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.260\nThis is why this can become\nvery complicated very quickly.\n\n506\n00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.580\nEncoding, continuing down.\n\n507\n00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:34.530\nAnd decoding, and coding is the action of\neffectively taking a message, right, plain\n\n508\n00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:39.450\ntext, and as you heard me say encoding\nit or enciphering it into cipher text.\n\n509\n00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:40.830\nDecoding means the exact opposite.\n\n510\n00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.870\nWe run it the other way.\n\n511\n00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:45.400\nWe take cipher text and we decode it,\nwe run it back through and\n\n512\n00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.470\ncreate plain text on the back-end.\n\n513\n00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.050\nTransposition or permutation,\njust a few more,\n\n514\n00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:51.990\nI promise you we're almost at the end.\n\n515\n00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:54.610\nTransposition or permutation and\nnotice by the way,\n\n516\n00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:56.743\nI have not taken a breath\nthe entire time we've been talking.\n\n517\n00:26:56.743 --> 00:26:58.553\n>> [LAUGH] I've been pretty impressed.\n\n518\n00:26:58.553 --> 00:27:00.860\n>> Transportation [LAUGH] transportation.\n\n519\n00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.950\nTransposition or permutation.\n\n520\n00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:06.490\nTransposition or permutation is\nthe idea of being able to substitute\n\n521\n00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:08.520\ncertain things, or move them around.\n\n522\n00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:11.890\nBut not just substitute, the way\nsubstitution says, but to transpose them.\n\n523\n00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.580\nSpecifically, to move them\naround in a certain order.\n\n524\n00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:19.870\nSo, when we transpose we say that\nthe letter A now becomes the letter Z,\n\n525\n00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.860\nand the letter B becomes the letter Y,\nor something like that.\n\n526\n00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.760\nAnd we're transposing,\nwe're shifting in effect, or permutating.\n\n527\n00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.460\nWe are modifying in some way.\n\n528\n00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.920\nThat's what transposition or\npermutation is about.\n\n529\n00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:34.900\nSubstitution is just a very simple thing,\nthe letter A is really the number one,\n\n530\n00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.040\nthe number B is really the number two.\n\n531\n00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.280\nAnd so, when we write, the dog is blue,\nwe would find the numerical equivalent, so\n\n532\n00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.600\nwe would simply say, 1,5,7,9 and\n\n533\n00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.000\nthen, we would translate that back to the\ndog is blue, that would be substitution.\n\n534\n00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:52.640\nSP network, the SP network stands for and\nby the way SP stands for substitution and\n\n535\n00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.480\npermutation as we talked about which is,\n\n536\n00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.250\neffectively transpositioning, when we\ntalked about the idea of X oaring, right?\n\n537\n00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.740\nAnd taking the output of one run and\nusing it as the input for\n\n538\n00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.840\nthe next, it's kind of hinting at this.\n\n539\n00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.220\nIt says most block ciphers do a series of\nrepeated substitutions and permutations to\n\n540\n00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:13.550\nadd what's called confusion and diffusion,\ndefined below, to the encryption process.\n\n541\n00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:19.050\nSo, the SP network is this idea of using\nsubstitution and permutation, ultimately,\n\n542\n00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:22.030\nto add confusion and\ndiffusion to the system so\n\n543\n00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:26.440\nthat we further obfuscate,\nfurther hide the original data and\n\n544\n00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.820\nmake it that much more difficult for\nsomebody to break the encryption.\n\n545\n00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:33.850\nConfusion provides or\nallows us to effectively provide the idea\n\n546\n00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:37.940\nof changing and\nmixing up things to effectively add so\n\n547\n00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.700\nmuch randomness seemingly into\nthe system that it's very hard for\n\n548\n00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:44.840\nus to really understand what is the real\ndata and what is the data that's been\n\n549\n00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:49.160\nmodified through multiple XOR's,\nmultiple permutations along the way.\n\n550\n00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.860\nEffectively rendering, not the real data,\n\n551\n00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.480\nbut a representation of the encrypted\ndata multiple times over.\n\n552\n00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.680\nDiffusion is the idea of\nmixing up the location so\n\n553\n00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.580\nthat way, as we scatter the plain text\nthroughout what becomes the cipher text,\n\n554\n00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.410\npeople don't know where the real data is\nand where the buffering and padding is.\n\n555\n00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:09.070\nAnd as a result, they're not sure\nwhat to decrypt, and what is real and\n\n556\n00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:12.030\nwhat is not,\nvery crafty on our part, by the way.\n\n557\n00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.960\nAvalanche effect, right, the avalanche\neffect, that should be the last one.\n\n558\n00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.470\nThe avalanche effect is going to be where\na minor change in either the key or\n\n559\n00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:19.450\nthe text itself,\n\n560\n00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:23.570\nthe plain text has a significant\nresulting change in cipher text.\n\n561\n00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:27.160\nWhat we often talk about with this is\nreally what's know as, more generally,\n\n562\n00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.090\nthe butterfly effect.\n\n563\n00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:29.900\nYou may have heard of\nthe butterfly effect, right?\n\n564\n00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:34.400\nA butterfly flapping its wings in\nthe Amazon leads to global climate change,\n\n565\n00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.250\nbecause of a series of small but\ninterlocking and\n\n566\n00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.440\nrelated events that become larger and\nmore amplified as they go.\n\n567\n00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:44.370\nThe classic example of this is dropping\na pebble or a rock into a pool of water.\n\n568\n00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:48.180\nYou see the rippling waves that move\noutwards from the point of contact,\n\n569\n00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:52.580\nand they become broader and wider as they\ngo, touching more of the body of water.\n\n570\n00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.470\nThis is what the avalanche effect is.\n\n571\n00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:59.120\nWhen we XOR through the data runs, if we\nhave a small error in the beginning and\n\n572\n00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.590\nwe wrap that error up and we use the\noutput of that run to become the input for\n\n573\n00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:05.910\nthe next and we amplify the error\ngoing forward 20 times,\n\n574\n00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:09.790\na little error right here,\nbecomes a massive error on the back-end.\n\n575\n00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.620\nBecause it gets amplified\nthrough all those runts\n\n576\n00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.270\nthat's what the avalanche effect is.\n\n577\n00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.890\nI'm gonna stop talking right now\nbecause if I don't take a breath,\n\n578\n00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:17.860\nI'm gonna pass out.\n\n579\n00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.910\n>> Very good Adam.\n\n580\n00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.060\nWe sure do appreciate\nall those

day.\n\n583\n00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.150\nWe have to bring that in tomorrow.\n\n584\n00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.840\n>> There's a quiz.\n>> There's going to be a quiz, great.\n\n585\n00:30:26.840 -->

00:00:21.152\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick, today we're\ndoing our CISSP content, specifically,\n\n4\n00:00:21.152 --> 00:00:26.313\nwe're going into our assess and\nmitigate our vulnerabilities, part 25.\n\n5\n00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:28.301\nNow, there's a lot to it, right?\n\n6\n00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:32.040\nWe've gone over a lot of key concepts,\na lot of key terms, and\n\n7\n00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.100\nthere's more that we really need\nto understand, and so, we have Mr.\n\n8\n00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.130\nAdam Gordon here to walk us through it.\n\n9\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.701\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:39.230\n>> I'm good, I'm good.\n\n11\n00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.590\nI'm wearing my walking socks, not my\nwalking shoes, but my walking socks.\n\n12\n00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.400\nWe're in good shape.\n\n13\n00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.190\n>> They do look comfy.\n\n14\n00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.030\n>> They do, they are.\n\n15\n00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.430\nAnd indeed I am happy cuz they are\ncomfortable and a word from our sponsor\n\n16\n00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.680\nabout the standing pad that I\nhave on also which is great cuz.\n\n17\n00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.870\nThank you sir,\nthis is working out really well.\n\n18\n00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.550\nAll right so, high work factor.\n\n19\n00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.550\nLet's talk about, we've been talking\nabout the ideas behind how we mitigate.\n\n20\n00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.480\nHow we ultimately assess and figure out\nwhat the risks and vulnerabilities are,\n\n21\n00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.550\nand how we deal with them.\n\n22\n00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.640\nWe just spent an entire episode going\nthrough and laying out vocabulary for\n\n23\n00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.040\nyou with regards to cryptography and\nencryption, and\n\n24\n00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.700\nall the moving parts there.\n\n25\n00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.900\nWhen we think about all that stuff,\n\n26\n00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.815\nwhat we really have to also consider,\nkeeping in that same general theme for\n\n27\n00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:23.675\na minute, is what does it really take for\nus to use cryptography?\n\n28\n00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:26.155\nWhat are the value adds,\nin other words, and, potentially,\n\n29\n00:01:26.155 --> 00:01:26.995\nwhat are the liabilities?\n\n30\n00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:29.085\nWhat are the risks that\nwe may have to address?\n\n31\n00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:31.675\nSo when we think about using\na cryptographic solution\n\n32\n00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:34.045\nto increase security,\nwe're obviously gaining.\n\n33\n00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:38.030\nWe're getting confidentiality,\nwe may be gaining integrity.\n\n34\n00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.010\nWe may be getting the ability to be\nable to safeguard information and\n\n35\n00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.050\nto validate not only proof of origin,\nwho sent it, but\n\n36\n00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.010\nalso the fact that the data\nhas not been modified.\n\n37\n00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.190\nSo, these are good things,\nbut, what are the risks?\n\n38\n00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.500\nOne of the risks are,\n\n39\n00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.330\nthat we may use cryptography that\nis not implemented properly.\n\n40\n00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.690\nSo, we may have a problem because it\nmay not stand up to the test of time.\n\n41\n00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.220\nWe've talked about this before, we may\nlose the key, heaven forbid that happens.\n\n42\n00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.970\nWe lose the key,\nwe lose access to the data in theory.\n\n43\n00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.730\nWe'll talk about key management at\nsome point, but if we don't keep\n\n44\n00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.280\na copy of the key, then effectively\nyou could say goodbye to your data,\n\n45\n00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.960\ncuz you're not going to see it again.\n\n46\n00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.210\nYou could look at it but\nyou're not really going to see the data,\n\n47\n00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.780\nyou're going to see\nthe encrypted form of the data.\n\n48\n00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.550\nSo if all you want to see is ciphertext,\nthen that's okay.\n\n49\n00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.981\nBut if you actually want the plain text,\nyou may wanna have a copy of the key.\n\n50\n00:02:24.981 --> 00:02:27.638\nSo you have to keep in mind that there\nare certain risks associated with\n\n51\n00:02:27.638 --> 00:02:29.680\nthe activities that we're talking about.\n\n52\n00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.550\nAnd so\nthese kind of things become important,\n\n53\n00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.130\nwe did talk about work factor when\nwe were going through vocabulary.\n\n54\n00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.030\nWork factor remember is\nthe measure of time it would take\n\n55\n00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.531\nto break the cryptosystem.\n\n56\n00:02:39.531 --> 00:02:43.167\nWe measure cryptosystem strength\nwith regards to work factor,\n\n57\n00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:45.620\nif a cryptosystem will take a million.\n\n58\n00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.740\nThat's 1 million years to break\nwith current modern technology,\n\n59\n00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.480\nit's considered to be\nunbreakable by modern standards.\n\n60\n00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.830\nBut 12 months from now,\nthat may not take a million years anymore.\n\n61\n00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.960\n12 months from now, that may take half\nthat time in theory, 500,000 years.\n\n62\n00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.460\nThat's still a really long time to wait,\n\n63\n00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.090\nI'm not that patient,\nI've just never been that patient.\n\n64\n00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.460\nSo it still may be too long,\nrealistically, for us to say we can gain\n\n65\n00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.610\nan advantage and the system is\nstill considered to be unbreakable.\n\n66\n00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.950\nBut it's not as unbreakable as it was,\nit's only half as unbreakable as it was.\n\n67\n00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.910\nAnd if you get the point I'm\ngoing after here over time,\n\n68\n00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.840\nthe amount of time that will take, the\nwork factor it takes to break the system\n\n69\n00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.260\nlessens because technology gets better.\n\n70\n00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.380\nAnd so we constantly have to reassess\nthe application of cryptographic solutions\n\n71\n00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.935\non whether they are providing\nthe right level of protection.\n\n72\n00:03:32.935 --> 00:03:35.440\nCISSP's have to know that\nwe have to do this so\n\n73\n00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.570\nwe have to drive the organization forward.\n\n74\n00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.160\nTo do this with regards\nto risk management,\n\n75\n00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.230\nbecause one of the key risks we have is\nthat the cryptosystem becomes weak enough,\n\n76\n00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.740\nthe work factor has shrunken to the point\nthat the time it would take to invalidate\n\n77\n00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.720\nthe cryptosystem and break it is so\nsmall that it may actually be doable,\n\n78\n00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.800\nit may actually be something somebody will\nattempt and therefore gain an advantage\n\n79\n00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.790\nand ultimately expose our data rendering\nconfidentiality null and void.\n\n80\n00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.000\nAnd so that will obviously be a bad\noutcome, so when we think about that,\n\n81\n00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.670\nthat's one of the key\nrisks we have to address.\n\n82\n00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.400\nAnother risk is the implementation\nof the cryptosystem,\n\n83\n00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.520\nnot just did we choose the right one,\nis it strong enough?\n\n84\n00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.540\nDoes it have a work factor,\na high enough work factor, but\n\n85\n00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.940\nwhat kind of implementation are we doing?\n\n86\n00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.570\nAre we gonna use stream based ciphers?\n\n87\n00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.470\nStream based encryption solutions?\n\n88\n00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.660\nOr are we gonna use block\nbased encryption solutions?\n\n89\n00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.350\nStream based ciphers, block based ciphers,\nare two of the choices that we have.\n\n90\n00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.470\nA stream based cipher,\n\n91\n00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.820\neffectively, is going to operate on\nthe data in ciphering it in a stream.\n\n92\n00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.300\nIt's much like drinking from a fire hose,\nright?\n\n93\n00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.140\nYou ever done that?\n\n94\n00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.510\nDrinking from a fire hose?\n\n95\n00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.290\nYou've got to get a small straw.\n\n96\n00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.720\nGet it just right, angled just right, not\nto get all wet all over the place, right?\n\n97\n00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.750\nSo drinking from a hose is\nthe idea of having a stream\n\n98\n00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.975\nof something that goes by you and being\nable to effectively engage the stream.\n\n99\n00:04:48.975 --> 00:04:51.925\nSo literally a stream based cipher\nenciphers one bit at a time\n\n100\n00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:53.015\nin a continuous stream.\n\n101\n00:04:53.015 --> 00:04:56.985\nThink of a conveyor belt moving past you\nand the conveyor belt has all the bits and\n\n102\n00:04:56.985 --> 00:04:57.595\nbytes on it.\n\n103\n00:04:57.595 --> 00:05:01.255\nAnd you're just enciphering all of them\none at a time, whereas a block-based\n\n104\n00:05:01.255 --> 00:05:07.105\ncipher takes a entire grouping of\nthe information, let's say 64 bits\n\n105\n00:05:07.105 --> 00:05:11.780\nif that's what we're doing, 64 bits of\ndata in a block, we put that into a box,\n\n106\n00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.350\nin effect, and we operate on the 64\nbits of data, altogether, as block.\n\n107\n00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.530\nAs opposed to individual bits,\none at a time in a string, so\n\n108\n00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.710\nthe outcome is the same we get ciphertext,\nbut how do we get there?\n\n109\n00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.155\nHow we choose to implement Implement,\nhow the algorithms in implement work and\n\n110\n00:05:26.155 --> 00:05:29.265\nwhat their strengths and weaknesses\nare are things we have to be aware of.\n\n111\n00:05:29.265 --> 00:05:32.405\nSo we also have to consider\nstream based ciphers as well as\n\n112\n00:05:32.405 --> 00:05:34.445\nunderstanding block based ciphers.\n\n113\n00:05:34.445 --> 00:05:37.335\nThe stream based cipher is going to,\n\n114\n00:05:37.335 --> 00:05:39.945\nbecause of its operating going\nto continue a stream of bits,\n\n115\n00:05:39.945 --> 00:05:44.114\nis going to obviously be enciphering and\ndeciphering one bit at a time.\n\n116\n00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:48.570\nWhereas the block-based cipher operating,\nlet's say hypothetically on 64 bits\n\n117\n00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.700\nof data altogether in a box,\nis operating on an entire chunk of data.\n\n118\n00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.800\nIf we encrypt that entire chunk and\n\n119\n00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.418\nwe get that chunk of data encrypted\nincorrectly, we screwed up 64 bits.\n\n120\n00:05:58.418 --> 00:06:02.450\nIf we end the stream and encrypt\na single bit of data and screw that up,\n\n121\n00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.960\nwe've only screwed up one bit.\n\n122\n00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.910\nSo remember the concept of the avalanche\neffect that we're talking about or\n\n123\n00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.360\nhave talk about with regards\ntowards our definitions.\n\n124\n00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.930\nIf the avalanche effect pushes\nthe encryption error forward, and\n\n125\n00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.260\nit's on 64 bites of data in a block,\n\n126\n00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.100\nthat's more significant than\na single error with a single bit.\n\n127\n00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.040\nSo we have to think about some of\nthe things we talk about relation to this\n\n128\n00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.180\nto understand this functionality.\n\n129\n00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.250\nOperating a cypher, in other words,\nis a complicated endeavor.\n\n130\n00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.600\nWe have to choose wisely as\nwe often talked about, so\n\n131\n00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.800\nstream based ciphers rely\nprimarily on substitution.\n\n132\n00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.160\nWe've talked about substitution, how they\nwork, and we have to understand that\n\n133\n00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.310\nbecause they are using substitution on\na per bit basis, one bid after another.\n\n134\n00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.460\nThat if we're not careful, and we're\nnot really paying attention to detail,\n\n135\n00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.600\nthe substitution pattern may emerge, and\n\n136\n00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.260\nif it emerges, we may find a way to\nbreak the cryptosystem and decrypt.\n\n137\n00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.000\nSo we do need to understand that, the\nlonger the period without repetition in\n\n138\n00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.230\nthe stream, the stronger the stream\ncipher is considered to be.\n\n139\n00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.280\nRemember, everything we talk about,\neverything we've always talked about,\n\n140\n00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.810\neverything we ever will talk about,\nforever and\n\n141\n00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.130\never, right, with regards to\ncryptography is the following.\n\n142\n00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.380\nAny pattern of any kind,\nany sameness of any kind is bad, and\n\n143\n00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.045\nwe should have a graphic that\nflashes up on the screen.\n\n144\n00:07:13.045 --> 00:07:15.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Big, red circle with a line through it,\n\n145\n00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.020\nsameness is bad, right?\n\n146\n00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.450\nTattoo that on your brain,\n\n147\n00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.320\nmake sure you understand that patterns,\nwe don't want them.\n\n148\n00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.150\nIf we get patterns, we get repetition,\nwe get potentially the opportunity for\n\n149\n00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.300\nthat actor to gain advantage and\nbreak the cryptosystem.\n\n150\n00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.120\nNot suggesting it will happen,\nI'm pointing out that it can, now if it\n\n151\n00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.550\nhappens often enough, it will, that's\nsomething you can definitely guarantee.\n\n152\n00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.604\nRemember, Block Cipher's gonna block or\n\n153\n00:07:36.604 --> 00:07:39.807\nchunk data together,\nwe will operate at different sized blocks.\n\n154\n00:07:39.807 --> 00:07:44.544\n64 bits, 128 bits, 192 bits,\ndepends on the nature of the block cipher,\n\n155\n00:07:44.544 --> 00:07:48.690\nhow it is set up, how it works,\ndifferent ciphers work different ways.\n\n156\n00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:52.665\nBut the idea is ultimately that with a\nblock cipher, we need to have what's known\n\n157\n00:07:52.665 --> 00:07:55.834\nas padding, we talked about this\nwith initialization vector.\n\n158\n00:07:55.834 --> 00:08:00.491\nInserting a certain amount of stuff in the\nbeginning of the run helps us to inject\n\n159\n00:08:00.491 --> 00:08:03.551\nrandomness but,\nin addition We also need padding,\n\n160\n00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:07.470\nbecause what happens is we\noperate it on a complete block.\n\n161\n00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.000\nImagine that you have a box, and\n\n162\n00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.820\nI often use the analogy of going to\na store where you can buy drinks,\n\n163\n00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.505\nlike either soda, water, wine, whatever\nit is, bottles of some kind, right?\n\n164\n00:08:17.505 --> 00:08:19.970\nAnd you get that box and\nit's the cardboard inserts in them,\n\n165\n00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.570\nwith like the checkerboard pattern.\n\n166\n00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.820\nYou put all the bottles in there so\n\n167\n00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.040\nyou can carry them out to\nthe car without breaking them.\n\n168\n00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.230\nThe idea's that we want\nto fill up the box.\n\n169\n00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.440\nFill in all of the little areas inside the\ncheckerboard pattern with the cardboard\n\n170\n00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.550\nseparators to ensure that the box is full.\n\n171\n00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:36.820\nOtherwise, we're not allowed to\ntake the box out of the store.\n\n172\n00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.030\nThat's the rule.\n\n173\n00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:40.900\nWhen we operate in a block cipher format,\n\n174\n00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.960\nwe have to make sure that every\nblock is completely filled out.\n\n175\n00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.340\nIf the block size is 64 bits,\nwe got to have 64 bits of data.\n\n176\n00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:48.450\nIf we only have 32,\n\n177\n00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:54.560\nwe have a problem because we can't encrypt\n32 bits of data when we're expecting 64.\n\n178\n00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.340\nSo we have to do what's called padding.\n\n179\n00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.820\nWe have to effectively we throw\na bunch of packing peanuts in there.\n\n180\n00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.210\nIf you're familiar with the concept\nwhen you go to UPS or something.\n\n181\n00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:01.810\nRight?\nSo\n\n182\n00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.090\nwhat they do is they put a bunch of\nstuff in there to take up the space.\n\n183\n00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:06.740\nSo that way the bottles don't\nknock around and break, or\n\n184\n00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.290\nyour bits are going to be filled out,\nor fully filled out on the block.\n\n185\n00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:14.440\nSo we inject some padding into\nthe block if it's not fully formed.\n\n186\n00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.610\nIf you were to take, let's say,\n96 bits of data, and\n\n187\n00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.240\nyou were going to chunk it and\nblock it into 64 bit blocks,\n\n188\n00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.870\nyou will be left with one full block and\none partial block, right?\n\n189\n00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.090\nAnd as result we'd have to use\npadding to get the partial block up\n\n190\n00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:31.240\nto 64 bits to make it 128.\n\n191\n00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.910\nCuz we're missing roughly 36 bits of\ndata as a result of that, or 32 bits or\n\n192\n00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:36.990\nwhatever it would be.\n\n193\n00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.380\nSo just make sure you're aware of that and\n\n194\n00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:44.140\nyou understand the value of both\ninitialization vectors as well as padding.\n\n195\n00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.470\nThat's very important\nas we talk about this.\n\n196\n00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.690\nI'd like to right now if we could\ntalk about specifically what\n\n197\n00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:52.680\nare known as basic block cipher modes.\n\n198\n00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.210\nIn other words,\nhow does the block actually function?\n\n199\n00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.320\nWhat we have is a nice little\nchart we're gonna put up for you,\n\n200\n00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.150\nand we're gonna talk specifically about\nthe five different modes, or mechanisms,\n\n201\n00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.120\nthe block ciphers can operate under.\n\n202\n00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.240\nYou'll see the first two on\nthe screen in front of you.\n\n203\n00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.110\nWe'll be scrolling down in just\na moment to get to the rest.\n\n204\n00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:12.960\nBut let's start with just making sure\nwe understand how to read the chart.\n\n205\n00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.660\nOn the left is gonna be the electronic\ncode book, cipher block chaining,\n\n206\n00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.800\ncipher feedback, etc, etc, etc.\n\n207\n00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.240\nThese are all the modes.\n\n208\n00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.385\nBy the way, etc, etc,\netc is a formal technical term.\n\n209\n00:10:23.385 --> 00:10:24.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're only allowed to use that if\n\n210\n00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.020\nyou're a CISSP though.\n\n211\n00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:28.070\nSo don't say that until\nyou become certified.\n\n212\n00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.032\nSo on the left is the mode column.\n\n213\n00:10:30.032 --> 00:10:32.610\nIt's gonna be the way in which\nthe block actually works,\n\n214\n00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.770\nthe cipher block or basic block\ncipher mode is gonna be on the left.\n\n215\n00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:40.110\nThe how it works column, like the name\nimplies, is going to explain to us\n\n216\n00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:43.740\nwhat electronic code book or\ncipher block chaining actually means.\n\n217\n00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.870\nSo let's start with electronic\ncode booking, shall we?\n\n218\n00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.350\nElectronic Code Book in what's\ncommonly called ECB mode.\n\n219\n00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:52.440\nEach block is encrypted independently,\n\n220\n00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.740\nallowing randomly accessed\nfiles to be encrypted and\n\n221\n00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.290\nstill accessed without having to process\nthe file in a linear encryption fashion.\n\n222\n00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.300\nWhat does that mean?\n\n223\n00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.660\nIn effect,we operate on\neach block independently.\n\n224\n00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.600\nWe're not going in, a let's say,\nan assembly line fashion where we're going\n\n225\n00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.600\nblock one, block two,\nblock three, block four.\n\n226\n00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.130\nWe're simply randomly encrypting\nblocks as they come in, so\n\n227\n00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.360\nwe're encrypting files without\nhaving to do it sequentially..\n\n228\n00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.660\nBut we have a code book.\n\n229\n00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.910\nWe effectively have a map that tells\nus what we encrypted and how we did it.\n\n230\n00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:27.530\nAnd by using the code book, we can unwind\nthe encryption, wind it backwards,\n\n231\n00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.860\nand effectively reverse engineer it,\nor run it backwards to get\n\n232\n00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.730\nplain text out the back end by reversing\nand mapping to the electronic code book.\n\n233\n00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.700\nThat's what the ECB mode means.\n\n234\n00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.530\nSo if a block cipher is running\nin electronic code book mode,\n\n235\n00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.740\nit is effectively going\nto be able to go out and\n\n236\n00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:47.450\nrandomly encrypt those blocks,\ncreate some sort of a map.\n\n237\n00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.660\nThe map is stored in what's called the\ncode book and that code book is then used\n\n238\n00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.790\nultimately to be able to decrypt if we\nhave to reverse going the other way.\n\n239\n00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:55.890\nCipher block chaining.\n\n240\n00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:57.545\nIf we could scroll up\njust a little bit there.\n\n241\n00:11:57.545 --> 00:11:58.380\nThank you sir.\n\n242\n00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:02.640\nIn Cipher Block Chaining mode,\nthe result of encryption one block of data\n\n243\n00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.910\nis fed back into the process\nto encrypt the next block.\n\n244\n00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:07.725\nI talked about the x orig.\n\n245\n00:12:07.725 --> 00:12:12.940\nX, or x ' rather, OR\nis what we would say X orig is written as.\n\n246\n00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.358\nThe X orig function.\n\n247\n00:12:14.358 --> 00:12:19.060\nAnd X orig function is effectively just\ncipher block chaining by another name.\n\n248\n00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:23.970\nSo, when we run a block cipher in\nCipher Block Chaining mode we are x orig,\n\n249\n00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.970\nwe are taking the output of one and\nciphering, run, and using it to then start\n\n250\n00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.250\nor form the input, the IV, the\ninitialization vector for the next one.\n\n251\n00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.380\nThis is potentially how we create\nan avalanche effect because\n\n252\n00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.410\nwe are propagating potentially the error\nall the way through the system\n\n253\n00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.920\nif we get it wrong, and heaven will\nhelp you if that happens by God.\n\n254\n00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.060\nYou know what we call that\nby that way if that happens.\n\n255\n00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.640\nWe call that an RGE.\n\n256\n00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.920\nYou know what an RGE is?\n\n257\n00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.350\n>> I believe that is\na Resume Generating Event.\n\n258\n00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.510\n>> That is a Resume Generation Event,\nthat's one for\n\n259\n00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:54.100\nthe vocabulary list there for\nyou boys and girls.\n\n260\n00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.160\n>> We'll make sure we add that one on.\n\n261\n00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.200\n>> Well we'll add that one on.\n\n262\n00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.730\nMake sure that's not a testable one but\nit is a real world one so\n\n263\n00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.070\njust be aware of that.\n\n264\n00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.770\nAll right so back to our list.\n\n265\n00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:02.820\nCipher Feedback mode.\n\n266\n00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.810\nSo in Cipher Feedback mode, the cipher\nyou can see there is used as a keystream\n\n267\n00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.560\ngenerator rather than for confidentiality.\n\n268\n00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.303\nEach block of key stream comes from\nencrypting the previous block of\n\n269\n00:13:12.303 --> 00:13:13.250\ncipher text.\n\n270\n00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:15.560\nIn other words what\nCipher Feedback mode is,\n\n271\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.270\nis essentially just another way\nof approaching and soaring.\n\n272\n00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:24.600\nIt's another approach that effectively\ndoes very similar things to what CBC does.\n\n273\n00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:30.820\nWe effectively are using the output of one\nrun to effect what will become the input\n\n274\n00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.260\nfor the next to generate the next key and\ntherefore the next encryption method.\n\n275\n00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:37.880\nSo what's cipher feedback is just\nanother take on that if you will.\n\n276\n00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.400\nOutput feedback is going to effectively,\n\n277\n00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.420\nas you see, the key stream is generated\nindependently of the message.\n\n278\n00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.244\nEffectively generate a key and\n\n279\n00:13:45.244 --> 00:13:48.650\nan encryption solution\nseparate from the message.\n\n280\n00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.830\nSo the message itself is not\nbeing used to effectively,\n\n281\n00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:56.160\nin any way, have any input that could\nbe used to trace back to the key.\n\n282\n00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.780\nAnd so as a result of that,\nwe're separating the two processes.\n\n283\n00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.280\nKeeping the separate makes them more\nsecure because one cannot, in any way,\n\n284\n00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.610\nshape or form point back to the other.\n\n285\n00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.490\nSo that's gonna be another take on this.\n\n286\n00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.220\nAnd then Counter method, CTR,\nCounter's not used very often, but\n\n287\n00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.360\nCounter is just that.\n\n288\n00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.580\nIt's effectively an incremental\ncounter that is effectively gonna use,\n\n289\n00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.950\nas you can see, a formula.\n\n290\n00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.190\nEncrypt (Base+N),\n\n291\n00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.650\nN is the incremental number, that will go\nup by a individual variable every time.\n\n292\n00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:26.480\nSo, it goes N, N plus one, N plus two in\nincrements, and as a result of that we use\n\n293\n00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.110\nthe incremental value of n as\nthe initialization vector for\n\n294\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.710\nthe randomness we insert\nto start off the process.\n\n295\n00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:37.700\nSo it's just a simple incrementing\ncounter factor or counter function, which\n\n296\n00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.270\njust adds a numerical equivalent in there\nand says, hey, now you're number two.\n\n297\n00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.000\nLet's start with number\ntwo as the random value.\n\n298\n00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.780\nNow you're number three.\n\n299\n00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.120\nNow you're number four.\n\n300\n00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.230\nAnd but if we know the sequence,\nwe can detect ultimately the pattern,\n\n301\n00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.280\nand we can figure out how to reverse it.\n\n302\n00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.320\nIf we don't know what the initialization\nof that sequence was and\n\n303\n00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.300\ndon't know where we are,\nit's a random number.\n\n304\n00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.280\nIt's going to be very tough for\nus to guess what that number may be.\n\n305\n00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.520\nAnd we don't obviously start at one\nevery time and go up from there.\n\n306\n00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.890\nWe randomly pick a number and\ngo up an increment from there.\n\n307\n00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.410\nSo these are the five different methods\n\n308\n00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.600\nthat block ciphers can be\neffectively implemented as.\n\n309\n00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.860\nWe wanna make sure we\nhave knowledge of them.\n\n310\n00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.640\nVery important for us to know\nwhat these are and how they work.\n\n311\n00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.440\nBecause these are gonna help us\nto understand the different ways\n\n312\n00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.500\nin which a block cipher\npotentially can operate, and\n\n313\n00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.490\nthe different ways that which we implement\nan algorithm as a result of that\n\n314\n00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.280\nis gonna be based on\nthe choice that we make.\n\n315\n00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.190\nSo if I was you, if I was studying for\n\n316\n00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:32.250\nthe exam I would want to have a general\nsense of the five thing we just discussed.\n\n317\n00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.860\nI would want to especially focus\non electronic code booking and\n\n318\n00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:39.390\ncipher block chaining those are the two\nthat are most popular, most prevalent.\n\n319\n00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.470\nSome of the others are not used anymore.\n\n320\n00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.190\nOr implement it only in\nspecial circumstances but\n\n321\n00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.388\nI wanna be generally\nfamiliar with all five.\n\n322\n00:15:46.388 --> 00:15:50.240\nI'd wanna equate them with the use of or\nthe understanding of the fact that they\n\n323\n00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.540\nare part of how blocked ciphers\nare typically implemented.\n\n324\n00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.510\nSo we just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n325\n00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:57.973\nWe've talked about key length and\nhow important key length is.\n\n326\n00:15:57.973 --> 00:16:00.422\nWe talked about the fact\nthat the larger the key,\n\n327\n00:16:00.422 --> 00:16:04.149\nthe harder it is to crack the system,\nthe higher the work factor, right?\n\n328\n00:16:04.149 --> 00:16:05.451\nBecause it takes more time.\n\n329\n00:16:05.451 --> 00:16:07.696\nSo key length is something\nvery important for\n\n330\n00:16:07.696 --> 00:16:11.128\nus again to consider as part of\nthe overall thought process.\n\n331\n00:16:11.128 --> 00:16:13.000\nWe also wanna talk about\nthe fact that the block size,\n\n332\n00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.450\nwith the block cipher, is also important.\n\n333\n00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.567\nThe bigger the block size, the more\ndata we are encrypting in one run.\n\n334\n00:16:18.567 --> 00:16:20.403\nThe less blocks we have to generate, and\n\n335\n00:16:20.403 --> 00:16:23.540\nobviously the less likelihood will\nhave an error as a result of that.\n\n336\n00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.200\nBecause we're using less blocks so\nthere's more data in the block.\n\n337\n00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:26.840\nBecause remember,\n\n338\n00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.480\nif we put 256 bits of data in a block,\nit's still one encryption cycle.\n\n339\n00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.280\nIf we put 56 bits of data in the block,\nit's still one encryption cycle.\n\n340\n00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.390\nWe're just encrypting a lot more\ndata with a higher block size.\n\n341\n00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:42.050\nSo we have to think about the fact that it\nmay be easier for us to move data through\n\n342\n00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.200\nthe system and have less errors\nif we increase the block size.\n\n343\n00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.380\nBut the downsize to that is that\nbigger blocks may take longer to\n\n344\n00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:49.530\nencrypt and decrypt.\n\n345\n00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:52.380\nSo maybe a performance negative there,\nbecause it may take longer for\n\n346\n00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.935\nthese systems to spin up and operate.\n\n347\n00:16:53.935 --> 00:16:55.360\nSo there is a pro and a con.\n\n348\n00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.150\nWe have to measure everything obviously,\nand be aware of that as well.\n\n349\n00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.281\nSo thinking through that obviously,\nwill be some of the mitigation and\n\n350\n00:17:02.281 --> 00:17:03.429\nassessment techniques,\n\n351\n00:17:03.429 --> 00:17:06.942\nand the things that we would have to\nconsider as we continue our conversations.\n\n352\n00:17:06.942 --> 00:17:09.780\nWe also wanna turn and talk a little\nbit about different cipher types.\n\n353\n00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.152\nNot just block and stream.\n\n354\n00:17:11.152 --> 00:17:14.445\nDifferent ways that these ciphers\ncan be not just implemented, but\n\n355\n00:17:14.445 --> 00:17:16.132\nactually are crafted, overall.\n\n356\n00:17:16.132 --> 00:17:17.895\nWe have different names for some of them.\n\n357\n00:17:17.895 --> 00:17:22.091\nThings like null cipher, substitution\ncipher, transposition ciphers.\n\n358\n00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:25.055\nThese are cipher types out\nbeyond stream and block.\n\n359\n00:17:25.055 --> 00:17:27.673\nAnd you should be passingly\nfamiliar with these as well.\n\n360\n00:17:27.673 --> 00:17:31.304\nA null cipher is gonna be used where,\neffectively,\n\n361\n00:17:31.304 --> 00:17:33.952\nit's not important to necessarily.\n\n362\n00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:38.330\nGet the use of encryption and\napply encryption to the system directly.\n\n363\n00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:44.460\nBut rather, we wanna make sure that we\nare going to obfuscate the data, hide\n\n364\n00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.550\nit in some way, but encryption may not\nnecessarily be the best way to do that.\n\n365\n00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:52.440\nSo effectively, we can go ahead and\nsay that we may not wanna\n\n366\n00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.920\nuse encryption at all, but\nsimply wanna use another mechanism.\n\n367\n00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.240\nA substitution, transposition,\npermutation, which is a form of cipher,\n\n368\n00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.161\nbut is not necessarily an encryption\nof the data that will effectively\n\n369\n00:18:04.161 --> 00:18:07.270\nachieve the protection\nthat we're looking for.\n\n370\n00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:10.060\nThis is what a null cipher\ncould be represented as.\n\n371\n00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:13.966\nThe lack of the use of encryption is what\na null cipher represents traditionally.\n\n372\n00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:15.560\nThat's how it's defined.\n\n373\n00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.610\nSo sometimes, it's okay not to encrypt.\n\n374\n00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.350\nBut still to provide other protections\nthat will get the job done.\n\n375\n00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.220\nSo we may not actually have to encrypt\ndata to protect it in others words,\n\n376\n00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.720\nwe may just have to hide it and some how\nmodify so people can't read it directly.\n\n377\n00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.000\nAs a result of that,\nthat may still be appropriate.\n\n378\n00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.860\nSo you've heard about the concept\nabout hiding in plain sight perhaps.\n\n379\n00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:33.383\nRight?\n\n380\n00:18:33.383 --> 00:18:35.380\nSo the idea years ago.\n\n381\n00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.490\nRemember some of this technologies,\nsome these ciphers we're talking about.\n\n382\n00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.130\nThey have been around for 100 of years.\n\n383\n00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.380\nWe talk about veneer ciphers for\ninstance, and\n\n384\n00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.271\nplay fair ciphers which were created\nin the 15th, 16th, 17th centuries.\n\n385\n00:18:47.271 --> 00:18:51.430\nWe're talking about the sky tail cipher,\nwhich has been around since Sparta,\n\n386\n00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:55.528\nthe modern equivalent of that doesn't\nexist anymore cuz we don't walk around\n\n387\n00:18:55.528 --> 00:18:59.710\nwith rods and staff and leather thongs we\nwrap around them to encrypt a message.\n\n388\n00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.180\nIt just doesn't work anymore.\n\n389\n00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.400\nSo some of these are 100,\nperhaps 1,000 of years old.\n\n390\n00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.695\nAt the time these original ciphers were\ncreated, the traditional mechanisms of\n\n391\n00:19:08.695 --> 00:19:11.737\ntrying to hide data,\nwe didn't have modern computers.\n\n392\n00:19:11.737 --> 00:19:13.500\nWe didn't have encryption algorithms.\n\n393\n00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.128\nWe didn't have advanced mathematics,\nright?\n\n394\n00:19:15.128 --> 00:19:17.431\nAnd as a result of that,\nI mean we had mathematics, but\n\n395\n00:19:17.431 --> 00:19:20.330\nnot the kind we need to do what we\ndo today in terms of computers.\n\n396\n00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.833\nAnd as a result of that, right, we wanna\nmake sure that understand that some\n\n397\n00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:26.898\nof these things may not really make\nus much sense in the real world,\n\n398\n00:19:26.898 --> 00:19:30.383\nmodern world we live in today as\nthey did 100 or 1,000 of years ago.\n\n399\n00:19:30.383 --> 00:19:32.795\nYou may say to yourself,\nwell why would I use a null cipher,\n\n400\n00:19:32.795 --> 00:19:34.880\nwhy would I not encrypt\nsomething I wanna protect.\n\n401\n00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.855\nToday it's so common,\nwhy wouldn't I encrypt it?\n\n402\n00:19:36.855 --> 00:19:39.051\nAnd the answer is you probably would, but\n\n403\n00:19:39.051 --> 00:19:42.020\nit maybe as simple as simply\nwriting a note to somebody.\n\n404\n00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.020\nAnd in the note, every fifth or seventh\nletter represents the actual message.\n\n405\n00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.700\nBut you've scattered that message,\n\n406\n00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.610\nyou've diffused it within\nthe actual body of the letter.\n\n407\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.690\nSomebody may have that understanding, and\n\n408\n00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:55.840\nthey know that every seventh letter should\nbe counted out or written down separately.\n\n409\n00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:58.306\nTo effectively then,\ngenerate the secret message.\n\n410\n00:19:58.306 --> 00:20:02.228\nThis will be an example of hiding data\nin plain site, using a null cipher,\n\n411\n00:20:02.228 --> 00:20:03.600\na non encrypted cipher.\n\n412\n00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.930\nTo be able to effectively\nsecret the data in the message.\n\n413\n00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:06.968\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n414\n00:20:06.968 --> 00:20:09.336\nWe thought about substitution ciphers,\nhow they work.\n\n415\n00:20:09.336 --> 00:20:11.870\nWe've talked about transposition ciphers,\nhow they work.\n\n416\n00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.785\nThese are all examples of\ndifferent kinds of ciphers.\n\n417\n00:20:13.785 --> 00:20:17.260\nMono-alphabetic and\npoly alphabetic ciphers as well.\n\n418\n00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.910\nUsing one alphabet to do the substitution\nor transposition or poly alphabetic,\n\n419\n00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.836\nmultiple alphabets being used\nto be able to do the same thing.\n\n420\n00:20:24.836 --> 00:20:27.524\nAgain think back 100 of years ago,\n\n421\n00:20:27.524 --> 00:20:32.235\nwhen really all we had was our brains\nas computers to do this stuff.\n\n422\n00:20:32.235 --> 00:20:36.027\nIf you used multiple alphabets and\nsubstituted across a grid, you would make\n\n423\n00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:39.430\nit much more complex for somebody\nto figure out what the message was.\n\n424\n00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.470\nBut it would be much harder because they\nwould have to know which alphabets were\n\n425\n00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.280\nused and\nthey would have to know what sequence or\n\n426\n00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.260\nwhat order they were placed on the page\nto do the substitution or permutation.\n\n427\n00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.350\nSo as a result of that,\nthis could be very, very difficult for\n\n428\n00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.870\nsomeone to actually do.\n\n429\n00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.450\nSo running key ciphers, another example\nof a cipher, the key is repeated, or\n\n430\n00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.800\nruns, for\nthe same length as the plain text.\n\n431\n00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.410\nSo the key repeats as often\nas the plain text does.\n\n432\n00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:05.580\nIf you have a 1,000 letters in the plain\ntext, the key will be a 1,000 spaces long.\n\n433\n00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.560\nThe key is repeated or runs throughout\nthe entire length of the message.\n\n434\n00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.240\nThe key in other words,\nwill be as long as the data itself.\n\n435\n00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.246\nAnd this is just another\nexample of a cipher.\n\n436\n00:21:13.246 --> 00:21:15.120\nWe also talk about one time pads.\n\n437\n00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.300\nOne time pads are going to be considered\nto be the only truly unbreakable crypto\n\n438\n00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.770\nsystem even today by today's standards\nif they are implemented correctly.\n\n439\n00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:26.410\nThere's always a but or an asterisk\nassociated with a statement like that.\n\n440\n00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.500\nWe never make the declarative or\n\n441\n00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.660\ndefinitive statements unless we know for\nsure.\n\n442\n00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.422\nThat nobody's ever gonna call us on it,\nright?\n\n443\n00:21:31.422 --> 00:21:33.605\n[LAUGH] So\nwe wanna make sure that we understand.\n\n444\n00:21:33.605 --> 00:21:35.513\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I did try to time that while you were\n\n445\n00:21:35.513 --> 00:21:37.230\ngrabbing a drink just to make sure.\n\n446\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.870\nSo we wanna make sure we understand\nthat the one time pad is considered to\n\n447\n00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.330\nbe unbreakable provided\nit's implemented correctly.\n\n448\n00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:45.630\nLet me explain what I mean.\n\n449\n00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:49.094\nSo the concept of one time pad is actually\nvery straightforward, it's been around for\n\n450\n00:21:49.094 --> 00:21:50.180\n100 of years.\n\n451\n00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.020\nWe create a series of ciphers that\nare gonna be used by an individual\n\n452\n00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.460\none time and one time only,\nand they're thrown away.\n\n453\n00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.730\nSo you can think of these as keys,\nor passwords, or\n\n454\n00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:01.560\nwhatever you wanna use that will\ndrive an encryption solution.\n\n455\n00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:05.520\nAnd they're gonna be used one time, and\nthen they're gonna be never used again.\n\n456\n00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.360\nAnd we have to synchronize this system\nwith both the sender and the receiver.\n\n457\n00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.540\nSo both people who are gonna use\nthe system have to have a copy\n\n458\n00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.020\nof all the keys, and have to have them\nset up in the right sequenced order.\n\n459\n00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.950\nThey both have to know that the key is\nused one time and then it is destroyed.\n\n460\n00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:24.260\nAs long as we do that, and as long as\nthose keys are kept secret on both sides,\n\n461\n00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.660\nand never exposed to anybody but\nthe sender and the receiver.\n\n462\n00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.150\nThe system is unbreakable.\n\n463\n00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:31.580\nBecause, even if you find\na pattern in one message,\n\n464\n00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.470\nit's never going to repeat\nagain in the same way.\n\n465\n00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.360\nBecause, the key is never to be reused.\n\n466\n00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.960\nSo, what's considered to be\na truly unbreakable system,\n\n467\n00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.350\nif implemented correctly.\n\n468\n00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:43.630\nThe challenge is, implementing it\ncorrectly, is incredibly challenging.\n\n469\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.232\nRight, so, this is what a one time pad is.\n\n470\n00:22:45.232 --> 00:22:46.935\nThis is what it's considered to be.\n\n471\n00:22:46.935 --> 00:22:48.980\nWanna make sure that is the case.\n\n472\n00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.680\nOr, at least that we are aware of that,\nas well.\n\n473\n00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.770\nSo when we think about\nsymmetric cryptography,\n\n474\n00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.590\nwe've talked about symmetric and\nasymmetric, we think about symmetric\n\n475\n00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.140\ncryptography we're thinking about\nsingle key or private key cryptography.\n\n476\n00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.470\nSome advantages of symmetric cryptography,\nwe've talked about what it is and\n\n477\n00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.400\nwe talked about why it's\ngonna be advantageous.\n\n478\n00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.460\nIt's incredibly fast, so\nit operates very quickly.\n\n479\n00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.461\nEncrypts very large volumes of data\nvery quickly because we're only\n\n480\n00:23:11.461 --> 00:23:12.764\nusing a single key, one key.\n\n481\n00:23:12.764 --> 00:23:13.300\nRight?\n\n482\n00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.050\nIt is secure.\n\n483\n00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:17.210\nIt's very secure if you keep the key\nprivate as we said, nobody can break\n\n484\n00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.550\nthe system unless they get the key and\nit's relatively inexpensive to implement.\n\n485\n00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.020\nIt's relatively straight forward.\n\n486\n00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.910\nWe use this kind of encryption\nall the time in modern systems\n\n487\n00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.310\nto do a variety of things.\n\n488\n00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.270\nDisadvantages, key disadvantage,\n\n489\n00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:31.990\nproblem management,\nnumber one is key management, right?\n\n490\n00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.510\nWe have to make sure that we\nkeep the private key secure.\n\n491\n00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:38.810\nIf we give out the private key all of\na sudden now, five people have it,\n\n492\n00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.200\nten people have it, twenty people have\nit the likely it would get exposed and\n\n493\n00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.100\ntherefore everybody can\nread the information.\n\n494\n00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:48.440\nSo the biggest issue and concern with\nsymmetric is the security of the key.\n\n495\n00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.841\nAnd we're gonna show you why\nthis is important right now,\n\n496\n00:23:50.841 --> 00:23:54.179\nwe're going to show you, at least one of\nthe many diagrams that we've created.\n\n497\n00:23:54.179 --> 00:23:57.664\nWe invited our friends Bob and\nAlice over today to help us out.\n\n498\n00:23:57.664 --> 00:24:00.775\nThey brought their buddy the attacker\ndown there at the bottom of the diagram.\n\n499\n00:24:00.775 --> 00:24:03.142\nCuz you know when you invite people over,\nthey always wanna bring guests.\n\n500\n00:24:03.142 --> 00:24:04.351\nYou can never control that.\n\n501\n00:24:04.351 --> 00:24:08.390\nSo we're going to go ahead and use them to\nhelp us talk about this whole example of\n\n502\n00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:12.140\nusing a private key, or\nwhat's called symmetric key encryption.\n\n503\n00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:14.020\nAre we going to be able\nto zoom in just a touch?\n\n504\n00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.780\nSo we're going to zoom\nin just a little bit.\n\n505\n00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:16.410\n>> Maybe not.\n\n506\n00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.280\n>> As soon as we get the diagram back.\n\n507\n00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:19.150\nSo give us just a second.\n\n508\n00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:20.730\nThis is live TV, after all, folks.\n\n509\n00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:21.830\nSo we want to make sure.\n\n510\n00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:23.060\nThere we go.\nBob and Alice.\n\n511\n00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:23.560\nAlright.\nSo,\n\n512\n00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.460\nyou'll see Alice on the left-hand\nside of the diagram.\n\n513\n00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.000\nAnd Alice has a document there.\n\n514\n00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.790\nA little piece of paper, It's in blue.\n\n515\n00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:33.870\nAnd the key that is in the circle below,\nin blue,\n\n516\n00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.010\nis going to represent\nAlice's private key or\n\n517\n00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:40.605\nher symmetric key, that key is going to\nbe used by Alice to encrypt the message.\n\n518\n00:24:40.605 --> 00:24:44.665\nThe message is sent across the wire, the\nwhite arrow horizontally moving towards\n\n519\n00:24:44.665 --> 00:24:46.795\nBob, is not a laser targeting site,\n\n520\n00:24:46.795 --> 00:24:50.155\nbut rather, it's actually Alice\nmoving the data over to Bob.\n\n521\n00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:52.315\nIf Bob pisses her off,\nhowever, that may change.\n\n522\n00:24:52.315 --> 00:24:56.105\nBut for now it's just Alice transmitting\nthe message over to Bob, and so\n\n523\n00:24:56.105 --> 00:24:57.715\nBob is going to receive the message, but\n\n524\n00:24:57.715 --> 00:25:02.670\nthe problem is if Bob receives the message\nbut doesn't have a copy of Alice's key,\n\n525\n00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:07.070\nBob cannot effectively use the message,\nhe can only observe the cipher text.\n\n526\n00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:11.860\nSo you'll see a secondary arrow that kind\nof arcs underneath the message sent and\n\n527\n00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:12.980\nit's heading towards Bob.\n\n528\n00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.990\nAnd that is Alice figuring out how to\ntransmit her private key to Bob, but\n\n529\n00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:18.800\nshe is transmitting that out of band.\n\n530\n00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.320\nMeaning, she has separated the key from\nthe message and not send the two together,\n\n531\n00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.690\nbecause if she sent the two together,\nthen the attacker down there\n\n532\n00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.840\nwould could potentially intercept\nthe message would also get the key.\n\n533\n00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.110\nThe red arrows indicate that the attacker\nis trying to siphon off the information.\n\n534\n00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.120\nBad attacked, right?\n\n535\n00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:36.880\nWe shouldn't let the attacker do that.\n\n536\n00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.430\nSo if the attacker gets the message,\nin this example the attacker may get\n\n537\n00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:45.590\nthe encrypted message, but because they\ndon't get the key along with the message,\n\n538\n00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:48.680\nthey may not be able to actually\ndecipher the message and read it.\n\n539\n00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:50.960\nWhich is a good thing even\nthough they stole it.\n\n540\n00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.510\nWhen we send the key out of band, when we\ntransmit it separately, we are ensuring,\n\n541\n00:25:55.510 --> 00:26:00.080\nwe are taking additional steps to try to\nensure, that the key will stay secure.\n\n542\n00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.060\nThis is what we need to do when we use\nprivate key or symmetric key systems.\n\n543\n00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.490\nBecause if we separate the key and\n\n544\n00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:09.000\nthe data, it is far less likely\nthat the two will be compromised.\n\n545\n00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.840\nBut the challenges still remains how does\nAlice securely transmit the key to Bob?\n\n546\n00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.300\nDoes she walk it over there to Bob?\n\n547\n00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.110\nShe may.\n\n548\n00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:17.660\nThat may be one way to do it.\n\n549\n00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:22.100\nShe could send the key via a different\nmethod, such as maybe a text message or\n\n550\n00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.610\nmaybe she could send it on\na little sticky note, and\n\n551\n00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:27.840\nshe could give it to somebody,\ndeliver to Bob.\n\n552\n00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:32.820\nShe may put it on a, who knows,\na USB drive and give it to Bob.\n\n553\n00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:36.650\nDifferent ways to do that, but the reality\nis that at the end of the day all of those\n\n554\n00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.830\ncarry potential liabilities\nassociated with them.\n\n555\n00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:42.185\nSomebody can intercept one or\nmore of those transmission mechanisms and\n\n556\n00:26:42.185 --> 00:26:44.185\nthey would, of course, then have the key.\n\n557\n00:26:44.185 --> 00:26:46.335\nSo we have to figure out\nhow to safeguard the key.\n\n558\n00:26:46.335 --> 00:26:48.615\nThis is the key, no pun intended,\n\n559\n00:26:48.615 --> 00:26:53.785\nthe key challenge with symmetric systems\nis how do we send the key securely.\n\n560\n00:26:53.785 --> 00:26:56.915\nSo this is what we call out\nof key band distribution.\n\n561\n00:26:56.915 --> 00:27:00.635\nSo we want to just be thinking about\nthe fact that we have to send out a band,\n\n562\n00:27:00.635 --> 00:27:01.795\nwe have two goals.\n\n563\n00:27:01.795 --> 00:27:05.960\nOne is to send the data securely and\nif the attacker is able to compromise\n\n564\n00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:10.610\nthe data stream, we then have to separate\nthe key transmission from the message\n\n565\n00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.400\ntransmission to ensure the attacker\ndoesn't get both at the same time.\n\n566\n00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.830\nThe other goal here is key management,\nensuring that the key is kept securely.\n\n567\n00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.410\nSo once Alice gives it to Bob,\nbecause that's only half the battle,\n\n568\n00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:26.790\nBob now has to keep the copy of the key\nsecure and make sure it's not exposed just\n\n569\n00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:30.420\nlike Alice does, because if anybody gets\nthe key they could read all the messages\n\n570\n00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.240\nthat have ever been sent with the key,\nor ever will be sent with the key,\n\n571\n00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:38.020\nbecause all of the messages are encrypted\nwith the same key all the time.\n\n572\n00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.510\nSo this is obviously is going to provide\nsome interesting thought process for\n\n573\n00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.610\nus in terms of how do we achieve this.\n\n574\n00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:46.580\nBut it is also going to potentially\nlead to some complications for\n\n575\n00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.770\nus if we're not spot on with making\nsure this is done the right way.\n\n576\n00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:54.390\nSo some things to think about,\nthis out-of-band key transmission.\n\n577\n00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:55.480\nNow we may use one or\n\n578\n00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.270\nmore encryption algorithms to\nbe able to achieve encryption.\n\n579\n00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.850\nDES I've mentioned before,\nthe Data Encryption Standard,\n\n580\n00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:05.140\nis one of the most common ones, it's been\naround for almost forever and a day.\n\n581\n00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.660\nIt's been around since the 1970's,\ncertainly.\n\n582\n00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.100\nBut as of the last several years,\nDES has really fallen out of favor.\n\n583\n00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:14.130\nBecause it's been around long enough,\nas an algorithm,\n\n584\n00:28:14.130 --> 00:28:17.230\nthat the modern technology we\nhave in terms of computing power\n\n585\n00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.890\nhas finally caught up with\nour ability to use DES.\n\n586\n00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.430\nAnd it was recommended several years ago\nthat we no longer use DES formally for\n\n587\n00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.280\nencryption, at least for something that\nhas to be kept safeguarded and secure with\n\n588\n00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:32.040\nconfidentiality assured for a period of\ntime, because DES can be compromised.\n\n589\n00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.550\nWe've moved to what's known as AES,\nthe Advanced Encryption Standard,\n\n590\n00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.980\nwhich is a newer protocol that is\ngoing to be stronger and as a result,\n\n591\n00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.980\nwill last longer ultimately.\n\n592\n00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:44.890\nDES is often referred to as\na 64 bit length algorithm,\n\n593\n00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.160\nwhere it uses 64 bit key.\n\n594\n00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.880\nBut that's not really true because\nwhat desk does is it ignores every\n\n595\n00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.100\neighth bit in the 64-bit key.\n\n596\n00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.550\nAnd so effectively, eight bits right?\n\n597\n00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:00.750\nIgnore the eighth bit.\n\n598\n00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.130\nEight bits times eight, 64 bits.\n\n599\n00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.790\nWe effectively ignore\neight bits in the DES key.\n\n600\n00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.730\nAnd what that means is although it\nis overall a 64 bit implementation,\n\n601\n00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:13.990\nDES is really considered to\nbe a 56 bit true algorithm,\n\n602\n00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:17.260\nmeaning it is actually\nrun as a 56 bit solution.\n\n603\n00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:22.160\nSo DES by itself, what we call single\nDES or just DES, is a 56 bit algorithm.\n\n604\n00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.240\nDouble DES, which was around for a little\nbit but really wasn't very popular,\n\n605\n00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.970\ndidn't really catch on, would've\nbeen 56 bits times two, or 112 bits.\n\n606\n00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:32.980\nTriple desk which is what you\nwould normally know of as DES, you\n\n607\n00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:37.150\nwould see three dash DES, which is what we\ncall triple DES when you pull down you're\n\n608\n00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:41.230\nencryption options in your application and\napply one or more of these algorithms.\n\n609\n00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:45.450\nWhen you choose triple DES,\nyou're choosing 56 bits times three or\n\n610\n00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.800\n168 bit encryption solution.\n\n611\n00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.760\nSo that's how DES actually operates.\n\n612\n00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.550\nIt's a 64 bit overall, but\na 56 bit actual algorithm.\n\n613\n00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:55.390\nI think I said 56 bit true earlier.\n\n614\n00:29:55.390 --> 00:30:00.040\nIt was actually 64 bit, but then reduced\ndown to a 56 bit implementation based on\n\n615\n00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.230\nignoring every eighth\nbit in the key streams.\n\n616\n00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:03.320\nJust be aware of that.\n\n617\n00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.870\nLittle geek trivia there for\nyou, in case you're interested.\n\n618\n00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:09.390\nSomebody stops you on the road later and\nsays hey, do you know many bits in DES?\n\n619\n00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:10.530\nYou can say actual or true?\n\n620\n00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:11.060\n>> That's right?\n\n621\n00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.790\n>> You can decide and throw them\na curve ball, and see what they now.\n\n622\n00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.030\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n623\n00:30:16.156 --> 00:30:19.050\nWe also want to know that CCMP,\n\n624\n00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:22.690\nCounter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining\nMessage Authentication Code Protocol.\n\n625\n00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.770\nHad to look that one up,\nbecause I can't remember the whole stream.\n\n626\n00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:27.760\nCCMP, I'm just throwing it out there\nas a little reference for you.\n\n627\n00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:32.070\nCCMP is going to be found as\nan authentication protocol in 802.11i\n\n628\n00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:33.420\nwireless standards.\n\n629\n00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.200\nSo if you ever come across CCMP,\n\n630\n00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.330\nyou just want to equate that\nwith wireless authentication.\n\n631\n00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:39.960\nThat's an authentication protocol, and\n\n632\n00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.490\nan encryption solution that is\nused with wireless technologies.\n\n633\n00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:44.470\nSo I just want to make sure\nwe're aware of that one.\n\n634\n00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.630\nI did mention AES, AES has another name.\n\n635\n00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:52.450\nAdvanced Encryption Standard is the\nbranded name, the marketed name, for AES.\n\n636\n00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:54.050\nOr rather, for the algorithm.\n\n637\n00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:56.690\nThe algorithm is actually\ncalled the Rijndael Algorithm.\n\n638\n00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.840\nSo if you hear either one,\nyou just want to equate the two together.\n\n639\n00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.210\nRijndael is the formal\nname of the algorithm,\n\n640\n00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:05.270\nAES is the rebranded name\nthat it's marketed under.\n\n641\n00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:09.125\nBut AES or Rijndael is a variable\nbit strength algorithm.\n\n642\n00:31:09.125 --> 00:31:12.277\nIt can run at 128, 192,\nor 256 bit strength.\n\n643\n00:31:12.277 --> 00:31:17.147\nIt's a variable strength algorithm,\nwhich is what makes it stronger and will\n\n644\n00:31:17.147 --> 00:31:22.960\nobviously now allow it to replace DES,\nbecause DES is fixed, it runs at 56 bits.\n\n645\n00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.270\nYou implement DES and\ntriple DES, you get 168 bits.\n\n646\n00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.340\nYou implement AES you choose 128,\n192, or 256,\n\n647\n00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:32.660\nbased on how you choose to\nimplement the algorithm.\n\n648\n00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.630\nSo we just want to make sure\nwe're aware of that and\n\n649\n00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.050\nwe're thinking about that as well.\n\n650\n00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:39.180\nWe have a couple of other algorithms,\njust that we want to go over quickly.\n\n651\n00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.650\nCouple, as I do two here.\n\n652\n00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:42.400\nDown below it's like the pitcher sign.\n\n653\n00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.170\nTo the far left for the fast ball.\n\n654\n00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.380\nSo we have idea.\n\n655\n00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:48.500\nIdeas referred to as international\ndata encryption algorithm.\n\n656\n00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.720\nRemember, you don't have to\nknow what the algorithm names,\n\n657\n00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:54.120\nthe what do we call the short name?\n\n658\n00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.150\nThe-\n>> The acronyms?\n\n659\n00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.210\n>> They are, thank you very much.\n\n660\n00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:56.862\nThe acronyms.\n\n661\n00:31:56.862 --> 00:31:58.953\nI was running out of room up here,\nI had no more storage left.\n\n662\n00:31:58.953 --> 00:31:59.792\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The acronyms.\n\n663\n00:31:59.792 --> 00:32:01.326\nYou don't have to know the acronyms,\nright?\n\n664\n00:32:01.326 --> 00:32:02.953\nWe're not going to make\nyou know what they are.\n\n665\n00:32:02.953 --> 00:32:03.930\nYou don't have to memorize them.\n\n666\n00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.159\nIf we use the modern exam,\nwe always spell them out.\n\n667\n00:32:06.159 --> 00:32:08.250\nAnd I think I've cautioned you\nabout this at least once before.\n\n668\n00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:09.350\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n669\n00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:15.570\nSo idea is a 128 bit key solution,\nand operates on 64 bit blocks of data.\n\n670\n00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.980\nSo idea as an algorithm is\n128 bit key algorithm, but\n\n671\n00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:21.850\nit operates as a block algorithm,\n64 bit blocks.\n\n672\n00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:23.590\nSo we just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n673\n00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:26.500\nCAST is another algorithm that's\nout there you may hear about.\n\n674\n00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.660\nCAST is commonly called CAST-128.\n\n675\n00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:33.230\nIt is gonna use keys anywhere\nbetween 40 to 128 bits in size.\n\n676\n00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:37.220\nSo it's a variable level or\nvariable strength key algorithm, and\n\n677\n00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.720\nit is going to be, depending on how\nyou set it up, weaker or stronger,\n\n678\n00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.610\ndepending on the size of the key.\n\n679\n00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:45.450\nObviously, closer to 128,\nthe stronger the algorithm is.\n\n680\n00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:48.300\nWe also have Safer,\nSafer's another one that's out there.\n\n681\n00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:51.350\nSafer is actually gonna\nbe the only algorithm,\n\n682\n00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.730\none of the only ones that's out there now,\nthat's patent free.\n\n683\n00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:56.670\nMeaning it's open source, and you can\nuse it without having to effectively\n\n684\n00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:59.420\npay somebody for it's use, so\nthat's kind of interesting.\n\n685\n00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.370\nThat's a little tidbit on Safer.\n\n686\n00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:04.900\nWe have Blowfish and Two Fish, I think\nyou've heard me mention them as well.\n\n687\n00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.030\nBlowfish is gonna be interesting.\n\n688\n00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:10.510\nIts claim to fame is that it can be\nimplemented in as little as 5k of memory.\n\n689\n00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:14.250\nSo Blowfish is often used in\nmobile devices because the memory\n\n690\n00:33:14.250 --> 00:33:15.430\nrequirements are so small.\n\n691\n00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:19.110\nSo you see it in cellphones a lot, and\nthe wireless devices that have very small\n\n692\n00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.440\namounts of memory onboard\nare gonna use this.\n\n693\n00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.080\nIt operates with a variable\nkey size anywhere\n\n694\n00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.850\nfrom 32 bits all the way up to 448 bits,\nwhich is what Blowfish does.\n\n695\n00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:33.070\nTwo Fish is effectively going to be\na variable block size is, excuse me,\n\n696\n00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.770\nvariable key size as well.\n\n697\n00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:37.390\nIt was actually one of\nthe competitors that lost out to\n\n698\n00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:40.330\nAES to region doll to become\nthe new replacement for DES.\n\n699\n00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:42.080\nIt's also a variable key size.\n\n700\n00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.580\n128, 192, or\n256 bit keys with a 128 bit block.\n\n701\n00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:50.290\nAnd so\nwe just want to be aware of that as well.\n\n702\n00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:54.630\nNow we have RC4, RC5, the RC series\nof algorithms, also very popular.\n\n703\n00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:56.220\nYou may have heard of them.\n\n704\n00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.890\nRC5 can run up to a 2,040 bit key.\n\n705\n00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:04.542\nVery, very big key, a very large key, so\nthat's obviously going to be very secure.\n\n706\n00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:05.865\nRC4 is going to run on 128 bit key.\n\n707\n00:34:05.865 --> 00:34:08.350\nSo we just want to make\nsure we are aware of that.\n\n708\n00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:12.600\nRC4's claim to fame,\nwe'll finish up with this one.\n\n709\n00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:17.560\nRC4's claim to fame, is that it actually,\nstill is, the algorithm the underlies\n\n710\n00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.130\nthe implementation of WEP\nin wireless solutions.\n\n711\n00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:23.530\nBut if you know anything about WEP,\nyou are probably laughing right now.\n\n712\n00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:25.990\nYou don't want to know\nthat cuz that sucks,\n\n713\n00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:29.560\nwe never use use that, but\npeople don't really understand that what\n\n714\n00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:33.880\nwent horribly wrong with WEP\nwas not that WEP was bad,\n\n715\n00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:38.450\nit was just that WEP's implementation\nof RC4 was done incorrectly.\n\n716\n00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:42.320\nAnd as a result of that, RC4 itself is a\nvery secure algorithm still used today and\n\n717\n00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.590\nis very, very common, but the way it\nwas chosen to be implemented within\n\n718\n00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:48.580\nthe WEP solution is what\nactually screwed up WEP.\n\n719\n00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.910\nBecause the implementor was such a short\nkey space, such a small number of keys,\n\n720\n00:34:51.910 --> 00:34:55.622\nthat the keys actually repeated so quickly\nthat we're able to find a pattern and\n\n721\n00:34:55.622 --> 00:34:58.110\nultimately break\nthe cryptographic solution.\n\n722\n00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:01.860\nSo RC4's claim to fame, erroneously,\nis that it's associated with WEP.\n\n723\n00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.940\nBut actually it's still a very\nstrong protocol overall, 128 bits.\n\n724\n00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:08.480\nSo just quickly, by way of closing up.\n\n725\n00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.490\nWhen I've talked about the bit strength,\nthe key strength, for instance,\n\n726\n00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:12.110\nof an algorithm.\n\n727\n00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.580\nI've talked about the block\nsize in some cases.\n\n728\n00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:17.530\nThat obviously is important information\nif we'd have through the trouble.\n\n729\n00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:21.380\nAnd I've gone through the time and\nexpense it takes to bring that to you.\n\n730\n00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.080\nSo, what I'm getting at is if I've said,\nfor instance,\n\n731\n00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.420\nRC4 is a 128 bit key algorithm,\nor that Two Fish\n\n732\n00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:33.070\nis a variable key algorithm that runs on\ndifferent key levels or key strengths,\n\n733\n00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:36.340\nyou should probably take note of that,\ngo back and make sure you review that.\n\n734\n00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.910\nMake some notes on that,\nmake sure you're aware of that.\n\n735\n00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:41.510\nThat may help you at\nsome point in the future\n\n736\n00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:45.620\nwhen you are being asked questions about\nhow these solutions may be implemented.\n\n737\n00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:48.050\n>> Very good Adam, that's again,\na lot of information.\n\n738\n00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:50.590\nGreat look at encryption,\nsome of the history of encryption,\n\n739\n00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.490\nand then a lot of the different algorithms\nthat we need to be familiar with.\n\n740\n00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:56.450\nAnd you said that the block sizes and\nthe key links, or\n\n741\n00:35:56.450 --> 00:35:58.750\nthe possible key links\nif they're variable.\n\n742\n00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:59.920\nVery good stuff.\n\n743\n00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:02.080\nWe talked about out of band and\nwe did have a really good question.\n\n744\n00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:05.340\nI know we're getting short on time, but\nin the chat room we haven't really gotten\n\n745\n00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.620\nheavily into asymmetric yet, but I wanted\nto go ahead and answer that question.\n\n746\n00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:13.440\nJohn asked does an asymmetric solve the\nproblem of out of band key distribution?\n\n747\n00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:16.282\n>> Well you said you were gonna answer it-\n\n748\n00:36:16.282 --> 00:36:16.811\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'm gonna stand by and wait for you\n\n749\n00:36:16.811 --> 00:36:19.400\nto tell John what the answer is.\n>> I mean we.\n\n750\n00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.050\nI'm gonna tell him yes, but\nI think he wants you to.\n\n751\n00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:22.890\n>> That was the royal you as opposed to,\nright?\n\n752\n00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.500\n>> Yes.\n>> That was the royal we meaning I\n\n753\n00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.030\nam gonna answer that question.\n\n754\n00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.600\nGot it.\n\n755\n00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.835\nThank you very much.\n\n756\n00:36:27.835 --> 00:36:28.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yes.\n\n757\n00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:29.820\nSo, John, absolutely.\n\n758\n00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:30.580\nThat's a great question.\n\n759\n00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:34.260\nSo, asymmetric encryption, we'll talk\nabout this in an upcoming episode.\n\n760\n00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:38.710\nBut, quickly, asymmetric encryption,\npublic private key pair encryption is\n\n761\n00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:43.370\ngonna help solve the transmission problem\nwithout a band key distribution, but\n\n762\n00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.280\nit's not as simple as it sounds.\n\n763\n00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.520\nAnd so, we're gonna talk about how\nthat works and why we can do that.\n\n764\n00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.710\nBut, how we're gonna effectively\ncome together, if you will, and\n\n765\n00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.260\ncreate what's called a hybrid solution.\n\n766\n00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.500\nWe're gonna take a look at how that works.\n\n767\n00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.020\nWe got a nifty little diagram for\nyou coming up.\n\n768\n00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:00.375\nMike's been busy scripting and sketching\naway there while I've been talking.\n\n769\n00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:00.990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n770\n00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:02.810\nwe're gonna show you that\nin an upcoming episode.\n\n771\n00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:04.340\n>> Fantastic, all right,\nthank you Adam and\n\n772\n00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.500\nthen that should answer\nDavid's question as well.\n\n773\n00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:07.910\nYes, those are my stick figures.\n\n774\n00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:11.070\nSo [LAUGH] all right ladies and gentlemen,\nwe hope you enjoyed that episode.\n\n775\n00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:14.534\nRemember If you guys want to attend one\nof Adam's classes, shoot us an email.\n\n776\n00:37:14.534 --> 00:37:17.028\nSeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n777\n00:37:17.028 --> 00:37:18.350\nThat's going to to it for this one.\n\n778\n00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:19.170\nWe'll see you soon.\n\n779\n00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:19.870\nI'm signing off.\n\n780\n00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:20.880\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n781\n00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:21.745\n>> I'm Adam

--> 00:00:19.540\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\ntoday we're doing our CISSP,\n\n4\n00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.220\nand specifically,\nwe've been dealing with assessing and\n\n5\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.580\nmitigating vulnerabilities within\nour system's architecture.\n\n6\n00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.180\nAnd we've really been talking\na lot about encryption and\n\n7\n00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.700\nsome of the vocabulary necessary\nto truly get a good grasp and\n\n8\n00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.610\nunderstanding of encryption,\nas well as some examples.\n\n9\n00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.950\nWe've gone through some\nsymmetric encryption algorithms.\n\n10\n00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.810\nAnd now we're gonna continue on and move\non into the world of some of the other\n\n11\n00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.950\ntypes of encryption algorithms, and of\ncourse, here with us is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.320\nHow're you doing, Adam?\n\n13\n00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.015\n>> I'm asymmetrically challenged today,\nhow are you doing?\n\n14\n00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:52.110\n>> [LAUGH] I'm doing good.\n\n15\n00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.650\n>> Awesome.\n\n16\n00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.270\nSo, we're gonna take about\nasymmetric encryption algorithms.\n\n17\n00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:56.520\nThat's what we're gonna\nstart talking about.\n\n18\n00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.570\nWe did a pretty good thorough run\nthrough as Mike had just summarized for\n\n19\n00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.940\nus on not just encryption overall,\nin the last couple of episodes,\n\n20\n00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.820\na lot of the language,\nof course, vocabulary.\n\n21\n00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.960\nBut we just spent some time in the last\nepisode, talking about symmetric\n\n22\n00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.200\nencryption, how that works, block and\nstream ciphers, how those work.\n\n23\n00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.710\nPut up Alice and Bob,\nwe invited them out for lunch.\n\n24\n00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.520\nThey said they'd come and\ndo a little thing for us.\n\n25\n00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.870\nWe're gonna invite them\nback in a little while.\n\n26\n00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.780\nYou're gonna see them again,\n\n27\n00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.800\nwe're gonna do some more work with them,\ntalk about asymmetric algorithms.\n\n28\n00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.190\nSo let's start by defining\nwhat asymmetric is or\n\n29\n00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.460\nreminding ourselves of what\nasymmetric algorithms are.\n\n30\n00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.190\nSymmetric algorithms are single key or\nprivate key solutions.\n\n31\n00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.320\nAsymmetric are public private key or\nkey pair solutions,\n\n32\n00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.310\nand we wanna make sure we understand that\nwhen we use an asymmetric solution or\n\n33\n00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.500\nan asymmetric algorithm,\nwe're talking about a key pair.\n\n34\n00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.340\nSo what we wanna do in our mind\nas we start thinking about this\n\n35\n00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.770\nis think about the fact that\nwhen we have a symmetric system,\n\n36\n00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.470\na private key only,\nour biggest challenge is key management.\n\n37\n00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.460\nHow do we safeguard the private key?\n\n38\n00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.130\nHow do we, in theory, through out of\nband communication, as we talked about.\n\n39\n00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.400\nAnd Alice and Bob helped us to show you\nhow do we transmit the key securely, but\n\n40\n00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.800\nalso then focus on keeping it\nsecure once Bob gets a hold of it.\n\n41\n00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.680\nSo that's a bit of a challenge.\n\n42\n00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.450\nAnd so what we're gonna now do is\nintroduce the idea of asymmetric\n\n43\n00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.150\nencryption, public private key pairs.\n\n44\n00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.500\nWe're gonna differentiate between what the\nprivate key and or the public key can or\n\n45\n00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.630\ncannot be used to do.\n\n46\n00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.010\nAnd then depending on whose key and\n\n47\n00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.540\nwhat key, we're then gonna talk about\nwhat we can effectively achieve.\n\n48\n00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.650\nBut because of the fact\nwe have a key pair,\n\n49\n00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.760\nwe also have a different approach that we\nneed to think about and understand here,\n\n50\n00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.700\nbecause now the risk\nis a little different.\n\n51\n00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.950\nThe risk is not,\ncan I keep the private key secure?\n\n52\n00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.116\nThe risk is now, if I transmit the key,\n\n53\n00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:39.212\nwhich key am I transmitting\nusing what functionality?\n\n54\n00:02:39.212 --> 00:02:41.675\nAnd if I use that key,\nis it going to be exposed and\n\n55\n00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:43.671\npotentially break confidentiality?\n\n56\n00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:46.323\nAnd the answer is obviously if\nwe make the right choices, no,\n\n57\n00:02:46.323 --> 00:02:49.665\nif we make the wrong choices,\nthen obviously we have some trouble.\n\n58\n00:02:49.665 --> 00:02:52.125\nSo, we're gonna go back to our\ndiagrams here with Alice and Bob.\n\n59\n00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:56.897\nWe're gonna take a look at how we can\nactually now use public key cryptography.\n\n60\n00:02:56.897 --> 00:03:00.967\nSo asymmetric cryptography to\nsend a confidential message.\n\n61\n00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:04.287\nSo the same thought process we\nhave with symmetric systems,\n\n62\n00:03:04.287 --> 00:03:09.107\nwhere Alice is trying to send\na message securely over to Bob, right?\n\n63\n00:03:09.107 --> 00:03:11.632\nBut instead of using Alice's private key,\n\n64\n00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:16.127\nwe're gonna see that we're gonna\nactually use a different solution.\n\n65\n00:03:16.127 --> 00:03:18.317\nSo are we gonna zoom in just a little,\nor are we gonna stay there?\n\n66\n00:03:18.317 --> 00:03:18.878\nWhat do you-\n>> Sure.\n\n67\n00:03:18.878 --> 00:03:20.435\n>> Thank you, Mr. Key Master there.\n\n68\n00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:24.000\nSo, we're gonna zoom in just a touch,\nand what we're gonna see is that Alice,\n\n69\n00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.760\non the left hand side of the diagram,\nhas both her public, and her private key.\n\n70\n00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.210\nHer private key is in red in\nthis particular example, and\n\n71\n00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.680\nthe public key is in green.\n\n72\n00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.010\nIt's in the little dialogue box there, or\n\n73\n00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.580\nlittle text box that has some\nlines associated with it.\n\n74\n00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.310\nWe're actually representing that as\na certificate tied with the public key.\n\n75\n00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.670\nBut the idea is that green is public,\nred is private.\n\n76\n00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.556\nAnd so when Alice wants to send\na secure message over to Bob,\n\n77\n00:03:47.556 --> 00:03:50.170\nAlice has to choose what key to use.\n\n78\n00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.310\nBut if Alice sends with one of her keys,\nshe effectively is not gonna\n\n79\n00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.340\nbe able to send the message securely\nto Bob, and let's talk about why.\n\n80\n00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.030\nRemember, we're trying to\nsend a confidential message.\n\n81\n00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.210\nWe're focusing on confidentiality,\nie, we're focusing on making sure\n\n82\n00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.720\nthe message is encrypted so nobody can see\nit unless they have a key to decrypt it.\n\n83\n00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.930\nIf Alice uses her public key in\norder to send the message to Bob and\n\n84\n00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.000\nencrypts the message with her public key,\nthe only key that could decrypt\n\n85\n00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.180\nthe message is the corresponding key\npair equivalent or the private key.\n\n86\n00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.070\nSo in effect,\n\n87\n00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.450\nwhat Alice would have to do is figure out\nhow to transmit her private key to Bob.\n\n88\n00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.500\nWell, now we're back\nto a symmetric system,\n\n89\n00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.900\nwe're back to the whole idea of key\nmanagement and out of band communication.\n\n90\n00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.230\nAnd for all that trouble,\n\n91\n00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.260\nAlice might as well just've gone with\na symmetric key in the first place.\n\n92\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.740\nIt would have been much easier.\n\n93\n00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.600\nIf Alice uses her private key to encrypt\nthe message, which she could do in theory\n\n94\n00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.290\nas well, then the corresponding key pair,\nthe matching key, can decrypt the message.\n\n95\n00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.000\nWell, that may sound like it makes sense,\nthat's Alice's public key.\n\n96\n00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.230\nWouldn't that make sense?\n\n97\n00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.280\nWell, in theory it does, but\n\n98\n00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.888\nonly if you want everybody in\nthe world to read Alice's message.\n\n99\n00:05:01.888 --> 00:05:05.890\nBecause what will happen is,\nthe public key is made available, ie,\n\n100\n00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.960\npublic key, publicly available,\n\n101\n00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.172\nmeaning it is widely distributed and\navailable to anybody who wants it.\n\n102\n00:05:12.172 --> 00:05:17.168\nAgain, typically, remember keys\nare stored in the directory service more\n\n103\n00:05:17.168 --> 00:05:22.163\noften than not or on key servers,\nKMS key management servers in some cases,\n\n104\n00:05:22.163 --> 00:05:25.379\nor in public key cloud\nservers in the case of PGP.\n\n105\n00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:28.651\nThere's different ways keys may\nbe stored and distributed, but\n\n106\n00:05:28.651 --> 00:05:30.920\nultimately public keys\nare not kept secure.\n\n107\n00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.109\nThey're widely distributed, so as a result\nof that, if Alice uses her private key to\n\n108\n00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:41.590\nencrypt the message, anybody with a copy\nof her public key can decrypt the message.\n\n109\n00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.545\nSo Alice is running out of\noptions here really quickly,\n\n110\n00:05:44.545 --> 00:05:46.680\nstarting out to be a bad day for Alice.\n\n111\n00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.573\nSo what we have to do instead\nis take a different approach.\n\n112\n00:05:49.573 --> 00:05:51.316\nAnd what we're gonna do, and\n\n113\n00:05:51.316 --> 00:05:54.850\nas you can see at the top of\nthe little area there where the arrow\n\n114\n00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.050\nis pointing down from to hit the message,\nwe're gonna use one of Bob's keys.\n\n115\n00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.160\nSo Alice is gonna go out and\nget Bob's public key.\n\n116\n00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.328\nBecause if Alice uses Bob's public\nkey to encrypt the message, again,\n\n117\n00:06:06.328 --> 00:06:08.388\npublic keys are freely available.\n\n118\n00:06:08.388 --> 00:06:13.262\nIf she uses Bob's public key,\nthe only corresponding key that can\n\n119\n00:06:13.262 --> 00:06:17.267\ndecrypt a public key encrypted\nmessage is the pair, or\n\n120\n00:06:17.267 --> 00:06:21.288\nthe joined key in that pair,\nwhich is the private key.\n\n121\n00:06:21.288 --> 00:06:22.581\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n122\n00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:26.490\nBob's private key will have to\nbe used to decrypt the message.\n\n123\n00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.434\nSo if Alice sends the message\nusing Bob's public key,\n\n124\n00:06:29.434 --> 00:06:32.890\nthe only key that can decrypt\nthe message is Bob's private key.\n\n125\n00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:37.785\nThis is how we would send a cryptographic\nmessage using public private key or\n\n126\n00:06:37.785 --> 00:06:41.620\nasymmetric cryptography to\nsend a confidential message.\n\n127\n00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.234\nTo effectively encrypt the email and\nsend it to Bob securely,\n\n128\n00:06:45.234 --> 00:06:47.550\nwe would use Bob's public key.\n\n129\n00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.230\nNow the attacker is down\nthere at the bottom,\n\n130\n00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.900\nbecause he's always lurking somewhere.\n\n131\n00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.660\nRight?\n\n132\n00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.920\nAnd the attacker can try\nto steal the message.\n\n133\n00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.020\nWe talked about that.\n\n134\n00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.740\nThe attacker may be able to\nsiphon off the message, but\n\n135\n00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.830\nif the message was encrypted\nwith Bob's public key,\n\n136\n00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.490\nthe only thing he's gonna get is\nthe encrypted message, the cipher text.\n\n137\n00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.720\nWell, okay,\nwe would prefer he not have it, but\n\n138\n00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.720\nthe reality is we don't care, because\nwithout Bob's private key, that cipher\n\n139\n00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.010\ntext is useless to the attacker cuz he or\nshe can't read anything.\n\n140\n00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:19.240\nAll they can see is just\nthe encrypted cipher text, that's it.\n\n141\n00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.650\nSo we've effectively safeguarded\nthe transmission as a result of that,\n\n142\n00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.000\nwhich is a good thing.\n\n143\n00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.260\nNow what we wanna look at next is\nhow we use public key cryptography\n\n144\n00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:31.170\nto send a message with what's\ncalled proof of origin.\n\n145\n00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:31.919\nProof of origin.\n\n146\n00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.580\nSo now what we're gonna do is, again,\nwe're gonna use Alice and Bob, all right,\n\n147\n00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.400\nwe've contracted with them for the whole\nday, so they're gonna be here all day.\n\n148\n00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:39.970\nAll right?\n\n149\n00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:40.478\nI'm here all week.\n\n150\n00:07:40.478 --> 00:07:41.793\nThank you, thank you very much.\n\n151\n00:07:41.793 --> 00:07:44.470\nAll right, so, Alice,\nright, Alice on the left.\n\n152\n00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.070\nAlice again has her\npublic private key pair.\n\n153\n00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.296\nSo remember, red key is private,\ngreen key is public.\n\n154\n00:07:50.296 --> 00:07:55.962\nSo you'll see that Alice is gonna use\nher private key to be able to do what?\n\n155\n00:07:55.962 --> 00:08:00.628\nAre we Encrypting the message, or\nare we digitally signing the message?\n\n156\n00:08:00.628 --> 00:08:02.380\nAnd this is what we have to understand.\n\n157\n00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.140\nWhen we're using public key cryptography\nto send a message with proof of origin, we\n\n158\n00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:12.320\nare sending it and validating that Alice\nsent the message beyond reasonable doubt.\n\n159\n00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.130\nAnd what we are then doing\nis using Alice's private key\n\n160\n00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:20.070\nto digitally sign the message, and as\na result of digitally signing the message,\n\n161\n00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:24.330\nwe are creating a unique lock with\nAlice's identity and her private key.\n\n162\n00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.210\nBut keep in mind as we talked about\nearlier with the example with going\n\n163\n00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.760\nthrough originally and talking about\nit with Mike when we said well,\n\n164\n00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.210\nif Mike uses this kind of a key this way,\nhe may expose the key, but\n\n165\n00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.830\nif he does this this other way, he won't.\n\n166\n00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:41.120\nWell we made the distinction and said that\nwhen Alice or Mike use their private key\n\n167\n00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.760\nto sign, and we are effectively not using\nthe key to encrypt, but rather effectively\n\n168\n00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.840\nto hash and create an integrity check,\nand digitally sign the message.\n\n169\n00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.330\nWe are taking the body of the message,\nrunning it through a hashing algorithm\n\n170\n00:08:55.330 --> 00:09:00.070\nthat is using Alice's private key to\ngenerate a hash string out the back end.\n\n171\n00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.400\nThat hash becomes the digital signature,\n\n172\n00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.940\nit's effectively the signature\nattached to the email.\n\n173\n00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.440\nAs a result of that Alice can validate\nher identity, proof of origin.\n\n174\n00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.380\nBut, she's not exposing her key,\nbecause the key itself is not being sent.\n\n175\n00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:17.920\nWe're using the key to represent one\nelement of the cycle that's needed to\n\n176\n00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.780\neffectively create the signature.\n\n177\n00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.900\nSo, it's a component in the recipe but\n\n178\n00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.740\nit is not being used in a way\nthat it can be exposed.\n\n179\n00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.550\nAnd as a result of that, when we send the\nmessage over to Bob, Bob gets the message,\n\n180\n00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.000\nBob has to get a copy\nof Alice's public key.\n\n181\n00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.340\nHe can get that, and he can use the public\nkey to effectively re-sign the message,\n\n182\n00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.490\nrerunning it, comparing the output of\nthe hash when he runs with the public key.\n\n183\n00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.450\nFrom the original symmetry, the original\nhash, and the private key part\n\n184\n00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.410\nof the message, the two will match if\nBob gets the right public key pair.\n\n185\n00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.410\nIn other words,\nthe matching to Alice's private key.\n\n186\n00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:52.940\nAs a result of that,\n\n187\n00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.346\nwe can validate that Alice indeed\nwas the person who sent the message.\n\n188\n00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:59.310\nNow I did talk about the fact that we\ndon't really know for sure it was Alice,\n\n189\n00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.560\nwe know that Alice's key and\nher identity were used, but Alice may or\n\n190\n00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.350\nmay not have been the person that really\nwas there at the keyboard operating,\n\n191\n00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.270\nsending the message.\n\n192\n00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.600\nThat's okay, we're not worried about that\nportion of the discussion right now,\n\n193\n00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:15.560\nwhat we're more concerned with is\nunderstanding how a digital signature\n\n194\n00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.290\ncan use Alice's private key,\nthe sender's private key.\n\n195\n00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:24.230\nTo represent the identity without exposing\nthe private key, and allowing the public\n\n196\n00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:29.140\nkey pair, the match, to be used to\nvalidate the identity for proof of origin.\n\n197\n00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.480\nRight, this is what sending\na public key cryptographic message\n\n198\n00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.670\nwith proof of origin\nis going to look like.\n\n199\n00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:38.450\nNow, the next thing we wanna talk about\nis doing confidential message sent\n\n200\n00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.930\nwith proof of origin, in other words,\nwe're gonna combine the two things we just\n\n201\n00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.500\ntalked about, sending a message securely\nusing public private key encryption, and\n\n202\n00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.300\ndigitally signing a message\nto provide proof of origin\n\n203\n00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:50.980\nusing public private key encryption.\n\n204\n00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.860\nWe're gonna combine the two\ntogether effectively, right,\n\n205\n00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.920\nin order to be able to figure out how\nto send a message with encryption, but\n\n206\n00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.550\nalso use proof of origin at the same time.\n\n207\n00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.640\nNow because of the fact that obviously\nwhen we zoom out on the diagram,\n\n208\n00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.370\nit's probably gonna be a little\ndifficult for you to see the detail.\n\n209\n00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.420\nWe're gonna zoom in on the left\nhand side of the diagram first,\n\n210\n00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:10.950\nwe're gonna walk through that portion.\n\n211\n00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.620\nWe'll move over to the right when\nwe're done, and then we'll kinda zoom\n\n212\n00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.820\nback out and talk about what happens\nat the high level with everything.\n\n213\n00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.430\nSo let's start on the left with\nAlice getting ready to send to Bob.\n\n214\n00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.240\nAnd you'll see that\nAlice has her public and\n\n215\n00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.100\nprivate key, remember red is private,\ngreen is public.\n\n216\n00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.390\nAlice is gonna use a private key or\na public key, which one?\n\n217\n00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.740\nAnd we can see at the top she's\nusing a public key, but not her own.\n\n218\n00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:37.790\nShe's gonna use Bob's public key,\nthe recipient's public key\n\n219\n00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.540\nis gonna be used by the sender to\neffectively encrypt the message, right.\n\n220\n00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:47.550\nTo send the message with encryption, with\nconfidentially applied, as a result of\n\n221\n00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:52.090\ndoing that, what's then gonna happen is\nthat Bob when he receives the message\n\n222\n00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.964\ncan use his private key to match\nthe public key and decrypt the message.\n\n223\n00:11:55.964 --> 00:12:01.250\nSo the left hand side of the diagram\nis all about using the recipient's\n\n224\n00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:06.740\npublic key to make sure that we are\nsending the message with confidentiality.\n\n225\n00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.300\nNow we're gonna move to the right\nhand side of the diagram.\n\n226\n00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:16.800\nThe right-hand side is Alice being\nable to send a message over to Bob,\n\n227\n00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.540\nand Alice is going to create\nproof of origin for the send.\n\n228\n00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.960\nSo Alice is digitally signing with her\nprivate key, as we just discussed, and\n\n229\n00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.620\nshes sending a digitally\nsigned email over to Bob.\n\n230\n00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:29.990\nBob will be able to download effectively,\n\n231\n00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.980\nAlice's public key to\nvalidate the signature.\n\n232\n00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.250\nWhen we combine the two together,\nwhat we effectively then are seeing,\n\n233\n00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:42.050\nright, is that we can use both of\nthese systems in theory if we want to,\n\n234\n00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:46.720\nside by side indeed,\neffectively as part of the same solution,\n\n235\n00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:50.530\nto be able to achieve two\nvery specific end results.\n\n236\n00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:55.490\nIf we wanna be able to both, encrypt a\nmessage, send it with confidentiality, and\n\n237\n00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.410\ndigitally sign it, and\npotentially do both at the same time,\n\n238\n00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.210\nwe can engage in both activities,\nwe just have to use the right set of keys,\n\n239\n00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:07.140\nin order to be able to go through and\nexercise the right kind of operation.\n\n240\n00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.950\nSo for instance, in something\nlike Outlook, which is a MAPI,\n\n241\n00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.330\na full blown desktop based email client,\nor even a web based email client,\n\n242\n00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.730\ndepending on the nature of\nwhat kind of system you use.\n\n243\n00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:21.070\nYou typically have an option to\neither digitally sign, to encrypt or\n\n244\n00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.730\nboth, depending on the check off box or\nthe button you push or\n\n245\n00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:27.130\nwhatever it may be, based on\nthe particulars of the application.\n\n246\n00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:29.380\nSo as a result, if we choose both options,\n\n247\n00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.650\nwe are effectively both digitally signing,\nas well as encrypting the message.\n\n248\n00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.970\nWhat that means is that we're going to\nuse different keys to achieve different\n\n249\n00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.330\nresults, but combine the activities\ntogether in order to send and\n\n250\n00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.190\nreceive securely, and\nprovide proof of origin.\n\n251\n00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.870\nSo this is how we would do both together.\n\n252\n00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.569\nSo we just wanna keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that as well.\n\n253\n00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:53.870\nWe also want to go ahead and\ntalk about a hybrid solution.\n\n254\n00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:57.650\nAll right, I wanna make sure we\nare thinking about this idea, as we're\n\n255\n00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:01.997\nthinking about the hybrid solution,\nwhich is effectively gonna let us combine,\n\n256\n00:14:01.997 --> 00:14:06.218\nright, both solutions together effectively\nto be able to use both symmetric,\n\n257\n00:14:06.218 --> 00:14:07.930\nand asymmetric cryptography.\n\n258\n00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.307\nBecause, a lot of times,\nwhat we have to do,\n\n259\n00:14:10.307 --> 00:14:12.872\nis we have to use the best\nboth worlds in order to be\n\n260\n00:14:12.872 --> 00:14:16.710\nable to effectively get the desired\nresult, let me explain what I mean.\n\n261\n00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:21.160\nAnd this kind of goes back to John's\nquestion that he asked earlier in the chat\n\n262\n00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.020\nduring our last episode, when he asked,\n\n263\n00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:27.200\nhey, doesn't asymmetric encryption\neffectively solve the problem\n\n264\n00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.980\nof out of band communication and\nor symmetric key management.\n\n265\n00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.130\nAnd the answer was yes, but\nthe answer was yes, but stay tuned.\n\n266\n00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.810\nSo we can talk a little bit more\nfully about how that's gonna work, so\n\n267\n00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.410\nlet's actually walk\nthrough that right now.\n\n268\n00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:42.140\nSo you'll see that at the top\nof the diagram that we have\n\n269\n00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.770\na symmetric key in blue, and\nthis is gonna be Alice's symmetric key.\n\n270\n00:14:46.770 --> 00:14:49.920\nRight, a symmetric key that\nshe can use in this instance\n\n271\n00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.140\nto do symmetric based encryption.\n\n272\n00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.460\nNow what we're gonna do is we're gonna\ncombine symmetric and asymmetric together.\n\n273\n00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.980\nBut we're gonna have to walk\nthrough how that works, and\n\n274\n00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.920\nwe're gonna animate our diagram\na little bit along the way to do that.\n\n275\n00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.790\nMike's gonna help me out with this one and\n\n276\n00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:06.500\nhe's going to actually play\nthe part of the animator for us.\n\n277\n00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.020\nSo we're gonna start with\nthe symmetric key solution.\n\n278\n00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.190\nRemember symmetric are single key,\nprivate key only.\n\n279\n00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.100\nSo if Alice wants to bulk\nencrypt a large amount of data,\n\n280\n00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.600\nour data on the left there,\ngot a whole bunch of lines in our data,\n\n281\n00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.140\nlittle file there,\nshe's got a whole bunch of data.\n\n282\n00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.380\nIf we wanna encrypt all that data,\nwe know,\n\n283\n00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.500\nas I said, that symmetric keys\nare very quick symmetric encryption.\n\n284\n00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:31.640\nIt's very quick for bulk encryption, it's\nvery, very quick cuz it uses only one key.\n\n285\n00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.370\nAs a result of that,\nif we bulk encrypt the data\n\n286\n00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.400\nusing a symmetric key we're\ngonna apply encryption to it.\n\n287\n00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.830\nSo Mike's gonna turn\nthe data file there blue for\n\n288\n00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:45.440\nus indicating that we've used the private\nsymmetric key to drive the encryption.\n\n289\n00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.045\nAs a result of that, the data has now\nbeen encrypted with a symmetric key.\n\n290\n00:15:49.045 --> 00:15:53.149\nSo we know that if we use the same\nsymmetric key we can unencrypt the data,\n\n291\n00:15:53.149 --> 00:15:54.171\nso that's fine.\n\n292\n00:15:54.171 --> 00:15:57.670\nBut the problem is,\nhow do we safeguard and transmit the key?\n\n293\n00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:58.910\nThat's a problem.\n\n294\n00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:03.163\nSo now what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna talk about how we bring asymmetric\n\n295\n00:16:03.163 --> 00:16:07.681\nencryption to the party and we answer\nJohn's question along the way, and we talk\n\n296\n00:16:07.681 --> 00:16:11.802\nabout the use of asymmetric encryption\nto safeguard the symmetric key and\n\n297\n00:16:11.802 --> 00:16:13.700\nto securely transmit it.\n\n298\n00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.140\nSo Mike's about to copy that\nsymmetric key, that private key, and\n\n299\n00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:19.310\nput it into a little container there.\n\n300\n00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.750\nSo we're gonna copy the blue key.\n\n301\n00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.820\nWe're gonna stick it inside\na little rectangular container.\n\n302\n00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.510\nWe're gonna separate that key\nfrom the data in other words.\n\n303\n00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:28.840\nRight?\nThe data's been encrypted with\n\n304\n00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.940\nthe private key.\n\n305\n00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.380\nAnd we have the key now, and we're\ngonna now be able to effectively just\n\n306\n00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:34.830\nmake sure that we know\nthat the two are separate.\n\n307\n00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:37.700\nEven though we may not separate them\nin the diagram we know that the two\n\n308\n00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.230\neffectively are going to\nbe separate entities.\n\n309\n00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:44.700\nEncrypted data and key, and now what\nwe're going to do is follow it, right?\n\n310\n00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.260\nBecause that's so much better, cuz it's so\ndark you can actually see on the black\n\n311\n00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.140\nbackground that the blue has moved and you\ncan see the separation between the two.\n\n312\n00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.826\nOutstanding work there\nwith the cursor sir.\n\n313\n00:16:53.826 --> 00:16:54.610\nThank you very much.\n\n314\n00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.460\n>> I'm new with the animation.\n\n315\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.640\n>> All right stick to the script,\nlet's not ad lib.\n\n316\n00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.700\nAll right, so we know that the key is\ngoing to be the symmetric key, and\n\n317\n00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:05.090\nso what we have to do now is\nsecurely transmit that key.\n\n318\n00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.740\nNow this is where the asymmetric\nsolution comes in.\n\n319\n00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.360\nAlice realizes the only way to\nreally safely transmit that key\n\n320\n00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.190\nis not to figure out how to\ngive it to Bob out of band, but\n\n321\n00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:18.350\nrather to use asymmetric\nencryption to safeguard the key.\n\n322\n00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:22.980\nSo what we're gonna do is asymmetrically\nencrypt not the whole package, but\n\n323\n00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.650\nsimply the key, the symmetric key.\n\n324\n00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.000\nNow we could encrypt the key and\nthe data if we wanted to, but\n\n325\n00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.770\nwe're just gonna focus\non encrypting the key.\n\n326\n00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.610\nYou could actually asymmetrically\nencrypt the entire thing, but\n\n327\n00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.840\nwe're gonna asymmetrically\nencrypt just the key.\n\n328\n00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.700\nSo in order to asymmetrically\nencrypt the symmetric key, and\n\n329\n00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:45.690\nensure that the recipient of\nthe symmetric key is the only person that\n\n330\n00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:50.240\ncan open up the encryption and\ndecrypt the encrypted key.\n\n331\n00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.390\nWe have to make sure we choose wisely and\n\n332\n00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:56.070\nchoose the right key for\nAlice to use, right?\n\n333\n00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.530\nSo it's like a game show\nthe anticipation is building.\n\n334\n00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.840\nSpin the wheel of keys\nchoose the right key.\n\n335\n00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.190\nSo what we're gonna do is decide\nwhich key Alice needs to use.\n\n336\n00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:09.130\nNow let's just review and remember at\nthe same time what her options are.\n\n337\n00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.610\nAlice has a Public Key pair.\n\n338\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.670\nAn asymmetric system now, so she has\na Private Key, which she has to keep\n\n339\n00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:19.050\nconfidential not share with anybody,\nand she has a Public Key.\n\n340\n00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:20.720\nAnd those two are joined, right?\n\n341\n00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.940\nThey're like twins.\n\n342\n00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.990\nThey both can perform operations, but\n\n343\n00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.220\nthey're paired together effectively,\nright?\n\n344\n00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.890\nKinda locked together.\n\n345\n00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:32.580\nSo if Alice uses her Private Key\nto encrypt that Symmetric Key\n\n346\n00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:36.980\nanybody with Alice's Public Key\ncan decrypt the message, or\n\n347\n00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.390\nin this case, decrypt the encrypted key.\n\n348\n00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:43.320\nThat would be a bad outcome,\nbecause what would happen is effectively\n\n349\n00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:48.240\nshe's exposed the Symmetric Key to anybody\nwho has a copy of her Public Key and\n\n350\n00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.230\ntherefore expose the encrypted data\nbecause they can now take that\n\n351\n00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.940\nSymmetric Key in blue and\nunencrypt the data.\n\n352\n00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.260\nThat would be bad.\n\n353\n00:18:55.260 --> 00:19:00.100\nSo instead what Alice is gonna do is\nshe is going to use her Public Key\n\n354\n00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:04.170\nto symmetrically, or\nexcuse me asymmetrically encrypt.\n\n355\n00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:08.150\nThe Public Key is gonna be used to\nasymmetrically encrypt the symmetric key.\n\n356\n00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:12.660\nIn other words asymmetrically encrypt\nthe symmetric key for the encrypted data.\n\n357\n00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.090\nWe're gonna turn it green.\n\n358\n00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:17.900\nBy doing that what Alice has\neffectively done is said\n\n359\n00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.630\nhey I'm gonna use my Public Key, right?\n\n360\n00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:24.670\nBy doing that only\nsomebody that has a copy\n\n361\n00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:29.000\nof my Private Key can\nunencrypt the data right?\n\n362\n00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.540\nAnd by doing that what she's\ndone is she's rendered that key\n\n363\n00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:38.120\ninaccessible to anybody who doesn't\nhave a copy of her Private Key.\n\n364\n00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.540\nSo as a result nobody could\nunecrypt the data now\n\n365\n00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.090\nexcept somebody who has her Private Key.\n\n366\n00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:47.480\nIf Alice just wants to safe guard that\nkey, and not allow anybody to see the data\n\n367\n00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.520\nuntil she decides to unencrypt it this\nwould be a perfect way to do that.\n\n368\n00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:56.150\nBecause effectively now they need a copy\nof her Private Key in order to then\n\n369\n00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:01.170\nget to a copy of the symmetric key that\ncan then be used to unencrypt the data.\n\n370\n00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:05.630\nNow whether Alice chooses to share\nher Private Key to let somebody else\n\n371\n00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:09.000\nunencrypt the data is up to her,\nbut the point is she's effective\n\n372\n00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.325\nprotected the Symmetric Key without having\nto worry about transmitting it to anybody.\n\n373\n00:20:13.325 --> 00:20:19.700\nShe simply encrypted it with her own\nPublic Private Key pair, and by doing that\n\n374\n00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.750\nshe's rendered it unavailable to anybody\nunless she decides to give them access.\n\n375\n00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:27.750\nSo she's combined symmetric and\nasymmetric cryptography together\n\n376\n00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:31.570\nto deal with the issue of safely\nstoring the Symmetric Key.\n\n377\n00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:36.380\nBy doing something like this when we are\nbulk encrypting data in a secure network\n\n378\n00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.430\nand then storing the key that\nsafeguards the encryption of the data\n\n379\n00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:43.180\nwe are adding an additional\nlayer of protection.\n\n380\n00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.970\nAnd by doing that we're\nsafeguarding the key and\n\n381\n00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:49.520\nnot worrying about having to transmit it\nto people because now we're the only ones\n\n382\n00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:51.090\nthat control who gets to see the data.\n\n383\n00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:55.150\nSo this becomes a very secure and\nvery, very specific way\n\n384\n00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.550\nto deal with one of the concerns\naround out of band key transmissions.\n\n385\n00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.250\nSo we may be able to use symmetric and\n\n386\n00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:04.070\nasymmetric cryptography together\nto achieve some of these results.\n\n387\n00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:09.490\nNow if Alice wanted to transmit that key\nsecurely she could potentially do that,\n\n388\n00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:12.870\nbut we're back to an issue\nthat we have to consider.\n\n389\n00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:17.220\nIf she's encrypted the symmetric\nKey in blue with her public key\n\n390\n00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.930\nonly her Private Key can be used\nto decrypt, which means in effect,\n\n391\n00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:25.930\nthe problem is that anybody who has a copy\nof her private key can see the message,\n\n392\n00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.130\nbut nobody else can interact with it.\n\n393\n00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.640\nShe still has a the problem with\ntransmitting her Private Key securely in\n\n394\n00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.190\nother words, right?\n\n395\n00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.456\nWe're back to the whole out of band issue.\n\n396\n00:21:33.456 --> 00:21:38.130\nHowever if she uses her\nPrivate Key to encrypt as we said\n\n397\n00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.200\nshe could do wouldn't\nbe a lot of his choice.\n\n398\n00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.760\nShe exposes the Private Key that's\nencrypted in the blue container\n\n399\n00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.240\nthe Private Key Symmetric Key.\n\n400\n00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.530\nShe exposes it to everybody now,\n\n401\n00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:50.680\nbecause everybody potentially can have\na copy of her Public Key and decrypt.\n\n402\n00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.050\nSo we still potentially have an issue\nthere if she wants to transmit\n\n403\n00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:58.040\nthe encrypted key securely we still have\nto worry about ultimately an out of band\n\n404\n00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:58.720\nmechanism.\n\n405\n00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.270\nRight?\n\n406\n00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.830\nSo John while we said potentially yes\n\n407\n00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:06.530\nout of band mechanism communication\nsolutions or concerns may be addressed\n\n408\n00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:10.250\nthrough asymmetric systems there's always\nan asterisk, there's always a but,\n\n409\n00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.990\nbecause the problem may be we may\nwind up back at the same place.\n\n410\n00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:17.440\nWe still have to figure out how\nto securely transmit the key\n\n411\n00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.970\nthat's been encrypted in\norder to transmit and\n\n412\n00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:24.580\nsafeguard the Private Key to unencrypt\nthe data, so while it sounds good on\n\n413\n00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.600\nthe surface it doesn't always\nnecessarily work out any easier.\n\n414\n00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.590\nUltimately what Alice really\nneeds to do is get rid of Bob and\n\n415\n00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.890\njust decide that she's going to keep\neverything for herself because if she does\n\n416\n00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.725\nthat she doesn't have to worry about\nsharing her private keys with anybody.\n\n417\n00:22:37.725 --> 00:22:41.080\nAnd then there's no out of band\ncommunication at all, and everybody's\n\n418\n00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.550\nhappier, so that's gonna be a lot\nbetter for her, and for everybody else.\n\n419\n00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.080\nShe's not gonna do that by the way.\n\n420\n00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:46.760\nI'm only kidding.\n\n421\n00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.478\nThose of you out there that don't\nwant to see Bob killed off vote now.\n\n422\n00:22:49.478 --> 00:22:51.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right?\n\n423\n00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:56.430\nSo we want to make sure we understand that\nwe have different ways of dealing with\n\n424\n00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:57.210\nkey transmission.\n\n425\n00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.230\nWe have a symmetric system private key,\nwe have to worry about out of band.\n\n426\n00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.010\nWe have an asymmetric system Public\nPrivate Key, we could digitally sign,\n\n427\n00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:05.850\nwe can encrypt.\n\n428\n00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.590\nIt depends on what key's being used and\nwhat problem we're trying to address.\n\n429\n00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:12.100\nNow back to John's\ncomment about asymmetric\n\n430\n00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.660\nwhat we could do is potentially take Bob's\nif we take this to the logical extent\n\n431\n00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:21.600\nwe could take Bob's [COUGH] Public Key,\nand we could encrypt that blue\n\n432\n00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:25.970\nSymmetric Key at the top of the data\nstack with Bob's Public Key.\n\n433\n00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:30.130\nAnd then Alice could send that and\nif she does that only Bob could\n\n434\n00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.670\nunencrypt the message getting\nthe Symmetric Key to unencrypt the data.\n\n435\n00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:37.450\nWhat we were talking about in terms\nof making sure we understand how\n\n436\n00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.710\nasymmetric encryption can be used to\ndeal with this out of band issue.\n\n437\n00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:44.670\nThe example we were just talking about was\nreally Alice is gonna keep the key secure\n\n438\n00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.578\nand use asymmetric encryption to do that\nand safe guard it, but not transmit it.\n\n439\n00:23:48.578 --> 00:23:50.296\nBut we've added Bob to the mix right?\n\n440\n00:23:50.296 --> 00:23:53.712\nSo we put Bob in there cuz now what\nwe wanna do is just talk about how we\n\n441\n00:23:53.712 --> 00:23:57.803\ncan actually transmit the key securely as\nwell and Kinda come full circle back to\n\n442\n00:23:57.803 --> 00:24:00.795\nJohn's comment about what he was asking,\nwhich was hey,\n\n443\n00:24:00.795 --> 00:24:04.720\ncan we use a symmetric systems to\nsolve out of band key communication?\n\n444\n00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:08.530\nWe actually can, but we have to think\nabout the logic of how to do it fully.\n\n445\n00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.462\nIf Alice just wants to keep the keys\nsecure, and keep it for herself and\n\n446\n00:24:11.462 --> 00:24:12.815\nnot transmit it, we're done.\n\n447\n00:24:12.815 --> 00:24:14.080\nWe don't have to worry\nabout anything else.\n\n448\n00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:18.304\nBut if she wants to transmit it to John's\npoint, that we gotta bring by them and\n\n449\n00:24:18.304 --> 00:24:21.696\nwe gotta use Bob's keys in order\nto complete the circuit here,\n\n450\n00:24:21.696 --> 00:24:24.768\nbecause if we use Alice's keys\nas we were talking about,\n\n451\n00:24:24.768 --> 00:24:29.030\nthe problem we're gonna have is that\nshe can't securely transmit the key.\n\n452\n00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:31.900\nWe're back to this whole\nissue of effectively well,\n\n453\n00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:34.850\nit's like a symmetric system, we're back\nto the whole private key thing again.\n\n454\n00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:40.340\nSo Alice has to get to Bob, and say to\nBob, Bob, I need to send this key to you.\n\n455\n00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.260\nHow am I gonna do that?\n\n456\n00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.890\nAnd so, what Alice is gonna do, is Alice\nis gonna go grab Bob's public key.\n\n457\n00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:51.730\nShe grabs Bob's public key, and\nshe uses Bob's public key to encrypt\n\n458\n00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:55.960\nthe blue symmetric key sitting up there,\nand you see we wrapped it in green,\n\n459\n00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.350\nto represent a public key but\nit's just gonna be Bob's public key.\n\n460\n00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.560\nBob was a little rushed to get\nto the studio this afternoon so\n\n461\n00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.060\nhe forgot to bring his keys with him.\n\n462\n00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.605\nSo we're just gonna proxy for\nBob's keys and assume they're there.\n\n463\n00:25:06.605 --> 00:25:12.010\nBut if Bob used, or rather, excuse me, if\nAlice borrowed and used Bob's public key\n\n464\n00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:16.870\nthen what would happen is when she sends\nthe encrypted key, the blue symmetric key,\n\n465\n00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:20.850\nthe only person that can decrypt\nthe encryption, unwrap it and\n\n466\n00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:25.190\nturn the green rectangle back to\nwhite to get to the symmetric key\n\n467\n00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:29.860\ninside is gonna be Bob because he has\nthe matching corresponding private key.\n\n468\n00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:34.050\nAnd so, when we wanna use\nasymmetric encryption to be able to\n\n469\n00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:38.020\neffectively send or\nsafeguard a symmetrically encrypted key,\n\n470\n00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:42.280\ndealing with the out of band issue,\nthe answer is absolutely we can do that.\n\n471\n00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:46.240\nBut we just have to make sure we\nare using the recipient's public key\n\n472\n00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.290\nto drive the encryption of\nthe symmetric private key.\n\n473\n00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:53.520\nAnd by doing that, we then are effectively\nJohn, as you've asked about and\n\n474\n00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.680\nwe've indicated,\n\n475\n00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.040\nyou are then effectively able to deal with\nthe out of band communication mechanism.\n\n476\n00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.990\nSo as a result,\nwe have effectively come full circle.\n\n477\n00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.670\nAnd we've done that,\n\n478\n00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:06.000\nso that's gonna help us to understand\nexactly what we need to achieve there.\n\n479\n00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.440\nSo what we've been thinking about and\n\n480\n00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:11.850\ntalking about is different kinds\nof key solutions, symmetric,\n\n481\n00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:16.210\nasymmetric, we've been talking a lot about\nhow you can implement them, we can use\n\n482\n00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.430\nthe private key with, then we're limited\nby that as we've been talking about.\n\n483\n00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:20.690\nWe have trouble transmitting that.\n\n484\n00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:22.870\nSo we're gonna have to keep\nit ourselves very limited.\n\n485\n00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:26.600\nWhen we use a public private key\npair we can use the private key or\n\n486\n00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.150\nthe public key depending on\nwhat we're looking to do.\n\n487\n00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.530\nWhether we're looking to sign or\n\n488\n00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:33.010\nwe're looking to securely transmit,\nwe may pair the two together.\n\n489\n00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.030\nSymmetric and asymmetric encryption.\n\n490\n00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:38.690\nEffectively allowing us to get\nthe advantages of symmetric encryption\n\n491\n00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.210\nvery quick.\n\n492\n00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.510\nBut the downside,\nwhich is a single key hard to manage,\n\n493\n00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:46.650\nwe overcome that with asymmetric,\nwhich is a dual key pair.\n\n494\n00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.270\nWe can use the public key of the recipient\n\n495\n00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:53.060\nto effectively safeguard the sending\nof the symmetric private key, and\n\n496\n00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.130\nI'm sure that it will not be\ncompromised along the way.\n\n497\n00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:59.425\nI'm out of things to talk about with\ncryptography because my brain is hurting.\n\n498\n00:26:59.425 --> 00:27:00.880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We've talked about so much.\n\n499\n00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.535\nThis is our fifth episode\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n500\n00:27:02.535 --> 00:27:03.186\n>> Five, that's right.\n\n501\n00:27:03.186 --> 00:27:03.975\n>> Five episodes.\n\n502\n00:27:03.975 --> 00:27:05.450\nHow often do we have five episodes.\n\n503\n00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.574\nOnly when they let me talk without\ntelling me I have to stop.\n\n504\n00:27:07.574 --> 00:27:08.991\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's how often we get five.\n\n505\n00:27:08.991 --> 00:27:11.781\nSo we're gonna wrap up our\nconversation here, but before we do,\n\n506\n00:27:11.781 --> 00:27:14.450\nI just wanna point out two\nvery important things for you.\n\n507\n00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.740\nWith regards to this entire conversation.\n\n508\n00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.680\nAll five episodes regarding\nthe assessment of vulnerabilities.\n\n509\n00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.100\nWe've been talking specifically about\nvulnerabilities dealing with system\n\n510\n00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.880\narchitecture, and that's gonna be general\ntheme for this entire group of episodes.\n\n511\n00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.070\nWe're gonna have in the some upcoming\nepisodes additional discussions about\n\n512\n00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:37.690\nassessing and mitigating vulnerabilities\nin different areas, Web for instance,\n\n513\n00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:39.090\nmobile, things like that.\n\n514\n00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.020\nWe're not done in other words,\nwe're talking about assessment and\n\n515\n00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:43.350\nmitigation of vulnerabilities.\n\n516\n00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:46.960\nBut we really had to be very deep,\nand very broad here in our discussion\n\n517\n00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.410\ninitially to set it up from the system\narchitecture perspective, so\n\n518\n00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.790\nthat we can then delve\ninto these specific areas,\n\n519\n00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.000\nas we now go through\nsome additional material.\n\n520\n00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.650\nOverall, as you prepare to study\nfrom this entire section, and\n\n521\n00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:02.680\nprepare to take and ultimately\nsuccessfully pass the CISSP exam.\n\n522\n00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.860\nWe spent a fair amount\nof time on cryptography.\n\n523\n00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:05.910\nThere's a reason for that.\n\n524\n00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:07.710\nIt's very important for\nyou to understand it.\n\n525\n00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:11.590\nIt forms one of the fundamental\nbasic constructs that we use\n\n526\n00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:14.880\nin every discussion we have\nabout security in any way.\n\n527\n00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.660\nBecause we're always talking about\nconfidentiality and integrity.\n\n528\n00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.380\nThese are two of the three pillars,\n\n529\n00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.920\nthe foundational elements\nof information security.\n\n530\n00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.680\nCryptography is all about how we\nachieve confidentiality and integrity.\n\n531\n00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.260\nMake sure you understand what\nwe've talked about here,\n\n532\n00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.430\nmake sure you are comfortable\nwith the language.\n\n533\n00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.970\nMake sure you understand how and\nwhen we choose the appropriate keys.\n\n534\n00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.800\nThese things will be very helpful to you.\n\n535\n00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.070\nThey were very important for\nyou as you prepare for the exam.\n\n536\n00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.640\n>> I tell you, that's great stuff, Adam.\n\n537\n00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.150\nFive episodes,\nI enjoyed every minute of it.\n\n538\n00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:45.700\nHopefully everybody out there did,\nas well.\n\n539\n00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.750\nAnd remember,\nif you wanna attend one of Adam's classes,\n\n540\n00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.870\nall you gotta do is shoot us an email,\nSeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n541\n00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:53.356\nThat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n542\n00:28:53.356 --> 00:28:54.876\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n543\n00:28:54.876 --> 00:28:56.118\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n544\n00:28:56.118 --> 00:28:57.430\n>> And we'll see you next

--> 00:00:17.940\nMy name's Mike Rodrick,\nI'll be your host today.\n\n4\n00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.450\nAnd we're continuing on with our CISSP,\nand specifically,\n\n5\n00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.740\nwe've been looking at assessing and\nmitigating vulnerabilities, and we started\n\n6\n00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.920\noff looking at system architecture,\nwe're gonna shift gears a little bit.\n\n7\n00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.720\nWe're gonna shift into web-based\nvulnerabilities as well as some mobile\n\n8\n00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.430\nvulnerabilities and ICS systems or\nmy industrial control systems.\n\n9\n00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.150\nAnd here to help us with all\nof that is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.958\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.350\n>> I'm good, I'm good.\n\n12\n00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.260\nI wanted to be Mike today and\nactually be the host and\n\n13\n00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.710\nhave Mike do the presentation.\n\n14\n00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.870\nSo we could do that cuz Mike\nknows all this stuff too.\n\n15\n00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.550\nHe's just really shy and\ndoesn't like to talk on camera.\n\n16\n00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.058\nSo I'll go ahead and\nstep in since Mike hasn't volunteered.\n\n17\n00:00:55.058 --> 00:00:57.897\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's talk about assessing and\n\n18\n00:00:57.897 --> 00:01:00.555\nmitigating, or continuing our\nthought process, I should say,\n\n19\n00:01:00.555 --> 00:01:01.974\nabout assessing and mitigating.\n\n20\n00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:06.364\nWe're focusing on web-based, on mobile,\non ICS, industrial control and\n\n21\n00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:09.280\non SCADA systems,\nsupervisory control systems.\n\n22\n00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.170\nWe're gonna talk about vulnerabilities and\nways to deal with them in those areas.\n\n23\n00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.440\nWe're gonna wrap that kind of\nall up in one large discussion.\n\n24\n00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.490\nGive us the ability to look\nout across that landscape and\n\n25\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.750\nfigure out what we need to be doing\ndifferently in order to be more secure.\n\n26\n00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.020\nSo as we think about\nsuggested protection for\n\n27\n00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.370\nthe web, we really want to be thinking\nabout is what goes on in the web services.\n\n28\n00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.310\nWhat goes on with web services,\nthrough the web?\n\n29\n00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.530\nThe idea is that we're having people come\nin, in often cases, anonymously in some\n\n30\n00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.060\ncases they are authorizing, and\nwe're knowing who they are, so\n\n31\n00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.410\nthey're coming in, and\nthey're providing credentials.\n\n32\n00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.157\nBut effectively, they're showing up and\n\n33\n00:01:42.157 --> 00:01:47.267\ndemanding from us that we provide goods\nand services to them using protocols and\n\n34\n00:01:47.267 --> 00:01:51.020\nusing information that may or\nmay not show us who they are.\n\n35\n00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.860\nIt may be hard for us and others to know\nreally who somebody is other than through\n\n36\n00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.240\na username and a password.\n\n37\n00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.290\nThe protocol HTTP, the protocol HTTPS,\nthe protocol FTP, those kind of\n\n38\n00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.130\nprotocols really don't have authorization\nassociated with them directly.\n\n39\n00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.560\nAt least HTTP anyway, does not,\nand certainly FTP does not.\n\n40\n00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.640\nIt is anonymous by design and\nby nature more often than not.\n\n41\n00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.680\nSo when we think about associating and\nthink about identifying and\n\n42\n00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.450\nthink about analyzing vulnerabilities and\nworrying about mitigation techniques,\n\n43\n00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.970\nwith regards to assessing weaknesses\nin these systems, we have to start out\n\n44\n00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.500\nfrom that assumption that, a lot of the\ntimes that people are using these systems,\n\n45\n00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.170\nmay not be directly known to us.\n\n46\n00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.690\nAnd we have to then take everything we\nsee with a grain of salt, so to speak.\n\n47\n00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.590\nBe a little skeptical about where they're\ncoming from and what they're doing.\n\n48\n00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.980\nAnd so what we have to think about is\nreally making the systems as hardened,\n\n49\n00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.330\nas secure as we can up front, to prevent\nthe obvious things from going wrong.\n\n50\n00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.380\nDon't give strangers the ability\nto find open doors and window,\n\n51\n00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.960\nin other words,\nin our solutions, lock them up.\n\n52\n00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.150\nGet rid of the unnecessary services.\n\n53\n00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.988\nMake sure we're up-to-date on our patches.\n\n54\n00:02:56.988 --> 00:03:00.600\nMake sure that we're not offering\ninformation through a web service or\n\n55\n00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.590\ngenerically in any form that should not\nbe seen because it is classified as\n\n56\n00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.630\nconfidential.\n\n57\n00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.440\nSo make sure we are safeguarding\ninformation with data classification.\n\n58\n00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.630\nMake sure we are using cryptography,\nas we've talked about extensively.\n\n59\n00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.770\nAnd encryption to safeguard data both\nin transit, as well as in storage.\n\n60\n00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.720\nAnd so these are the kind of things we\nwanna be thinking about as we begin\n\n61\n00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.600\nour conversation with\nregards to web services.\n\n62\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.201\nWe wanna make sure we're\nscanning constantly, looking for\n\n63\n00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:27.783\nvulnerabilities in these systems.\n\n64\n00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:30.736\nIt is rare that a month goes by\nwithout hearing about one or\n\n65\n00:03:30.736 --> 00:03:34.860\nmore vulnerabilities on a web platform,\nwithout mentioning vendors by name,\n\n66\n00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.906\njust generically, any web platform.\n\n67\n00:03:36.906 --> 00:03:38.612\nDoesn't really matter.\n\n68\n00:03:38.612 --> 00:03:41.939\nIn other words, there are many\nvulnerabilities out there that\n\n69\n00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.824\nexist that are available to\nbad actors in the web area,\n\n70\n00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:48.899\nand the more we scan, the more proactive\nwe are, the more we probe and look for\n\n71\n00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:50.810\nso that we ultimately can fix them.\n\n72\n00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.030\nWe know what they are before\nthe bad actors come and\n\n73\n00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.590\ntake them away from us,\nthose are things that we're gonna\n\n74\n00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.610\nultimately have to do if\nwe wanna stay secure.\n\n75\n00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.110\nIt's just very important to do.\n\n76\n00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.583\nWe should be using scanning technologies.\n\n77\n00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:06.230\nWe've talked about IDSs, IPSs, intrusion\ndetection, intrusion prevention systems.\n\n78\n00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.540\nWe should be using firewalls to\nsafeguard our infrastructure.\n\n79\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.812\nCreate a DMZ, a demilitarized zone\nwhere web servers can safely live, but\n\n80\n00:04:13.812 --> 00:04:17.620\nthey are protected by at least one,\nif not more than one, gateway device that\n\n81\n00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.660\nwill offer some form of inbound filtering\nto prevent just random association and\n\n82\n00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.650\nrandom communication from taking place,\nor rather communication that is filtered.\n\n83\n00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.840\nThat we understand and we can control,\nis really the goal here.\n\n84\n00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.810\nMake sure we get rid of unnecessary and\nunwanted administrative interfaces.\n\n85\n00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.085\nJust because somebody thinks it's\na good idea to put a web interface into\n\n86\n00:04:37.085 --> 00:04:41.810\nadminister or configure a, front end for\nsomething doesn't mean it's a good idea.\n\n87\n00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.290\nJust means they thought\nit was a good idea.\n\n88\n00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.740\nSomebody thought it was a good idea to\nbuild a ship called the Titanic and\n\n89\n00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.050\nsail it in the middle of an ice field.\n\n90\n00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.385\nThat doesn't mean it was a good idea.\n\n91\n00:04:50.385 --> 00:04:51.369\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It just means\n\n92\n00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:54.670\nsomebody thought it was and\nturned out to be not such a good idea.\n\n93\n00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.010\nSo my point is when we\nthink about things like\n\n94\n00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.590\nusing web interfaces to configure\nfirewalls and switches and\n\n95\n00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.190\nrouters today, that may be very nice for\nthe administrator cuz it's convenient.\n\n96\n00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.630\nYou don't have to learn\nabout a command line,\n\n97\n00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.560\nyou don't have to worry about\nremembering a bunch of commands.\n\n98\n00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.390\nWe can more easily view things, and\nI get that, and that's perfectly fine.\n\n99\n00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.980\nBut the challenge with that is that\nthe bad actors also get that, and\n\n100\n00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.710\nthey also understand how\neasy we're making it.\n\n101\n00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.350\nAnd they are not gonna\nsit on the sidelines and\n\n102\n00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.670\njust watch you do your job and\nnot try to take that system away from you.\n\n103\n00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.610\nThey're gonna say,\nwell I want some of that.\n\n104\n00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.870\nIt's easy, I wanna get in there and\nplay around too.\n\n105\n00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.230\nAdam, why don't you move over?\n\n106\n00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:33.790\nLet me touch that router for a little bit.\n\n107\n00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.520\nLet me see what I can do to\nreconfigure that through the web.\n\n108\n00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.490\nSo if we're not smart about\nhow we manage web services and\n\n109\n00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.250\navailability through the web, somebody's\ngonna come and take that away from us.\n\n110\n00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.850\nSo one of the biggest\nvulnerabilities we have,\n\n111\n00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.700\none of the biggest things we have\nto mitigate with web services,\n\n112\n00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.390\nis the availability,\nthe ubiquitousness of web access,\n\n113\n00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.040\nthat everybody can get to that front door\nand knock on it to see if they can get in.\n\n114\n00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.290\nRemember, we've talked about this before,\nmy,\n\n115\n00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.010\nbe this much better than\neverybody else conversation.\n\n116\n00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.650\nWell, with web services,\nit's not only be this much better, but\n\n117\n00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.030\nit's be this much better and be this much\nbetter as we've talked about all the time.\n\n118\n00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.780\nBecause that web access is\navailable to everybody,\n\n119\n00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.230\nregardless of whether you want them\nto see it or not if you publicly\n\n120\n00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.130\nmake it available, if you publish it,\nin other words, outside the organization.\n\n121\n00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.816\nEven if it's inside the organization,\nbehind firewalls,\n\n122\n00:06:20.816 --> 00:06:23.143\nyou still have bad actors\npotentially internally.\n\n123\n00:06:23.143 --> 00:06:24.660\nAnd we have to worry about them as well.\n\n124\n00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.800\nWorld would be a lot easier if we only\nhad bad people on the outside and\n\n125\n00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.870\ngood people on the inside.\n\n126\n00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.910\nWe wouldn't have to worry so much about\nwhat goes on inside of our systems.\n\n127\n00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.900\nBut the problem is, we don't really\nknow where the bad actors are.\n\n128\n00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.230\nWe have to be thinking about this and\nbe aware of this as well.\n\n129\n00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.350\nWe also have to think\nabout input validation.\n\n130\n00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.230\nHow do we allow information\nto be put into a web service?\n\n131\n00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.890\nSo for instance,\nif somebody has a database and\n\n132\n00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.470\nwe are gathering data over the web,\nand you have a form,\n\n133\n00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.410\na web enabled form that most of us\nhave probably seen time and again.\n\n134\n00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.350\nWe probably use something very\nsimilar whenever we log on and/or\n\n135\n00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.900\nprovide account information the first\ntime we create an account at a website.\n\n136\n00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.180\nYou're asked to fill out some sort\nof form on the web and submit that.\n\n137\n00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.290\nThat goes into a database on the back\nend behind a secure firewall somewhere.\n\n138\n00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.510\nSo the web server itself\nmay be in the DMZ.\n\n139\n00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.750\nThe database is behind the internal part\nof the DMZ on the local area network,\n\n140\n00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.340\ncuz we know we shouldn't expose\nthe database unnecessarily.\n\n141\n00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.050\nSo we use a web front end to\neffectively reach out to you and\n\n142\n00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:25.760\nto effectively then pass that back to\na secure database stored somewhere else.\n\n143\n00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:29.900\nThe problem is that we don't validate and\ncontrol what input goes into that form.\n\n144\n00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.710\nWe may be injecting, this is the term\nwe use, injecting that data and\n\n145\n00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.540\nas a result of that, information\nthat is incorrect, that's one issue.\n\n146\n00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.800\nBut also information that is malformed\ninto that database that can cause\n\n147\n00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.960\neither denial-of-service attacks,\nbuffer overflows, or\n\n148\n00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.394\nall sorts of things that can\ngo wrong with that database.\n\n149\n00:07:49.394 --> 00:07:52.613\nDatabases, especially those\nconnected to the web,\n\n150\n00:07:52.613 --> 00:07:55.912\nare highly susceptible to\ninput validation attacks.\n\n151\n00:07:55.912 --> 00:07:59.201\nIf we don't validate the field,\nif we don't say, for instance,\n\n152\n00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:03.331\nthat field could only have 50 characters\nof text and it is gonna be alphanumeric.\n\n153\n00:08:03.331 --> 00:08:05.178\nAnd we're gonna exclude\nspecial characters.\n\n154\n00:08:05.178 --> 00:08:09.245\nWhat will happen is somebody can put\nspecial characters, more than 50.\n\n155\n00:08:09.245 --> 00:08:13.461\nAnd they can inject command line code,\nstructures, and information and\n\n156\n00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:16.725\nin this case commands that may\nbe executed in the database\n\n157\n00:08:16.725 --> 00:08:21.830\nin such a way that it can actually expose\nthat in the database if we're not careful.\n\n158\n00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.650\nThis is called an input validation attack.\n\n159\n00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.820\nOr at least this is what results,\nif we don't do input validation.\n\n160\n00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:32.160\nSo, buffer overflows, authentication\nissues, scripting, submission of some\n\n161\n00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.935\nsort of command to the underlying solution\nthat's encoded in a certain way so\n\n162\n00:08:35.935 --> 00:08:39.165\nwe don't recognize what it is, but\nthe system will execute it anyway.\n\n163\n00:08:39.165 --> 00:08:40.995\nURL encoding and translation.\n\n164\n00:08:40.995 --> 00:08:44.985\nThese are all problems that web\nservices can face, ultimately,\n\n165\n00:08:44.985 --> 00:08:48.625\nand that we have to use firewalls and\nspecifically proxy firewalls,\n\n166\n00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:52.175\napplication level firewalls,\nto be able to address and deal with.\n\n167\n00:08:52.175 --> 00:08:54.425\nAs the CISSP,\nyou have to be aware of these things.\n\n168\n00:08:54.425 --> 00:08:57.365\nSo we wanna make sure that input\nvalidation is really up near the top\n\n169\n00:08:57.365 --> 00:09:00.550\nof our list with regards to web services.\n\n170\n00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.780\nLanguage and language choice for\nweb services is also important.\n\n171\n00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.690\nWhen we talk about protocols,\nthose are important.\n\n172\n00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.847\nWe talk about HTP, FTP versus HTTPS.\n\n173\n00:09:08.847 --> 00:09:11.407\nDo you know, by the way,\nthere is a secure form of FTP?\n\n174\n00:09:11.407 --> 00:09:12.800\nMay or may not be aware of that.\n\n175\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.149\nOne that is not anonymized.\n\n176\n00:09:14.149 --> 00:09:16.840\nThat requires log-on\nauthentication to be used.\n\n177\n00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.930\nSo you may wanna read up on that\nif you're not familiar with that.\n\n178\n00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:25.190\nXML and also SAML, Security Assertion\nMarkup Language, are two languages,\n\n179\n00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.290\nprogrammatic languages, that we may\nchoose to use today with web services.\n\n180\n00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:34.840\nSAML is really focused on making sure\nwe are able to exchange information for\n\n181\n00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.260\nauthentication authorization securely.\n\n182\n00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.230\nXML is going to be used to\nexchange data generically and\n\n183\n00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.690\nrelying many of the services we use today.\n\n184\n00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:48.380\nBy using something like SAML to formally\nand to, with the proper structure and\n\n185\n00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.800\noversight in place because of\nthe structure of the language,\n\n186\n00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.020\nexchange authentication and\nauthorization information.\n\n187\n00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:57.320\nWe effectively are trying to safeguard\nthat exchange using standards and\n\n188\n00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.310\nstructures that have\nbeen approved to do so.\n\n189\n00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.820\nWe're gonna be much more likely to be\nsuccessful at achieving that end result,\n\n190\n00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.190\nmitigating the possibility that somebody\ncan get that information from us.\n\n191\n00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.448\nWe may use something like Open ID Connect.\n\n192\n00:10:08.448 --> 00:10:12.710\nOr OOF 2.0 these traditional\nauthentication standards on the web\n\n193\n00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.830\nthat can also be used to safeguard\nauthentication information and\n\n194\n00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.790\nto prevent the unnecessary\nexposure of this data.\n\n195\n00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.460\nGone are the days where we\nsimply sit down and log in and\n\n196\n00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.510\ndon't worry about anybody snooping and\nsniffing that information off the wire.\n\n197\n00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:28.330\nToday we can assume that\neverybody is listening and\n\n198\n00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.540\nas a result of that what\nare we gonna do differently?\n\n199\n00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.090\nI often challenge my students in class,\nwhen I talk to them about anything but\n\n200\n00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.460\nespecially security.\n\n201\n00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.550\nI challenge them by saying, what are you\ngoing to do differently on Monday morning?\n\n202\n00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.660\nWhat I mean by that is, when you get\ndone learning about all the things we're\n\n203\n00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.070\ntalking about, what's going to stick with\nyou and what are you ultimately going to\n\n204\n00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:49.550\ngo and try to do differently at the job\nthat you are already engaged in.\n\n205\n00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.860\nTo be able to get more secure,\nto be able to get better at what you do.\n\n206\n00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.930\nBeing a CISSP is as much\nabout understanding\n\n207\n00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.790\nthe great knowledge that we have\nto master, mile wide inch deep.\n\n208\n00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:03.450\nIt's about all of that but it's also about\nincrementally improving the security of\n\n209\n00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.570\nthe organization you work for\non a daily basis.\n\n210\n00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.730\nIf you could do one thing\ndifferently every day.\n\n211\n00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:13.130\nAnd incrementally ratchet up that security\nlevel over time, you are doing your job.\n\n212\n00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.450\nYou uphold the code of ethics.\n\n213\n00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:17.360\nYou're acting honorably,\nyou're acting justly and you're protecting\n\n214\n00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.690\nthe organization as well as\nthe community that we all are a part of.\n\n215\n00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:24.338\nThe information security community\nof all the professionals that\n\n216\n00:11:24.338 --> 00:11:25.700\nhold certifications.\n\n217\n00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.750\nThis is important.\n\n218\n00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.470\nThis is what CISSPs\nare charged with doing.\n\n219\n00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.500\nSo, you have to think about what you're\ngonna do differently on Monday morning.\n\n220\n00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.350\nBecause you have to think about\nthe different things you may\n\n221\n00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:38.510\nbe able to implement, in order to achieve\na more secure solution over time.\n\n222\n00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.470\nNot just with the web, but with any and\nall of these areas that we focus\n\n223\n00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.620\non mitigation and\nassessment of vulnerabilities across.\n\n224\n00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.050\nOne of the key things with the web, and\n\n225\n00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.200\nwe talked about this in one\nof our earlier episodes.\n\n226\n00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.290\nIs the use of the knowledge\nthat may be acquired\n\n227\n00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.300\nfrom an organization such as OWASP.\n\n228\n00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.500\nAnd we've talked about OWASP,\n\n229\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.395\nthe Open Web Application Security Project\nis what OWASP stands for.\n\n230\n00:11:58.395 --> 00:12:02.200\nOwasp.org is where you\nwill go if you want to see\n\n231\n00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.400\nthe information that we've previewed for\nyou in prior discussions.\n\n232\n00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:09.570\nThe OWASP top ten web application\nvulnerability list that's put out every\n\n233\n00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.810\nthree years is a great resource for you.\n\n234\n00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.150\nWe've mentioned it in one of\nthe prior discussions we've had.\n\n235\n00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.870\nPlease go back.\n\n236\n00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.380\nPlease make sure you take a look at that.\n\n237\n00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.290\nYou would want to be familiar\nwith those vulnerabilities and\n\n238\n00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.640\nwanna take steps to mitigate them\nif they're found in your systems,\n\n239\n00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.990\nthings like cross-site scripting for\ninstance.\n\n240\n00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.800\nAnd authentication concerns and\nlack of input validation.\n\n241\n00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.010\nThese are all things we've talked about,\n\n242\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.180\nand these are things that you should\nbe looking at with regards to the web.\n\n243\n00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.130\nWhen we move on and\ntalk about assessment and\n\n244\n00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.830\nmitigation of vulnerabilities in\nmobile systems, one of the other\n\n245\n00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.570\nareas we wanna touch on, we have to\nthink about risk from remote computing.\n\n246\n00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.370\nWe've talked a lot about mobile platforms,\ntalked about mobile device management,\n\n247\n00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.530\ntalked about cellphones,\ntablets, laptops, etc.\n\n248\n00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.210\nWe have to make sure we understand\nhow to use these things, but\n\n249\n00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.690\nwe have to make sure we understand\nhow to use them securely.\n\n250\n00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.160\nSo it's as much about doing\nvulnerability assessment, mitigating\n\n251\n00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:00.160\nthe concerns we find, as it is about\npairing that with security awareness, and\n\n252\n00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.680\ntraining the end user to make sure\nthat they're using them securely.\n\n253\n00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.290\nWe've talked a lot about the fact\nthat when we see people get up and\n\n254\n00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:10.880\nwalk away from a device without locking\nit down, that that's clearly an issue and\n\n255\n00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.990\nthat's a lack of security awareness on the\npart of the end user that's causing that.\n\n256\n00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.360\nI believe firmly, and I really do,\nthat if people were just trained and\n\n257\n00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.700\ngiven the opportunity to understand what\nthe implications of their actions are,\n\n258\n00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.160\nthat they would act differently.\n\n259\n00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.960\nNot everybody, not all the time.\n\n260\n00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.200\nThere are still people that would just\nobviously choose to act inappropriately\n\n261\n00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.690\nfor a variety of reasons.\n\n262\n00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:33.780\nBut the reality is most of us,\nif we really stopped and\n\n263\n00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.930\nthought about the implications\nof our actions and\n\n264\n00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:40.170\nunderstood the potential negative outcomes\nthat could associate with that behavior.\n\n265\n00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.060\nWould probably do something differently,\n\n266\n00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.450\nif we knew that it was\ngonna cause a problem.\n\n267\n00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.100\nBecause most of us are in general,\njust trying to do\n\n268\n00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.200\nthe right thing which may not\nunderstand what the right thing is,\n\n269\n00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.480\nas Spike Lee once famously said,\ndo the right thing.\n\n270\n00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.370\nWe do want to make sure we understand that\nthe risks associated with remote computing\n\n271\n00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.200\nare varied.\n\n272\n00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.255\nWe want to be using VPMs.\n\n273\n00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.010\nWe want to be using tunneling protocols.\n\n274\n00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:02.680\nWe want to be using encryption.\n\n275\n00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:07.590\nWe want to be training end users to ensure\nthat they don't leave their devices\n\n276\n00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.940\nunattended over time, and\nif they do, that they lock them out.\n\n277\n00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:14.380\nBut we don't want to rely on\nthem doing that exclusively.\n\n278\n00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.330\nWe want to use lockout controls that will\neffectively time out a session after so\n\n279\n00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.510\nmany minutes or seconds or\nwhatever of inactivity.\n\n280\n00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.030\nWe want to make sure we use single\nsession key authentication.\n\n281\n00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:28.690\nSo when somebody logs in remotely\nto do something, if they time out,\n\n282\n00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.030\nthey can't simply hit the F5\nbutton to refresh that session and\n\n283\n00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.450\nbring it back up; they\nhave to reauthenticate.\n\n284\n00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.440\nBecause of that we're asking\nthem to affect will reprove,\n\n285\n00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.380\nrevalidate who they are overtime.\n\n286\n00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.422\nThis is called reproofing.\n\n287\n00:14:40.422 --> 00:14:42.816\nThey have to reauthenticate\nthrough this system.\n\n288\n00:14:42.816 --> 00:14:47.265\nAs a result of that somebody can't execute\nwhat's know as a replay attack where they\n\n289\n00:14:47.265 --> 00:14:50.650\ncan effectively come in and\njust reuse the session credential to\n\n290\n00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.250\nreconstitute that session and\nbring it back up.\n\n291\n00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.030\nWere preventing that from happening.\n\n292\n00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.510\nSo pairing session time\nouts with replay or\n\n293\n00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:01.550\nanti replay technology prevents\na lot of these issues and concerns.\n\n294\n00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:03.660\nSo we do wanna make sure\nwere thinking about that.\n\n295\n00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:07.300\nWe wanna tunnel, but we also wanna encrypt\nthe tunnels and authenticate them.\n\n296\n00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.350\nTunneling on its own,\n\n297\n00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:12.770\nVPN on their own may not be enough unless\nwe are encrypting in other words right?\n\n298\n00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:17.600\nOn top of that so for instance the use\nof L2TP and we'll talk about L2TP,\n\n299\n00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.890\nlater 2 Tunneling Protocol and PTPP,\nPoint-to-Point Tunneling Protocol\n\n300\n00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:24.290\nin some of the upcoming episodes\nwith regards to networking and\n\n301\n00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.460\ntelecommunications security.\n\n302\n00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.060\nOne of the other domains that we will\nobviously have a lot to say about.\n\n303\n00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.200\nBut to preview that here for\njust a minute, with regards to L2TP in\n\n304\n00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.250\nparticular, layer 2 Tunneling Protocol,\nwhich is going to be very common today.\n\n305\n00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.020\nWhich we probably are all using,\nand have used for many years now.\n\n306\n00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.080\nWe don't just implement L2TP because\nL2TP by itself does not encrypt,\n\n307\n00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.440\nit does not authenticate.\n\n308\n00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.270\nAll it does is tunnel.\n\n309\n00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.720\nIt does that very well but\na tunnel without security\n\n310\n00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.180\nis really just nothing more than\nanother way of transmitting data.\n\n311\n00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.399\nBut it's still transmitting data in the\nclear, it's just a little bit harder for\n\n312\n00:15:57.399 --> 00:15:59.042\nus to see the data cuz it's in the tunnel.\n\n313\n00:15:59.042 --> 00:16:01.099\nBut no big deal,\nwe could drill through the tunnel and\n\n314\n00:16:01.099 --> 00:16:03.581\nstill understand what's there\nif you don't encrypt the data.\n\n315\n00:16:03.581 --> 00:16:04.800\nThat's not hard to do at all.\n\n316\n00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.330\nSo L2TP by itself is not enough.\n\n317\n00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:08.830\nWe have to know enough.\n\n318\n00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:13.092\nWe have to understand enough to understand\nto know that L2TP must be implemented\n\n319\n00:16:13.092 --> 00:16:14.230\nwith IPsec.\n\n320\n00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:17.820\nSo what you will often will hear about\nhopefully if your doing this the right way\n\n321\n00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:20.820\nis that you will hear L2TP\nwith IPsec is implemented.\n\n322\n00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.800\nIPsec stands for IP security.\n\n323\n00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.820\nIPsec brings in the authentication\nthrough authentication headers, and\n\n324\n00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.180\nthe encryption through encapsulating\nsecurity payload functionality\n\n325\n00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.200\nto both encrypt and, or\nencrypt and authenticate.\n\n326\n00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.100\nAnd as a result we have integrity.\n\n327\n00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.264\nWe have non-repudiation.\n\n328\n00:16:36.264 --> 00:16:37.280\nProof of origin.\n\n329\n00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.100\nWe also have confidentiality.\n\n330\n00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.560\nBy pairing the two together\nwith a tunneling protocol\n\n331\n00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.830\nwe create an incredibly secure\nsolution that both over the web and\n\n332\n00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:50.790\nwith mobile devices can be enabled for\nus to communicate.\n\n333\n00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.290\nAnd we mitigate vulnerabilities and\nwe minimize them as a result of that.\n\n334\n00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:58.070\nThis is the kind of thought process\nthat a CISSP needs to engage in, and\n\n335\n00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.960\nI'll remind you yet again of\nsomething I've told you many times.\n\n336\n00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.000\nYou may not be an expert at any one\nof these technologies or areas.\n\n337\n00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.640\nYou may not have a clue as to what I\njust described to you about L2TP and\n\n338\n00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.940\nIPsec, and that's okay.\n\n339\n00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.780\nThere's nothing wrong with that, and\nI'm not kidding when I say this.\n\n340\n00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.960\nI'm being very serious now.\n\n341\n00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.960\nYou may not understand that technology,\ncuz you don't work with it everyday.\n\n342\n00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.220\nThat's fine.\nIf you're not doing networking,\n\n343\n00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.180\nif you're not doing routing,\n\n344\n00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:23.760\nif you're not doing packet management on\na regular basis this is not your thing.\n\n345\n00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.590\nYou may be the cryptography expert,\nyou may be the policy expert,\n\n346\n00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:30.310\nyou may be the system engineering\nexpert in your world.\n\n347\n00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:34.560\nThose people have important roles to play\nas well, but they may not be expert at\n\n348\n00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.785\nwhat I just talked about, and\nif that's you that's fine.\n\n349\n00:17:37.785 --> 00:17:40.005\nYou have to partner with people that are,\nand\n\n350\n00:17:40.005 --> 00:17:44.485\nyou have to get really good as a CISSP at\nunderstanding what your limitations are,\n\n351\n00:17:44.485 --> 00:17:49.125\nand finding out how to augment them with\nadditional skills inside the organization\n\n352\n00:17:49.125 --> 00:17:53.455\nthat can help you to achieve that security\nprofile that we're talking about.\n\n353\n00:17:53.455 --> 00:17:55.425\nHow do you get incrementally\nbetter every day?\n\n354\n00:17:55.425 --> 00:17:57.370\nHow do you do something\ndifferently every day?\n\n355\n00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.810\nYou may have to ask for\nhelp is what I'm suggesting to you, and\n\n356\n00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:02.320\nfinding out the people that\nare good at these things\n\n357\n00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.040\nis part of what a CISSP's\nresponsibilities are.\n\n358\n00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.750\nAnd then pairing that with\nthe understanding of how to manage\n\n359\n00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.620\nthe implementation of that\nsolution they suggest\n\n360\n00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.330\nis also the part of\na CISSP's responsibilities.\n\n361\n00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.940\nWant to make sure we're aware of that\nas we think about mobile devices and\n\n362\n00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.200\nvulnerabilities associated\nwith them as well.\n\n363\n00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.260\nPotential vectors or\n\n364\n00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.910\nattacks from mobile devices that\nwe have to be concerned about.\n\n365\n00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.390\nSMS messages right.\n\n366\n00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:25.380\nPeople can send you a short text message,\n\n367\n00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:28.430\nsend you information that could\nsend you off to download something.\n\n368\n00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.360\nYou may download malware directly\non to the machine on to the phone\n\n369\n00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:33.490\nby receiving that.\n\n370\n00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.140\nSomebody may send you an out\nof band communication\n\n371\n00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.660\ngiving you an authentication\ncode to a website.\n\n372\n00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.650\nThey may send you the incorrect code and\nsend you to the wrong website, and\n\n373\n00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:43.310\nas a result you may be compromised.\n\n374\n00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.540\nThese are things we have to think about.\n\n375\n00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.940\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth,\ninfrared enabled devices.\n\n376\n00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.640\nHow often have you inadvertently\nassociated with somebody when\n\n377\n00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.750\nyou meant to associate with your own\ndevice when you're using Bluetooth?\n\n378\n00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:54.250\nRight?\n\n379\n00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.000\nHappens.\n\n380\n00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.910\nBluetooth is nice.\n\n381\n00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:57.720\nIt's cool technology.\n\n382\n00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:58.420\nIt's fun.\n\n383\n00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.300\nIt's what I call consumer technology.\n\n384\n00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.970\nMike knows my opinion about\nconsumer technology, right?\n\n385\n00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:06.240\nI can't say those words on the air because\nthe FCC gets very upset with us when\n\n386\n00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.410\nwe use those words.\n\n387\n00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.180\nI don't like it.\n\n388\n00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.010\nLet's put it that way.\n\n389\n00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.210\nI have a very strong opinion about it.\n\n390\n00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:15.480\nI don't believe it's appropriate\nin the enterprise security space.\n\n391\n00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.400\nLet me be clear.\n\n392\n00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.700\nNow this is my opinion that I'm sharing\nwith you for a very important reason.\n\n393\n00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.700\nThese technologies can be used securely,\nbut you have to understand the limitations\n\n394\n00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.850\nof what these technologies\noffer you by way of security.\n\n395\n00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.030\nBluetooth is basically\nan open connect standard.\n\n396\n00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:34.750\nAny device within three to five\nfeet potentially can associate\n\n397\n00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.350\nif you allow it to.\n\n398\n00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:40.310\nNow it's not just about the association\ncuz we can block association, but\n\n399\n00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:43.860\nI may just need to connect to\nthe device in order to transmit malware\n\n400\n00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.440\nwithout associating.\n\n401\n00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.687\nSo I may actually be able to still infect\nyour device something called blue jacking\n\n402\n00:19:49.687 --> 00:19:55.400\nor blue scarfing, which are different\nattack vectors across Bluetooth solutions\n\n403\n00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.760\ncan be executed without the ability\nto authenticate through the device.\n\n404\n00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.020\nI just have to connect, and\nif you enable Bluetooth, and\n\n405\n00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.240\nyou allow Bluetooth to run and\nBluetooth is not protected\n\n406\n00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.800\nwhen it is running it's running open you\nopen yourself up to this kind of concern.\n\n407\n00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.600\nAgain knowledge of the environment,\nknowledge of the situation and operational\n\n408\n00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.610\nenvironment you are asked to take on is\ncritical, is crucial to your success.\n\n409\n00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:21.340\nI'm not saying you gotta be an expert at\neverything, but I am saying the things\n\n410\n00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:24.390\nthat you don't know can come back\nto haunt you if you're not careful.\n\n411\n00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.750\nSo please be aware of that, all right?\n\n412\n00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.550\nAre there useful standards out there for\nmobile device management?\n\n413\n00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:30.440\nAbsolutely.\n\n414\n00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.410\nWe've talked about lots and\nlots and the standards.\n\n415\n00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.030\nThere are many more of them\nthat may be valuable to you.\n\n416\n00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:38.290\nI'll throw a few out there for\nyou just for giggles.\n\n417\n00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:41.359\n840-R3 Guide to\nEnterprise Patch Management.\n\n418\n00:20:41.359 --> 00:20:42.821\nI think we mentioned that at some point.\n\n419\n00:20:42.821 --> 00:20:46.990\n800-121-R1 specifically will give\nyou a Bluetooth security guide to\n\n420\n00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:50.170\nimplementation based on what\nI was just talking about.\n\n421\n00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.870\nBlue jacking for instance as an attack.\n\n422\n00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:56.110\n800-121R1 will help you figure\nout how not to fall prey to that.\n\n423\n00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.460\nAside from just turning off Bluetooth,\nwhich would obviously be the quickest and\n\n424\n00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.115\neasiest way to do that.\n\n425\n00:21:01.115 --> 00:21:04.645\n800-124R1 Guideline for\nmanaging the security of mobile devices\n\n426\n00:21:04.645 --> 00:21:08.145\nin the enterprise all up security for\nmobile device management overall.\n\n427\n00:21:08.145 --> 00:21:09.275\nThese are all useful for\n\n428\n00:21:09.275 --> 00:21:13.155\nyou as device standards and standards\noverall that will help you to manage and\n\n429\n00:21:13.155 --> 00:21:15.805\nunderstand and assess vulnerabilities\nwithin the mobile space.\n\n430\n00:21:15.805 --> 00:21:18.825\nWe want to turn our\nattention to devices and\n\n431\n00:21:18.825 --> 00:21:20.555\ncyber physical systems that are embedded.\n\n432\n00:21:20.555 --> 00:21:23.357\nICS and\nSCADA systems fall into this category.\n\n433\n00:21:23.357 --> 00:21:28.135\nCyber physical systems are gonna be smart\nnetwork systems that have embedded censors\n\n434\n00:21:28.135 --> 00:21:31.020\nin them that effectively are able\nto communicate with each other, and\n\n435\n00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.580\nas a result of that can\nactually then take action.\n\n436\n00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:38.350\nThey can turn a valve on or off, they can\nopen a spigot, they can control flow.\n\n437\n00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.630\nThese are the kind of things that are done\nfor instance in power generation plants,\n\n438\n00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:45.910\nin gasoline distillation plants,\nin places where we have\n\n439\n00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.950\nhuge volumes of infrastructure most of it\nif not all of it is remotely managed, and\n\n440\n00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.550\nwe have to then figure out how\nto turn things on and off.\n\n441\n00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:56.670\nAnd this is where cyber physical, ICS,\nand SCADA systems typically play.\n\n442\n00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:01.370\nPower generation, manufacturing,\nthese kinds of systems.\n\n443\n00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:02.730\nWhen you think about a dam for\n\n444\n00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:06.260\ninstance that has control valves\nto open and allow water to flow.\n\n445\n00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:08.710\nThese kinds of things\nare controlled by computers today.\n\n446\n00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:12.370\nThere's nobody sitting there cranking a\nwheel around trying to open that valve and\n\n447\n00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:13.940\nthat overflow connection.\n\n448\n00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:16.400\nYou've got a computer that\nopens that up automatically for\n\n449\n00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.550\nyou based on certain indicators and\nmonitoring that takes place.\n\n450\n00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:20.780\nThat would be a cool job, but\n\n451\n00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.561\nit would really kind of suck\nduring the rainy season.\n\n452\n00:22:23.561 --> 00:22:25.247\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're out there trying turn that\n\n453\n00:22:25.247 --> 00:22:26.787\nwhole thing getting wet all the time, but\n\n454\n00:22:26.787 --> 00:22:29.350\nimagine the biceps you would\nultimately generate from.\n\n455\n00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.700\nCrank open all that stuff.\n\n456\n00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.380\nBig guns, right?\n\n457\n00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.100\nBig guns.\nSo yeah this is all computer controlled.\n\n458\n00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.780\nIt has been for a long, long time.\n\n459\n00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:36.980\nSo, how do we safeguard?\n\n460\n00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.450\nHow do we assess vulnerabilities?\n\n461\n00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:40.070\nHow do we mitigate them in these systems?\n\n462\n00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.220\nThis is a huge area of concern today.\n\n463\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.210\nIt's one of the biggest areas\nof concern today by the way.\n\n464\n00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.200\nCyber security, which is really\na generic all up term we use today\n\n465\n00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.750\nis really focused primarily in\nthis particular space over all.\n\n466\n00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.220\nThere's a lot of other\nthings that go with it, but\n\n467\n00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:57.750\nit focuses a lot in this particular area\n\n468\n00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:01.530\nbecause we can't figure out how to nail\nthe security on these systems properly.\n\n469\n00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:05.760\nWe are potentially allowing bad actors\nto get into mission critical systems.\n\n470\n00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.420\nPower generation and potentially\nturn them off if we're not careful.\n\n471\n00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.200\nI mean imagine what could happen if a bad\nactor was able to figure out how to get\n\n472\n00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.500\ninto a nuclear reactor control system and\neffectively stop the cooling that is\n\n473\n00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:21.910\nessential to the safe management and\nsafe operation of that nuclear reactor.\n\n474\n00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.550\nYou would have a meltdown along\nthe lines of what we saw in Chernobyl or\n\n475\n00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.870\nalong the lines of Three Mile Island\nwhich almost happened, but\n\n476\n00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:31.260\ndidn't obviously happen to\nthe extent that Chernobyl did.\n\n477\n00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.500\nIf you're old enough to remember Three\nMile Island or old enough to remember\n\n478\n00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:38.420\nChernobyl you remember what could happen,\nyou remember what did happen.\n\n479\n00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:42.930\nThe Fukushima reactor in Japan that was\ntaken offline because of a tsunami that\n\n480\n00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.580\nbasically blew out\nthe cooling capabilities and\n\n481\n00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.400\nmelted down the core of that reactor\nflooding all the water in the containment\n\n482\n00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.680\nvessel with radioactivity that\nnow is leaked out is continuing\n\n483\n00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.480\nto be a huge environmental concern for\neverybody that lives in that area.\n\n484\n00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.394\nAnd for all of us around the planet,\nbecause that radiation is actually in\n\n485\n00:23:59.394 --> 00:24:02.080\nthe ocean it is slowly but\nsurely making it's way around the world.\n\n486\n00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.134\nSo stop drinking sea water right.\n\n487\n00:24:04.134 --> 00:24:04.748\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n488\n00:24:04.748 --> 00:24:07.798\nthe reality is you know these are three\nexamples of what can go horribly,\n\n489\n00:24:07.798 --> 00:24:08.557\nhorribly wrong.\n\n490\n00:24:08.557 --> 00:24:13.005\nNot because somebody hacked into a system,\nbut because the systems that manage these\n\n491\n00:24:13.005 --> 00:24:17.240\ninfrastructure platforms for us were\nnot able to do their job the right way.\n\n492\n00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.050\nSomething went wrong.\n\n493\n00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.690\nI'm not suggesting for a minute it had\nanything to do with cyber hacking,\n\n494\n00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:21.920\nit did not, let me be clear.\n\n495\n00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.650\nI don't want any rumors to start, [LAUGH]\nright, we'll see like in a month from now.\n\n496\n00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:30.020\nSecurity expert claims that cyber\nhacking was at the heart of\n\n497\n00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.800\nthe Fukushima reactor problem.\n\n498\n00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.250\nRight, we don't want that to happen.\n\n499\n00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:38.120\nBut what I am suggesting to you is that\nif hacking replaced the tsunami related\n\n500\n00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.610\ndamage that was done, it could easily have\nbeen because of that that the same action,\n\n501\n00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.760\nand ultimately the same outcome,\nwould take place.\n\n502\n00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.730\nAnd so this is a huge, huge liability for\nus, and we have to be aware of this.\n\n503\n00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.290\nIn CPS, cyber physical control systems,\nthey're not just found there.\n\n504\n00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:56.150\nBuilding automation today is a huge area,\na very, very big area for people.\n\n505\n00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:57.930\nHome automation, a big area for people.\n\n506\n00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:02.037\nHow many of you are using, what is it, the\nnest home control systems, one of the big,\n\n507\n00:25:02.037 --> 00:25:03.370\npopular ones today?\n\n508\n00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.980\nRight, you may be hooking up everything\nin your house to the Internet,\n\n509\n00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.651\nallowing your cell phone,\nyour smart app device, right, I hate apps,\n\n510\n00:25:10.651 --> 00:25:12.660\nI can't say how many times I hate apps.\n\n511\n00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.503\nSo using apps to be able to control\nstuff like that is really one of\n\n512\n00:25:15.503 --> 00:25:17.250\nthe key concerns we have here, right?\n\n513\n00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.130\nThink about those\ncommercials you would see.\n\n514\n00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:22.090\nAnd AT&T did a great job\nwith this years ago.\n\n515\n00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.160\nThey would show us all these commercials\nabout what the future would look like.\n\n516\n00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.390\nYou may remember seeing some\nof them on TV over the years.\n\n517\n00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.690\nYeah, we'll bring it to you, right?\n\n518\n00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:32.400\nThe theme was basically, hey,\nthis is what it's like today.\n\n519\n00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.555\nThis is the future.\n\n520\n00:25:33.555 --> 00:25:34.580\nWho's gonna get you there?\n\n521\n00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.600\nAT&T's gonna deliver that service to you.\n\n522\n00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.540\nSo they would have the one where\nthe mother with the child in the car by\n\n523\n00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:44.760\nherself, drives up to the dark house, dark\nand scary landscapes, all dark at night.\n\n524\n00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.700\nAll of a sudden she clicks one button,\nright?\n\n525\n00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.340\nAnd the house lights up,\nthe garage door opens.\n\n526\n00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.460\nThermostat lowers,\nthe dinner's cooked, right?\n\n527\n00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.300\nAll that stuff happens.\n\n528\n00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.990\nBut the point was that we\nwould automate the home.\n\n529\n00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.550\nThat's happening today,\nthat's a reality, right?\n\n530\n00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:02.860\nWe see another one where doctors\nare collaborating about an online scan for\n\n531\n00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.670\nan x-ray or\nsomething in different countries,\n\n532\n00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:07.880\nbecause the expert's in one place, and the\ndoctor that needs the help's in the other,\n\n533\n00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.250\nand the patient's laying there.\n\n534\n00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.580\nRight?\nAnd AT&T says, oh,\n\n535\n00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:14.390\nwait, now we can transmit that in\nhigh speed and real time and hi-def\n\n536\n00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.660\nover the wire securely, and we'll be\nable to collaborate and do that for you.\n\n537\n00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.180\nNow these are all things\nthat are going on today.\n\n538\n00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.130\nThis is the reality of our world.\n\n539\n00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.910\nCyber physical control systems and\nintegration and\n\n540\n00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:27.410\nthe technology that brings\nus the Internet of things,\n\n541\n00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:31.140\nwhat we call convergence, is taking\nplace today, whether you like it or not.\n\n542\n00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.400\nYou can control your home\nwith an app on your phone.\n\n543\n00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.865\nIf you don't like your home,\nget a new app.\n\n544\n00:26:35.865 --> 00:26:37.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's kinda how it works, right?\n\n545\n00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.470\nWe are hooking our cars\nup to the Internet.\n\n546\n00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:42.880\nThat may or\nmay not be a good thing, right?\n\n547\n00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.420\nThe fact that car systems\nare going to be IP enabled.\n\n548\n00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.736\nTesla, for instance, is leading the drive\non this where they have announced\n\n549\n00:26:48.736 --> 00:26:51.439\npublicly, and they are indeed\ndoing this with their new cars,\n\n550\n00:26:51.439 --> 00:26:54.520\nthat they're opening up APIs to allow\nthe car to be hooked up to the web.\n\n551\n00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.678\nSo they can push auto-updates\nout to update firmware, but\n\n552\n00:26:57.678 --> 00:27:01.030\nthey also can do diagnostic work and\nschedule repairs.\n\n553\n00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:05.420\nThat all sounds great till you figure\nout how a bad actor can use that\n\n554\n00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:10.060\nto take control of the car and instead\nof updating your firmware, I don't know,\n\n555\n00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.660\nperhaps take control of the safety systems\nand disable them and who knows what.\n\n556\n00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.920\nObviously, that would be catastrophic and\nI'm not suggesting for\n\n557\n00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.500\na minute that that does happen today.\n\n558\n00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.130\nBut I am suggesting that it is possible.\n\n559\n00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:24.860\nAnother biggie that I often love talking\nabout that happened recently with regards\n\n560\n00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:29.700\nto CPS and convergence and all this, some\nbright genius in the avionics industry\n\n561\n00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.570\ndecided it would be a wonderful idea\nto provide wireless Internet on planes.\n\n562\n00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.160\nThat part is awesome, right?\n\n563\n00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.600\nGogo Wi-Fi, two thumbs up, I love it.\n\n564\n00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.700\nBut here's the downside,\n\n565\n00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.470\nthe dark side people don't\noften talk about or know about.\n\n566\n00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:45.630\nThe same Gogo Wi-Fi Internet\nconnections that are set up on planes\n\n567\n00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:50.050\nhappen to be tapped into the same control\nplatforms that the avionics run on.\n\n568\n00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:52.890\nNow, people don't often know this and\ndon't hear much about this.\n\n569\n00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:57.340\nBut in the most current designs,\nAirbus, Boeing, etc, and for\n\n570\n00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.950\nseveral years now,\nwithout direct common public knowledge,\n\n571\n00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:04.520\nthose systems have effectively been\nrunning together on the same network.\n\n572\n00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.080\nLet me make it very clear for you.\n\n573\n00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.400\nWhat I mean is, in theory, although\nnobody's done it yet, that somebody could\n\n574\n00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.957\nconnect to the Gogo Internet wireless\nin the plane, and if they had\n\n575\n00:28:13.957 --> 00:28:18.360\nenough knowledge, and by the way, the\nknowledge to do this is out there, right?\n\n576\n00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.010\nAs Agent Mulder used to say, and\nScully, right, on the X-Files,\n\n577\n00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:22.610\nthe truth is out there.\n\n578\n00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.420\nThe knowledge is out there on the web.\n\n579\n00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.900\nAll you have to do is know enough\nto go figure out how to find it.\n\n580\n00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.377\nIn other words, the schematics,\nthe diagrams, the knowledge,\n\n581\n00:28:29.377 --> 00:28:31.690\nall the things that you would\nneed are potentially out there.\n\n582\n00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:36.010\nIf somebody figured out how to jump from\nthe wireless connection into the main\n\n583\n00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:40.929\nsystem through the avionics interconnect,\nwhich is not impossible to do, somebody,\n\n584\n00:28:40.929 --> 00:28:45.800\nin theory, could hack directly into the\nplane's control systems, either on board.\n\n585\n00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.027\nOr here's the really scary part,\npotentially from the ground,\n\n586\n00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:52.430\nbecause you have a wireless connection\nthat is going from the plane to\n\n587\n00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.850\nthe ground in order to allow\nyou to do what you do.\n\n588\n00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:58.919\nYou don't think about these things, but\nthese things are happening around you.\n\n589\n00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.985\nNobody's ever gonna fly again.\n\n590\n00:29:00.985 --> 00:29:02.528\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Nobody's gonna drive a car,\n\n591\n00:29:02.528 --> 00:29:04.910\nnobody's gonna ever use their\nsmartphone or an app again.\n\n592\n00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:05.940\n>> Horse and buggy all the way.\n\n593\n00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:07.640\n>> I screwed everybody, right?\n\n594\n00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.900\nWe're going back to the Stone Age.\n\n595\n00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.870\nYou ever see that commercial?\n\n596\n00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.680\nThe one where it's Little Caesar's\ncommercial, where the guy is sitting\n\n597\n00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.360\nthere with the family saying, I don't\nwanna give my password, all that stuff?\n\n598\n00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.030\nHot and ready pizza.\n\n599\n00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:18.880\nWe're going off the grid, the crazy guy.\n\n600\n00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:22.490\nWe're going off the grid,\nnow they're like sitting in a cave.\n\n601\n00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:25.180\nAnd, oh,\nyou could have just done Little Caesar's.\n\n602\n00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.490\nWe're back on the grid,\nright, for five bucks.\n\n603\n00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:28.630\nI mean, it's kinda like that.\n\n604\n00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:32.630\nI don't wanna scare you and make it seem,\nhonestly, like it's dire and\n\n605\n00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:33.840\nit's doomsday out there.\n\n606\n00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.370\nIt is, but we want you to be happy.\n\n607\n00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.590\nWe don't want to tell you that.\n\n608\n00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.110\nSo just think good thoughts, right.\n\n609\n00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:41.120\nAs Bobby McFerrin would say,\ndon't worry, always be happy, right.\n\n610\n00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.580\nLook, there's a lot of problems out there.\n\n611\n00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.420\nI don't wanna make light of this.\n\n612\n00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.502\nBut I do want you to understand that what\nI'm describing to you are absolutely worst\n\n613\n00:29:47.502 --> 00:29:50.498\ncase scenarios that have never\ncome to fruition as of today.\n\n614\n00:29:50.498 --> 00:29:53.433\nSo we wanna understand that\nwhile the capabilities and\n\n615\n00:29:53.433 --> 00:29:57.963\npotentially the vulnerabilities are there,\nthe theme of the discussion about this\n\n616\n00:29:57.963 --> 00:30:02.492\nentire area is that we have to understand\nthem, identify them, associate controls\n\n617\n00:30:02.492 --> 00:30:06.670\nwith them to mitigate and minimize them so\nthat they don't come to fruition.\n\n618\n00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:10.612\nThat we don't wind up sitting in a plane,\nwhile somebody takes it over from\n\n619\n00:30:10.612 --> 00:30:14.710\na wireless access point and decides to\ntake it somewhere you don't wanna go.\n\n620\n00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:16.470\nThat's not a good outcome, right?\n\n621\n00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:20.250\nBut that could happen, if somebody was\nsmart enough to figure out how to do this.\n\n622\n00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:21.570\nWe obviously wanna prevent that, and\n\n623\n00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:24.350\nthere are steps that have been taken\nby the way in this particular area to\n\n624\n00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:27.120\nprevent that from happening when\nthis vulnerability came to light.\n\n625\n00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.580\nSo this is no longer as big of an issue as\nit could have been a couple of years ago.\n\n626\n00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:34.520\nBut the fact that it was even allowed to\nget to that point is incredibly scary.\n\n627\n00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.119\nAll right?\nSo\n\n628\n00:30:35.119 --> 00:30:38.770\nwe do wanna make sure we are smart\nabout how we approach these issues.\n\n629\n00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:42.590\nWe have to understand the nature of the\ntechnology we use, we have to understand\n\n630\n00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.440\nthe nature of the vulnerabilities that\nexist in these platforms, and we have to\n\n631\n00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.310\nbe willing to admit that we may not be up\nto the task of securing them by ourselves.\n\n632\n00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:51.930\nThis is very, very important stuff, right?\n\n633\n00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:56.442\nSo ICS, Scata, these embedded industrial\ncontrol systems, cyber physical systems,\n\n634\n00:30:56.442 --> 00:31:00.593\nall these things, we have to take the same\nsteps to safeguard them that we would any\n\n635\n00:31:00.593 --> 00:31:01.940\nother system.\n\n636\n00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:06.091\nPatch management, vulnerability\nassessment, authentication control,\n\n637\n00:31:06.091 --> 00:31:10.190\nmulti-factor authentication,\nsecure protocols, encryption.\n\n638\n00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:11.910\nThis is the standard mantra.\n\n639\n00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:13.580\nWe use this with every discussion.\n\n640\n00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.320\nWe've been using this for the last\nfive episodes in this general area for\n\n641\n00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.010\nall of the discussions,\nall these things are important.\n\n642\n00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:23.985\nJust because we change the name\nthat's gonna be there, mobile,\n\n643\n00:31:23.985 --> 00:31:26.890\nweb, ICS,\nwe still have to do the same things.\n\n644\n00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:28.993\nWe still ultimately have to be smart,\n\n645\n00:31:28.993 --> 00:31:33.141\nwe still ultimately have to understand\nthat we are using our common sense.\n\n646\n00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:37.746\nBut also our knowledge and our skills to\nachieve the end results, the security\n\n647\n00:31:37.746 --> 00:31:43.195\nprofile and ultimately the protection that\nwe need and we are charged with as CISSPs.\n\n648\n00:31:43.195 --> 00:31:45.305\n>> Very good, Adam, again,\na lot of great stuff.\n\n649\n00:31:45.305 --> 00:31:49.135\nI'm going to buy my horse and\nbuggy this evening and parking my car.\n\n650\n00:31:49.135 --> 00:31:50.496\n>> Go Amish.\n>> [LAUGH] No, really,\n\n651\n00:31:50.496 --> 00:31:53.883\nit's a great look at it and\nreally makes us think about this, and\n\n652\n00:31:53.883 --> 00:31:57.522\nhopefully it makes you guys wanna be\na CISSP and follow that code, and\n\n653\n00:31:57.522 --> 00:32:01.130\nprotect me from being able to [CROSSTALK]\n[LAUGH] I wanna be able to fly.\n\n654\n00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:03.760\n>> Mike needs to protection from himself,\nthat's what Mike needs.\n\n655\n00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.752\n>> I don't wanna be able to fly.\n\n656\n00:32:04.752 --> 00:32:06.730\nSo and again, thanks, Adam, for\nall of that great information.\n\n657\n00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:10.636\nAnd

--> 00:00:17.650\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.800\nToday, we're gonna be doing our CISSP\ncontent Specifically, we're gonna be\n\n5\n00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.350\nlooking at applying cryptography,\nwe've done a few episodes now on\n\n6\n00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.460\ndifferent types of cryptography, a lot of\nvocabulary, a lot of information there.\n\n7\n00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.980\nNow, we want to take a look at actually\nputting it in place, using it and\n\n8\n00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.750\nsome of the ways we do that.\n\n9\n00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.640\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.440\nHow's at going Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.690\n>> Good, good.\n\n12\n00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.710\nLet's talk a little bit\nabout applying cryptography.\n\n13\n00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.610\nReally, applying cryptography is first and\nforemost\n\n14\n00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.730\nabout reviewing what we already know about\ncryptography because in order to apply it,\n\n15\n00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.300\nwe've gotta make sure we understand it.\n\n16\n00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.210\nNow, we've spent a lot of time,\n\n17\n00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.760\nyou've invested a lot of your\ntime in watching episodes.\n\n18\n00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.910\nMike and I spend a lot of time preparing\nthem and delivering them to you so\n\n19\n00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.810\nyou understand what those things are.\n\n20\n00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.971\nWe're not gonna redo that whole thing\ncuz that would take way too long.\n\n21\n00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:02.546\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n22\n00:01:02.546 --> 00:01:05.136\nMike would then throw down\nthe microphone and walk out in protest.\n\n23\n00:01:05.136 --> 00:01:06.191\nSo we're not gonna do that.\n\n24\n00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What we are gonna do is just quickly\n\n25\n00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.270\nremind you about what\nthe cryptographic process looks like.\n\n26\n00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.840\nAnd what I mean is simply\nwe take plain text,\n\n27\n00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.990\nwe run it through some sort\nof cryptographic system.\n\n28\n00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.860\nWhich is effectively an algorithm using\none or more keys, either a private key or\n\n29\n00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.950\na private public key pair to change\n\n30\n00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.350\nto effectively transform the plain\ntext to what we call cypher text.\n\n31\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.830\nThat's if we run through it in ciphering.\n\n32\n00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.620\nIf we were going to decipher, we\neffectively run in backwards in reverse.\n\n33\n00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.000\nWe take cypher text turn it back\nthrough the crypto system and\n\n34\n00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.860\nout the far end comes plain text.\n\n35\n00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.040\nSo, if we start from that assumption with\nthe crypto graphic process being defined\n\n36\n00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.680\nas such then we could talk\nabout the different things\n\n37\n00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.950\nthat are associated with it.\n\n38\n00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.770\nWe're not going to go back and\n\n39\n00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.550\nhave that whole conversation\nagain about different key types.\n\n40\n00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.200\nWe're not going to talk about\nsymmetric versus asymmetric.\n\n41\n00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.850\nWe're not going to talk about why we\nneed a public key versus a private key.\n\n42\n00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.920\nWe've done all that.\n\n43\n00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.120\nBut we are going to remind you of\nis that the use of cryptography\n\n44\n00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.110\nis fundamentally important to\nensure confidentiality and\n\n45\n00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.280\npotentially to ensure integrity\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n46\n00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.060\nThere are different types of cryptography.\n\n47\n00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.600\nOne of the ones we havent talked\nabout until now is something\n\n48\n00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.870\ncalled quantum cryptography, which is a\nrelatively newer version of cryptography.\n\n49\n00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.880\nIt uses the law of science as\nopposed to the laws of mathematics,\n\n50\n00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.930\nwhich do underlie the laws of science But\nspecifically, we're gonna use the laws of\n\n51\n00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.370\nphysics in order to be able to affectively\nsecure data using quantum cryptography.\n\n52\n00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.740\nNow, quantum cryptography is primarily\nstill a theoretical construct,\n\n53\n00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.080\nbecause we need quantum computers in order\nto be able to use quantum cryptography.\n\n54\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.980\nWe are moving in this direction slowly but\nsurely.\n\n55\n00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.610\nAnd over time, and most likely within\nwho knows how long, maybe five years,\n\n56\n00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.200\nten years, 20 years,\nhard to say exactly how long But\n\n57\n00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.720\nwithin our lifetime most likely,\nquantum cryptography and\n\n58\n00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.580\nquantum computers will actually be\navailable and they will be a reality.\n\n59\n00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.892\nEffectively what we do today is we use\ncomputers based on a very established and\n\n60\n00:02:58.892 --> 00:03:03.224\nwell-known and well-understood model,\nbut a model that has limitations.\n\n61\n00:03:03.224 --> 00:03:07.100\nA quantum computer is gonna be\na very different animal entirely.\n\n62\n00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.960\nIt's gonna be based on\nthe laws of physics and\n\n63\n00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.940\nthe way in which energy is transformed.\n\n64\n00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.090\nIn order to be able to effectively\nachieve transformation,\n\n65\n00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.860\nwe have to understand how to\nmanage energy in different forms.\n\n66\n00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.570\nAnd when we can build a quantum computer\nin anything other than a very expensive\n\n67\n00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.550\nscience lab.\n\n68\n00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.620\nMoving protons around from here to\nthere and spelling out IBM, which was\n\n69\n00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.760\nwhat the example of quantum computing that\nactually has occurred up until now was.\n\n70\n00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.740\nSo, somebody has successfully done this,\nbut they've done it on a very small scale,\n\n71\n00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.140\nis what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n72\n00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.640\nWhen we translate that into a production\nlevel quantum computer that's commercially\n\n73\n00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.060\navailable, then quantum cryptography\nwill actually be something to consider.\n\n74\n00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.200\nBut the idea is that basically\nthe ideas around security and\n\n75\n00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.290\ncryptography that we know of today will\nbe radically transformed by applying\n\n76\n00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.960\nthe same laws, the same rules of physics\nthat help us to understand the universe,\n\n77\n00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.620\nto the idea of a quantum computer\nas well as quantum cryptography,\n\n78\n00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.010\nto safeguard information\nwithin a computer.\n\n79\n00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.300\nSo, just a look ahead if\nyou will into the future.\n\n80\n00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.620\nRemember the cryptographic\nsystems provide confidentiality,\n\n81\n00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.630\npotentially integrity, and certainly\nsafeguard and provide for availability.\n\n82\n00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.800\nBut, they also do other things.\n\n83\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.440\nWe've talked about non repudiation.\n\n84\n00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.020\nWe've talked about authentication and\n\n85\n00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.320\naccess control as being additional\nfeatures of cryptographic systems so\n\n86\n00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.090\nwe just want to make sure\nwe're aware of those.\n\n87\n00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.980\nRemind ourselves of those as well.\n\n88\n00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.620\nThe cryptographic life cycle,\nthe idea of effectively taking plain text,\n\n89\n00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.820\nciphering it in tour and ciphering it\nto cypher text has been well explained,\n\n90\n00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.380\nhopefully and well understood by you.\n\n91\n00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.030\nThe cryptographic lifecycle is considered\nto be broken when somebody figures out\n\n92\n00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.740\nhow to steal the key or somehow compromise\nit and effectively without permission and\n\n93\n00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.300\nwithout rights, decipher data\nthat should be kept confidential.\n\n94\n00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.630\nSo, we do want to make sure we\nunderstand that a cryptographic function\n\n95\n00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.620\ncan be broken.\n\n96\n00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.930\nAnd we do want to make sure we understand\nwhat would break a cryptographic function.\n\n97\n00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.060\nAlgorithm Android protocol guidance and\ngovernance is also important.\n\n98\n00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.750\nWe've also talked about some places\nthat you can get guidance from this and\n\n99\n00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.890\nother places like that.\n\n100\n00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.010\nWe've talked about making good choices.\n\n101\n00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.010\nGovernance overall, should be applied\nto these architectural decisions.\n\n102\n00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.180\nThings such as cryptographic policies,\nthe use of acceptable standards,\n\n103\n00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.740\nthe understanding of how to use\nprocedures that will minimally or\n\n104\n00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.700\nrather minimally provide some protection,\nbut\n\n105\n00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.430\nalso minimally impact us negatively and\nminimize risk are also very important.\n\n106\n00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.390\nApproved cryptographic algorithms and\nkey sizes, for instance,\n\n107\n00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.570\nshould be stipulated in policies\nbefore we implement systems.\n\n108\n00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.040\nSo we talked about the issues associated\nwith the usage of DES today and\n\n109\n00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.560\nthe fact that we moved away from DES\ntowards AES and other algorithms that\n\n110\n00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.310\nare considered to be stronger because they\nhave variable key sizes that are bigger\n\n111\n00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.520\noverall than the key space, or rather, the\nkey size that DES was using to implement.\n\n112\n00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.440\nAs a result of that, a policy would\nstipulate that we should use only the most\n\n113\n00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.740\nsecure algorithms and\nwe should test the security.\n\n114\n00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.040\nThe voracity of those algorithms,\nin other words, should be challenged and\n\n115\n00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.040\ntested on a yearly basis.\n\n116\n00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.250\nThis will be an acceptable\nusage policy for algorithms and\n\n117\n00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.590\na good way to make a choice about the best\npossible algorithms available at the time.\n\n118\n00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.140\nSo, this will be one example\nof what we're talking about.\n\n119\n00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.360\nWe should have key generation,\nkey management, key escrow,\n\n120\n00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.080\nkey lifecycle capabilities built\ninto our crypto systems and\n\n121\n00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.400\nwe will talk about them in a little more\ndepth here over the next few minutes.\n\n122\n00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.290\nWant to make sure we have policies and\nstandards to guide that.\n\n123\n00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.570\nNIST has some documentation,\nrecommendations for this, and\n\n124\n00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.180\nit's one of the places you can look\nat to figure out how to do this,\n\n125\n00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.970\nif you're not sure, what to do,\nand specifically, how to do this.\n\n126\n00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.540\nObviously, keep in mind that it's\nunderstood that it's part of any risk\n\n127\n00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.310\nanalysis, looking at\nthe impact of cryptography.\n\n128\n00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.460\nIt's gonna be central to what we do.\n\n129\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.610\nWe've talked about the fact\nit could be a value add and\n\n130\n00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.240\ncan prevent exposure of confidentiality.\n\n131\n00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.350\nSo, effectively can minimize risk.\n\n132\n00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.870\nBut we also talk about the fact\nthere is risk directly associated\n\n133\n00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.900\nwith the use of cryptography, if we lose\nthe keys, for instance, the private key.\n\n134\n00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.500\nIf we lose that key and\nwe can not decrypt the data,\n\n135\n00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.690\nwe effectively run the risk of not being\nable to use the information anymore.\n\n136\n00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.360\nThis in and of itself should be identified\nas a risk and should be assessed as such.\n\n137\n00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.110\nWe'll talk about the importance and\nsignificance of this also.\n\n138\n00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.930\nWe may also want to touch on\ntheoretically as well as actually,\n\n139\n00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.440\nwhether we are going to export\nthe encryption controls that we are using.\n\n140\n00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.730\nSo, will we export the algorithms,\nfor instance, like AES?\n\n141\n00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:15.300\nWill we make them available to\nanybody who wants to use them?\n\n142\n00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.650\nWhat we tightly control them and\n\n143\n00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.800\nonly make them available to certain\nfriends or third part countries\n\n144\n00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.600\nthat stipulate they will obviously\nabide by certain rules in their use.\n\n145\n00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.335\nCertain algorithms and certain encryption\nsolutions are not available worldwide.\n\n146\n00:07:28.335 --> 00:07:32.133\nThere are certain countries on blacklists\nthat effectively are prevented\n\n147\n00:07:32.133 --> 00:07:35.869\nfrom being able to buy and use these\nalgorithms because we are concerned,\n\n148\n00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:39.967\nthe US or other countries, are concerned\nthat they will get these algorithms and\n\n149\n00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:42.677\neffectively try to use them\nto do a variety of things,\n\n150\n00:07:42.677 --> 00:07:45.530\nnone of which we would\nobviously think are acceptable.\n\n151\n00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.475\nSo, we talked about things in one of our\nvery early discussions, one of the earlier\n\n152\n00:07:50.475 --> 00:07:55.493\nepisodes In the system engineering as well\nas in the other conversations we had about\n\n153\n00:07:55.493 --> 00:08:00.440\nstandards such as ITAR and Wassenaar,\nthe arrangements that allow us to control,\n\n154\n00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.176\nand to minimize the use of Dual use goods\nand technologies because we're afraid\n\n155\n00:08:05.176 --> 00:08:09.530\nthat things like encryption controls\nmay fall into the wrong hands.\n\n156\n00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.154\nSo, we wanna keep that in mind and\n\n157\n00:08:11.154 --> 00:08:14.510\nthe CISSP has to be thinking\nabout these things as well.\n\n158\n00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.350\nIn order to then bring all this together,\n\n159\n00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.700\nwhat we have to do is dig a little bit\ndeeper into some of the technology I\n\n160\n00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.790\nmentioned, when we were talking\nabout assessment of vulnerabilities.\n\n161\n00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.790\nAnd we spent all that time drilling\ninto the discussion on encryption.\n\n162\n00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.986\nWe wanna revisit another\ndiscussion about PKI.\n\n163\n00:08:29.986 --> 00:08:33.660\nAnd we wanna revisit discussion\nabout digital certificates and\n\n164\n00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.290\nbring key management to be around those\ndiscussions in order to make this\n\n165\n00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.750\nkind of a full circle but also to give\nyou a better picture, if you will,\n\n166\n00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.900\nof how PKI and\ncertificates are going to act and look and\n\n167\n00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.035\nhow we can use them to achieve\nthe end results we're looking for,\n\n168\n00:08:47.035 --> 00:08:51.975\nwhich is secure transmission and secure\ncommunication of that overall discussion.\n\n169\n00:08:51.975 --> 00:08:55.255\nSo, or rather the overall information\nrelated to the discussion.\n\n170\n00:08:55.255 --> 00:08:58.480\nSo, when we think about PKI, we can\nsee it on the screen in front of us,\n\n171\n00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.148\nthat we have a diagram that helps to bring\nto life the thought process about PKI or\n\n172\n00:09:02.148 --> 00:09:03.553\npublic key infrastructure.\n\n173\n00:09:03.553 --> 00:09:05.440\nThat's what PKI stands for.\n\n174\n00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.290\nWe have a root certificate authority\nsitting at the top of diagram up there.\n\n175\n00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:13.096\nThere are some arrows flowing down into\nwhat are known as Intermediate CAs.\n\n176\n00:09:13.096 --> 00:09:16.050\nCA just stands for\nCertificate Authority generically.\n\n177\n00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.420\nAlthough I like saying that over and\nover and\n\n178\n00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.615\nover again, we're are just gonna\nabbreviate that going forward.\n\n179\n00:09:20.615 --> 00:09:23.405\nSo, a Root CA can be of one of two types,\n\n180\n00:09:23.405 --> 00:09:27.625\neither an Enterprise Root CA or\na Standalone Root CA.\n\n181\n00:09:27.625 --> 00:09:31.143\nAn Enterprise Root CA is gonna be\nassociated with a directory namespace.\n\n182\n00:09:31.143 --> 00:09:36.834\nSo, an LDAP Directory where it's\na standalone Enterprise Root CA,\n\n183\n00:09:36.834 --> 00:09:40.487\ncreating a third category of Root CA's.\n\n184\n00:09:40.487 --> 00:09:44.047\nSo, we have an Enterprise Root CA\nassociated with the directory service,\n\n185\n00:09:44.047 --> 00:09:48.417\nwe have a standalone Root CA, which is\ngoing to obviously as the name implies\n\n186\n00:09:48.417 --> 00:09:51.327\nbe outside the directory service\nnot connected to it, but\n\n187\n00:09:51.327 --> 00:09:53.090\nis still able to act as a root.\n\n188\n00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:56.850\nAct as the basis for the issuing of\ncertificates to intermediate and\n\n189\n00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.290\nsubordinate CAs,\n\n190\n00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.380\nwhich will then also create what\nwe know of as a chain of trust.\n\n191\n00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.260\nAnd we're gonna demonstrate that by\nshowing you a live certificate here in\n\n192\n00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:06.210\njust a moment.\n\n193\n00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:09.270\nBut before we get there let's make sure\nwe understand how we actually issue\n\n194\n00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.280\ncertificates.\n\n195\n00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.200\nSo, the Root CA is going\nto issue certificates to\n\n196\n00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.800\neither an intermediate\nand/or a subordinate CA.\n\n197\n00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.850\nSo, the arrows pointing down through\nthe hierarchies who create the pyramid\n\n198\n00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.840\nare gonna represent that issuing.\n\n199\n00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.060\nThose certificates are then\ngoing to be allowed to be used.\n\n200\n00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.470\nDown below the level that\nthey're issued at to validate\n\n201\n00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.120\nthings like the digital signature,\nto validate the identity,\n\n202\n00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.380\nto validate the service\nthat is being offered.\n\n203\n00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.780\nThey could be attached as you see in\nthe bottom there with the stick figures to\n\n204\n00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.700\neither Bob or Alice, although we haven't\nnamed them they're anonymous today.\n\n205\n00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.290\nAnd or\ncomputers that are gonna be sitting there.\n\n206\n00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.090\nEither a laptop, a desktop, whatever.\n\n207\n00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.370\nA mobile device.\n\n208\n00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.260\nWe can associate them with all\nsorts of things over there.\n\n209\n00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.460\nAnd we can see the certificates\nin other words are good for\n\n210\n00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.150\nboth users as well as for computers.\n\n211\n00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:02.950\nAnd we often will enroll a user\ncertificate and/or a computer certificate\n\n212\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.530\nfor dual use so we can digitally sign, and\n\n213\n00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:07.580\nwe can do other things with it for\ninstance.\n\n214\n00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.440\nSo, wanna make sure we understand\nthe general hierarchy.\n\n215\n00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.210\nNow, what we wanna do is,\nwe wanna go ahead and\n\n216\n00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.840\nwe wanna take a look at what\na real certificate looks like.\n\n217\n00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.350\nSo certificates, and Mike's gonna help\nme by bringing up the certificate,\n\n218\n00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.160\nlet's just make sure you're\nclear on where we are so\n\n219\n00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.090\nyou don't just randomly see this list and\nwonder what we're looking at.\n\n220\n00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.485\nWe're in Mike's web browser.\n\n221\n00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:26.920\nWe're in Google Chrome and\n\n222\n00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.830\nin Google Chrome Mike's gone to\nthe Settings to Manage Advanced Settings.\n\n223\n00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:33.360\nHe's gone to managed certificates and\n\n224\n00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.620\nhe's brought up the certificate\nstore that is there.\n\n225\n00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.570\nNow, we're just highlighting or\nlooking at one or\n\n226\n00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.860\nmore of the certificates\nthat are going to be there.\n\n227\n00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.990\nMike's gonna double-click on one and\nbring it up for us so\n\n228\n00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.490\nwe can see what's in there.\n\n229\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.080\nWe're gonna zoom in a little bit I think\nhopefully and be able to see that.\n\n230\n00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:50.010\nOr Mike's gonna figure out how we can\ntry to zoom in while we're talking.\n\n231\n00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:51.790\nBut let me just tell you\nsomething important about it.\n\n232\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.160\nAnd even if we can't zoom in, I'll kind of\nexplain what's there, it's not a big deal.\n\n233\n00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.530\nWe have an X.509V3 certificate.\n\n234\n00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.595\nAnd we wanna make sure we know what\ntype of certificate we're using.\n\n235\n00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:03.995\nX.509, which is the certificate standard.\n\n236\n00:12:03.995 --> 00:12:07.816\nX.509 is the standard, V3, version three.\n\n237\n00:12:07.816 --> 00:12:14.730\nAnd so X.509V3 certificates are used today\nand certificates represent digital trust.\n\n238\n00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.960\nThey represent the ability to validate and\nprove identity.\n\n239\n00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.740\nAnd to validate and prove source and\n\n240\n00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.520\norigin, and they represent the ability\nto validate and to push forward.\n\n241\n00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.050\nAnd to effectively transfer\ntrust between parties.\n\n242\n00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.000\nAnd so what we see in a certificate\nare a bunch of fields.\n\n243\n00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.450\nThey are listed there, and\nI know it may be a little difficult for\n\n244\n00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.620\nyou to see them cuz it is\na little small on the screen.\n\n245\n00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:35.790\nSo, we understand that.\n\n246\n00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.760\nWe'll just call out some\nof the highlights for you,\n\n247\n00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.930\nat least to tell you what What's there.\n\n248\n00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.170\nWe're gonna have an algorithm\nthat's used for the signature.\n\n249\n00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.760\nSo, it's gonna list somewhere in\nthe field there what algorithm was used.\n\n250\n00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.820\nWhether it was RSA or\nwhether it was SHA-1.\n\n251\n00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:49.930\nOr whatever it may be.\n\n252\n00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.670\nThere may be different choices there.\n\n253\n00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.290\nWe're gonna have the issuer name.\n\n254\n00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.900\nSo, we're gonna have the X 500\nLDAP aligned directory name\n\n255\n00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:58.560\nof the certificate authority.\n\n256\n00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.540\nSo, the issuing name will be there.\n\n257\n00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.110\nWe're going to have a period of validity,\nvery important,\n\n258\n00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.590\nthe certificate was issued from this or\non this particular day, good for\n\n259\n00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.840\nthis many days, weeks, months,\nyears, whatever that may be.\n\n260\n00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.090\nRoot certificates are usually good for\nvery long period of time.\n\n261\n00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:15.560\nIntermediate and\nsubordinate CA certificates not so\n\n262\n00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.830\nlong, much shorter period of time.\n\n263\n00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.590\nCertificates issued to a user typically\nare good for about 12 months on average.\n\n264\n00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.490\nBut that may change.\n\n265\n00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.500\nYou have the right to adjust that.\n\n266\n00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.390\nThe subjects name, so\nthe owner of the public key,\n\n267\n00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.310\nwho is the subject,\nthat's gonna be a field that's there.\n\n268\n00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:33.880\nThe digital signature of a CA, of\nthe certificate authority will be there.\n\n269\n00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.277\nThis will represented by a hash, and we\ncan see some hash values on various lines,\n\n270\n00:13:37.277 --> 00:13:40.935\nprobably down towards the bottom, it's\nwhere Mike's pointing, that will be there.\n\n271\n00:13:40.935 --> 00:13:45.190\nSo there is lots of different things that\nwould show up in the certificate fields.\n\n272\n00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:50.020\nWe wanna make sure we know that\nthe certificates are going to represent,\n\n273\n00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.130\nnot just the issuer, but\nalso the owner of the certificate.\n\n274\n00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:56.250\nSo, the person who issued it or the who\nissued it, but also the target of it,\n\n275\n00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.760\nthe subject that's gonna use it.\n\n276\n00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.820\nIt represents both.\n\n277\n00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.330\nAnd we have to make sure that we\nunderstand the concept of trust\n\n278\n00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:03.540\nwhen we talk about certificates.\n\n279\n00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.100\nTrusts are very important.\n\n280\n00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.180\nNow, I'm not in the habit of walking\naround with money in my pocket, right?\n\n281\n00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.860\nBut on occasion I do have paper money\nas opposed to credit cards with me.\n\n282\n00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.920\nBut when I do, if I turn over a dollar\nbill, a United States dollar bill,\n\n283\n00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.880\nI will see on the back of our currency\nthe words In God We Trust, right?\n\n284\n00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.990\nSo, In God We Trust.\n\n285\n00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.940\nSee, four words.\n\n286\n00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.820\nThey're usually on the masthead of\nthe bill somewhere on the back.\n\n287\n00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.930\nNow what we're talking about there is\nnot in theory as well as in actuality\n\n288\n00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.410\nthat we are going to expect\nthat God is gonna actually\n\n289\n00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:37.820\ngive us the ability to have goods and\nservices in exchange for that dollar bill.\n\n290\n00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.880\nWhat we're implying, right,\nis a statement of several things, and\n\n291\n00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.650\nwithout getting into the reality, excuse\nme, the religiosity of that conversation.\n\n292\n00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.240\nI'm not gonna go down that road with us.\n\n293\n00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.895\nWhat I'm simply gonna say is that when we\ntalk about something like in God we trust\n\n294\n00:14:51.895 --> 00:14:56.208\non the back of the currency, what we're\nimplying is that the full faith and\n\n295\n00:14:56.208 --> 00:14:59.564\nvalue of that dollar or\nthat amount of currency is backed by\n\n296\n00:14:59.564 --> 00:15:02.868\nthe United States Government\nin the case of US currency.\n\n297\n00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:06.904\nAnd we are saying, ultimately, that there\nhas to be trust between the issuer,\n\n298\n00:15:06.904 --> 00:15:09.736\nof the good and service, and\nthe consumer of the good and\n\n299\n00:15:09.736 --> 00:15:11.780\nservice that adds the currency.\n\n300\n00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.960\nAnd the exchange of those\ntwo things implies trust.\n\n301\n00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.970\nIt implies that the value of that good and\n\n302\n00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.570\nservice is gonna be equal to\nthe amount of money that we give, and\n\n303\n00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:24.410\nif it's less than that we get change, and\nif it's more we give some back, right?\n\n304\n00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:25.560\nOr we give some more.\n\n305\n00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.950\nSo, the idea is that there has to be\ntrust in any of these things that we do,\n\n306\n00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:32.000\nand certificates allow\nus to distill down trust\n\n307\n00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.840\ninto a digital representation\nof what that means.\n\n308\n00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:38.929\nWhat that ultimately means to us,\nwhen we think about certificates,\n\n309\n00:15:38.929 --> 00:15:43.295\nis that the issuer has said that the\nholder of this certificate is allowed to\n\n310\n00:15:43.295 --> 00:15:47.940\noperate with the full trust and backing\nand faith of the issuer, on their behalf\n\n311\n00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:52.414\nto execute the actions that the\ncertificate implies are available to them.\n\n312\n00:15:52.414 --> 00:15:57.541\nWhether it is a digital signature to\nvalidate email, whether it is to validate\n\n313\n00:15:57.541 --> 00:16:02.280\na webpage, whether it is to provide\na non-repudiation and integrity,\n\n314\n00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:07.358\nwhatever it maybe, those certificates\nare going to be backed by the issuer.\n\n315\n00:16:07.358 --> 00:16:08.681\nIn this case, the Root CA.\n\n316\n00:16:08.681 --> 00:16:10.358\nIntermediate or subordinate CA.\n\n317\n00:16:10.358 --> 00:16:14.025\nSo we just wanna make sure we understand\nwhat a certificate is and why it's so\n\n318\n00:16:14.025 --> 00:16:15.250\nimportant to us.\n\n319\n00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.760\nWhen we think about key management,\n\n320\n00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:20.110\nwhich is really what goes into the idea\nof now that we have certificates and\n\n321\n00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.580\nwe've issued them,\nhow do we actually keep track of them?\n\n322\n00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.450\nHow do we ultimately understand\nhow long they're good for and\n\n323\n00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.810\nwhat do we do with them?\n\n324\n00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.940\nCertificates are going to be a derivative\nof a public key traditionally that's\n\n325\n00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.200\nused to effectively\ncreate the certificate.\n\n326\n00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.800\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe have to think about key management.\n\n327\n00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.720\nBecause key management\nis all about the art and\n\n328\n00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:42.430\nscience of issuing keys securely, keeping\nthem around for a period of time, and\n\n329\n00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.020\nthen getting rid of them when we no longer\nneed them, and decommissioning them.\n\n330\n00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.260\nWe have a life cycle.\n\n331\n00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:50.220\nSo a very famous person came up with\na statement about key management and\n\n332\n00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.430\nthe cryptosystem in general.\n\n333\n00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.460\nA guy named Kirchhoff and Kirchhoff's law,\nwhich is what we want to talk about\n\n334\n00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:00.110\nwith regards to key management, basically\nsays, a cryptosystem should be secure\n\n335\n00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.860\neven if everything in it is known, is made\navailable publicly with one exception.\n\n336\n00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.260\nThat exception should be\nknowledge of the key.\n\n337\n00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.040\nAnd so what Kirchhoff talked about is the\nidea that if we keep one thing secret in\n\n338\n00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.330\na system, one thing, and one thing only,\nand that thing is the key.\n\n339\n00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:15.780\nIn our case, the private key, right?\n\n340\n00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.250\nIf we keep the private key secure,\neverything else is known.\n\n341\n00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.880\nAll the other stuff is\npublicly available and\n\n342\n00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:24.590\nthat knowledge is going to be a scene and\nmade available anywhere in the system.\n\n343\n00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:28.440\nThen the system will still be secure\nbecause the private key by itself\n\n344\n00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.120\nis enough to safe guard and\ncreate the integrity and\n\n345\n00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.490\nthe confidentiality we need in the system\nprovided that we keep that key secure and\n\n346\n00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.180\nour conversations about how\nwe can safeguard information.\n\n347\n00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.570\nHow we can use either the recipients\npublic key or the senator's private key to\n\n348\n00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:46.410\nprovide for the appropriate transmission,\nwe've talked a lot about that.\n\n349\n00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:50.570\nWe're just simply reminding you of that\nby summarizing it up in Kirchhoff's Law.\n\n350\n00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.310\nYou would want to be familiar with\nKirchhoff's Law, it's probably a good idea\n\n351\n00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:56.330\nto know what that law says and\neffectively what it means.\n\n352\n00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.490\nSegregation of duties,\nwe've talked about this before.\n\n353\n00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:01.380\nTalked about the idea that\nwe should split up roles and\n\n354\n00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.770\nas a result of that give one or\nmore people different roles and\n\n355\n00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.960\nresponsibilities so that way one\nperson is not in charge or everything.\n\n356\n00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.630\nThis makes a lot of sense when you think\nabout it, because if we segregate duties,\n\n357\n00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.710\nwhat we're saying is the person that\nis going to be able to effectively\n\n358\n00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:18.060\nback up data should not be the same\nperson that can restore data.\n\n359\n00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:20.995\nThat's one example of how\nsegregation of duties may work.\n\n360\n00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:24.495\nAnd because of that, we are trying\nto avoid malicious behavior and\n\n361\n00:18:24.495 --> 00:18:25.735\nabuse of the system.\n\n362\n00:18:25.735 --> 00:18:28.035\nSo segregation of duties\nis also important here.\n\n363\n00:18:28.035 --> 00:18:32.375\nWanna juxtapose, compare that with what's\nknown as dual control or split knowledge.\n\n364\n00:18:32.375 --> 00:18:35.115\nThese are also terms that\nbecome very important.\n\n365\n00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:39.304\nDual control is gonna be implemented as a\nsecurity procedure where we're gonna have\n\n366\n00:18:39.304 --> 00:18:42.549\nmore than one person,\ntypically two people, that are going to,\n\n367\n00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:44.201\nor at least more than one person,\n\n368\n00:18:44.201 --> 00:18:47.810\ncome together to effectively be able\nto carry out some sort of activity.\n\n369\n00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:51.999\nSo with dual control we have at least two\npeople involved that may have to insert\n\n370\n00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:54.728\nkeys into a system and\nturn them to launch a weapon or\n\n371\n00:18:54.728 --> 00:18:58.041\nsomething like that,\nkind of classic example right of that.\n\n372\n00:18:58.041 --> 00:19:02.305\nSo split knowledge is going to be\nthe ability to effectively give multiple\n\n373\n00:19:02.305 --> 00:19:05.827\npieces of knowledge,\npart of the puzzle, to individuals.\n\n374\n00:19:05.827 --> 00:19:09.998\nHave them bring them all together to solve\nthe problem and carry out the activities,\n\n375\n00:19:09.998 --> 00:19:11.713\nis what split knowledge implies.\n\n376\n00:19:11.713 --> 00:19:15.840\nSo split knowledge systems will involve\neffectively maybe giving out a portion of\n\n377\n00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.965\nthe key, and then bringing all those keys\ntogether effectively allows us to carry\n\n378\n00:19:19.965 --> 00:19:21.197\nout the action.\n\n379\n00:19:21.197 --> 00:19:22.657\nI don't know if you've ever seen these.\n\n380\n00:19:22.657 --> 00:19:27.660\nThey are very popular with young kids,\ngirls especially, right?\n\n381\n00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:29.830\nThe little broken heart pendants\nwhen they give it to a friend.\n\n382\n00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:32.810\nOh, you're my best friend, and they break\nthe heart pendant, they give you half,\n\n383\n00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:33.700\nyou have half.\n\n384\n00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:38.010\nAnd then as a result,\nyou bring them together, you're besties.\n\n385\n00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:39.940\nThat's an example of split knowledge.\n\n386\n00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:43.020\nBecause split knowledge is the idea\nof having something that's a whole,\n\n387\n00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:46.760\nthe heart pendant, broken up and\nthen given to individuals and they have to\n\n388\n00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.610\nbring that back together in order to\neffectively see the whole picture, right?\n\n389\n00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.460\nTo be besties you need the broken heart.\n\n390\n00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:53.490\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n391\n00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.570\nSo when we think about key storage and\ndestruction.\n\n392\n00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:59.540\nTalked about key life cycles, talked about\nmanaging keys, issuing them securely,\n\n393\n00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:01.240\nkeeping them safe during their use.\n\n394\n00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.380\nWhat about when we have to destroy them,\nright?\n\n395\n00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.870\nWhen they're no longer valid anymore,\nwhen they're no longer good,\n\n396\n00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.170\nwhen they've been compromised,\nwe have to get rid of them.\n\n397\n00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.490\nWe don't just throw them in the garbage.\n\n398\n00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:10.860\nI mean, theoretically, you could,\n\n399\n00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.660\nbut the reality is it's not\nthe approved way of destroying keys.\n\n400\n00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.030\nKeys are digital solutions.\n\n401\n00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:21.850\nThey are effectively going to be strings,\nalphanumeric strings,\n\n402\n00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.680\nof letters and numbers, and\nmaybe thousands of characters long.\n\n403\n00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.710\nBut they are strings of characters.\n\n404\n00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:30.210\nSo we could just delete them off the\nsystem, but the reality is deleting them\n\n405\n00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:34.840\nas we know from prior discussions, is\ngonna lead to data remnants that will be\n\n406\n00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:38.000\nleft behind, in other words potentially,\nand may be recoverable.\n\n407\n00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.030\nSo we have to securely delete them,\nsecurely destroy them.\n\n408\n00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.930\nWe can't just simply hit the delete\nbutton and delete the file.\n\n409\n00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:47.579\nWe have to make sure that they are stored\nsecurely, trusted and tamper-proof,\n\n410\n00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:52.210\ntamper-resistant storage using something\nlike a tpm, a trusted platform module or\n\n411\n00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.480\nan hsm, a hardware security module,\nor a software security module,\n\n412\n00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.850\nthey're called different things.\n\n413\n00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:00.640\nBut the idea is that we store them\nin these containers while they're in\n\n414\n00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.640\nthe system.\n\n415\n00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.370\nThey are tamper resistant,\ntamper proof, so\n\n416\n00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.940\nif you try to break into them,\nthe keys are destroyed.\n\n417\n00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.280\nThey are effectively shredded,\n\n418\n00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:10.850\nmeaning they are encrypted, and\nthen the encryption keys are destroyed, so\n\n419\n00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:13.360\nthat way you can't get to them and\nunencrypt the keys.\n\n420\n00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:18.040\nCryptor shredding or\nbeing able to re-encrypt the data,\n\n421\n00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.020\nif effect, is a very effective\nmethod of destroying data securely,\n\n422\n00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.310\nprovided we get rid of\nthe new encryption keys.\n\n423\n00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:26.630\nSo we effectively get rid of those keys,\nand do so securely and\n\n424\n00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.600\neffectively render the data inoperable.\n\n425\n00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.420\nSo we wanna make sure we understand\nthat storage is important, but\n\n426\n00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.090\ndestroying is equally important.\n\n427\n00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.060\nWe have to overwrite,\nwe may have to degauss, and\n\n428\n00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.240\nwe may have to do various things to get\nrid of those keys if they're digital.\n\n429\n00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.310\nIf they're written down somewhere\nit may be easier, right?\n\n430\n00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:43.760\nWe can burn the paper, we can shred it,\nwe can do various things to get rid of it.\n\n431\n00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:46.420\nIf we have multiple copies,\nwe can go around and gather them up and\n\n432\n00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.450\ndestroy them.\n\n433\n00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.330\nBut ultimately we'll have to figure out\nhow to destroy keys successfully and\n\n434\n00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.690\nto make sure they're not recoverable.\n\n435\n00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.610\nWe also want to keep in mind that\nif certificates are compromised,\n\n436\n00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:59.500\nthere may be a cost associated with\nrevoking them and then reissuing them.\n\n437\n00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.360\nEvery so often, you hear about\na certificate being compromised.\n\n438\n00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.930\nSomebody loses the certificate,\nsomething happens.\n\n439\n00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.240\nMalware may infect the system may become\ncompromised, and as a certificate\n\n440\n00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:12.870\nadministrator, we may have to go in and\nrevoke that certificate, use what's called\n\n441\n00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.390\na CRL, certificate revocation list,\nand then create a brand new one.\n\n442\n00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:19.620\nNow, in and of itself, that's really\nnot a very expensive thing to do.\n\n443\n00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.110\nOne certificate every so\noften, not a big deal.\n\n444\n00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:25.220\nBut what if that was a root certificate\nfrom a major software vendor\n\n445\n00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.440\nlike Microsoft, or Google, right, or\n\n446\n00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.140\nsomebody like that, who effectively\nhas issued that certificate\n\n447\n00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.260\nto hundreds of millions of individuals\nto effectively establish trust.\n\n448\n00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.740\nNow all of a sudden it's not so\neasy to reissue a brand new certificate.\n\n449\n00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.540\nIt is, but what I'm saying is, the pushing\nof the button's not the hard part.\n\n450\n00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.930\nThe disseminating that out to hundreds of\nmillions of individuals that have to get\n\n451\n00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:50.230\nrid of the old certificate and replace it\nwith a new one is incredibly complicated,\n\n452\n00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:52.120\ntime consuming, and expensive.\n\n453\n00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.180\nSo this is something to\nbe aware of as well.\n\n454\n00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.720\nSo, we wanna make sure we can safeguard\ncertificates and keys, but if they\n\n455\n00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.240\nare lost for any reason or compromised,\nwe have to be prepared to take action.\n\n456\n00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.790\nKey recovery is one of\nthose actions we may take.\n\n457\n00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.720\nIf the key is lost, not compromised,\nbut lost, we may be able to recover it.\n\n458\n00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.100\nSo if we have only a single private\nkey and we don't make a copy of it and\n\n459\n00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.410\nwe lose the key, we're done right?\n\n460\n00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.730\nWe can go home,\nthere's nothing else to discuss.\n\n461\n00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:19.910\nBut if we have a copy of the key and\nwe store that key copy somewhere securely,\n\n462\n00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:24.540\noffsite or with a trusted third party or\nthrough an escrow solution wherever it is,\n\n463\n00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.130\nwe can recover that key potentially\ngiven the right circumstances.\n\n464\n00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:30.680\nSo multi-party or\nthird party key recovery is an option.\n\n465\n00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.590\nWe can split up the key and\nstore it in different places and\n\n466\n00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.760\nhave copies available.\n\n467\n00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.420\nWe may store it with what's known as\nan escrow agent, an off-site trusted third\n\n468\n00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:43.200\nparty, but a single entity as opposed\nto multiple parties that will be given\n\n469\n00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.020\ninformation and instructions about how\nto safely store the key for a fee.\n\n470\n00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.670\nObviously, we'll pay them.\n\n471\n00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.350\nAnd then under certain circumstances,\n\n472\n00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:53.200\nwe probably have to validate\ncertain information.\n\n473\n00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.890\nMaybe provide written attestation\nabout whatever we need done.\n\n474\n00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.870\nThere may be a process in other words\ntypically associated with this.\n\n475\n00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:01.260\nWhen we show up, we can't just say,\nhey, I'm there to get the key.\n\n476\n00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:02.610\nCan I have Bob's key please?\n\n477\n00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.140\nIt's not quite that simple.\n\n478\n00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.741\nSo we may have to go through\na process to identify ourselves.\n\n479\n00:24:05.741 --> 00:24:09.144\nBut assuming we meet the criteria\nassociated with key recovery, we will be\n\n480\n00:24:09.144 --> 00:24:12.385\ngiven a copy of the key, which can then\nbe used to ultimately Go ahead and\n\n481\n00:24:12.385 --> 00:24:15.861\nrecover the data, so we do want to\nunderstand key recovery and how it works.\n\n482\n00:24:15.861 --> 00:24:17.071\nIt is very important, and\n\n483\n00:24:17.071 --> 00:24:19.990\nkey escrow is also gonna be\nvery important in this regard.\n\n484\n00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.220\nWe want to be thinking about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n485\n00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.240\nAlong with certificates and\ndigital certificates and\n\n486\n00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.800\nkeys, we also want to think about how we\ncreate the ability to manage data, and\n\n487\n00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:33.290\nto effectively use digital information,\nand to use trust to our advantage.\n\n488\n00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:35.060\nWe think about something known as DRM, or\n\n489\n00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.400\nDigital Rights Management,\neffectively applying safeguards to data so\n\n490\n00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.920\nthat it cannot be compromised\nwithout our knowledge.\n\n491\n00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.630\nSo one of the biggest issues we have\nin the modern systems we create,\n\n492\n00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.210\nenterprise content management platforms,\nfor instance,\n\n493\n00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:53.770\nlike SharePoint, like WebSphere, is that\nwe store huge volumes of data in the web,\n\n494\n00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:56.370\nor in the cloud via the web\nwe access them, and\n\n495\n00:24:56.370 --> 00:25:00.790\nthe problem becomes we may not understand\nhow to apply access controls properly, and\n\n496\n00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:05.100\nso somebody may be able to get to\nthe data and see it within the interface.\n\n497\n00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:08.239\nBut we may not want them to remove it,\nand if they can remove it,\n\n498\n00:25:08.239 --> 00:25:11.490\nthe attributes,\nthe protection attributes are not sticky.\n\n499\n00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.130\nWe call them sticky if\nthey stay with the data.\n\n500\n00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:18.100\nIf they're not sticky, the data itself\nmay be removed from the system,\n\n501\n00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:19.880\nand the attributes don't go with the data.\n\n502\n00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.980\nThe data, in other words is unprotected.\n\n503\n00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.090\nAnd this is obviously a very bad state\nof affairs to find ourselves in.\n\n504\n00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:28.720\nSo as a result of that,\nwhat we do is we use DRM technology.\n\n505\n00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.250\nDRM technology allows us to apply\nsticky attributes to the data.\n\n506\n00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:35.640\nSo no matter where the data goes,\neffectively it stays protected.\n\n507\n00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.610\nWe can say you can see that data,\nbut you can't print it.\n\n508\n00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.400\nYou may be able to read it, but\nonly inside a certain application with\n\n509\n00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.530\na certain reader, and you may not\nbe able to screen capture it, so\n\n510\n00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:46.920\nyou cannot take a picture of it,\nat least not in the system.\n\n511\n00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.210\nYou may say, well, I'll pull out my\ncamera, because I have an app for that.\n\n512\n00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.520\nThat's why I hate apps, and\nI can go ahead and take a picture.\n\n513\n00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.680\nSo, yeah you can do that.\n\n514\n00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.920\nI can't prevent that\nfrom happening with DRM.\n\n515\n00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.940\nI have this conversation\nall the time with students.\n\n516\n00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.030\nSome bright person in the room says,\nwell, what about taking a picture?\n\n517\n00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.520\nWell, yeah, I could do that, right?\n\n518\n00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:07.130\nThe point is, I can't prevent everything,\nbut I can prevent most things, right?\n\n519\n00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:11.110\nLike go karts going down the road, for\ninstance, we have to make sure, right,\n\n520\n00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:14.770\nthat we understand how to safely\ncoexist with the technology and\n\n521\n00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.370\nthe solutions that we're dealing with.\n\n522\n00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:19.210\nEspecially if they're home made go karts,\nit's very important.\n\n523\n00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.660\nSo, when we think about\ndigital rights management,\n\n524\n00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.900\nwhat we're thinking about is\nthe safety of the data, right?\n\n525\n00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.330\nIf we build a system,\n\n526\n00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:30.410\nthat has sticky attributes associated\nwith it, what we can do so\n\n527\n00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:34.400\nwe can make sure that when the data leaves\nthe system, we're not able to print it.\n\n528\n00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.540\nWe're not able to potentially open\nit under certain circumstances.\n\n529\n00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.490\nWe may not be able to send it via email.\n\n530\n00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.900\nWe may not be able to forward\nit if we do get it via email.\n\n531\n00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.200\nThere's lots of things\nthat we can do with DRM.\n\n532\n00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.600\nSo data rights management, or digital\nrights management technology, is very\n\n533\n00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.800\ncomprehensive today, and it's one of the\nkey ways that we implement security and\n\n534\n00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.350\nsafeguarding when we think\nabout applying cryptography.\n\n535\n00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.740\nThat is what we're talking about,\n\n536\n00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.550\nhow we apply cryptography in different\nsituations, different solutions through\n\n537\n00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:02.690\nPKI, use of digital certificates\nwith DRM technology, for instance.\n\n538\n00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:05.350\nOne of the ways we do that,\nlots of different ways.\n\n539\n00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:08.800\nThere's different types of DRM,\nthere's what we call always on DRM, so\n\n540\n00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.260\nname applies, it's always on.\n\n541\n00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:13.040\nThere may be DRM associated\nwith a USB key, so\n\n542\n00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.490\nyou may be able to use a USB key\nfob to enable the DRM solution or\n\n543\n00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:20.180\nbe able to transfer data onto removal\nmedia, but have the attribute stick.\n\n544\n00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.580\nThere's different ways DRM\nmay be implemented today.\n\n545\n00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.160\nWhat we wanna think about\nare things like digital watermarks,\n\n546\n00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:28.080\nwhere we put digital watermarks\ninto the background of a document.\n\n547\n00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:29.560\nYou've probably seen those, right?\n\n548\n00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.620\nWhere they have the do not print,\nauthorized use only or\n\n549\n00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.520\nwhatever that shows up on every page.\n\n550\n00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.480\nYou may not see it when you read it but\nwhen you go to print it,\n\n551\n00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.530\nit's there,\nit's kind of a light watermark.\n\n552\n00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:40.550\nThose kind of things, pr property of so\n\n553\n00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:44.030\npeople know where you got it from,\nthose are all DRM solutions.\n\n554\n00:27:44.030 --> 00:27:47.760\nThose watermarkings and those\nfingerprintings of the data being able to\n\n555\n00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.870\ninsert random character strings, will\nlook like random character strings into\n\n556\n00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:54.940\nthe digital data, but is actually\na digital fingerprint that when stitched\n\n557\n00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.060\nback together uniquely tags the data as\nanother form of DRM that we use as well.\n\n558\n00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:01.100\nIt's called fingerprinting, or\ndigital fingerprinting today.\n\n559\n00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.940\nSo I want you to just be thinking about\nthat and be aware of that as well.\n\n560\n00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:08.520\nWe've talked a lot about hashing as well\nas digital signature, and what hashing is\n\n561\n00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.610\nused for, remember creating integrity\nis really what hashing is all about.\n\n562\n00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:16.320\nDigital signature provide, digital\nsignatures, let me enunciate clearly.\n\n563\n00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:20.428\nDigital signatures provide\nnon-repudiation and proof of origin.\n\n564\n00:28:20.428 --> 00:28:23.079\nWe want to make sure we understand what\nthose things are as we think about\n\n565\n00:28:23.079 --> 00:28:26.085\nhashing, specifically, or rather we\nthinking about applying cryptography or\n\n566\n00:28:26.085 --> 00:28:26.941\nhashing I should say.\n\n567\n00:28:26.941 --> 00:28:28.457\nWhen we think about hashing,\n\n568\n00:28:28.457 --> 00:28:32.470\nwhat we also want to understand is what\nhashing algorithms are that we can use.\n\n569\n00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:34.220\nI mentioned a couple of them already.\n\n570\n00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.440\nWe talked about MD5, we talked about SHY1.\n\n571\n00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:41.360\nI mentioned that MD5 produces\na 128 bit hashing output so\n\n572\n00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.510\nthe bitstream is 128 bits.\n\n573\n00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:46.430\nI mentioned that SHY1, which is short for\n\n574\n00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.780\nSHY160, is gonna produce\n160 bit output streams.\n\n575\n00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.870\nWe wanna know that.\n\n576\n00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:53.190\nWe also want to know there\nare some other hashing algorithms.\n\n577\n00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.860\nMaybe not as frequently used,\nmaybe not as popular, right?\n\n578\n00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.790\nBut still very important to be aware of.\n\n579\n00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:00.890\nHAVAL, which is one of\nthe ones that's out there,\n\n580\n00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:04.230\nis gonna potentially produce a bit\nstream output that's variable.\n\n581\n00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:10.250\nAnything from 128 bits to 160,\n192, 224 or 256 bits.\n\n582\n00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:14.526\nSo it has potentially five different\nvariable outlets that it can produce.\n\n583\n00:29:14.526 --> 00:29:17.383\nThere's also RIPEMD-160.\n\n584\n00:29:17.383 --> 00:29:22.550\nRIPEMD-160 is gonna be\n160 bit output block,\n\n585\n00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.370\nbut it operates similar to what MD5 is.\n\n586\n00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:30.490\nSo it actually looks like an MD5 hash,\nbut it produces 160 bit output,\n\n587\n00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.358\ninstead of 128 bit output.\n\n588\n00:29:33.358 --> 00:29:37.910\nLet me, again, be clear about that because\nmy powers of enunciation are quickly,\n\n589\n00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:41.060\nslowly but surely, and\nquickly escaping me here, all right.\n\n590\n00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:45.690\nAs we are talking about ways we\napply cryptography in this episode,\n\n591\n00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.190\nwe've really been talking about\nthe different mechanisms that we can use.\n\n592\n00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.950\nSome review, some a little bit more\nin detail as we've gone back and\n\n593\n00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:55.160\ndrilled down on the ways we can\npractically apply cryptography.\n\n594\n00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.460\nIn our next episode that's gonna\ncome up that we're gonna talk about,\n\n595\n00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.750\nkind of our part two of\napplying cryptography,\n\n596\n00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:03.070\nwe're gonna take a look at\nhow we break crypto systems.\n\n597\n00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:05.950\nSo understanding how to apply\ncryptography's important.\n\n598\n00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:09.360\nUnderstanding how it can be attacked, and\ntherefore, what we have to do to mitigate\n\n599\n00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:13.200\nultimately and defend, is gonna be\nthe subject of our next conversation.\n\n600\n00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.470\n>> All right, good, Adam,\nagain a lot of great information there.\n\n601\n00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:18.110\nYou know, looking at that that applied\ncryptography, taking what we've learned in\n\n602\n00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.910\nthe previous episodes and\nseeing how we actually implement it,\n\n603\n00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:25.080\nhow it actually helps me protect my\ninformation, my data, my websites,\n\n604\n00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.720\nwhatever it is we're trying to\nprotect out there in the real world.\n\n605\n00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.115\nSo thanks for that, Adam.\n\n606\n00:30:29.115 --> 00:30:33.231\nRemember, if you guys want to attend one\nof Adam's classes live, shoot us an email,\n\n607\n00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:34.388\nSeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n608\n00:30:34.388 --> 00:30:36.850\nThat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n609\n00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:38.580\nSigning off, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n610\n00:30:38.580

--> 00:00:17.230\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.060\nToday we're doing our CISSP and\nspecifically we're going to be going into\n\n5\n00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.650\napplied cryptography or\napplying cryptography, right.\n\n6\n00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.960\nWe've already taken a look\nat some cryptography,\n\n7\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.900\nwe've taken actually\na pretty extensive look.\n\n8\n00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.700\nLooked at some metric and asymmetric and\n\n9\n00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.510\nsome of the places where we wanna put\ncryptography or apply cryptography.\n\n10\n00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.090\nAdam has more for us, and so Mr.\nAdam, how are you doing today?\n\n11\n00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.480\n>> I'm doing well, I'm doing well So\nlet's talk a little bit about,\n\n12\n00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.660\na little more I should say,\nabout cryptography.\n\n13\n00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.150\nWhen we think about applying cryptography,\nright, we wanna make sure that we're\n\n14\n00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.630\nunderstanding that ultimately the goal,\nand we've often talked about this,\n\n15\n00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.770\nof cryptography is to ensure\nconfidentiality, right.\n\n16\n00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.870\nBut also we get integrity from\nthe idea of cryptography.\n\n17\n00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.210\nWe can have integrity functions,\nhashing functions,\n\n18\n00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.640\ndigital signatures for\nnon-repudiation, proof of origin.\n\n19\n00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.690\nSo we're really thinking about both.\n\n20\n00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.130\nBut what we're going to talk about here in\nthis particular episode more than anything\n\n21\n00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.200\nelse is how to we break\nthe cryptographic system.\n\n22\n00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.970\nNot because we want you to\nbreak the cryptographic system.\n\n23\n00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.610\nQuite the opposite, we want you\nto ensure that it doesn't break.\n\n24\n00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.370\nBut we want you to understand how\nthe attackers that are going to try and\n\n25\n00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.670\ncome and take your systems away from you,\nand do the things that they need to do in\n\n26\n00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.850\norder to gain an advantage,\nare going to operate.\n\n27\n00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.335\nAnd by having knowledge of that,\nby understanding what that looks like,\n\n28\n00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:31.740\nit's going to be a lot easier for us to\nhave a better sense of how to defend.\n\n29\n00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.150\nAnd so we're going to think about that and\n\n30\n00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.170\nwe're going to take\na look at that as well.\n\n31\n00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.448\nSo when we think about attacks that can\nhappen against hashing algorithms and/or\n\n32\n00:01:39.448 --> 00:01:43.856\nthings that can affect integrity we're\nthinking about things such as brute force.\n\n33\n00:01:43.856 --> 00:01:47.445\nWhen we think about brute forcing, we're\nthinking about literally going in and\n\n34\n00:01:47.445 --> 00:01:49.038\ntrying every combination of a key.\n\n35\n00:01:49.038 --> 00:01:53.541\nRemember the goal here, no matter what we\ntalk about, is not to guess a password,\n\n36\n00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:54.930\nnot to guess a user name.\n\n37\n00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.270\nThat's important and\nwe talk about that as well, but\n\n38\n00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.270\nwe talk about that really more\nwith regards to access control.\n\n39\n00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.960\nHow do we get into a system if we have\nto figure out one of the factors.\n\n40\n00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.450\nLet's say the factor is a PIN or\nthe factor is a username or password.\n\n41\n00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.590\nSomething we know, something we have.\n\n42\n00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.490\nThose kinds of things.\n\n43\n00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.630\nIf we can steal the Smart card, or\nwe can figure out the username and\n\n44\n00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.870\npassword combination, we can still get in.\n\n45\n00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.910\nSo that is important.\n\n46\n00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.050\nThat is a kind of attack.\n\n47\n00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.220\nBut we're really not focusing\non that level of attack here.\n\n48\n00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.570\nWhen we think about cryptographic systems\nwhat we're thinking about ultimately\n\n49\n00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.850\nis brute forcing.\n\n50\n00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.474\nThinking about throwing every possible\ncombination of the key string that we can\n\n51\n00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:31.910\nimagine at the problem.\n\n52\n00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.611\nAnd in theory, if we're lucky enough,\nif we're repetitive and\n\n53\n00:02:35.611 --> 00:02:39.460\nwe're relentless enough,\nultimately over time, we may find it.\n\n54\n00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.829\nBut remember as we've talked about the\nmeasure of time that we're up against is\n\n55\n00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.570\ncalled something specifically.\n\n56\n00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.990\nIt's vocabulary term we've\nspoken about with you before.\n\n57\n00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.690\nI would ask Mike if he remembers\nwhat it is, but he's having\n\n58\n00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.820\na coffee challenge this morning, and\nI don't want to put him on the spot.\n\n59\n00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.100\nHe's a little challenged for sweetener.\n\n60\n00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.613\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're having an issue.\n\n61\n00:02:55.613 --> 00:02:57.882\nHe shared with me before\nwe went on confidentially.\n\n62\n00:02:57.882 --> 00:03:00.740\nHe's not real comfortable with\nhis sugar selection this morning.\n\n63\n00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.409\nAnd so he wants to just hang back.\n\n64\n00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.060\nSo, what we're going to do is just remind\nyou of the fact that this is what we call\n\n65\n00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.270\nthe work factor, right?\n\n66\n00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.340\nThe work factor is gonna be\nthe measure of how long in theory,\n\n67\n00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.570\nin time, it would take us\nto crack the cryptosystem.\n\n68\n00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.870\nNow, brute forcing doesn't\nnecessarily equal work factor,\n\n69\n00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.840\nin the sense that you may\nget lucky the third try.\n\n70\n00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.250\nBoom, you're done, and\nthe work factor went from this to wow,\n\n71\n00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.720\nI've got a lot of time on my hands today.\n\n72\n00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.780\nWhat should I do?\n\n73\n00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.370\nBut the reality is that work\nfactor is the ultimate measure.\n\n74\n00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.640\nIn the sense that if you were not lucky,\n\n75\n00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.925\nIf you literally took the entire possible\nset of combinations and it was the very\n\n76\n00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:41.385\nlast one that you hit that was actually\nthat rang the bell and let you in.\n\n77\n00:03:41.385 --> 00:03:44.535\nThe work factor would be\na measure of the time it took you\n\n78\n00:03:44.535 --> 00:03:46.685\nto actually brute force to that system.\n\n79\n00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.215\nSo it's important to remember\nwhat work factor is.\n\n80\n00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:52.935\nBut the reality is brief forcing could\nallow you to break in editing moment in\n\n81\n00:03:52.935 --> 00:03:56.260\ntime if you happen to get the right\nstring, the right key combination.\n\n82\n00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.485\nJust through the luck of the draw.\n\n83\n00:03:57.485 --> 00:04:01.190\nYou should also buy lottery tickets\nat that same exact instance as well.\n\n84\n00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.860\nSo cryptanalysis, remember,\nalso as we've talked about this,\n\n85\n00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.500\nthis is also one of\nthe definitional terms.\n\n86\n00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.770\nThe vocabulary list that we have put\nup for you in a prior episode and\n\n87\n00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.800\nspent a fair amount of\ntime walking you through.\n\n88\n00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.820\nCryptanalysis is the idea of\nstudying the cryptosystem, trying to\n\n89\n00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.630\nfigure out ways that we can ultimately\nget into it, gain advantage and break it.\n\n90\n00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.150\nAnd so we can use cryptanalysis to\nattack hashing algorithms as well.\n\n91\n00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.000\nIf you remember a hashing algorithm,\na hash in general,\n\n92\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.560\nis a thought process that does two things,\nright.\n\n93\n00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.970\nIt allows us to be able to\ntake variable sized data,\n\n94\n00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.580\ncombine it with a hashing algorithm, and\nthere's a list of hashing algorithms.\n\n95\n00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.160\nWe talked about them, MB5,\nShy1, Haval, RipeMD 160,\n\n96\n00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.160\nthere's several hashing algorithms.\n\n97\n00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.231\nWe combine it wish a hashing algorithm and\n\n98\n00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:54.859\nwhat comes out of the hash process is\na bit stream of a certain number of bits.\n\n99\n00:04:54.859 --> 00:04:59.600\n128, 160, 256, whatever that is.\n\n100\n00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.370\nThat bit stream is actually the hash.\n\n101\n00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.270\nAnd that hash is what represents\nthe integrity check of the data.\n\n102\n00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.000\nWe're not trying to create\ncryptography applied to hashing\n\n103\n00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.610\ndoes not try to create\na confidentiality solution.\n\n104\n00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.570\nIt creates an integrity solution.\n\n105\n00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.910\nAn integrity solution\ndoesn't try to hide the data.\n\n106\n00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.110\nAs a matter of fact we give you the data.\n\n107\n00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.640\nWe're like here, here's the data,\nread it, no big deal.\n\n108\n00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.390\nWe're not worried about keeping it secret.\n\n109\n00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.230\nWhat we're worried about is making\nsure you don't change the data or\n\n110\n00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.600\nmodify it in any significant way.\n\n111\n00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.990\nAnd so when we hash, we're thinking about\nmaking sure we can represent that data,\n\n112\n00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.500\nfrozen in a moment in time, and understand\nit is not modified or changed in any way\n\n113\n00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.460\nfrom that moment in time, going\nforward whenever we want to check it.\n\n114\n00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.270\nSo the hash work that we do, the work\nwith hashing is all about integrity.\n\n115\n00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.430\nThe idea is that a hash\nrepresents integrity but\n\n116\n00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.880\nit also represents a one way process that\nis almost impossible to reverse engineer.\n\n117\n00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.520\nWe're not worried about you using you're\nprivate key to drive the hashing process\n\n118\n00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.740\nif that's what you do.\n\n119\n00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.570\nDigitally signing, for instance, right?\n\n120\n00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.750\nWe digitally sign with our private key.\n\n121\n00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.950\nWere not worried about that\nbecause we say that process is so\n\n122\n00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.000\ndifficult to reverse engineer\nto derive the key and\n\n123\n00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.020\nthe data from the hash, so that were\njust not worried about you doing that.\n\n124\n00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.150\nAnd so crypt analysis is the analysis\nof that kind of a system\n\n125\n00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.820\nlooking to see if we can find a weakness,\nif we could reverse engineer.\n\n126\n00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.320\nCould we find that key?\n\n127\n00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.040\nIt's highly unlikely we will, but\ncryptanalysis is that thought process that\n\n128\n00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.230\nhelps us to do that, and this is one of\nthe ways we may attack hashing functions.\n\n129\n00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.800\nWe also need to be thinking about\ndifferent attacks that allow us ultimately\n\n130\n00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.850\nto take the output or input or some\ncombination of those in a cryptosystem and\n\n131\n00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.300\nstill try to attack the cryptosystem\nknowing something, but not everything.\n\n132\n00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.950\nIf you remember Kirchhoff's principle.\n\n133\n00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.860\nKirchhoff said,\namong the many things he said.\n\n134\n00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.850\nBring me a cup of coffee,\nI want eggs and toast for breakfast, but\n\n135\n00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.640\nall the other things beside that.\n\n136\n00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.770\nThe most important thing\nhe did say was that\n\n137\n00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.290\neverything in a crypto\nsystem can be known.\n\n138\n00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.570\nCan all be made public,\nwith one exception.\n\n139\n00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.660\nIf we keep the key, the secret key,\n\n140\n00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.530\nthe private key secure, then the system\nis still considered to be secure.\n\n141\n00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.930\nThis is what we refer as\nKerckhoffs's principle.\n\n142\n00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.980\nSo if we remember what Kerckhoffs said,\n\n143\n00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.340\nwe're probably going to have knowledge of\none or more areas of the cryptosystem.\n\n144\n00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.270\nBut we're not going to have\nknowledge of all of them.\n\n145\n00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.080\nIf we did, we would have\na very short conversation now.\n\n146\n00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.388\nI can go on and talk about something else.\n\n147\n00:07:25.388 --> 00:07:27.140\nSo we wouldn't have to talk\nabout how to break it.\n\n148\n00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.740\nWe'd just have to talk about you\nputting the key into the system and\n\n149\n00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.150\nthen getting your data back, right?\n\n150\n00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.620\nSo it would be a very\ndifferent conversation.\n\n151\n00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.130\nSo we know we're not\ngoing to have everything.\n\n152\n00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.190\nAnd most likely, more often than not,\nwe're not going to have the key.\n\n153\n00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.480\nWhat we're going to have is other bits and\npieces around the key.\n\n154\n00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.180\nWe may have the plain text, right?\n\n155\n00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.380\nStuff that goes in front.\n\n156\n00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:49.580\nThe actual data that's been encrypted and\ncreated as cypher text out the back end.\n\n157\n00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.550\nWe maybe able to manipulate and get that.\n\n158\n00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.015\nOr at least one version of that,\nbecause there may be multiple messages and\n\n159\n00:07:55.015 --> 00:07:57.002\nobviously different levels of messages.\n\n160\n00:07:57.002 --> 00:07:59.276\nAnd different kinds will\nproduce different cypher texts.\n\n161\n00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:01.076\nAnd so we're going to\npotentially have plain text.\n\n162\n00:08:01.076 --> 00:08:02.530\nWe may know the algorithm.\n\n163\n00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.283\nAnother ingredient.\n\n164\n00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:05.360\nWe may know the algorithm.\n\n165\n00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.720\nWe may know the cypher text.\n\n166\n00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.470\nWe may even have all three.\n\n167\n00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.040\nBut we're not gonna have the key.\n\n168\n00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.320\nAnd so in effect we're solving for\nthe unknown.\n\n169\n00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.650\nMuch like a percentage rate time\nproblem if you think about it.\n\n170\n00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:20.631\nOr one of those problems where in\nalgebra you would be given two\n\n171\n00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:23.680\nof the three variables and\nhave to solve for the third.\n\n172\n00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.800\nUsed to hate that stuff.\n\n173\n00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.160\n>> Why do we care what x is?\n\n174\n00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:33.210\n>> Yeah, as an adult, I'll tell ya,\neverybody's wired a certain way.\n\n175\n00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.190\nI can do this stuff with my eyes closed.\n\n176\n00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.770\nNo problem.\n\n177\n00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.190\nI don't need to even think about it.\n\n178\n00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.350\nI can just do it.\n\n179\n00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.480\nI cannot add two plus two and\nget four on a good day.\n\n180\n00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.220\nJust that's me.\n\n181\n00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.650\nI am not a math person at all.\n\n182\n00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.040\nAnd so, I don't.\n\n183\n00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.020\nI'm not able to think that way.\n\n184\n00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:48.210\nI'm not wired that way.\n\n185\n00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.320\nYou ask me to do that, we're done,\nI leave, and you get somebody else.\n\n186\n00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.710\nUsually a six or seven year old who knows\nhow to do math will do better than me.\n\n187\n00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.030\nSo when I had to go through all that stuff\nbecause when I went and I got my degrees.\n\n188\n00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.900\nYou had to do statistical analysis to get\na Master's Degree when I went to school.\n\n189\n00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.880\nAnd so, I had to do all this stuff,\nand I still haven't recovered.\n\n190\n00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.780\nI actually went grey,\nwhen I had to go do algebra.\n\n191\n00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.050\nThat was me.\n\n192\n00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.360\nUntil then, I actually had dark hair.\n\n193\n00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.060\nIt was good.\n\n194\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.950\nWhen I did statistics,\nI've been like this ever since.\n\n195\n00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.190\nSo, don't become that person.\n\n196\n00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:22.630\nSo, when we think about, right, we think\nabout knowing several of the components.\n\n197\n00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.990\nWhat we're thinking about\nnow is the attack vector.\n\n198\n00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.650\nThe way we're gonna execute the attack is\nnow really gonna be focused in on what do\n\n199\n00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.830\nwe know, and now, what do we have to find.\n\n200\n00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.490\nThis is really the methodology\nof the attack.\n\n201\n00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.575\nRight?\nWe will know certain things but\n\n202\n00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:35.895\nwe're not going to know everything.\n\n203\n00:09:35.895 --> 00:09:39.740\nSo, can we stitch together enough\nthings to figure out the unknown,\n\n204\n00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.167\nit's what the attacker\nis constantly thinking.\n\n205\n00:09:42.167 --> 00:09:44.885\nSo as we go through these attack\ntypes what we want to understand,\n\n206\n00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:49.100\nor at least make sure you understand, is\nthat we're going to always know something.\n\n207\n00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.510\nBut we're never gonna know everything, and\nif we don't know everything, we're usually\n\n208\n00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:55.940\ngonna be missing the key at a minimum,\nthat's what we're gonna solve for.\n\n209\n00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:59.570\nSo a cypher text only attack,\none of the kinds of attacks we could have,\n\n210\n00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.870\nis an attack where as the name implies,\nyou have the cypher text, meaning you have\n\n211\n00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.380\nthe output of the encryption run, you've\nbeen given the garbled text, you now have\n\n212\n00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:12.230\nto work backwards and try to find the key\nthat ultimately unlocks that message.\n\n213\n00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.100\nAgain, you may know the algorithm\nthat has produced the cipher text.\n\n214\n00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.180\nKnowing the algorithm is really\nnot an advantage quite honestly.\n\n215\n00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:23.090\nBecause the algorithm itself, knowing that\nwe used RSA, knowing that we used RC5,\n\n216\n00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:28.170\nknowing that we used Blowfish, in and\nof itself really no value to you\n\n217\n00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.730\nunless you know how the algorithm\nwas configured in the cryptosystem.\n\n218\n00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.050\nHow strong was the key?\n\n219\n00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.490\nIn other words, how big was the key?\n\n220\n00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.395\nRemember some are variable.\n\n221\n00:10:36.395 --> 00:10:38.020\nDec has a fixed key size, right?\n\n222\n00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.240\n56 bits.\n\n223\n00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:43.440\nSo triple dec, 168 bit key size,\nthat's pretty standard.\n\n224\n00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.870\nNot going to change.\n\n225\n00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.140\nAES.\n\n226\n00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.640\nVariable key size,\ncould be up to 256 bits.\n\n227\n00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.450\nSo unless we know the settings along with\nthe algorithm we're gonna have to guess a,\n\n228\n00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.220\nextremely, large number of keys.\n\n229\n00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.130\nCuz we have to guess a whole set\nof keys at every bit string.\n\n230\n00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.990\nSo at the 56 bit,\nat the 64 bit, at the 128 bit,\n\n231\n00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:07.600\nat the 256 bit level,\nthose keys get exponentially larger.\n\n232\n00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.180\nWhich means we have to guess a string or\n\n233\n00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.700\nset of keys in every category unless we\nknow the exact settings of the system.\n\n234\n00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.390\nNow that can be an advantage certainly.\n\n235\n00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.670\nIf we know the algorithm and\nknow how the crypto itself system is set,\n\n236\n00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.890\nhow it is configured, that's clearly gonna\ngive us an advantage and be a time saver.\n\n237\n00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.910\nBut we probably don't know that.\n\n238\n00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.710\nWe may be able to derive the algorithm,\n\n239\n00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:31.980\nwe're probably not gonna know the exact\nsettings that were used, how many rounds,\n\n240\n00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.170\nhow many XORs were done in order to\nencrypt or to reverse and decrypt.\n\n241\n00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.640\nWe're probably not gonna know any of that,\nquite honestly.\n\n242\n00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.220\nIf we did, we'd have the entire system,\nin effect, right.\n\n243\n00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:44.170\nWe'd have the box and we could open\nthe box, and we could examine it.\n\n244\n00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.880\nAnd we'd be able to then\nreproduce behavior based on that.\n\n245\n00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.230\nWe're lucky if we get there.\n\n246\n00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.560\nChances are good you're\nnot gonna be that lucky.\n\n247\n00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.850\nSo more often than not you're\ngonna have one element.\n\n248\n00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.200\nCipher text only attacks the cipher text.\n\n249\n00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.350\nYou have to gather enough cipher text,\nenough transmissions of\n\n250\n00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:04.840\ndifferent encryption runs for different\nmessages, that you look for a pattern.\n\n251\n00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.700\nRemember we've often talked about the fact\nin cryptography that patterns are bad.\n\n252\n00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.560\nI made that statement over and\nover and over again.\n\n253\n00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.960\nBecause anytime we have a pattern we are\nthinking about the fact that ultimately,\n\n254\n00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.690\npeople are just really cannot\nunderstand certain things, right?\n\n255\n00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:23.980\nSo when we think about patterns we're\nthinking about the fact that we see\n\n256\n00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.120\nsomething but we may not understand it.\n\n257\n00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.490\nIt's much like reading a sign,\nright, on a door.\n\n258\n00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.070\nWhen you read the sign on the door and\nit says Don't Come In, but\n\n259\n00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.440\nthen you come in anyway.\n\n260\n00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.070\nIt's like you didn't see the pattern,\nit was there but you didn't get it.\n\n261\n00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.240\nIt just went right over the head, right?\n\n262\n00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.445\nSo when we think about this, ow!\n\n263\n00:12:40.445 --> 00:12:43.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The podium just tried to attack me!\n\n264\n00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.480\nWhen we think about this,\n\n265\n00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.350\nwhat we're thinking about is the fact\nthat ultimately, we don't as protectors,\n\n266\n00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.750\nas defenders, we do not wanna create\npatterns in our CryptoStream.\n\n267\n00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.330\nWe wanna make sure everything is unique.\n\n268\n00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.360\nThe reality is, over time,\n\n269\n00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.330\nno matter how good we are,\npatterns are gonna be created.\n\n270\n00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.400\nSystems are ultimately\ngonna generate patterns,\n\n271\n00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.030\nbecause there's nothing that\nwe can do about the fact that,\n\n272\n00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:07.430\nat some point, we're gonna run out of\nrandomness in a system and there's gonna\n\n273\n00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:11.320\nbe repetition of something, It's just\nthe nature of the systems we build.\n\n274\n00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.480\nAttackers, on the other hand,\nwant patterns.\n\n275\n00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.460\nThey want sameness because\nit makes their life easier.\n\n276\n00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:23.440\nIf we can attack a system, it's because,\nif we're successful, we've deduced, or\n\n277\n00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.100\nwe've figured out what the pattern is.\n\n278\n00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:30.230\nSo with a cipher text only attack, we're\nlooking at multiple repetition events.\n\n279\n00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:34.020\nIn other words, we're looking at,\nhey I got five cypher texts here, and\n\n280\n00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.770\nthey all seem to start off the same way or\nthere seems to be this block in the middle\n\n281\n00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:42.900\nthat identical, this series of 56\nbits is the same in every message.\n\n282\n00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.120\nThat tells me something very significant.\n\n283\n00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.560\nIt tells me that there's some sort\nof repetition that's occurring\n\n284\n00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.660\nwith this block of information that\nwill allow me to start figuring out and\n\n285\n00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.140\nnarrowing down what the key may look like.\n\n286\n00:13:55.140 --> 00:14:00.240\nBecause if we start using keys that\ngenerate this block of text in this space,\n\n287\n00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.120\nwe're gonna begin to zero in on\nthe keys that might actually\n\n288\n00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.088\nbe generating the cipher text.\n\n289\n00:14:05.088 --> 00:14:08.260\nSo cipher text only attacks\nare difficult because you really don't\n\n290\n00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.420\nknow much of anything.\n\n291\n00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.280\nAll you know is the encrypted stream.\n\n292\n00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.240\nYou've gotta start analyzing huge volumes\nof information in order to work backwards.\n\n293\n00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.840\nBut remember,\nwe have an advantage as an attacker.\n\n294\n00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.410\nWe have automation on our side.\n\n295\n00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:23.690\nWe have systems that can run\nthrough these streams looking for\n\n296\n00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.320\npattern matches if they're\nprogrammed the right way.\n\n297\n00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.590\nAnd we can then set them off and\nbasically say okay, I'm gonna walk away.\n\n298\n00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:30.410\nI'm gonna come back.\n\n299\n00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:31.940\nShow me what the patterns are.\n\n300\n00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:35.430\nAnd then we can start to run\nkeys to produce those patterns,\n\n301\n00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.600\nusing different algorithms,\ntill we get to the right point.\n\n302\n00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.175\nAnd we can figure all that out.\n\n303\n00:14:39.175 --> 00:14:43.061\nSo cipher text only attacks are when\nwe know the cipher text text, but\n\n304\n00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:44.150\nnothing else.\n\n305\n00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.610\nThe known plain text attack,\nanother attack, like the name implies.\n\n306\n00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.410\nYou know the good thing\nabout these attacks,\n\n307\n00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:53.610\nthe name itself basically describes\nto you what the attack is.\n\n308\n00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:56.790\nEven if you don't remember the attack,\nyou can't describe it on an exam,\n\n309\n00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:00.530\nwhen you are given the name, you have\nto choose the best likely description.\n\n310\n00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.950\nBy sending you cipher text only,\nhopefully, you would have enough presence\n\n311\n00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.360\nof mind to look at the list and say,\nwell, that means I've got cypher text,\n\n312\n00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.900\nI should probably be looking for\nthat in the answer, right.\n\n313\n00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.800\nSo we're not trying to trick you.\n\n314\n00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.860\nWe are trying to just make\nyou aware of these attacks.\n\n315\n00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.310\nSo use some common sense.\n\n316\n00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.870\nThink about them.\n\n317\n00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:17.980\nTake a deep breathe.\n\n318\n00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:19.100\nAnd then you'll be fine.\n\n319\n00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.720\nKnown plain text,\nthe attacker has access to the cyphertext\n\n320\n00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.380\nas well as the plain text\nversion of the message.\n\n321\n00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.650\nIn other words, we have the plain text and\n\n322\n00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.530\nwe have the outcome of\nthat plain text runs.\n\n323\n00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:31.400\nNow we have two very important things.\n\n324\n00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.300\nWe have the before and after.\n\n325\n00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.987\nAnd now we can look at that message and\nsay the dog is blue and the dog is\n\n326\n00:15:36.987 --> 00:15:41.149\nblue equals this string, whatever it is,\nthe cipher text out the back end.\n\n327\n00:15:41.149 --> 00:15:45.100\nAs we start doing that we have more\nmessages, more runs of plain and\n\n328\n00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.495\ncipher text together then we can,\nagain, emerge and look for patterns.\n\n329\n00:15:49.495 --> 00:15:53.607\nSo, as we see the dog is green, the dog is\nred, the dog is blue, the dog is yellow,\n\n330\n00:15:53.607 --> 00:15:56.826\nand the first four parts of that\nmessage are always the same, and\n\n331\n00:15:56.826 --> 00:16:00.819\nyet it changes in the cypher text, we can\nbegin to zero in on what is different and\n\n332\n00:16:00.819 --> 00:16:02.634\nwhat is the same and how that works.\n\n333\n00:16:02.634 --> 00:16:05.650\nSo know in plain text,\nyou have both the cypher text and\n\n334\n00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:07.497\nthe plain text available to you.\n\n335\n00:16:07.497 --> 00:16:11.260\nAgain, goal is try to find the key, right?\n\n336\n00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.750\nShows in plain text.\n\n337\n00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.090\nWhat do we think that one would be?\n\n338\n00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:14.980\nWell, most likely,\n\n339\n00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.810\nas I said, we are gonna be able to\nknow something about the system.\n\n340\n00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:22.418\nIn this case, we're gonna be able to\nchoose and know what the plain text is.\n\n341\n00:16:22.418 --> 00:16:25.908\nSo, we're gonna be able to effectively\nprogram the outcomes in the system.\n\n342\n00:16:25.908 --> 00:16:30.810\nWe can run text through the system\nchoosing what we want to encrypt.\n\n343\n00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.010\nWe get, obviously,\ncypher text out the back end.\n\n344\n00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.010\nAnd then, we have to effectively\nstart working backwards.\n\n345\n00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.270\nSo, when the chosen plain text attack,\nattacker knows the algorithm.\n\n346\n00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.270\nSo, we have knowledge of\nthe algorithm as well.\n\n347\n00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.350\nAs well as having the machine,\nthe machinery, the crypto system or\n\n348\n00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.280\naccess to it, to move the chosen\nplain text through the system.\n\n349\n00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.130\nThis may not happen all\nthe time obviously, right?\n\n350\n00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.650\nAnd this is something that you may or\nmay not be able to pull off.\n\n351\n00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.900\nYou would have to have access\nto the entire crypto system in\n\n352\n00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.500\norder to carry out a chosen\nplain text attack.\n\n353\n00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.176\nSo, during the second World War,\nwhen the Allies, specifically the British,\n\n354\n00:17:04.176 --> 00:17:08.442\nin particular, were engaged in code\ncracking activities trying to break\n\n355\n00:17:08.442 --> 00:17:11.919\nthe Japanese as well as\nthe German military codes, right?\n\n356\n00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:14.851\nYou've probably, some of you,\nmost of you, if you're history buffs or\n\n357\n00:17:14.851 --> 00:17:16.364\nhave heard about this period of time,\n\n358\n00:17:16.364 --> 00:17:19.281\nwould probably have heard of what's\ncalled an ENIGMA machine, right?\n\n359\n00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:22.836\nThe ENIGMA machine was the German\nmilitary code box that was used,\n\n360\n00:17:22.836 --> 00:17:27.300\nin effect, to do all the deciphering and\nencyphering of German military traffic.\n\n361\n00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.210\nIt was a highly guarded secret, probably\none of the most important intelligence\n\n362\n00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.870\nsecrets of the second world war.\n\n363\n00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.740\nBecause if the Allies were able\nto figure out the ENIGMA code,\n\n364\n00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.810\nthey could effectively read\nall of the German traffic,\n\n365\n00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:41.070\nfigure out what they were doing and,\neffectively, shorten the war.\n\n366\n00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.010\nSo, this was a focused effort.\n\n367\n00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:44.680\nAnd there was a lot of stories\nthat came out of this.\n\n368\n00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.470\nThere's several movies that have been\nmade about this whole period of time and\n\n369\n00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.720\nhow they, ultimately,\nthe Allies were successful in doing this.\n\n370\n00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:53.970\nOne of the things that they ultimately\nfigured out how to do effectively\n\n371\n00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.350\nwas to reproduce the ENIGMA machine, and\n\n372\n00:17:56.350 --> 00:18:00.790\nas a result could effectively executive\nchosen in plain text attacks and then\n\n373\n00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:05.500\ndecode information as a result because\nthey have the machinery, crypto system.\n\n374\n00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.010\nThey understood the sequencing, so,\nthe setting up, the key sequencing, and\n\n375\n00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.450\nthe positioning of the rotors.\n\n376\n00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.900\nAnd they could then run text through and\nget ciphered text out the backend.\n\n377\n00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.940\nThey could reverse the process and\nthen run ciphered text through and\n\n378\n00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.610\nget the original plain\ntext out the other side.\n\n379\n00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:24.550\nIn that particular solution, the key that\nthey were looking for was the setting of\n\n380\n00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:28.070\nthe rotors, the actual drums that\nmoved around to do the encrypting and\n\n381\n00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:29.610\ndecrypting of the message.\n\n382\n00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.480\nIt was done a little\ndifferently back then.\n\n383\n00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.130\nAnd so, the idea was basically,\nthey still looked for the key.\n\n384\n00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.630\nThey looked for\nthe settings of the system specifically\n\n385\n00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.475\nto figure out how to then do\nthe encryption and decryption.\n\n386\n00:18:39.475 --> 00:18:42.410\nChosen cypher text attack, basically\nthe same thing we just talked about.\n\n387\n00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.940\nThe only difference is we have access to,\nagain, the cryptosystem,\n\n388\n00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.040\nthe device just running it backwards.\n\n389\n00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:52.000\nAnd we're able to effectively choose the\ncypher text we want to run through to get\n\n390\n00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.900\nplain text out the back end and try to\nfigure out how that system is set up.\n\n391\n00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.520\nSo, it's the same concept,\n\n392\n00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.430\njust effectively in reverse\nfrom chosen plain text.\n\n393\n00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.842\nWe can all see differential\ncryptoanalysis.\n\n394\n00:19:02.842 --> 00:19:05.650\nDifferential cryptanalysis\nis a more complex attack.\n\n395\n00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.920\nThis, effectively, allows us to look\nat execution times in the system and\n\n396\n00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.050\nunderstand how the system if functioning.\n\n397\n00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.930\nThe more complex the encryption,\n\n398\n00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.950\nthe more likely it is the system\nwill take longer to execute.\n\n399\n00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.180\nThe less complex it is,\nthe less time it takes traditionally.\n\n400\n00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:24.600\nAnd by looking at the power and\nthe actual execution cycles in the time,\n\n401\n00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.800\nwe may be able to start deducing things\nabout the system, how it's set up.\n\n402\n00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.210\nBut, ultimately,\nwhat kind of encryption is being used.\n\n403\n00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.060\nAgain, these are very difficult\nattacks in many cases.\n\n404\n00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:34.280\nYou have to be an expert.\n\n405\n00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:37.330\nIn this case, in electrical engineering\nand mechanical engineering to\n\n406\n00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:42.350\nunderstand how to deconstruct a system and\nanalyze timing and power ratios.\n\n407\n00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:44.360\nBut this is an attack that can take place.\n\n408\n00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.090\nAnd, indeed, there are people that\nspecialize in doing this kind of stuff.\n\n409\n00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:51.469\nBut it's not something you would go out\non YouTube and just watch a video and\n\n410\n00:19:51.469 --> 00:19:54.380\nin your garage or at your kitchen\ntable you could go and execute.\n\n411\n00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.940\nIt's a little bit more involved than that.\n\n412\n00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:00.110\nWe also have what's known as\nlinear cryptanalysis attacks.\n\n413\n00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:04.420\nA linear cryptanalysis attack is, anything\nthat's linear is looking at a progression,\n\n414\n00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.350\na path that is kind of A to B to C,\n\n415\n00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.790\nand we're looking at how we go across\nthat path and what the activities are.\n\n416\n00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:13.220\nA linear cryptanalysis solution, or\n\n417\n00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.430\na linear set of attacks, is gonna\neffectively try to describe the behavior\n\n418\n00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:21.740\nof the system that's doing the encryption,\nthe cryptosystem, analyze it.\n\n419\n00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:25.050\nAnd if we then, again, if we can gain\nadvantage by understanding the settings,\n\n420\n00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:29.100\nthe algorithm used, the number of\nrounds of XORing, the key strength,\n\n421\n00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.820\nthings of that nature,\nwe can then reproduce it and\n\n422\n00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.020\nultimately start running plaintext\nciphertext through with different keys.\n\n423\n00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:38.270\nAnd figure out ultimately how that\nis going to effectively yield\n\n424\n00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.380\nthe results we want.\n\n425\n00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:42.535\nIf we run enough pairs of plain text and\n\n426\n00:20:42.535 --> 00:20:45.660\ncyphertext through a system,\nwe eventually start repeating.\n\n427\n00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:48.480\nAs we said, it may take while but\nthere will be repetition.\n\n428\n00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.860\nAnd we will then start to be able\nto match keys to cipher text and\n\n429\n00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.545\nthen simply look at that match.\n\n430\n00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:55.910\nIn effect,\nwe then look at what we've produced and\n\n431\n00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:57.960\nultimately figure out\nhow to decode messages.\n\n432\n00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.240\nSo it's a, matter of patience,\nas well as it is a matter of luck.\n\n433\n00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.850\nImplementation attacks.\n\n434\n00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.050\nThese are attacks that look at\nthe actual architecture of the system.\n\n435\n00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:06.940\nHow is it implemented?\n\n436\n00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.670\nI mentioned that for instance,\nWEP really suffered,\n\n437\n00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:14.570\nnot from a bad algorithm, but\na bad implementation of a good algorithm.\n\n438\n00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:18.000\nAnd so, implementation attacks against\nagainst WEP were ultimately successful\n\n439\n00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.264\nat cracking WEP because the architecture\nproved to be not only not up to the task,\n\n440\n00:21:22.264 --> 00:21:24.770\nbut proved to be a really,\nreally unfortunately\n\n441\n00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:28.932\nbad set of choices that led to a weak,\nultimately, a weak cryptosystem.\n\n442\n00:21:28.932 --> 00:21:31.940\nSo, implementation attacks allow\nus to attack the architecture and\n\n443\n00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:33.240\nthe set up and system.\n\n444\n00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.750\nReplay attacks allow us to effectively\nforce a breakdown in the system and\n\n445\n00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:42.060\nthen ask somebody to resend that\ninformation hoping that during the resend\n\n446\n00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:46.320\nprocess we may be able to insert\ndata that we can then control.\n\n447\n00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.840\nBecause if there's no time stamping,\nthere's no session keying of any kind,\n\n448\n00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.670\nthere's no way to track that.\n\n449\n00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:54.370\nWe then may be able to actually\ninsert our own data and\n\n450\n00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:56.300\nstart to manipulate the system.\n\n451\n00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.116\nOh, you didn't really mean\nto send the dog as blue,\n\n452\n00:21:59.116 --> 00:22:01.550\nyou really wanted to\nsend Mike needs coffee.\n\n453\n00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.310\nAnd if we can then go ahead and\ndecrypt Mike needs coffee and\n\n454\n00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:07.760\nfigure that out, we can work backwards and\ntry to figure out what the keys are.\n\n455\n00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:10.240\nActually, Mike needs coffee with\nreal sugar, is what Mike needs.\n\n456\n00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:10.820\n>> That'd be better.\n\n457\n00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.521\n>> That'd be better, right?\n\n458\n00:22:11.521 --> 00:22:13.550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, so that's another kind of attack.\n\n459\n00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:14.770\nAlgebraic attacks.\n\n460\n00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.220\nA class of attacks, or\na group of attacks, that rely on,\n\n461\n00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:22.040\nliterally, the analysis of algebra,\nthe analysis of the mathematics of\n\n462\n00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.220\nthe actual algorithms that\nare being used in the system.\n\n463\n00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:31.090\nSo, we will analyze RSA algorithms,\nanalyze RC4, RC5, Blowfish, Twofish,\n\n464\n00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:35.605\nwhatever it may be, looking for weaknesses\nin the implementation of the algorithm.\n\n465\n00:22:35.605 --> 00:22:38.375\nOr the actual use of the algorithm itself\n\n466\n00:22:38.375 --> 00:22:41.385\nin such a way that we may find\nfault in the mathematics.\n\n467\n00:22:41.385 --> 00:22:43.415\nAgain, very complicated set of attacks.\n\n468\n00:22:43.415 --> 00:22:45.465\nHave to specialize in these things.\n\n469\n00:22:45.465 --> 00:22:47.555\nOne of the things that makes\na lot of this easier for\n\n470\n00:22:47.555 --> 00:22:51.590\nus is the use of something\nreferred to as rainbow tables.\n\n471\n00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.040\nAnd so, what we're gonna wanna\ndo is really just think for\n\n472\n00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.520\na minute about what a rainbow table is.\n\n473\n00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.170\nWe're gonna let you take a look at\nwhere we can find them here online\n\n474\n00:22:58.170 --> 00:22:58.720\nin just a minute.\n\n475\n00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.200\nBut let's just describe what rainbow\ntables are where we're gonna\n\n476\n00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.990\nultimately put that up and take a look\nat the website where we find them.\n\n477\n00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.420\nThe idea of a rainbow table is ultimately,\n\n478\n00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:10.110\nbasically nothing more than just series\nof a lookup tables that we can use.\n\n479\n00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.110\nBut the idea behind a rainbow table is\nactually pretty cool when you think\n\n480\n00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.840\nabout it.\n\n481\n00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.720\nWhen we think about running\na hashing solution,\n\n482\n00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.780\nwhat we're doing is effectively taking\nsome sort of data, a hashing algorithm,\n\n483\n00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.640\nthen producing a bit stream,\na hash out the backend.\n\n484\n00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.678\nWhat a rainbow does, effectively,\nis allows us to look every possible\n\n485\n00:23:27.678 --> 00:23:31.400\ncombination for a password,\nlet's say hypothetically.\n\n486\n00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.340\nAnd allows us to run the hash\nof that password through every\n\n487\n00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.550\nkind of algorithm with\nevery kind of setting.\n\n488\n00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:39.880\nAnd effectively generates\nall the outcomes.\n\n489\n00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.370\nAnd then p,uts them into a table for us.\n\n490\n00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.690\nSo, we have the password that was used,\nor the phrase or\n\n491\n00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:45.870\nwhatever it was that was used.\n\n492\n00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:50.270\nAnd then, we have equivalent on the far\nside what the hash is or the outcome is.\n\n493\n00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:53.430\nAs a result of that, what we then\ncan do is use that rainbow table and\n\n494\n00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:57.030\nwe can feed it into an automated system.\n\n495\n00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.493\nTypically, a password\ncracking system of some kind.\n\n496\n00:23:59.493 --> 00:24:03.210\nThere are many pieces of\nsoftware out there that do this.\n\n497\n00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:04.417\nJohn the Ripper.\n\n498\n00:24:04.417 --> 00:24:05.776\nJohn the Ripper v2.\n\n499\n00:24:05.776 --> 00:24:10.141\nPWdump, L0phtCrack which is an oldie but\na goodie.\n\n500\n00:24:10.141 --> 00:24:13.200\nIt's not actually made anymore but\nyou still find it out there on the web.\n\n501\n00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.930\nBut whatever tool you use,\n\n502\n00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.610\nright, Hyena is another one I\nthink that you can use as well.\n\n503\n00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:21.300\nThere's all sorts of really cool\npassword cracking programs.\n\n504\n00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.970\nYou feed Rainbow Tables into them, and\nwhat you do is effectively sit back and\n\n505\n00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:29.770\nsay, okay what I want ultimately is to\nfind the match for what this hash is.\n\n506\n00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:31.290\nSo you have a hash string.\n\n507\n00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.650\nRight?\nAnd you want to decode the hashing effect.\n\n508\n00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:38.200\nSo, you run the rainbow table, and it just\nruns every hash looking for the match.\n\n509\n00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.960\nWhen you find it,\nthat hash equals whatever the password is,\n\n510\n00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.070\nwhatever the phrase was that generated it.\n\n511\n00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:46.880\nNow, you could do that blind, but\nit obviously takes a lot longer.\n\n512\n00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.650\nThe rainbow table gives you all\nthe pre-computed values and\n\n513\n00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:53.280\nall you need to do is sit back and\nwait for the pattern match to show up.\n\n514\n00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:56.950\nSo for instance, several years ago,\nyou may or may not remember, but\n\n515\n00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:59.220\nseveral years ago LinkedIn was attacked.\n\n516\n00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.660\nAnd somebody was able to dump the user\naccount database with all the usernames\n\n517\n00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.840\nand passwords.\n\n518\n00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.310\nAnd so, there was a big article about it.\n\n519\n00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.930\nEveryone was on edge about it.\n\n520\n00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:11.153\nYou had to go in and change your password\nin order to safeguard your account.\n\n521\n00:25:11.153 --> 00:25:12.150\nI happened to actually\nbe doing a conversation,\n\n522\n00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:15.680\nI was actually in the middle\nof speaking at a huge security\n\n523\n00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.860\nconference when this happened.\n\n524\n00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:19.950\nThis happened the night before, so\nthe next morning, I'm speaking to\n\n525\n00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:25.200\nseveral thousand people, not only to\nthem but generally about security.\n\n526\n00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.230\nAnd so we turned it into a learning event,\nright?\n\n527\n00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.640\nAnd so I got a copy of the database,\ncuz I went online that night,\n\n528\n00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.308\nfigured out this had happened,\ndownloaded the posted LinkedIn database.\n\n529\n00:25:35.308 --> 00:25:37.730\nAnd then I did a live demo in\nfront of everybody that said okay,\n\n530\n00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:38.780\nyou heard about this last night.\n\n531\n00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:41.340\nYeah, this is horrible, wow,\nthis is so, such a problem.\n\n532\n00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.400\nI can't believe this happened.\n\n533\n00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.820\nOkay, do you wanna see\nif you're on the list?\n\n534\n00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.720\nOh, okay, cool, can you tell us\nwhether we were hacked, absolutely.\n\n535\n00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.576\nSo, come up out of the audience, Mr.\n\n536\n00:25:49.576 --> 00:25:53.270\nand Ms. I wanna know if I'm hacked, and\ngive me your name and let's find out.\n\n537\n00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:56.650\nSo we did three or four of these, and\nwhat I did is I just basically ran\n\n538\n00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:00.660\ntheir hash of their password through\na password cracking program, and I used\n\n539\n00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.780\na rainbow table to do the comparison\nto show them how it could do that.\n\n540\n00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.916\nAnd I said, okay, so\nyou tell me what your password is.\n\n541\n00:26:05.916 --> 00:26:08.620\nWe're not going to expose it,\nbut tell me what it is and\n\n542\n00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.070\nwe'll see if it's on this list.\n\n543\n00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.140\nAnd if it is,\nwe'll know that you're in there.\n\n544\n00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.470\nAnd so we did this three or\nfour times, to great fanfare and\n\n545\n00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:17.950\ngreat effect, in the audience\nbecause it was a really tangible way\n\n546\n00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:22.060\nof showing somebody exactly what\nthe impact of this kind of technology is.\n\n547\n00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.025\nCan we quickly just take a look\nat where we find rainbow tables?\n\n548\n00:26:25.025 --> 00:26:25.886\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> So\n\n549\n00:26:25.886 --> 00:26:27.590\nhow you get them is\npretty straight forward.\n\n550\n00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:30.800\nYou can go out online, and all we did was\njust go out and literally google rainbow\n\n551\n00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:34.130\ntables, and you'll find a listing of\nall sorts of sites that are out there.\n\n552\n00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:37.090\nBut what you'll see is you have a list of\nrainbow tables on this particular site.\n\n553\n00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:40.470\nAnd all you do is literally go in and\nthere's some download links there.\n\n554\n00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:45.580\nYou can go in and grab different\nrainbow tables from as you'll see LM,\n\n555\n00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.980\nNTLM, some LAN manager NTLM,\nand TLAN manager.\n\n556\n00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.580\nSo those are for\n\n557\n00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:53.050\nWindows obviously depending on the version\nof Windows you may be running.\n\n558\n00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:57.100\nOlder versions are gonna use LM,\nnewer versions NTLM.\n\n559\n00:26:57.100 --> 00:27:00.380\nMD5s, you see\nthe MD5 Rainbow Tables there.\n\n560\n00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:02.630\nAnd if you go down, depending on the site,\nyou'll see other ones.\n\n561\n00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.890\nProbably SHA1, so SHA1 is there.\n\n562\n00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.540\nSo there's all sorts of\ndifferent algorithms.\n\n563\n00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.420\nObviously the longer the list,\nthe more Rainbow Tables there are,\n\n564\n00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.420\nthe more likely it is you're gonna\nfind the ones that you may need.\n\n565\n00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.330\nNow, just two big cautions about this.\n\n566\n00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.060\nNumber one,\nwhile they're not illegal to use.\n\n567\n00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.750\nI want to be clear.\n\n568\n00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.800\nYou can download these.\n\n569\n00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.630\nThere's nothing wrong with using them.\n\n570\n00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.300\nYou do need to understand that\nall the knowledge we give you,\n\n571\n00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:32.390\nespecially in some area like this, is,\nlet's say, practical in the sense that\n\n572\n00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:36.060\nwe want you to understand the mechanisms\nthat could be used to attack you.\n\n573\n00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.320\nBut we also wanna make sure\nyou understand that behavior\n\n574\n00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.570\nin this particular area has\nto follow certain guidelines.\n\n575\n00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:44.520\nAnd what I'm trying to get at is\nyou have to always act ethically,\n\n576\n00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.250\nas we talked about, and act honorably.\n\n577\n00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.260\nWe don't want you going out and\n\n578\n00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.170\nusing Rainbow Tables to try\nto break into a system, but\n\n579\n00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.380\nrather to understand that they can be\nused to break into your systems and\n\n580\n00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:57.550\nhow to use and defend against that is\nreally what we're talking about here.\n\n581\n00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:01.780\nHaving said that, it's not illegal\nto download and use rainbow tables.\n\n582\n00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:05.600\nHowever, please understand that\nthe use of password cracking software\n\n583\n00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.700\ncan be considered a problem\nin certain circles.\n\n584\n00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.910\nAnd you have to have very strict\nusage guidelines, and understand what\n\n585\n00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.400\nthey are inside your organizations,\nto govern this kind of behavior.\n\n586\n00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.500\nIn other words as an IT professional,\nas a security professional\n\n587\n00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:22.710\nit may be acceptable for you to use\nthese tools in certain circumstances.\n\n588\n00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:25.420\nBut there may also be\na very strict legal policy\n\n589\n00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.620\nin place in your organization that\nprevents this kind of behavior.\n\n590\n00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.080\nIf there is you may afoul of that even\nthough you're not doing anything wrong.\n\n591\n00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:36.040\nYou're simply just trying to figure out\nhow to defend against these attacks.\n\n592\n00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.930\nMake sure you understand\nthe rules of the game and\n\n593\n00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:40.560\nthe operational procedures is\nwhat I'm suggesting to you.\n\n594\n00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.620\nYou never want to wind up saying\nafter the fact, I didn't know,\n\n595\n00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.920\nand as a result of not knowing\nI did something wrong.\n\n596\n00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.980\nThat's not going to be a good conversation\nfor you to have with anybody, all right,\n\n597\n00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.240\nso just be aware of that.\n\n598\n00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.770\nWe also can use frequency\nanalysis to be able to go in and,\n\n599\n00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:57.670\nagain, looking for patterns and\nthe frequency of information repetition\n\n600\n00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.750\nis what we'd be focusing on with frequency\nanalysis, so we want to think about that.\n\n601\n00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:02.720\nWe also have an attack,\n\n602\n00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.000\nwhich is always fun to talk about,\ncalled the birthday attack.\n\n603\n00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.170\nIt's actually based on\na mathematical paradox.\n\n604\n00:29:08.170 --> 00:29:10.570\nA statistical problem called\nthe birthday paradox.\n\n605\n00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.130\nYou can actually look that up and\nGoogle it.\n\n606\n00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:13.210\nAnd read a little bit about it.\n\n607\n00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.150\nIt's a well known statistical problem.\n\n608\n00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:16.740\nI know that because I\nhad it in statistics.\n\n609\n00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.510\nI hated it then.\n\n610\n00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.050\nI still hate it now.\n\n611\n00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:22.630\nSo the birthday attack is based on\nthe ideas behind the birthday paradox.\n\n612\n00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:26.340\nThe problem in statistics which says if we\nput a certain number of people in a room\n\n613\n00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.270\nbasically, what's that magical\nnumber that we get to where\n\n614\n00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.160\nrandomly two people in that room\nare gonna share the same birthday.\n\n615\n00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.830\nAnd that number, that special number\nis actually very critical for us and\n\n616\n00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:41.330\nwe start to think about these types\nof systems and how we attack them\n\n617\n00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:45.540\nbecause the reality is that there is gonna\nbe repetition in everything, as I said.\n\n618\n00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.840\nIf we put 100 people in a room\nthe chances that two of them randomly\n\n619\n00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.820\nwill share the same\nbirthday are significant.\n\n620\n00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:57.810\nThe chances that a specific person,\nMike, is gonna find his particular match\n\n621\n00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:01.770\nin that room is a little bit lower in the\nsense that now we've narrowed the field.\n\n622\n00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:05.780\nNow we want to find the exact match for\nthis one individual.\n\n623\n00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:09.580\nBut if we say generically in a pool\nof 100, is there gonna be a match?\n\n624\n00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:10.740\nThe answer is absolutely.\n\n625\n00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.760\nAnd we don't need very many\npeople to make that happen.\n\n626\n00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.140\nAnd so measuring that and understanding\nwhat that breakpoint number is to get\n\n627\n00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.450\na match randomly is what we use to\neffectively execute a birthday attack\n\n628\n00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:25.270\nbecause what that says is,\nin a large enough pool of encrypted or\n\n629\n00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:29.790\nciphertext messages, there's going to\nstart being matches and we can look for\n\n630\n00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.860\nthose matches and\nthen find the key by working backwards.\n\n631\n00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:36.680\nAnd so the idea behind a birthday\nattack is effectively it's generically\n\n632\n00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:39.970\nconsidered to be relatively easy\nin a large pool of information\n\n633\n00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:44.550\nto find messages that may share a same key\nor may share a key that is similar and\n\n634\n00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:46.270\ntherefore allow us to decode them.\n\n635\n00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:50.280\nSo we can use this kind of an attack\nas well and you'll think about that.\n\n636\n00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:54.230\nThere's also factoring attacks, attacks\nthat actually can attack the way in which\n\n637\n00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:58.140\nspecific algorithms, in this case,\nRSA algorithms are used and implemented.\n\n638\n00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:02.940\nThe RSA algorithm is built on\nthe idea of factoring prime numbers,\n\n639\n00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.110\nbut not just any prime numbers.\n\n640\n00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:08.180\nNot one and three, but\nfactoring incredibly large prime numbers.\n\n641\n00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:12.950\nNumbers that go out hundreds, thousands,\ntens or hundreds of thousands of places.\n\n642\n00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:14.970\nReally, really big numbers, right?\n\n643\n00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:17.090\nSo when we factor those numbers,\n\n644\n00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:20.500\nthe result of that factoring\nprocess can yield a unique key.\n\n645\n00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.188\nAnd so the RSA algorithm is based on\nthe mathematics involved with that.\n\n646\n00:31:24.188 --> 00:31:27.810\nWe can attack that if we can figure\nout what those prime numbers are.\n\n647\n00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:28.480\nIt's not easy.\n\n648\n00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.400\nAgain, we're not talking\nabout small numbers.\n\n649\n00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.820\nWe're talking about huge numbers.\n\n650\n00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.280\nNumbers that are difficult for\nus as humans to work with and understand.\n\n651\n00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.918\nWe need computers to do this.\n\n652\n00:31:37.918 --> 00:31:39.360\nBut if you're able to do that and\n\n653\n00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.760\nfigure it out,\nyou can also attack the system as well.\n\n654\n00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.650\nThis is called a factoring attack.\n\n655\n00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:46.080\nWe may also socially\nengineer a key discovery.\n\n656\n00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.500\nWe may go in and try to figure out how\nto get the key away from somebody by\n\n657\n00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.320\neffectively tricking them\ninto giving it to us, right?\n\n658\n00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.160\nMike, what'd you have for\nbreakfast this morning?\n\n659\n00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.630\nMike will probably answer that question,\nright?\n\n660\n00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:59.897\nBut if I then ask another series\nof questions, somewhere in these,\n\n661\n00:31:59.897 --> 00:32:03.701\nI insert something about Mike, what do\nyou think Is the best use of a password.\n\n662\n00:32:03.701 --> 00:32:04.862\nWhat is your password?\n\n663\n00:32:04.862 --> 00:32:07.730\nWhat would you use if I asked\nyou to tell me what it was?\n\n664\n00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:11.430\nProbably wouldn't tell me directly, but if\nI tricked Mike in to giving it away to me.\n\n665\n00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:14.520\nHe may actually give me information that\nwill let me then ultimately figure out\n\n666\n00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:15.300\nwhat it is.\n\n667\n00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.510\nSo social engineering,\ncoercion, bribery, trickery,\n\n668\n00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:21.840\nwhatever you call that, could also\nbe used potentially to steal a key.\n\n669\n00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.160\nAnd so we wanna think about that as yet\n\n670\n00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.000\nanother way that we can\noffer an attack factor here.\n\n671\n00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.400\nDictionary attacks,\nwe talked about these as well.\n\n672\n00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.650\nThe idea that ultimately we have,\nknown passwords,\n\n673\n00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:34.640\nsomebody knows what they are,\nthey put them in.\n\n674\n00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.700\nWe talked about rainbow\ntables as one version, or\n\n675\n00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.650\none thought process in this area.\n\n676\n00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:42.650\nMore generically dictionary attacks are\nsimply lists of passwords that can be fed\n\n677\n00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:46.700\ninto an automatic password cracking\nprogram, and can then be used effectively.\n\n678\n00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.080\nTo do the match and find the password.\n\n679\n00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:52.530\nSo it's like the inverse,\nthe reverse of a rainbow table.\n\n680\n00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.208\nCuz rainbow table gives you the hashes,\n\n681\n00:32:54.208 --> 00:32:56.400\na dictionary attack works\nwith the passwords.\n\n682\n00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.420\nSo we have two sides in effect of the same\ncoin, but we could do this as well.\n\n683\n00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.400\nAnd we've talked about brute force,\nobviously things of that nature.\n\n684\n00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.810\nAlways comeback,\nwe always have that conversations.\n\n685\n00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.320\nWhat about reverse engineering?\n\n686\n00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.780\nWhat if we could take the system,\ntake it apart, figure it out,\n\n687\n00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:11.310\nput it back together again?\n\n688\n00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:14.880\nAnd affect understand how to run the\nsystem in reverse and learn enough about\n\n689\n00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.830\nit to effectively build our own decryption\nengine out of the encryption engine.\n\n690\n00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.460\nThis is yet another way that\nwe can attack a cryptosystem.\n\n691\n00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.600\nThere's so many different\nthings we can do that it really\n\n692\n00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.040\nprobably is boggling your mind, cuz I\nknow you're probably full at this point.\n\n693\n00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.581\nAnd it boggles our minds when we\nthink about talking about them.\n\n694\n00:33:30.581 --> 00:33:34.300\nBut there's so many ways in which\na Cryptosystem can be attacked.\n\n695\n00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:39.560\nThat as defenders we really need to\nbe focused on good implementation,.\n\n696\n00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.260\nGood architecture,\ngood administrative habits, right?\n\n697\n00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:44.570\nAll the things we've talked\nabout can be mitigated.\n\n698\n00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:46.910\nThey can be minimized\nin terms of exposure.\n\n699\n00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:50.170\nBut they can't be dealt with and\na never seen from or heard from again.\n\n700\n00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:51.580\nAnd if we can't zero them out.\n\n701\n00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:54.860\nWe're never gonna get rid of all of\nthe risks associated with cryptography.\n\n702\n00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:59.200\nBut if we're smart and we are doing\nthe things we know need to be done.\n\n703\n00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.190\nWe can minimize them to the point\nto that it's very likely that\n\n704\n00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:06.180\nour Cryptosystems will outlast our\nattacker's abilities to attack them.\n\n705\n00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.950\nThis is really ultimately what we wanna\nthink about as we think about how\n\n706\n00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:09.880\ndo we defend.\n\n707\n00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.466\nAnd by having knowledge\nof how we are attacked,\n\n708\n00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:13.060\nwe'd become better at\nthinking how we defend.\n\n709\n00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.030\n>> Very good Adam,\na lot of great information there,\n\n710\n00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:18.940\nreally important to understand\nwhat the bad guys are doing so\n\n711\n00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.490\nthat we can better defend against it.\n\n712\n00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:22.930\nUnderstand the methods that they're using.\n\n713\n00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:26.170\nTo try to get into our systems and\ntry to crack our passwords or\n\n714\n00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.610\ncrack our cryptography,\nwe can better defend against that.\n\n715\n00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:30.562\nGood stuff.\n\n716\n00:34:30.562 --> 00:34:34.760\nAll right, remember, if you guys want\nto attend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n717\n00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.390\nshoot us an e-mail, SeeAdam@itprov.tv.\n\n718\n00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:39.440\nThat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n719\n00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.201\nSigning off, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n720\n00:34:41.201 --> 00:34:42.176\n>> I'm Adam Gordan.\n\n721\n00:34:42.176 --> 00:34:43.545\nAnd

here at ITPro.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.260\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n5\n00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.900\nToday, we're doing our CISSP.\n\n6\n00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.850\nAnd specifically, we're gonna be getting\ninto Site and Facility Design, and\n\n7\n00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.950\nto that end Physical Security.\n\n8\n00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.160\nIt's one of those areas that I think most\nof us have a good understanding of some\n\n9\n00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.910\nbasic physical security, but there's\nreally some areas that sometimes I find\n\n10\n00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.320\nthat are kind of surprising,\nthat we don't think about, or get left\n\n11\n00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.260\noff of the list or not checked so here\nto help us with that is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.240\nHow are you doing Adam?\n\n13\n00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.510\n>> I'm good, I'm good.\n\n14\n00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.345\n>> I'm also anchored to the floor so\nnobody can walk away with me.\n\n15\n00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm physically secure.\n\n16\n00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.780\n>> Perfect.\n\n17\n00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.860\n>> Very important, right, because I'm\nwearing my extra special socks this\n\n18\n00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.780\nmorning, and\n>> You don't anyone to steal those.\n\n19\n00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.060\n>> I don't know if we've even seen that.\n\n20\n00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.290\nCan we go back out to the wide shot here?\n\n21\n00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.760\n>> I think we did.\nWe got to get rid of my name there.\n\n22\n00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.350\nTo see them.\nSo,\n\n23\n00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.850\nI have the grey with the orange\npolka dots on this morning.\n\n24\n00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.095\nI'm rocking an orange polka dot grey pair\nof socks in case anybody was wondering.\n\n25\n00:01:06.095 --> 00:01:07.700\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n26\n00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.180\nwhen we think about Physical Security.\n\n27\n00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.510\nRight?\nWhat we're thinking about ultimately\n\n28\n00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.280\nSite Design.\n\n29\n00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.330\nPhysical Security,\n>> So, to do the security, we're\n\n30\n00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.300\nthinking about the things that we have\nto do in order to make the operational\n\n31\n00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.260\nenvironments that we are going to live and\nwork in every day more secure.\n\n32\n00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.650\nRight?\nThe goal is to not let bad actors get to\n\n33\n00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.370\nour stuff.\n\n34\n00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.350\nIf they come and confine our stuff,\nthey're probably going to take it away or\n\n35\n00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.610\nwe're going to have to fight with\nthem to make sure they can't.\n\n36\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.530\nWe'd rather keep them far away and\nlet them go bother somebody else, right?\n\n37\n00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.590\nWe often talk, and I have often talked\nabout this idea of being this much better\n\n38\n00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.090\nthan the attacker that's\ncoming to take your stuff.\n\n39\n00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.170\nIf you can do that, they're going to\nhopefully go down the street somewhere,\n\n40\n00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.440\nlogically or physically, and they're going\nto go play in somebody else's backyard.\n\n41\n00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.090\nAnd if that person isn't that much better,\nthen they're going to take their stuff.\n\n42\n00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.110\nThat sucks for them, but\nit doesn't suck for you and so,\n\n43\n00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.800\nwhat you wanna make sure is that you don't\nlet people get near your stuff, right?\n\n44\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.820\nThis is a really important thought\nprocess, so we gotta start figuring out\n\n45\n00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.420\nhow to do that by first understanding\nwhere our stuff is, right?\n\n46\n00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.610\nAnd what is the boundary of what is ours?\n\n47\n00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.730\nSo, we have to do a survey, specifically\ndo what's called a Site Survey.\n\n48\n00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.100\nAnd a Security Site Survey is\nreally what we're focused on.\n\n49\n00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.310\nWhat are the outlying boundaries?\n\n50\n00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.120\nWhat are the areas we have to defend?\n\n51\n00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.440\nWhat do they look like?\n\n52\n00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.080\nWhat stuff is where?\n\n53\n00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.630\nThis is the goal of\ndoing a security survey.\n\n54\n00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.800\nWe have to understand all the security\nmeasures were already in place, and\n\n55\n00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.330\nfigure out which ones are good and\nwhich ones may not be so good.\n\n56\n00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.760\nAnd the ones that are not so good we have\nto mark and then ultimately maybe change.\n\n57\n00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.070\nSo, we may have locks on doors.\n\n58\n00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.540\nFor instance as an example.\n\n59\n00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.090\nBut those locks may be easily\nbroken they may not be very sturdy.\n\n60\n00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.750\nThey may not be locks that are going to\nactually have a dead bolt that goes into\n\n61\n00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.910\nthe frame, but rather just one of those\nyou push the button in lock on the handle\n\n62\n00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.250\nand the handle's kind of old and rickety.\n\n63\n00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.680\nYou can just grab it real hard and\nturn it and the door opens.\n\n64\n00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.550\nThat kind of a system is not very secure.\n\n65\n00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.850\nBut a dead bolt that goes into a frame,\nthat frame is cross set into the door\n\n66\n00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.150\nframe itself is cross set into\nthe wall with metal anchors and\n\n67\n00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.990\nit's a metal frame, not a wood frame,\nso it's harder to actually move.\n\n68\n00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.290\nAnd, that kind of a system is\ngonna be a lot more secure, right?\n\n69\n00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.930\nSo, we want to look at every possibility.\n\n70\n00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.350\nDo we have windows on the ground\nfloor of our building?\n\n71\n00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.070\nMost of us probably do.\n\n72\n00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.610\nDo we put our data center right up against\nan area where there are windows that face\n\n73\n00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.660\nthat outside.\n\n74\n00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.730\nIf we do that,\n\n75\n00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.770\nthat's probably not such a good idea\nbecause somebody may be able to break in.\n\n76\n00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.410\nThey may be able to throw a rock through\nthe window, or who knows what, but get in.\n\n77\n00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.940\nIf we have offices that look out,\nin other words, that's one thing.\n\n78\n00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.800\nBut even then, ground floor windows\nare usually not a good idea in secure\n\n79\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.680\nbuildings because they give people\na potential avenue to attack us.\n\n80\n00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.420\nSo, we may see windows on upper levels,\nbut\n\n81\n00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.910\nit's a lot harder to get to them,\ntraditionally.\n\n82\n00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.980\nDo we have doors?\n\n83\n00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.350\nWe probably do, as we said.\n\n84\n00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.190\nDo the doors that lead to the outside\nof the building in remote areas,\n\n85\n00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.800\ndo they have handles on the outside?\n\n86\n00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.130\nDo they have a way of being\nopened from the outside?\n\n87\n00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.760\nOr are they going to be\neffectively just one way doors.\n\n88\n00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.550\nDoors that open out, and can be opened\nfrom the inside with a crash bar or\n\n89\n00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.680\nsomething but have no handles,\nno way at all\n\n90\n00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.450\nto open the door from outside except\nmaybe a card key swipe of some kind, or\n\n91\n00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.620\nsome sort of a pad that lets you\nput in a code to open the door.\n\n92\n00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.940\nThat's gonna be a much more secure\nsolution because those kinds of entrances\n\n93\n00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.990\nare gonna be a lot tougher for\nsomebody to break into.\n\n94\n00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.170\nThere's nothing to grab onto.\n\n95\n00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.300\nThere's nothing to pick.\n\n96\n00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.260\nThere's nothing to pull or pry open.\n\n97\n00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.000\nThe door is flush against the building,\nand there's no way to get into it, right?\n\n98\n00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.860\nSo, that's gonna be something to consider.\n\n99\n00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.790\nDo we have closed-circuit TV systems\nmonitoring the entryways, right?\n\n100\n00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.440\nSo cameras above the doors.\n\n101\n00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.980\nDo we have flood lighting that lights\nthe door areas so that they are obviously\n\n102\n00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.480\ngoing to be something people pay attention\nto when they walk around the building,\n\n103\n00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.530\ndrive around at night, whatever.\n\n104\n00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.260\nYou have this island of bright light\naround a stair with a door next to it.\n\n105\n00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.260\nPeople are gonna pay attention to that,\nand see that, and\n\n106\n00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.010\nthey're gonna know that if they're\nstanding there somebody's gonna see that.\n\n107\n00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.170\nSo, this again the kind of\nthing we wanna think about.\n\n108\n00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.270\nDo we trim all of the landscaping\naround buildings to move it back and\n\n109\n00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.650\nprevent areas that can overgrow, so\n\n110\n00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.780\nplaces that people may be able\nto hide are gonna be obvious.\n\n111\n00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.200\nThat kind of thing.\n\n112\n00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.780\nDo we have parking garages?\n\n113\n00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.160\nA lot of us have parking garages\nattached to our buildings.\n\n114\n00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.400\nDo we have good lighting in the garage or\ndo we have a dark scary\n\n115\n00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.990\narea where people may be able to hide and\npotentially pop out and attack somebody.\n\n116\n00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.480\nIt's the kind of thing we have to\nthink about, it's all this stuff.\n\n117\n00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.750\nWhere do we put the building?\n\n118\n00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.170\nIs the building sited in such a way\nthat we have good site lines so\n\n119\n00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.580\nthat people coming up to the building\nare going to be observed?\n\n120\n00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.340\nOr is the building set up in such a way\nthat you can't see people until they show\n\n121\n00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.600\nup at your front door?\n\n122\n00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.890\nThat's a bad thing,\nbecause you don't know who's coming and\n\n123\n00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.630\nwhat they're coming with until\nthey're standing in front of you.\n\n124\n00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.160\nSo, in secure buildings you often\nsee them set back from the road.\n\n125\n00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.420\nYou will see there's really nothing\naround them, traditionally.\n\n126\n00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:59.430\nThey may even be raised higher than\nthe road, so you have to drive up to them.\n\n127\n00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.170\nAgain allowing us to observe you.\n\n128\n00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.930\nBut not just drive up on a straight road.\n\n129\n00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.330\nThere's usually a winding road that forces\nyou to slow down and go very slowly\n\n130\n00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.540\ncuz we don't want you gathering a great\nrate of speed to then be able to crash\n\n131\n00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.940\nthrough a gate or whatever may be there\nfor you then to be able to gain entry.\n\n132\n00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.690\nSo, when you approach a secure\nbase like a military base\n\n133\n00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.460\nyou often see they're are crash barriers\nand you have to zig zag your way in.\n\n134\n00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.620\nAnd then, theres a guard,\n\n135\n00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.950\nthere's typically a gate system and\nthere's a bunch of different solutions in\n\n136\n00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.440\nplace that overlap each other\nto prevent access easily.\n\n137\n00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.710\nUnless you drive up very slowly and they\nlet you in it's gonna be almost impossible\n\n138\n00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.230\nfor you crash through that gate and\nget on the base, right.\n\n139\n00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.280\nUnless you're coming in with a huge\ntruck and all sorts of stuff and\n\n140\n00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.970\nthey're gonna see that coming, right?\n\n141\n00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.630\nSo, this is the kind of\nthing that we think about.\n\n142\n00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.230\nDefining threats are gonna be very\nimportant to us in understanding\n\n143\n00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.440\nwhat kind of threats we may have, and\nwhat a threat is and therefore taking\n\n144\n00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.820\nsteps to prevent them is really what\nthis conversation is all about.\n\n145\n00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.490\nWhat are the targets\nthat we want to protect,\n\n146\n00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.820\nand what are the threats\nwe want to defend against?\n\n147\n00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.860\nThis is the conversation that\nultimately a security professional\n\n148\n00:06:58.860 --> 00:06:59.850\nneeds to be thinking about.\n\n149\n00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.810\nWe think about facility\nconsiderations like,\n\n150\n00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.080\nrattled off a whole bunch\nof them to you just now.\n\n151\n00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.200\nWe have to think about all\nthe things I mentioned, but\n\n152\n00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.060\nalso the people that work in the building,\nand are we screening them?\n\n153\n00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.600\nFor instance,\n\n154\n00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.060\nthe cleaning crew that's there at night\noften, do we really know who they are?\n\n155\n00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.810\nI mean, they're often there\nwalking around in the evenings.\n\n156\n00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.080\nIf anybody is around, there's probably\nnobody in the building at that point in\n\n157\n00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.190\ntime, especially if they\ncome late at night.\n\n158\n00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.590\nYou drive by, often a lot of times\nI'll be working late in my office.\n\n159\n00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.870\nWhen I'm leaving, I'll drive by the office\nbuildings around us, depending on\n\n160\n00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.530\nwhat office I'm in and there are banks for\ninstance, there are big office towers.\n\n161\n00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.153\nAnd you often see the banks,\n11, 12 o'clock at night,\n\n162\n00:07:35.153 --> 00:07:39.000\n10 o'clock at night lights are on,\nthere's people walking around in there.\n\n163\n00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.580\nI'm not talking about the bankers\nthemselves, hopefully\n\n164\n00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.490\nnot talking about people that are there\nborrowing money without permission.\n\n165\n00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.284\nBut typically it's\nthe cleaning crew right,\n\n166\n00:07:46.284 --> 00:07:48.906\nyou'll see them in there late at\nnight if you happen to drive by, and\n\n167\n00:07:48.906 --> 00:07:51.629\nbanks leave the windows open on purpose,\nleave lights on on purpose.\n\n168\n00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:54.703\nThey want people on the outside to be able\nto see what's going on on the inside so\n\n169\n00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:57.079\nif there's a robbery somebody's\ngoing to be observed, and\n\n170\n00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.680\nwhen the police show up they\ncould see who's inside.\n\n171\n00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.751\nRight, so this it's the same reason the\ncar dealers leave lights on all over their\n\n172\n00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:03.338\nlots, right?\n\n173\n00:08:03.338 --> 00:08:06.856\nBecause they want people to be, obviously,\naware of the fact that they're watching,\n\n174\n00:08:06.856 --> 00:08:08.150\nthey have security there.\n\n175\n00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.520\nBut also if it's brightly light,\nit's gonna be a lot tougher for\n\n176\n00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.270\nyou to steal a car.\n\n177\n00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.190\nIt's gonna be easier for us to see you.\n\n178\n00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.183\nSo these are all things people consider,\nbut\n\n179\n00:08:15.183 --> 00:08:17.082\nwho's walking around in there cleaning?\n\n180\n00:08:17.082 --> 00:08:22.140\nI mean, obviously whoever is there\nIs representing a cleaning service.\n\n181\n00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.290\nA cleaning service may be the building's\nown, may be the bank's own.\n\n182\n00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.750\nThey may have hired their own people.\n\n183\n00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.360\nBut it may be a contracted service\nthat the building maintenance\n\n184\n00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.600\npeople have brought in.\n\n185\n00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.340\nAnd the bank may not\nactually know who's there.\n\n186\n00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.520\nThey may have no knowledge of them.\n\n187\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.190\nAll they know is they show up in\nthe morning, their garbage is gone.\n\n188\n00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.790\nBut are the people there really trusted?\n\n189\n00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:40.170\nHave they been cleared?\n\n190\n00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:42.010\nThis is a big question for us.\n\n191\n00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.360\nNot maybe so much in a bank, cuz you're\nnot gonna be able to walk in and\n\n192\n00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.460\nsteal money from a bank,\njust because you're there cleaning.\n\n193\n00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.750\nIt's very hard to do that,\nmoney's locked up.\n\n194\n00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.810\nBut what about in an office building,\nwhere stuff may be left out on the desks?\n\n195\n00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.160\nAnd we may not really have a policy that\nsays we should walk around at night and\n\n196\n00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.020\nclear everybody's desks, and\nlock everything up that's secure.\n\n197\n00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.540\nWhat about if we're throwing\naway confidential information\n\n198\n00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.970\ninstead of securely disposing of it?\n\n199\n00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.780\nMaybe shredding it, things like that?\n\n200\n00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:07.610\nThat stuff laying around at\nnight with nobody there, and\n\n201\n00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:10.840\na cleaning crew that's there, could\neasily fall prey to somebody taking it.\n\n202\n00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.095\nAs a matter of fact, somebody may\nhave purposely inserted themselves\n\n203\n00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:18.175\ninto the cleaning crew, specifically to\ngo in there and get that information.\n\n204\n00:09:18.175 --> 00:09:21.375\nHow tough would it be, if you think\nabout it, to get a job like that, right?\n\n205\n00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:24.500\nI mean, it wouldn't be that difficult\nto go and apply for a job and\n\n206\n00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.460\nto then get yourself inserted\ninto this kind of a system.\n\n207\n00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.430\nAnd ultimately go in and\n\n208\n00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.250\nhave, effectively, run of the office\nlate at night with nobody there.\n\n209\n00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.990\nThere may be cameras, there may be things.\n\n210\n00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.750\nBut the reality is we expect to see\ncleaning people rubbing down desks and\n\n211\n00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.850\ngrabbing papers and throwing them in\ngarbage bins and taking garbage out.\n\n212\n00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.660\nThat's what we expect them to do.\n\n213\n00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.200\nSo we wouldn't necessary to see\nthat as suspicious behavior.\n\n214\n00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.130\nIf the guy sat down, or the girl sat down\nat the computer and spent 30 minutes doing\n\n215\n00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.070\nthis, and typing stuff in,\nwe may find that to be a little odd.\n\n216\n00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.870\nBecause cleaning crew people typically\nare not using computers late at night.\n\n217\n00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.580\nThey're rubbing them down quickly to\nclean them, but then they're moving on.\n\n218\n00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.750\nBut if they're smart about what they do,\n\n219\n00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.230\nwe might not see them as\nbeing a threat at all.\n\n220\n00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.720\nWe may not even know that they're there.\n\n221\n00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.940\nWe may not take notice to them.\n\n222\n00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.160\nAnd this is the idea, right?\n\n223\n00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.350\nThis is the thing that, from a facility\nstandpoint, we have to think about.\n\n224\n00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.320\nIt's the obvious things that go\non in front of our nose everyday,\n\n225\n00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.026\nthe hide in plain sight solutions\nthat we have to consider.\n\n226\n00:10:17.026 --> 00:10:19.800\nBecause these are the things that\noften come back to haunt us, right?\n\n227\n00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.398\nIt's the obvious stuff like\na door being propped open\n\n228\n00:10:22.398 --> 00:10:26.103\nto an area that's usually secured\nbecause of an air conditioning problem.\n\n229\n00:10:26.103 --> 00:10:29.218\nBecause of the fact somebody's running\nan errand and they forgot their keys so\n\n230\n00:10:29.218 --> 00:10:32.855\nthey prop the door open and they're coming\nright back, they ran out to their car.\n\n231\n00:10:32.855 --> 00:10:34.225\nWell, that's okay.\n\n232\n00:10:34.225 --> 00:10:37.095\nThe reality is,\nthat's a breach of security protocol.\n\n233\n00:10:37.095 --> 00:10:38.975\nYou're violating the policy.\n\n234\n00:10:38.975 --> 00:10:41.855\nI mean, there may be a reason for\nit, but the reality is,\n\n235\n00:10:41.855 --> 00:10:46.095\nwhatever reason you have is not compelling\nenough that you should violate the policy.\n\n236\n00:10:46.095 --> 00:10:49.565\nYou should follow the rules, that's\nwhat ultimately should be compelling.\n\n237\n00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:53.105\nAnd so when we see this kind of activity,\nwe have to put a stop to it, as CISSPs,\n\n238\n00:10:53.105 --> 00:10:54.595\nas security professionals.\n\n239\n00:10:54.595 --> 00:10:59.870\nSomebody props open a door, what you\nshould do as CISSP is stand by that door,\n\n240\n00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.790\nwait for them to come back,\nask them what they were thinking.\n\n241\n00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.864\nMake sure they are aware of the policy and\n\n242\n00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:09.013\nthen make sure that doesn't happen again\nby reinforcing the positive aspects of\n\n243\n00:11:09.013 --> 00:11:11.346\nwhat needs to happen on that policy,\nright?\n\n244\n00:11:11.346 --> 00:11:13.478\nWe shouldn't just allow that\nbehavior to go unchallenged,\n\n245\n00:11:13.478 --> 00:11:15.124\nin other words is what\nI'm suggesting to you.\n\n246\n00:11:15.124 --> 00:11:18.612\nBecause if we do, then we turn a blind\neye to the obvious security threats that\n\n247\n00:11:18.612 --> 00:11:21.980\nare facing the business and\nthis is something we have to consider.\n\n248\n00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.410\nSo there's all sorts of different things\nwe have to think about with the facility\n\n249\n00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:25.800\nconsideration in mind.\n\n250\n00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.440\nWe should also, and\n\n251\n00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.450\nwe've talked a lot about the idea that we\nshould be doing vulnerability assessments,\n\n252\n00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.445\nwe should be thinking about them.\n\n253\n00:11:31.445 --> 00:11:35.340\nThey should be done both for the software,\nthe hardware, the infrastructure on\n\n254\n00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.160\nthe computer side, but also for\nthe physical plan for the building.\n\n255\n00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.872\nI joked around with you in\none of the prior episodes.\n\n256\n00:11:39.872 --> 00:11:43.318\nWe talked about the Mission Impossible\nconversation with data in the vault, and\n\n257\n00:11:43.318 --> 00:11:44.745\nhow you get in there and steal it.\n\n258\n00:11:44.745 --> 00:11:48.200\nAnd all the stuff they did right and\nwrong when they set that up in the movie.\n\n259\n00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.610\nThe fact that they had HVAC\nvents that were big enough that\n\n260\n00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.316\nhumans could actually crawl\nthrough them is a problem, right?\n\n261\n00:11:54.316 --> 00:11:56.800\nYou don't need vents that big,\nyou just don't.\n\n262\n00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.835\nSo the reality is when you look\nat most air conditioning systems,\n\n263\n00:11:59.835 --> 00:12:03.384\nthe vents are not big enough to support\na human being being in there, right?\n\n264\n00:12:03.384 --> 00:12:07.787\nAnd obviously also, that a human\nwould weigh 150 pounds on average,\n\n265\n00:12:07.787 --> 00:12:09.100\nor whatever it is.\n\n266\n00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.750\nThose vents are typically not\nstrong enough to support a human.\n\n267\n00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.910\nYou go in there,\nyou'll fall right through, right?\n\n268\n00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:14.720\nSo the reality is,\n\n269\n00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.830\nwe probably don't often think about\nthat as being an attack vector.\n\n270\n00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.250\nBut what about a building that may\nhave been engineered differently?\n\n271\n00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.440\nWhat about a building that has reinforced\nvents that are strapped to the wall, or\n\n272\n00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.435\nto the ceiling, or whatever?\n\n273\n00:12:25.435 --> 00:12:26.290\nAnd that are big enough,\n\n274\n00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:30.410\nbecause of air flow concerns,\nvolume of air moving through the system,\n\n275\n00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.230\nthat maybe in theory, there is a way for\nsomebody to get in there.\n\n276\n00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:33.969\nWe'd have to think about that.\n\n277\n00:12:33.969 --> 00:12:35.450\nWe'd have to know about that.\n\n278\n00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.110\nWe have to know enough\nto look at the plans and\n\n279\n00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:38.580\nunderstand whether that is an issue or\nnot.\n\n280\n00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.220\nAnd then we'd also have to go double check\nthat what the plans show is is accurate.\n\n281\n00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.720\nThis is what we would be doing\nwith a vulnerability assessment.\n\n282\n00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.010\nWhat about air intakes?\n\n283\n00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.570\nWhat about where air is\nsucked into the building\n\n284\n00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.260\nthrough the air conditioning system?\n\n285\n00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:54.790\nIf those air intakes are on the ground\nlevel and are not protected,\n\n286\n00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.930\nsomebody could potentially get to them and\ninsert some substance into the air system,\n\n287\n00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.170\na gas, a foreign substance,\nwhatever it is.\n\n288\n00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:04.730\nIt may not be because they want to poison\npeople, it may just be a smoke grenade\n\n289\n00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.580\nbecause they want to clear the building\nmaking people think it's on fire, so\n\n290\n00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.610\nthey can get in.\n\n291\n00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.900\nThat's the James Bond activity, right?\n\n292\n00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.060\nWe love that where he throws\nthe smoke grenade in there,\n\n293\n00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.260\neverybody leaves the building,\ngoes right in steals the lector machine.\n\n294\n00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.760\nThat's from the Spy Who Loved Me, right?\n\n295\n00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.810\nOh no, that's From Russia with Love,\nno that's the Spy Who Loved Me.\n\n296\n00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:21.730\n>> I think so.\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n297\n00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:23.960\nOh no, From Russia with Love,\nthat was From Russia with Love.\n\n298\n00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.730\nSo, you get a bonus star by the way\nif you can figure out exactly which\n\n299\n00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:28.510\nmovie that was.\n\n300\n00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.900\nI do think it was From Russia\nwith Love actually,\n\n301\n00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.420\nit was the one that was set in Turkey,\nright, back with Sean Connery, years ago.\n\n302\n00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.430\nSo anyway, he does that.\n\n303\n00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.045\nHe sets of a smoke grenade and\n\n304\n00:13:36.045 --> 00:13:39.580\nultimately then able to go in and actually\njust steal the code machine, right?\n\n305\n00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.620\nPretty straightforward, but\n\n306\n00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.900\nhe does that in such a way that nobody\nknew it was gonna happen, right?\n\n307\n00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.690\nHe was able to effectively walk in and\njust take what he needs.\n\n308\n00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.610\nSo something as simple as that,\nprotecting the air intakes,\n\n309\n00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.540\nis actually really important as well.\n\n310\n00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.620\nIn secure buildings, these air\nintakes are usually up on the roof and\n\n311\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:56.760\nthey are protected so\nthat you can't get to them.\n\n312\n00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:00.120\nWhat about your power generators,\nright, your secondary power sources?\n\n313\n00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.220\nThey're obviously, typically gonna be\noutside the building because they're big,\n\n314\n00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.610\nthey're loud, they're noisy.\n\n315\n00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.300\nThey belch smoke, all that kind of stuff.\n\n316\n00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.770\nThey have flammable liquids in them, so\n\n317\n00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.410\nyou have to store them away from\nthe building cuz of fire codes.\n\n318\n00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:11.307\nThey have to be protected.\n\n319\n00:14:11.307 --> 00:14:14.422\nIf you don't have a gate around this\nthing with closed circuit monitoring so\n\n320\n00:14:14.422 --> 00:14:16.807\nthat somebody can't get in there and\nmess around with it,\n\n321\n00:14:16.807 --> 00:14:18.090\nyou're gonna have a problem.\n\n322\n00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.190\nBecause if somebody goes in and\nmesses with the power\n\n323\n00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.250\nin such a way that they effectively\nrender the generator inoperable and\n\n324\n00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.660\nthey fail over the building on\npurpose to knock it offline,\n\n325\n00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.220\nall your protection systems\nare running on power, right?\n\n326\n00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.390\nYour closed circuit TVs,\nall the monitoring, all that stuff.\n\n327\n00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:37.120\nThe power locks on the doors,\nthe card swipe etc., that's all powered.\n\n328\n00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.295\nEven if you have backup generators and you\nhave backup batteries for certain systems,\n\n329\n00:14:41.295 --> 00:14:45.250\nthe reality is if we knock the generators\noff line, all we have is battery power.\n\n330\n00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.550\nAnd battery power lasts maybe 15,\n20 minutes at most.\n\n331\n00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.660\nIf we can't restore the power before then,\n\n332\n00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:52.910\nthen the building systems\nare probably gonna go dark.\n\n333\n00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:55.650\nWe then may be able to get into\nthe building a lot easier because now all\n\n334\n00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.770\nthe monitoring is\neffectively not going on.\n\n335\n00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.910\nSo these, again,\nare the kind of things we'd look at.\n\n336\n00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.980\nAnd from a vulnerability\nassessments standpoint,\n\n337\n00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.330\nwe'd wanna understand what is possible and\ntherefore what we have to defend against.\n\n338\n00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.960\nSo site planning becomes very important.\n\n339\n00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.750\nWe have to think about that,\n\n340\n00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.940\nwe have to think about the roadway\ndesign as I mentioned.\n\n341\n00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.360\nIs the road straight, does it wind,\nis it a multi-lane road,\n\n342\n00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.675\nis it a single road,\ncould we put a choke point there?\n\n343\n00:15:17.675 --> 00:15:19.466\nCould we put a guard with a gate there, or\n\n344\n00:15:19.466 --> 00:15:22.386\ndo we have to worry about the fact\nthat it's a public access road?\n\n345\n00:15:22.386 --> 00:15:26.114\nIt's a four lane highway and we can't\ncontrol traffic, so now we have to offer\n\n346\n00:15:26.114 --> 00:15:30.465\na setback to the building with fencing to\neffectively create a perimeter 200, 300,\n\n347\n00:15:30.465 --> 00:15:33.370\n400 yards out from the front\nend of the building.\n\n348\n00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.710\nThese are things we have to consider.\n\n349\n00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.420\nIf you don't own the building,\nyou may not be able to do those things.\n\n350\n00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:41.370\nIf you rent space in a building, it's up\nto the building management to decide how\n\n351\n00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:44.440\nthey're gonna secure the physical plant,\nthe physical building.\n\n352\n00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.060\nIt's not directly in your control.\n\n353\n00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.641\nYou may be able to control\nthe area on the floor you're in,\n\n354\n00:15:48.641 --> 00:15:52.010\nyou may be able to lock out the elevator\nand say only our people get on.\n\n355\n00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.797\nWe have a card key,\nwe want exclusive access to our floor.\n\n356\n00:15:54.797 --> 00:15:57.647\nYou may be able to do that, but\nthat's really about the extent of what you\n\n357\n00:15:57.647 --> 00:16:00.360\ncan do because people getting into\nthe building on the ground floor,\n\n358\n00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.790\nyou have no control over.\n\n359\n00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.670\nThey may provide a guard,\nthey may provide cameras.\n\n360\n00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:07.532\nBut there's a limit to what you're\ngonna be able to negotiate that they're\n\n361\n00:16:07.532 --> 00:16:08.550\ngonna do for you.\n\n362\n00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.560\nBut if you own the building,\nit's a whole different story, right?\n\n363\n00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.710\nSo we refer to this generically, this\nidea as what's known as crime prevention\n\n364\n00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:21.310\nthrough environmental design,\nCPTED, or CP Ted.\n\n365\n00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:24.000\nIt's just an acronym that\nrepresents the thought process\n\n366\n00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.260\nthat if we are manipulating our\nenvironment to our advantage as defenders,\n\n367\n00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:33.060\nwe are a lot more likely to be successful\nat causing mitigation strategies to come\n\n368\n00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.070\ninto play and ultimately to be\nsuccessful preventing attacks.\n\n369\n00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.830\nSo just think about this, yeah, we have\nto think about the windows as I said,\n\n370\n00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.610\nwe have to think about the doors,\nwe have to think about the fences.\n\n371\n00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:42.630\nIs the fence high enough?\n\n372\n00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.180\nAre the windows strong enough?\n\n373\n00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.460\nAre the windows inaccessible?\n\n374\n00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.130\nAre the doors strong enough, right?\n\n375\n00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.770\nWe have different kinds of\nglass that we put into windows,\n\n376\n00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:50.870\nwe don't just have normal glass.\n\n377\n00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.140\nI mean, we could, but obviously,\nnormal glass meets rock, right?\n\n378\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:56.105\nRock, paper, glass instead of rock,\npaper, scissors.\n\n379\n00:16:56.105 --> 00:16:58.370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Rock, paper, glass, rock, right,\n\n380\n00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.110\nmeets glass and then,\nyou know, glass shatters.\n\n381\n00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:05.740\nBut if you have impact resistant glass, we\ncall it Hurricane Glass in the southeast,\n\n382\n00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.610\nbecause we put it into buildings that\nsuffer from these kind of storms.\n\n383\n00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:10.880\nIf you have impact-resistant glass,\n\n384\n00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.790\nthat glass may be rated up to 150\nmile impact or whatever it is.\n\n385\n00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:19.790\nThat glass will prevent somebody from\nhitting it with a crowbar or whatever.\n\n386\n00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.970\nIt'll spiderweb, it may actually crack,\nbut it's not gonna give way.\n\n387\n00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:25.840\nSo this is the kind of thing\nwe have to think about.\n\n388\n00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.990\nYou have this kind of glass in\nautomobiles, in your windshields,\n\n389\n00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.150\nit's called tempered glass or\nsafety glass.\n\n390\n00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.160\nIt's not as strong obviously,\nbut what it does,\n\n391\n00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.205\nthere's a film between the layers\nof glass, think of it as a sticky,\n\n392\n00:17:37.205 --> 00:17:40.790\ntapey film, that sits between\nthe layers of glass in the windshield.\n\n393\n00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.210\nWhen the windshield gets hit with\nsomething like a rock or whatever it is,\n\n394\n00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:47.900\nyou get in a crash, again, the windshield\nspiderwebs, but it won't just shatter and\n\n395\n00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.720\nblow inward on you typically, because\nit's going to effectively stick together.\n\n396\n00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.750\nAnd as a result, it's safer for\nyou being in the cab.\n\n397\n00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.500\nThat's why you often see in those\nmovies where they have to kick out\n\n398\n00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.290\nthe windshield.\n\n399\n00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.360\nThe guy's kicking it,\nit's not going anywhere, and\n\n400\n00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.980\nthey've gotta knock the whole frame out of\nthe windshield to actually get it to go\n\n401\n00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.900\nin, because it's all stuck together,\neven though it actually breaks.\n\n402\n00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.370\nSo there's different kinds\nof glass we can think about.\n\n403\n00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:09.080\nYou may see glass with wire mesh in it.\n\n404\n00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.880\nYou know, a lot of times,\n\n405\n00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.360\nyou see this in doorways that\nhave little peekaboo windows.\n\n406\n00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.460\nThose little rectangular\nwindows in classrooms,\n\n407\n00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.140\nthings like that, you can look into.\n\n408\n00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.620\nYou often see they have what\nlooks like chicken wire, right?\n\n409\n00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.730\nIf you grew up doing arts and crafts and\n\n410\n00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.890\ndid paper mache, you'll have fond\nmemories of chicken wire, right?\n\n411\n00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.460\nSo it looks like chicken wire.\n\n412\n00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:29.960\nAnd it's basically just a metal web, or\na metal wesh interwoven into the glass.\n\n413\n00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.690\nAgain, the idea is, if you break the\nglass, the glass may shatter inward, but\n\n414\n00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:36.450\nthe wire is gonna prevent you from\nreaching in directly and trying to grab\n\n415\n00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:39.800\nthe door handle and you'll getting\nin unless you cut through the wire.\n\n416\n00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.160\nThe point is not to keep you out\nultimately because let's face it,\n\n417\n00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.290\nyou put your first through\nthe window in the door, and\n\n418\n00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:50.060\nyou may be able to reach around and grab\nthat, but A you're gonna get all cut up B,\n\n419\n00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.330\nit's gonna take your time to break that,\nto cut the wire to do that.\n\n420\n00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.250\nAnd our hope is ultimately that\nduring that time, somebody is gonna\n\n421\n00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:59.420\nhear something or see something and\nyou're obviously gonna get caught.\n\n422\n00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:03.980\nA lot of these are what we call delaying\nsolutions, they're delaying tactics.\n\n423\n00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:08.410\nHaving glass in a window in general is\nunfortunately having a window and glass in\n\n424\n00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:11.800\nit is a bad idea, because the reality is\nif somebody wants to break in, they're\n\n425\n00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.900\ngonna figure out a way to blow that window\nout of the frame and crawl through.\n\n426\n00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.788\nSo the ultimate design solution should be,\nif I wanna give people the ability to look\n\n427\n00:19:19.788 --> 00:19:22.820\nout, I have to also understand\npeople may also come in.\n\n428\n00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.914\nSo how can I delay them long enough, and\n\n429\n00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:29.361\nput enough controls in place around that\nentryway, that they may be deterred, and\n\n430\n00:19:29.361 --> 00:19:33.330\nas a result they maybe not be able\nto successfully get into the system.\n\n431\n00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:35.140\nThat's really what the goal\nis with this stuff.\n\n432\n00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:39.157\nIt's not to stop you, because we know that\nif you're really that dead set on getting\n\n433\n00:19:39.157 --> 00:19:42.240\nin, you're gonna strap a little\nbit of explosive to the window and\n\n434\n00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.150\nyou're gonna blow it out of the frame,\nand here you're gonna make a big noise.\n\n435\n00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.810\nWe're gonna know you're there, but\nyou're probably still gonna go in and\n\n436\n00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.360\ndo what you wanna do, cuz you're willing\nto blow a window out of a building.\n\n437\n00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.860\nYou're probably not gonna be stopped by a\nbunch a people yelling and screaming look,\n\n438\n00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.640\nthere's somebody there,\nhe's coming to attack us, right?\n\n439\n00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.340\nSo the reality is you're gonna get in.\n\n440\n00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.770\nWe have to figure out ways\nto prevent you from doing so\n\n441\n00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.910\nlong enough, delay you,\nthat somebody will hopefully find you,\n\n442\n00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:06.910\nfigure that out, and then obviously\nwe can do things we need to do.\n\n443\n00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:11.930\nSo we have tempered glass, I talked\nabout this wired glass, laminated glass.\n\n444\n00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.430\nYou know about bullet resistant glass\nprobably, they have this in banks, for\n\n445\n00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:17.510\ninstance, and data centers\ncalled bullet proof glass, but\n\n446\n00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.350\nit's actually called bullet resistant\nglass, that's the formal name for it.\n\n447\n00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:23.600\nWe have glass break sensors, you break the\nglass, we know you broke it, and, yeah,\n\n448\n00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.680\nwe set off an alarm.\n\n449\n00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.160\nWe have noise sensors, right, so if you're\nwalking around somewhere late at night,\n\n450\n00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.490\nyou're making noise, acoustic sensors\nare what they're called, they may go off.\n\n451\n00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.690\nWe have infrared sensors,\n\n452\n00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:36.210\nright, sensors that will detect\nrise in body temperature and heat.\n\n453\n00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:37.660\nYou see these in all the movies.\n\n454\n00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.770\nYou also may have line break sensors, the\ninfrared lights that are crisscrossing and\n\n455\n00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:45.690\nkind of make the red pattern when they\nspray the special spray to show you in\n\n456\n00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:46.950\nmuseums and things like that.\n\n457\n00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.220\nWhen you walk through the system you break\nthe contact points between the light\n\n458\n00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.140\nbeams, then the alarm goes off.\n\n459\n00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.560\nThis is the same principle you have\nwith your garage doors at home,\n\n460\n00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.360\nas a matter of fact.\n\n461\n00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.539\nYou have infrared sensors on the bottom\non either side of the garage door,\n\n462\n00:20:58.539 --> 00:21:00.030\nthe safety sensors, right?\n\n463\n00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:02.614\nBecause that way if a child or\nsomething is blocking the door,\n\n464\n00:21:02.614 --> 00:21:05.548\nthe door stops if you break the line\nof the sensor as it's coming down,\n\n465\n00:21:05.548 --> 00:21:07.440\nso that way they don't get crushed.\n\n466\n00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.090\nIt's the same principle its just\nwe use a bunch of more of them to\n\n467\n00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.090\nprotect the whole gateway or\ndoorway, it's the same idea.\n\n468\n00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:14.680\nYou see a lot of these\nthings everywhere you go.\n\n469\n00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.480\nWe talked about garages, right, and how\nimportant it is to have lighting there,\n\n470\n00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.218\nto make sure they're safe areas.\n\n471\n00:21:20.218 --> 00:21:24.770\nYou don't wanna walk into, I see this\na lot, I travel a lot, and I'm in hotels,\n\n472\n00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.690\nI'm in airports, I'm in car rental\nagencies at 2:00 in the morning and\n\n473\n00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.830\ncrazy times,\ntrying to get where I need to go.\n\n474\n00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.230\nAnd a lot of times, you walk into\nthese garages at the airport, and\n\n475\n00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.270\na lot of them have these islands of light,\nas I call them, and\n\n476\n00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.180\nthen these pools of darkness, right?\n\n477\n00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.450\nSo you've got areas that are well lit,\naround the stairway typically,\n\n478\n00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:44.600\nmaybe around the landing for\nthe elevator where you come out.\n\n479\n00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:48.800\nBut then you look out and there's just\nthese dark rows that go off into infinity.\n\n480\n00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.500\nYou can't see what's down there,\nyou don't know who's there.\n\n481\n00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.190\nI'm not saying and suggesting for a minute\nthat there necessarily would be somebody\n\n482\n00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:57.170\nthere, but you just don't know,\nand it's scary.\n\n483\n00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.450\nI mean it's scary as an individual,\nwhether you're a man or\n\n484\n00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:02.940\na woman to be looking down a long,\ndark row of cars wondering if\n\n485\n00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.360\nsomeone may be hiding there while\nyou're trying to go out and\n\n486\n00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.650\nput your luggage in the back of the car,\ndo what you need to do.\n\n487\n00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:09.140\nSo it's not a good thing.\n\n488\n00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.460\nYou go to hotels, a lot of times\nthey're designed incredibly poorly.\n\n489\n00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.100\nThey have dark parking lots that wrap\naround the back of the hotel, and there's\n\n490\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.950\none little spotlight, right, in the\nmiddle, and then there's nothing right?\n\n491\n00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:21.820\nAnd so I'm always thinking\nwell it's a rental car so\n\n492\n00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.775\nif they break in I don't care,\nit's not my car.\n\n493\n00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:25.285\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I'll park it anywhere.\n\n494\n00:22:25.285 --> 00:22:28.580\nBut the reality is it's unsafe,\nbecause you may get out of the car,\n\n495\n00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.650\nsomebody may be there\ntrying to do you harm.\n\n496\n00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.890\nSo we have to think about these\nthings when we design buildings.\n\n497\n00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:36.780\nWe don't want garages that are dark and\nscary, we want garages that are well lit.\n\n498\n00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:41.060\nWe also want to think about, this one\nI often talk about with my customers.\n\n499\n00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:43.080\nIn secure environments, secure buildings,\n\n500\n00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.830\nyou're gonna have guards typically inside\nthe building, monitoring the perimeter.\n\n501\n00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.590\nThey actually will also typically walk\naround the perimeter at night, as well.\n\n502\n00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.330\nBut you're gonna have them inside, looking\nat screens typically, looking at cameras.\n\n503\n00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:54.730\nWe probably have perimeter lighting.\n\n504\n00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.830\nWe most likely will have spotlights and\nthings that light up areas of\n\n505\n00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:01.430\nthe perimeter, the gate, for instance,\nthe doorways, things like that.\n\n506\n00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.800\nWhat we wanna make sure we have\nis lighting the faces out.\n\n507\n00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.097\nRight, we want lighting that is away\nfrom the building facing out towards\n\n508\n00:23:07.097 --> 00:23:10.392\nthe perimeter, so that way the guards,\nwhen they're looking at stuff,\n\n509\n00:23:10.392 --> 00:23:13.530\nwhen they come out of a darkened\nroom into the dark lobby, typically,\n\n510\n00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:14.752\nout into the environment,\n\n511\n00:23:14.752 --> 00:23:18.300\nthey're not gonna be blinded by light\nshooting in from the perimeter.\n\n512\n00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.880\nBecause if you spotlight the doorway\nof the building from 100 feet away and\n\n513\n00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.860\nsomebody steps out,\nthey're blinded to the night.\n\n514\n00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.800\nYou blow their night vision,\nthey can't see anything.\n\n515\n00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.240\nSo they're not gonna see people coming,\n\n516\n00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.938\nthey're not really gonna be able\nto be effective as a deterrent.\n\n517\n00:23:29.938 --> 00:23:32.920\nSo we wanna be thinking of light\nplacement, this is also very important.\n\n518\n00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:36.340\nSomething we have to consider and\nbe thoughtful of as well.\n\n519\n00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.150\nWhat about fires?\n\n520\n00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.750\nWhen fires happen inside of a building,\nwe got to worry about this as well.\n\n521\n00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.290\nFire suppression is very important right?\n\n522\n00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:46.470\nSo we know we have different kinds of fire\nsuppression equipment based on the kind of\n\n523\n00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:47.230\nfire that we have.\n\n524\n00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.610\nFire is fire, in the sense that\nit all burns, it's all bad.\n\n525\n00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.837\nBut what causes the fire,\nor what is burning?\n\n526\n00:23:53.837 --> 00:23:57.926\nIs it you lighting a piece of paper\non fire, versus chemicals burning,\n\n527\n00:23:57.926 --> 00:24:01.280\nversus heavy metals that might\nhave caught fire, right?\n\n528\n00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.170\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n529\n00:24:02.170 --> 00:24:04.540\nEach kind of fire has to\nbe dealt with differently.\n\n530\n00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:07.930\nIf it's an electrical fire, you can't\nspray water on an electrical fire.\n\n531\n00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:09.870\nYou could, but you're not gonna\nbe very happy with the outcome.\n\n532\n00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:11.170\nLet me put it that way.\n\n533\n00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:15.870\nHowever, if you want a really cool\nfireworks show, that's the way to go.\n\n534\n00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:19.550\nSo we have different classes, class A,\nclass B, class C, and class D.\n\n535\n00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:23.420\nWhen it comes to different kinds of fires,\nyou probably should know what they are.\n\n536\n00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.249\nClass A is ordinary combustible materials.\n\n537\n00:24:25.249 --> 00:24:27.520\nThat's paper, wood, things like that.\n\n538\n00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.260\nJust stuff you mess around with\nyou that may catch on fire, but\n\n539\n00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:33.180\nyou can easily put out with a fire\nextinguisher, little bit of water, or\n\n540\n00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.110\nsmother it, whatever that may be.\n\n541\n00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.090\nClass B, flammable or combustible liquids.\n\n542\n00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:38.970\nThis is gasoline, oil.\n\n543\n00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:43.015\nThink of kitchen fires, where the pan\ncatches on fire cuz you have oil in it.\n\n544\n00:24:43.015 --> 00:24:43.920\nThat's a little bit different.\n\n545\n00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.200\nYou never throw water on\na combustible liquid fire.\n\n546\n00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.210\nIt spreads the combustible\nliquid everywhere.\n\n547\n00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:52.310\nIt also typically blows up in a huge\ncloud and will not only spray you, but\n\n548\n00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:53.810\ncatch fire to everything around it.\n\n549\n00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.360\nSo that's never a good idea.\n\n550\n00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.350\nWe use chemical suppressant there,\ntypically foam and/or some sort of\n\n551\n00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:03.320\nchemical suppressant or cutting off\nthe oxygen if it's a small fire,\n\n552\n00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:07.350\nlike on a cook top, you put another-\n>> Pan or?\n\n553\n00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:08.193\n>> Thank you.\n\n554\n00:25:08.193 --> 00:25:08.854\nCharades!\n\n555\n00:25:08.854 --> 00:25:10.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sounds like, two words, first word.\n\n556\n00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:13.490\nYou put pan on top of the other\npan to cut the oxygen off and\n\n557\n00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:14.500\neffectively smother the fire.\n\n558\n00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.870\nBut obviously,\nif it's a big fire somewhere,\n\n559\n00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:19.430\nwe have to use things like\nchemical foam to deal with that.\n\n560\n00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.460\nClass C fire is electrical equipment, as I\nsaid no water allowed there, dry foam or\n\n561\n00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.660\nchemical foam of some kind, typically.\n\n562\n00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.610\nMaybe some sort of dry extinguisher, but\n\n563\n00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.040\nagain nothing with water\nin it of any kind.\n\n564\n00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:34.140\nClass D combustible metals,\nthese are really nasty in particular.\n\n565\n00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.460\nThese can do great harm, and\nthey are very difficult to deal with.\n\n566\n00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.092\nYou'll need to leave that\nto the professionals.\n\n567\n00:25:39.092 --> 00:25:40.980\nThe firefighters have to come and\ntake care of that kind of stuff.\n\n568\n00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:43.610\nThey have special equipment that they\ncan use to deal with those fires.\n\n569\n00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.156\nBut it's not something your are going\nto be equipped to deal with typically.\n\n570\n00:25:46.156 --> 00:25:49.563\nBut we should know what the different\nclasses of fire suppression and\n\n571\n00:25:49.563 --> 00:25:50.510\nfire overall are.\n\n572\n00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.890\nSo we want to just be aware of that and\nthink about that.\n\n573\n00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:56.206\nWhat about safeguarding server rooms and\ninterconnects for electrical equipment?\n\n574\n00:25:56.206 --> 00:25:58.010\nAgain, electrical rooms should be locked.\n\n575\n00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:01.630\nYou should have camera surveillance\non them, so should server rooms.\n\n576\n00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.660\nPeople should not be able to go in and\nplay with circuit breakers, for instance.\n\n577\n00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.480\nIt's just a bad idea.\n\n578\n00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.862\nIt's a bad idea cuz a,\nthey could either hurt themselves,\n\n579\n00:26:07.862 --> 00:26:10.972\nit's also a bad idea because b, they can\ncut off power to you in the building.\n\n580\n00:26:10.972 --> 00:26:15.200\nSo again, if you're in a common building,\nand there is a common electrical closet or\n\n581\n00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.650\nserver closet on each floor,\nyou have to make sure that's secured.\n\n582\n00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.960\nYou have to work with building\nmanagement to do that.\n\n583\n00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.480\nThere may be more than one tenant that\nhas rights and needs access to that.\n\n584\n00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.130\nAnd there may be a bunch of vendors\nthat are coming in to do work for\n\n585\n00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:30.770\nthe building and for\nindividual tenants within the building.\n\n586\n00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.090\nAnd again, you have to understand that\nyou may not have exclusive access to\n\n587\n00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.190\nthese systems.\n\n588\n00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:39.430\nIn one our buildings down in\nSouth Florida, where I'm based,\n\n589\n00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.820\nwe have one of our centers where I work my\nday job, when I'm not hanging out with you\n\n590\n00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:48.250\nguys doing this, and we have a huge\nfacility, it's about 13,000 square feet.\n\n591\n00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:52.916\nOur electrical room is at the back corner\nof this particular area of the building.\n\n592\n00:26:52.916 --> 00:26:54.551\nNow, we're not the only tenant, but\n\n593\n00:26:54.551 --> 00:26:56.816\nwe are the largest tenant\nin that particular space.\n\n594\n00:26:56.816 --> 00:26:59.820\nThe space directly below us,\nwe happen to be in a mall.\n\n595\n00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.590\nSo we're upstairs in the office space\nin a mall, mall is massive, huge mall.\n\n596\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.930\nDownstairs, the Department\nof Transportation for\n\n597\n00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:12.005\nthe State of Florida came in and opened up\na huge driver's license division there.\n\n598\n00:27:12.005 --> 00:27:14.650\nSo they took three or\nfour small offices, closed them all,\n\n599\n00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.390\nconsolidated them,\nput them into this one space.\n\n600\n00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:21.680\nThey built a big data center right\nbelow our electrical closet above,\n\n601\n00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:23.100\nin the area where we control.\n\n602\n00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.230\nThey had to negotiate with\nthe building and ultimately, with us,\n\n603\n00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:31.040\nhave the contractors they use,\ncome in and drill conduit connections\n\n604\n00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.880\nthrough our stone slab floor, our concrete\nfloor, it's like four feet thick.\n\n605\n00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.210\nIn order to go down through our area,\nto bring their conduit for\n\n606\n00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:41.220\ntheir fiber runs into their\ndata center below us.\n\n607\n00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.320\nAnd so I had to show up at 2\no'clock in the morning for\n\n608\n00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.340\nlike three days in a row to sit there\nwith them while they're doing this, so\n\n609\n00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.840\nthey could drill through and\nmake sure it was working to set it up.\n\n610\n00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.900\nAnd here's the interesting part.\n\n611\n00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:51.360\nThey did all this, which is fine.\n\n612\n00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.950\nThey set up the conduit, all that stuff,\n\n613\n00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.710\nit's all good, it's all right through\nthe floor, everything's good.\n\n614\n00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:59.760\nThey left an interconnect gap of probably,\noh I'm guessing, what, maybe a foot,\n\n615\n00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:02.810\napproximately, between the conduit and\nthe floor.\n\n616\n00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:07.310\nAnd they never came back and\nactually took care of it or\n\n617\n00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:11.160\nenwrapped it, or set it up so it's totally\nsecure, so all the fiber is actually\n\n618\n00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.180\nrunning right through that pipe, and\nthere's a gap of about a foot where it\n\n619\n00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:17.470\nmeets the floor where you can actually tap\nright into the fiber if you wanted to.\n\n620\n00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:21.203\nSo the reality is that sometimes it\nwas just through dumb circumstance,\n\n621\n00:28:21.203 --> 00:28:25.442\nI'm sure just they didn't realize, and\nthey forgot, and they never came back.\n\n622\n00:28:25.442 --> 00:28:27.030\nThey just never did.\nIt's been that way for years.\n\n623\n00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:27.780\nIt's never been a problem.\n\n624\n00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.960\nWe don't let anybody in there.\n\n625\n00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.100\nIt's locked up all the time,\nand they don't have an issue.\n\n626\n00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:33.570\nAnd they probably don't\neven realize it's there.\n\n627\n00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:36.970\nBut the point is it is there, and in\ntheory, we could obviously get into it, or\n\n628\n00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.520\nsomebody could if they wanted to.\n\n629\n00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.400\nSo this is the kind of thing\nyou gotta think about.\n\n630\n00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.630\nThese are the kinds of things\nthat can obviously happen.\n\n631\n00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:46.602\nSo you're thinking about not just\nthings like that but also utilities.\n\n632\n00:28:46.602 --> 00:28:49.133\nPower, how do we bring power\ninto the building as I said.\n\n633\n00:28:49.133 --> 00:28:53.089\nWe may use one provider, but in a secure\nfacility, we probably have to use multiple\n\n634\n00:28:53.089 --> 00:28:56.270\nproviders bringing in different\ncircuits from different areas.\n\n635\n00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:59.010\nSo if one is cut, we still have\npower coming into the building,\n\n636\n00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:01.280\nwe can still achieve the end\nresults that we need.\n\n637\n00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.160\nThese are all gonna be things\nthat are very important.\n\n638\n00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.210\nWe have to worry about cable management.\n\n639\n00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:08.880\nAre we, as I said locking down our cable,\nso nobody can tap into the fiber, or\n\n640\n00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.380\nis it open and exposed?\n\n641\n00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.480\nWhen we run cable,\nis it in conduit up in the walls,\n\n642\n00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.490\nin the ceilings, or is it just run,\nscattered everywhere, and\n\n643\n00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.980\nsomebody could effectively go up in\nthe ceiling and tap into cables?\n\n644\n00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:21.320\nCuz we've all had to do that.\n\n645\n00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.312\nOh, I need a cable run, I'm not calling\nthe cable guy, 75 bucks a cable run.\n\n646\n00:29:25.312 --> 00:29:26.728\nSo we get up there.\n\n647\n00:29:26.728 --> 00:29:28.713\nMike, go down the far end on the ladder.\n\n648\n00:29:28.713 --> 00:29:30.188\nI'm gonna throw the cable ball to you.\n\n649\n00:29:30.188 --> 00:29:33.069\nAnd it just randomly arcs across and\nends up, yep,\n\n650\n00:29:33.069 --> 00:29:35.960\nthat's exactly where we wanted it,\nright there.\n\n651\n00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.060\nThe only thing you worry about is\nnot hitting the fluorescent lights\n\n652\n00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.010\nto make sure you don't worry\nabout hitting the ballast, and\n\n653\n00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:43.130\nas a result, you have interference.\n\n654\n00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:45.490\nOther than that,\nif you look up in most ceilings,\n\n655\n00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.450\nyou're probably gonna find a patchwork,\nliterally, of cable connections.\n\n656\n00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:51.390\nAnd that's the reality, it's just how\nit looks, so we wanna know about that,\n\n657\n00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:54.140\nwe wanna have someone to safeguard\nthese areas, think about them as well,\n\n658\n00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.640\nthis is all very important stuff.\n\n659\n00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.690\nWhat about the rack itself,\nwhat about the rack of servers?\n\n660\n00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:59.848\nAre we locking the rack?\n\n661\n00:29:59.848 --> 00:30:04.183\nMost racks come with locks, and most good\nIT administrators promptly ignore them,\n\n662\n00:30:04.183 --> 00:30:07.113\nforget where they are,\ndon't worry about the keys, and\n\n663\n00:30:07.113 --> 00:30:09.590\njust don't bother to use them.\n\n664\n00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:13.650\nSo the reality is, when I walk into\nsecure data centers, I see cages.\n\n665\n00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:14.254\nThat's great.\n\n666\n00:30:14.254 --> 00:30:15.531\nI walk in, I see racks.\n\n667\n00:30:15.531 --> 00:30:16.204\nThat's awesome.\n\n668\n00:30:16.204 --> 00:30:19.760\nI walk up to the rack,\nand the rack is open.\n\n669\n00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.150\nAnd I'm thinking well,\nthat's good, but it's not great.\n\n670\n00:30:24.150 --> 00:30:25.420\nI mean, let's be honest,\n\n671\n00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:28.350\nit's a pain to have to unlock a rack every\ntime you want to go talk to a server and\n\n672\n00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:31.950\ninteract with it, but\nthere's a lock on the front for a reason.\n\n673\n00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.080\nBecause people may still climb\nover the cage and get in, and\n\n674\n00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.140\nyou may not realize they're there.\n\n675\n00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.162\nSo this is something you\nhave to consider as well.\n\n676\n00:30:39.162 --> 00:30:40.605\nNow they have manageable rack locks,\n\n677\n00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:43.800\nones that are automated that can be opened\nwith a card swipe or things like that.\n\n678\n00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.930\nIt doesn't have to be a key, but the point\nis that if you don't take the extra step,\n\n679\n00:30:47.930 --> 00:30:50.590\nthat's usually where\nthe attacker is willing to go.\n\n680\n00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:53.970\nThey're gonna go that extra mile,\nthey're just gonna take it to the limit.\n\n681\n00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.529\nIf you're not willing to\ndo that as the Eagles said,\n\n682\n00:30:56.529 --> 00:30:58.225\ntake it to the limit one more time.\n\n683\n00:30:58.225 --> 00:31:00.421\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If you're not willing to do that,\n\n684\n00:31:00.421 --> 00:31:02.960\nI promise you, at some point,\nan attacker will.\n\n685\n00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.880\nAnd if they're willing to do that and\nyou're not, they win, and you lose.\n\n686\n00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.560\nSo that's really what\nyou have to think about.\n\n687\n00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.834\nRestricting their ability to get\nto that information is vital.\n\n688\n00:31:11.834 --> 00:31:15.060\nIf you're not able to do that, not willing\nto do that, that's really an issue.\n\n689\n00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.720\nThat's something you have to think about.\n\n690\n00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.767\nWe've talked about uninterrupted power\nsupplies, we've talked about generators,\n\n691\n00:31:19.767 --> 00:31:20.802\ntalked about all this stuff.\n\n692\n00:31:20.802 --> 00:31:21.580\nIt's all important.\n\n693\n00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.563\nWe talked about HVAC systems and\nwhy those are important.\n\n694\n00:31:24.563 --> 00:31:27.755\nLast thing I just wanna talk about,\nquickly, talked about water,\n\n695\n00:31:27.755 --> 00:31:31.731\ntalked about fire, mixing the two,\ntalked about sprinklers, fire suppression,\n\n696\n00:31:31.731 --> 00:31:32.853\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n697\n00:31:32.853 --> 00:31:34.756\nWe wanna make sure we know,\nactually two things.\n\n698\n00:31:34.756 --> 00:31:37.681\nOne, we wanna make sure we know the\ndifferent kinds of sprinkler systems, so\n\n699\n00:31:37.681 --> 00:31:39.133\nlet's just quickly talk about that.\n\n700\n00:31:39.133 --> 00:31:42.845\nThen I wanna say a quick word about\nfire suppression, but gas-based systems,\n\n701\n00:31:42.845 --> 00:31:44.965\nsystems that don't use water,\nbecause these are important,\n\n702\n00:31:44.965 --> 00:31:46.555\nand we have to know about them as well.\n\n703\n00:31:46.555 --> 00:31:49.665\nIf we have a system that uses water,\nwe have four different ways in\n\n704\n00:31:49.665 --> 00:31:52.600\nwhich a sprinkler system uses\nwater in theory, can be set up.\n\n705\n00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.390\nCould be a wet system, could be a dry\nsystem, a pre-action system, or\n\n706\n00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:57.440\na deluge systems.\n\n707\n00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.254\nLet's just quickly talk\nabout the differences.\n\n708\n00:31:59.254 --> 00:32:02.440\nA wet system is basically water's\nin the pipes at all times.\n\n709\n00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.267\nYou go ahead and set off the alarm,\n\n710\n00:32:04.267 --> 00:32:07.930\nthe sprinklers basically just\nimmediately drop water everywhere.\n\n711\n00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.713\nThis is the classic system that we have,\nwhere in most hotels, most buildings, you\n\n712\n00:32:11.713 --> 00:32:15.660\nsee the little colored vial of liquid if\nyou go up and look at the sprinkler head.\n\n713\n00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.490\nRed, green, orange, whatever it is,\n\n714\n00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:21.090\nthat liquid color indicates the boiling\npoint of the liquid in the glass.\n\n715\n00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.270\nSo, they will boil, the liquid will,\nat different temperatures.\n\n716\n00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.790\nBased on that, there's a certain delay\nbefore the sprinkler head actually is\n\n717\n00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:31.690\nactive, because there's a little piston or\na valve that sits behind that little vial.\n\n718\n00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:35.190\nWhen that vial breaks, it drops,\nthe head opens, in other words, and\n\n719\n00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:39.070\nwater is there sitting right behind that,\nand as a result, water drops out.\n\n720\n00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:40.650\nThis is what's called a wet system.\n\n721\n00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:41.890\nSo, you know you often see in the movies.\n\n722\n00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:43.820\nRight?\nSomebody stands up there with a lighter,\n\n723\n00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:45.990\nright, you know,\nlooks like they're at a concert.\n\n724\n00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:48.410\nThat's for those of you that are old\nenough to remember what that means.\n\n725\n00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:52.170\nSo, they're there, they're doing this, and\nthen all of a sudden, they effectively\n\n726\n00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:55.400\nboil the liquid, the thing bursts and\nthen all of sudden the sprinklers come on.\n\n727\n00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.400\nBut you'll notice,\nthey come on everywhere, right?\n\n728\n00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.670\nNot just in one place.\n\n729\n00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:01.480\nThat's a wet system,\nwater in the pipe everywhere at once.\n\n730\n00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.990\nA dry system is essentially the same but\nthere's no water in the pipe.\n\n731\n00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:07.890\nThere's air that is just\neffectively keeping the pipe open.\n\n732\n00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:10.280\nWater is contained in\na holding tank somewhere, and\n\n733\n00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:13.050\nthere's a valve further back in\nthe system, probably a series of them,\n\n734\n00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:16.530\nthat has to be released before the water\nactually is gonna hit that system.\n\n735\n00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:19.460\nSo, there's a delay between the time\nthe sprinklers are open and\n\n736\n00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.370\nthe time actually water shows up.\n\n737\n00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:22.290\nWe're not talking about minutes.\n\n738\n00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:24.740\nThis is just a few seconds,\nbut it's not immediate.\n\n739\n00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:26.340\nThere is a small delay.\n\n740\n00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.450\nPreaction systems,\n\n741\n00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:31.370\nwater is held back until the detectors\nare going to effectively activate.\n\n742\n00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.360\nThe nice thing is that this\nis an area controlled system.\n\n743\n00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:38.840\nSo, unlike a wet system which drenches\neverything, a preaction system\n\n744\n00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.200\nis going to effectively be targeted\nbased on where the alarm goes off.\n\n745\n00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.110\nSo, if it just goes off\nin this area right here,\n\n746\n00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:48.240\nin front of us, then it's just going\nto be this one sprinkler, right?\n\n747\n00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.410\nThat goes off, nothing else is going\nto go off and none of the other systems\n\n748\n00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:54.670\nare going to be activated,\nwhich is good because you obviously then\n\n749\n00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:58.050\nminimize damage in other areas of the\nbuilding, because water showing up, and\n\n750\n00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:00.910\nyou know falling on desks, and\nall sorts of stuff like that.\n\n751\n00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:05.890\nAnd then the system,\nall sprinklers in the system are open, and\n\n752\n00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.030\nall the heads are wide open.\n\n753\n00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:10.050\nThis is almost like a rainfall in effect,\nor a waterfall.\n\n754\n00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.820\nAnd when water hits the system,\nit comes pouring out everywhere.\n\n755\n00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.530\nLooks like literally a series of\nwaterfalls that are gonna go in and\n\n756\n00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:16.410\ndrench the building.\n\n757\n00:34:16.410 --> 00:34:18.240\nThese are fast-action systems in a sense,\n\n758\n00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:22.020\nthey flood large areas very quickly\nto put out very, very big fires.\n\n759\n00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.460\nThat's simply what these kind\nof systems are used for.\n\n760\n00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.220\nAnd a lot times,\n\n761\n00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:28.890\nespecially in data centers, we can't\nuse water because we know water and\n\n762\n00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:33.230\nelectricity do not mix, so we're gonna use\ngas based suppression systems instead.\n\n763\n00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:38.110\nSo, when you walk into a data center, we\nmay have seen the caution stickers right?\n\n764\n00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.570\nThe flammable substance,\n\n765\n00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:43.440\ndangerous gas whatever The warning\nstickers that firefighters often to use\n\n766\n00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:46.070\nto figure out what's in there\nbefore they go in and fight a fire.\n\n767\n00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.820\nWe see them on the front\ndoors of these datacenters.\n\n768\n00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:52.250\nThey'll simply say caution gas in use,\nor gas suppression in use.\n\n769\n00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:53.850\nThey typically will name the kind of gas.\n\n770\n00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:58.260\nSo may say FM-200,\nit may say Aero-K, or argon, or\n\n771\n00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.970\nCO2, whatever it is,\nthere's all these different gasses.\n\n772\n00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:03.440\nWhat it probably doesn't say anymore,\nis halon.\n\n773\n00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:06.120\nAt least it most likely\nwill not say that anymore.\n\n774\n00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:09.800\nThe only time you would've seen\na halon system, at least these days,\n\n775\n00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.540\nwould be if it hasn't\nalready been used and\n\n776\n00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.000\nit's sitting there as a relic waiting\nto be decommissioned and turned over.\n\n777\n00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.580\nI've seen these less and less over\nthe last number of years with customers.\n\n778\n00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:22.720\nI have two that actually still use, that\nhave halon systems that have not finally\n\n779\n00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.750\nhit the benchmark where they have to\nretire them but it's coming up very soon.\n\n780\n00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.650\nHalon used to be the gas of choice.\n\n781\n00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:31.310\nBut it is no longer used\nbecause it is a Greenhouse gas.\n\n782\n00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.250\nAnd it causes problems with the ozone.\n\n783\n00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:36.530\nAnd so when we would fire off these\nsystems, all the Halon would eventually\n\n784\n00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:38.540\nget out of the building so\nyou have to vent the building,\n\n785\n00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:40.740\nbecause Halon sucks all\nthe air out of the building.\n\n786\n00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:44.220\nSo effectively it sucks all the air away\nfrom the fire, which is very good for\n\n787\n00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.790\nfire suppression, not very good for you.\n\n788\n00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.880\nIf you happen to be sitting in the room\nwhen this goes off, you will die.\n\n789\n00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:52.410\nSo, we often have breathing apparatuses\nthat are scattered around the data\n\n790\n00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:53.210\ncenter for this.\n\n791\n00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:56.520\nThere's warning lights that go off, and\nyou usually have a small delay lag.\n\n792\n00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.740\nSo, you can get out of the area if\nyou need to before the gas goes off.\n\n793\n00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:03.730\nBut the idea is that Halon is no\nlonger allowed because of a treaty.\n\n794\n00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:04.720\nWe actually signed a treaty.\n\n795\n00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.310\nThe U.S did, many other countries did,\n\n796\n00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:10.770\ncalled the Montreal protocol back\nin 1987 that bans the use of Halon.\n\n797\n00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:13.320\nAnd as a result of that its\nbeen effectively banned for\n\n798\n00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.030\nuse in these systems for\nabout 30 years now.\n\n799\n00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:21.050\nSo, most of these systems are reaching the\nend of their useful life where they can\n\n800\n00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.820\nno longer be refilled with and so\n\n801\n00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.861\nwhen they go off, they then are gonna\nbe switched over to something like.\n\n802\n00:36:27.861 --> 00:36:33.290\nSo kind of interesting little geek\ngas information there, if you will.\n\n803\n00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:36.025\nSo, we're basically gonna wrap up\nour conversation in this area.\n\n804\n00:36:36.025 --> 00:36:39.025\nFinish up our discussion\nabout suppression systems.\n\n805\n00:36:39.025 --> 00:36:41.945\nThrow it back over to Mr.\nMike here, and he's gonna take us out.\n\n806\n00:36:41.945 --> 00:36:42.625\n>> Fantastic.\n\n807\n00:36:42.625 --> 00:36:43.825\nA lot of great information again.\n\n808\n00:36:43.825 --> 00:36:44.675\nPhysical security?\n\n809\n00:36:44.675 --> 00:36:47.625\nOne of those areas that\nsometimes get overlooked, or\n\n810\n00:36:47.625 --> 00:36:49.215\nsome of the finer details, right?\n\n811\n00:36:49.215 --> 00:36:51.505\nWe've really gotta pay attention to.\n\n812\n00:36:51.505 --> 00:36:52.085\nGreat stuff.\n\n813\n00:36:52.085 --> 00:36:52.755\nGreat insight, Adam.\n\n814\n00:36:52.755 --> 00:36:53.855\nWe appreciate that.\n\n815\n00:36:53.855 --> 00:36:57.345\nRemember, if you guys wanna attend one of\nAdam's classes live, shoot us an email.\n\n816\n00:36:57.345 --> 00:36:59.210\nSeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n817\n00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.130\nThat's it for now.\n\n818\n00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.960\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n819\n00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.290\n>> I'm Montreal Protocol.\n\n820\n00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:05.450\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n821\n00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:06.380\nTake care.\n\n822\n00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:12.710\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

I'm good.\nI'm feeling very OSIish today.\n\n13\n00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.620\n>> Oh Boy!\n>> As a matter of fact.\n\n14\n00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.168\n>> I know where we're going [LAUGH]\n>> Yes, yes you do.\n\n15\n00:00:44.168 --> 00:00:46.880\nThat good old-fashioned OSI model.\n\n16\n00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.620\nSo when we talk about network\narchitecture, we talk about secure design,\n\n17\n00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.170\nas Mike pointed out,\nwe have to build a good foundation.\n\n18\n00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.910\nAnd we have to build a good foundation\nof knowledge, but we also have to build\n\n19\n00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.090\na good foundation for actually everything\nthat will go on top of that knowledge.\n\n20\n00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.770\nThat's all the data.\n\n21\n00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.040\nThat's all the information that\nwe're gonna send and receive,\n\n22\n00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.100\nand we do that by understanding,\nat least in our world anyway,\n\n23\n00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.270\nunderstand the OSI model,\nthe Open System Interconnect model.\n\n24\n00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.165\nGood old fashioned seven layer,\ntop to bottom,\n\n25\n00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:14.930\nbi-directional discussion of how\ninformation is going to be managed,\n\n26\n00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.240\nboth physically and logically,\nthrough one system to another.\n\n27\n00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.560\nSo what I'm gonna do is walk us through\nthat over the next couple minutes.\n\n28\n00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.950\nExplain each layer to you.\n\n29\n00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.530\nGive you effectively a high level\nsummary of what each layer does.\n\n30\n00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.210\nWe don't want you to go down the rabbit\nhole here with the OSI model.\n\n31\n00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.940\nRemember mile wide,\ninch deep is the level we're looking for.\n\n32\n00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.260\nWe've talked about this.\n\n33\n00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.970\nTrying to set a level for you in your\nmind, with regards to data information\n\n34\n00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.930\nmanagement, that helps you to\nfocus on the right aspects,\n\n35\n00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.670\nthe right level of detail\nwithout getting too bogged down.\n\n36\n00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.370\nWe don't want you to become the expert\nknowledge master of the OSI world, but\n\n37\n00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.380\nrather simply a practitioner of OSI.\n\n38\n00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.660\nGo forth and practition.\n\n39\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.270\nGo forth in OSI, as they say.\n\n40\n00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.690\nSo we're going to talk about the model.\n\n41\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.570\nGive you a quick idea of\nwhat happens at each layer.\n\n42\n00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.800\nExplain the functionality,\nin terms of interaction.\n\n43\n00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.630\nAlso put in some additional\nconsiderations for us.\n\n44\n00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.100\nFor instance, some hardware that exists\nat different layers of the OSI model.\n\n45\n00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.160\nWhere do we find routers?\n\n46\n00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.480\nWhere do we find switches?\n\n47\n00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.650\nWhere do we find bridges?\n\n48\n00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.450\nGood to know that kinda stuff.\n\n49\n00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.910\nWhat kind of protocols may be found\nat certain layers of the OSI model?\n\n50\n00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.540\nWhere does TCP hang out?\n\n51\n00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.720\nWhere does TCP hang out,\nwhere does IP hang out?\n\n52\n00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.690\nWe don't care about ICP,\ntotally irrelevant.\n\n53\n00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.820\nWhere does UDP hang out,\nthings like that, right?\n\n54\n00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.650\nSo where are those protocols\ngonna be found commonly?\n\n55\n00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.050\nWe wanna make sure we know that.\n\n56\n00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.930\nWhere do we plug in and\nsee our physical connectivity?\n\n57\n00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.660\nAnd where do we see cabling nad\ninteraction with hardware and\n\n58\n00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.710\nthings of that nature?\n\n59\n00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.560\nHow does that happen?\n\n60\n00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.080\nWe'll talk about those things\nalong the way as well.\n\n61\n00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.570\nLet's throw up a nice graphic that\nwe created for the OSI model.\n\n62\n00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.180\nIt's gonna help us to walk through that.\n\n63\n00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.400\nShow that to you a little bit.\n\n64\n00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.010\nMike, if you could,\nif we could just zoom in just a touch.\n\n65\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.090\nWe're gonna just zoom in so you can see\na little bit more of the detail there.\n\n66\n00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.000\nMake it a little bit easier for\neverybody to see.\n\n67\n00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.090\nSo on the left of the diagram\nwe have the OSI model,\n\n68\n00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.210\nand you'll see on the right we\nhave the TCP/IP layer model.\n\n69\n00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.840\nWhat we call the DOD model or\nthe four layer model.\n\n70\n00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.630\nThis is the model.\n\n71\n00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.840\nWe'll just start with\nthat one on the right,\n\n72\n00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.240\nbecause it's, the older one we can\nquickly, kind of, walk through that.\n\n73\n00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.810\nThe TCP/IP model is the original\nmodel of Internet working,\n\n74\n00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.810\ncomes to us from the DOD,\nas in the Department of Defense, and\n\n75\n00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.540\nit's the first vision of what networking\nlooked like when we first started out and\n\n76\n00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.110\nreally started using networks to connect\nand flow information between endpoints.\n\n77\n00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.030\nIt was a little bit more of\na simplistic look at the world,\n\n78\n00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.780\ndidn't have as much detail.\n\n79\n00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.940\nReally, several years into\nthis thought process we now\n\n80\n00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.340\nbreak out out the OSI model.\n\n81\n00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.030\nWe needed more detail, more depth,\nmore understanding of the capabilities and\n\n82\n00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.370\nthe transactions that\noccurred at various layers.\n\n83\n00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.560\nAnd so we move into the OSI model.\n\n84\n00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.800\nYou'll notice the TCP model maps\nto to the OSI model very well.\n\n85\n00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.950\nMike's done a real nice job of lining\nthem up for us there on the diagram,\n\n86\n00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.000\nshowing you the connection points.\n\n87\n00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.820\nYou'll see that the link layer in the TCP\nmodel represents the first two layers at\n\n88\n00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.380\nthe bottom of the OSI model diagram,\nfor instance.\n\n89\n00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.250\nSo we can see a mapping\nthere between the layers.\n\n90\n00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.850\nOn the OSI model,\nwe'll notice that we have seven layers,\n\n91\n00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.730\nwhether we go from application at\nthe top to physical at the bottom,\n\n92\n00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.650\nor physical at the bottom up\nthrough transport into application.\n\n93\n00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.235\nThe model does run bi-directionally,\neither up and down, or down and up.\n\n94\n00:04:10.235 --> 00:04:11.975\nIt really depends on what we're doing.\n\n95\n00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:15.415\nWe're going to talk about the model\nfrom the perspective of sitting at\n\n96\n00:04:15.415 --> 00:04:19.565\nthe keyboard, looking at an application,\ninteracting with it at layer seven.\n\n97\n00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:22.472\nAnd walk down through\nthe deconstruction of the model\n\n98\n00:04:22.472 --> 00:04:26.132\non the deconstruction of a data packet\nthat makes its way through the model.\n\n99\n00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:28.992\nTo be able to ultimately be\nsend out on at layer one,\n\n100\n00:04:28.992 --> 00:04:32.882\nonto the wire out to an endpoint\nsomewhere else outside the system.\n\n101\n00:04:32.882 --> 00:04:35.499\nSo we'll walk through from\nlayer seven through layer one.\n\n102\n00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.150\nAt the top of the model at layer seven,\nthe application layer,\n\n103\n00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.640\nthis is where a user interacts\nwith the OSI model directly.\n\n104\n00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.690\nIn the sense that we sit at our computer,\nwe use Word or Adobe Acrobat or\n\n105\n00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.760\nInternet Explorer, or whatever it may be.\n\n106\n00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.990\nAnd we're interacting,\nwe're creating consuming data.\n\n107\n00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.150\nSo let's pretend for\na minute we're using a Word document,\n\n108\n00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.270\nwe're using Microsoft Word,\nwe're typing in a sentence.\n\n109\n00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.320\nAnd we've gone ahead and done that.\n\n110\n00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.510\nAnd we're gonna save that document.\n\n111\n00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.480\nWe then wanna use that document.\n\n112\n00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.420\nAttach it and\nsend it off to somebody, via email.\n\n113\n00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.510\nJust hypothetically, for our purposes.\n\n114\n00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.750\nSo at the application layer,\n\n115\n00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.330\nwe're using Microsoft Word to be\nable to effectively create data.\n\n116\n00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.615\nTo save it,\nwe'll save it to the local hard drive.\n\n117\n00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:17.545\nAnd then we're gonna use\nanother application.\n\n118\n00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:21.425\nLet's say our email application, to be\nable to attach that Word document and\n\n119\n00:05:21.425 --> 00:05:22.925\nsend it via email.\n\n120\n00:05:22.925 --> 00:05:24.378\nRight?\nSo we've use a couple of different\n\n121\n00:05:24.378 --> 00:05:25.435\napplications at that layer.\n\n122\n00:05:25.435 --> 00:05:28.175\nSo the application layer is\nall about the programs, and\n\n123\n00:05:28.175 --> 00:05:31.635\ninteraction between the program and\nthe user through the computer.\n\n124\n00:05:31.635 --> 00:05:34.485\nAt layer six,\nthe presentation layer as we go down,\n\n125\n00:05:34.485 --> 00:05:37.230\nwe're effectively looking\nat how we present data.\n\n126\n00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.340\nSo in other words in layer\nseven at the application layer,\n\n127\n00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.290\nwe see data in Word as let's say\nmaybe left margin justified,\n\n128\n00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.820\nwith I don't know, what's your favorite\nfont and font size there Mike?\n\n129\n00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.140\n>> I'd say Calibri 14.\n\n130\n00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.250\n>> All right Mike says Calibri 14 so\nwe'll see Calibri 14.\n\n131\n00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:56.699\nWe've got a little left margin\njustification going on, maybe we bold it,\n\n132\n00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.590\nmake it look real nice and pretty.\n\n133\n00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.080\nAnd that's all stuff that's gonna\nhappen in the presentation layer.\n\n134\n00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.500\nIn terms of how we actually are showing\ndata, and interacting with data and\n\n135\n00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.145\npresenting It's obviously shown\nto us in the application layer.\n\n136\n00:06:09.145 --> 00:06:11.245\nThe application does that for us.\n\n137\n00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:12.915\nBut as we save that data and\n\n138\n00:06:12.915 --> 00:06:17.755\nstart deconstructing it to actually create\nthe message and send it out as an email.\n\n139\n00:06:17.755 --> 00:06:21.505\nThe bits and bytes if you will,\nwe have to strip off all that formatting,\n\n140\n00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:25.335\nall that information management that\ntakes place in the application layer.\n\n141\n00:06:25.335 --> 00:06:28.395\nBecause we're not really concerned\nabout 14 point Calibri and\n\n142\n00:06:28.395 --> 00:06:30.220\nleft margin justify the bold.\n\n143\n00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.870\nWe're concerned about the bits and\nbytes, the binary data, the ones and\n\n144\n00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.750\nzeros, that represent that sentence,\nrepresent all that data.\n\n145\n00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.880\nSo we're going to strip away all the fancy\nwindow dressing as I often call it,\n\n146\n00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.210\nthe presentation layers,\nits all about making stuff look pretty.\n\n147\n00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.040\nI would often refer to it as\na universal translation layer.\n\n148\n00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.120\nI would use my Star Trek analogy, but\nsome of you may not remember the original\n\n149\n00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.470\nStar Trek episode where Captain Kirk\nfought the Gorgon, right?\n\n150\n00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.450\nThat lizard like creature it was one\nthe planet of the universal translator.\n\n151\n00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.140\nSo that's what the presentation\nlayer is all about right.\n\n152\n00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.420\nIt's about translating information to\nmake it look not only acceptable, but\n\n153\n00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.225\nto allow us the application\nthat we are presented to us.\n\n154\n00:07:07.225 --> 00:07:09.775\nSo that's what the presentation\nlayer is all about.\n\n155\n00:07:09.775 --> 00:07:11.695\nThe session layer as we'll move down,\n\n156\n00:07:11.695 --> 00:07:14.435\nis where we're going to do\nsomething very interesting.\n\n157\n00:07:14.435 --> 00:07:17.295\nThe session layer is where we\nactually establish the rules that\n\n158\n00:07:17.295 --> 00:07:18.375\ngovern connectivity.\n\n159\n00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:21.435\nIn other words we are creating in effect,\nthe box.\n\n160\n00:07:21.435 --> 00:07:24.715\nI refer to it as the box often when I\ntalk about it, we're sketching out and\n\n161\n00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:29.555\nmanaging what the interaction between our\ncomputer and another computer on the other\n\n162\n00:07:29.555 --> 00:07:32.050\nside that's going to receive\ninformation is going to look like.\n\n163\n00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.320\nWe're not actually sending anything yet.\n\n164\n00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.890\nWe are setting up\nthe management of the rules and\n\n165\n00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:39.040\nthe structure that will allow us to.\n\n166\n00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.820\nSo, we're getting ready, and\nwe're building out the structure,\n\n167\n00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.510\ndefining the rules,\ngetting ready to set things up.\n\n168\n00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.910\nBut we're not actually\nsending anything just yet.\n\n169\n00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.760\nBut we're establishing what will\nultimately become the session.\n\n170\n00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.420\nAnd we're gonna manage it at this layer.\n\n171\n00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.808\nAt the transport layer, this is end\nto end error detection and control.\n\n172\n00:07:55.808 --> 00:07:59.035\nI think of the transport layer\nalmost like UPS or FedEx, right?\n\n173\n00:07:59.035 --> 00:08:02.122\nWhere we're packaging stuff up,\nwe're gonna get it ready for\n\n174\n00:08:02.122 --> 00:08:03.412\ntransport and shipment.\n\n175\n00:08:03.412 --> 00:08:06.453\nI had to recently send a package\nto one of my friends up north.\n\n176\n00:08:06.453 --> 00:08:10.878\nI took it in, I took the information stuff\nI was going to put in the package in,\n\n177\n00:08:10.878 --> 00:08:14.840\nit was bottles of scotch, right,\nand send him a little present.\n\n178\n00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.789\nSo, I put them in [CROSSTALK]\n>> Put them on your Christmas list.\n\n179\n00:08:16.789 --> 00:08:17.995\n>> Well, absolutely, so\n\n180\n00:08:17.995 --> 00:08:20.153\nit's one of the guys that I do\na lot of writing with, right?\n\n181\n00:08:20.153 --> 00:08:23.065\nSo we would write books together, so\nI sent him a little holiday gift.\n\n182\n00:08:23.065 --> 00:08:27.735\nSo I took some scotch, put it in a box,\nand I put the packing peanuts in there,\n\n183\n00:08:27.735 --> 00:08:32.655\nwrapped it up, made sure it wouldn't\nbreak, took it, went into FedEx.\n\n184\n00:08:32.655 --> 00:08:34.825\nAnd weighed the box,\ntaped it all up, and said hey,\n\n185\n00:08:34.825 --> 00:08:38.340\nI wanna send this, took one look at it,\nsaid okay, what's in there?\n\n186\n00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.930\nStupidly I said oh, it's alcohol.\n\n187\n00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:45.310\nNice lady behind the counter said sorry,\nwe don't ship alcohol, you can't do that.\n\n188\n00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.820\nSo I had to take that box, pack it\nup into another box, take it to UPS\n\n189\n00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.475\ndown the street, this time I got smart and\ndidn't tell them I was shipping alcohol.\n\n190\n00:08:53.475 --> 00:08:54.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n191\n00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.270\njust simply put inside another\nbox with peanuts and everything.\n\n192\n00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.930\nPacked it up, wrapped it up nice, gave it\nto them, and then had them send it, right?\n\n193\n00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.935\nBecause, call me a fool once,\nbut don't call me a fool twice.\n\n194\n00:09:03.935 --> 00:09:06.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So at the transport layer,\n\n195\n00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.270\nwhat we're doing effectively, so\nwe're packaging up all that data, right?\n\n196\n00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.870\nWe're putting the bubble wrap in.\n\n197\n00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.760\nWe're setting up the structure\nof the data packet, so\n\n198\n00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.280\nwe're putting the header in place.\n\n199\n00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.720\nWe're putting in the middle container\nin effect, where data actually lives,\n\n200\n00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.095\nthe payload itself.\n\n201\n00:09:21.095 --> 00:09:24.635\nWe're putting in, or about to bolt\non the back end, the trailer,\n\n202\n00:09:24.635 --> 00:09:28.045\nwhich is gonna be the buffer that's gonna\ndo error control and correction for us and\n\n203\n00:09:28.045 --> 00:09:29.325\nmake sure all that's happening.\n\n204\n00:09:29.325 --> 00:09:31.635\nSo we're starting to\nstructure the data packets,\n\n205\n00:09:31.635 --> 00:09:35.165\nstarting to break the word\ndocument data down into consumable\n\n206\n00:09:35.165 --> 00:09:39.370\nbite-sized data frames that effectively\nthen allow us to transmit data.\n\n207\n00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.150\nThat's what's happening\nat the transport layer.\n\n208\n00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:43.250\nWe're starting that construction.\n\n209\n00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.740\nAt the network layer,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n210\n00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.020\nwe're gonna manage the connections\nthat are gonna actually take place.\n\n211\n00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.200\nWe're gonna set them up and ensure with\nthe information from the session layer\n\n212\n00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.240\nthat we know how to do the connection, how\nto effectively address the information and\n\n213\n00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.550\nmake sure it gets to the right place.\n\n214\n00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:01.562\nSo in the data header, we're gonna be\nputting in the TCP IP information.\n\n215\n00:10:01.562 --> 00:10:04.561\nThe IP address is, for\ninstance, is gonna go in there.\n\n216\n00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:06.332\nWe're gonna make sure we\nunderstand how to route it.\n\n217\n00:10:06.332 --> 00:10:10.940\nWe're gonna have information about\nwhere the packet is going to, so\n\n218\n00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.720\ndo we have a destination address?\n\n219\n00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.250\nEither IP or MAC, it just depends\non the nature of what we know.\n\n220\n00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.540\nIs it local, is it remote?\n\n221\n00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.210\nThings like that.\n\n222\n00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.070\nSo we're gonna have all that\ninformation taking place in there.\n\n223\n00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.050\nIn the data link layer,\nsomething interesting happens.\n\n224\n00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.832\nWe actually have two sub-layers,\nwhich are represented by,\n\n225\n00:10:25.832 --> 00:10:28.729\nyou have the items underneath\nitem number two there, data link.\n\n226\n00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:31.555\nWe see LLC and MAC, so\nwith the data link layer,\n\n227\n00:10:31.555 --> 00:10:35.654\nwe are effectively gonna be finalizing\nthe last minute activities,\n\n228\n00:10:35.654 --> 00:10:40.480\nlast minute check on the status of the\npacket, do a structural integrity check.\n\n229\n00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.467\nWe're gonna make sure that the error\ncontrol and correction details in\n\n230\n00:10:44.467 --> 00:10:48.519\nthe trailer, the cyclical redundancy\ncheck, the CRC, the check sum,\n\n231\n00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:52.990\nwhich is gonna give us the integrity check\non the data, all that stuff is there.\n\n232\n00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.370\nSo all the padding and\nthe structure is good.\n\n233\n00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.070\nShake the box, make sure nothing's\nrattling around in there.\n\n234\n00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:00.720\nI'm gonna double check\nthe header of the data packet.\n\n235\n00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.530\nMake sure the addressing is good,\nif we have any VLAN information,\n\n236\n00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:08.710\nany address translation, any flags, all\nthat kind of stuff that could take place.\n\n237\n00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.340\nFragmentation, data sequence numbers,\n\n238\n00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.250\nall that stuff is gonna be finalized and\nchecked.\n\n239\n00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.100\nJust make sure it's all good,\nlike a pre-flight check, right.\n\n240\n00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.080\nA checklist making sure we're done,\neverything is good, walk around,\n\n241\n00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.080\nkick the tires.\n\n242\n00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.120\nAnd then when we're done,\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n243\n00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.280\nwe're gonna send that data packet\ndown to the physical layer.\n\n244\n00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.840\nPhysical layer is gonna be\nthe interconnect layer where we actually,\n\n245\n00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.540\nagain, interact directly\nwith the OSI model.\n\n246\n00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:33.240\nThis is where we're gonna be able to\nplug the network cable into the back of\n\n247\n00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.260\nthe machine.\n\n248\n00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.710\nI often tell my students when I talk about\nthis, that everything that takes place in\n\n249\n00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.000\nthe OSI model is gonna\nhappen inside of a computer.\n\n250\n00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.350\nThe only places you really can see\nthe model in action are at layer seven and\n\n251\n00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.300\nat layer one,\nphysically interact with them,\n\n252\n00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.150\nbecause layer seven,\nyou're interacting with the application.\n\n253\n00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:53.170\nLayer one,\nyou're looking at the interconnection.\n\n254\n00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.010\nYou're looking at the cabling,\nyou're looking at the network card,\n\n255\n00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.810\nall the physicality of the connection and\nthe transmission is happening there.\n\n256\n00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.160\nSo whether it's fiber optic,\n\n257\n00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.040\nwhether it's gonna be traditional ethernet\ncopper wired cable, whether it's wireless.\n\n258\n00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.640\nYou can interact with and\nsee those things at layer one.\n\n259\n00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.854\nBut everything in between, you really\ndon't have any visibility and super say.\n\n260\n00:12:10.854 --> 00:12:15.860\nYou can't detect and understand through a\ncommand line using for instance ipconfig.\n\n261\n00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.312\nYou can look at your IP address,\nyou look at your MAC address.\n\n262\n00:12:18.312 --> 00:12:21.269\nYou can see evidence of some of that\nstuff, but we don't really directly\n\n263\n00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:24.120\ninteract with it more often than not,\nso it's kind of a black box.\n\n264\n00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.550\nIt happens inside if you think about it,\nall right.\n\n265\n00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.110\nSo this is all the stuff that\ntakes place in the OSI model.\n\n266\n00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:32.438\nWe send our packet out,\nit goes out the bottom obviously.\n\n267\n00:12:32.438 --> 00:12:35.983\nIt transits across the network in\nsome way, shows up the other side, we\n\n268\n00:12:35.983 --> 00:12:40.120\nwould then run the model in reverse, take\nthe packet off the physical connection,\n\n269\n00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.970\nmove it through the data link layer.\n\n270\n00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:45.745\nWe would then in effect look at\nthe packet, do an integrity check for\n\n271\n00:12:45.745 --> 00:12:48.857\nthe first time, do an address check for\nthe first time,\n\n272\n00:12:48.857 --> 00:12:52.766\nvalidate the MAC address belongs to\nus because we examine the packet at\n\n273\n00:12:52.766 --> 00:12:55.840\nthe sub-layer to ensure that\nthe packet belong to us.\n\n274\n00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.577\nIf it doesn't, we ignore the packet and\n\n275\n00:12:57.577 --> 00:13:00.800\nwe don't bother processing it\nthe rest of the way up the OSI model.\n\n276\n00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.000\nIf it does belong to us,\nwe then continue on.\n\n277\n00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.420\nAnd then we'll start unwrapping and\n\n278\n00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.330\nunpacking the package that\nwas actually put together.\n\n279\n00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.040\nAnd then ultimately,\nwe reformat it, we present it and\n\n280\n00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.830\nput it into the application layer\nseven and ultimately show it to you\n\n281\n00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.570\nright up on the screen doing\nwhatever it is you need to do.\n\n282\n00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:20.880\nSo this is what actually\nhappens at the OSI model.\n\n283\n00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.410\nWhat we then wanna understand, and\nwe'll just put into perspective as we go,\n\n284\n00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:26.870\nis what are some of the things\nthat occur at various layers.\n\n285\n00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.120\nWe said that at layer one,\n\n286\n00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.470\nthe physical layer of the OSI model, we're\nseeing the physical interconnections.\n\n287\n00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.520\nSo we're seeing the network card.\n\n288\n00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.850\nWe're seeing the cabling.\n\n289\n00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:39.680\nWe're seeing the connection\nstandards that we use, 802.3, 802.5,\n\n290\n00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:44.190\nethernet versus token ring, fiber, etc,\nall that stuff's gonna happen there.\n\n291\n00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:45.470\nHow fast is the connection?\n\n292\n00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:46.360\nIs it gigabit?\n\n293\n00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.050\nIs it 10 gigabit for fiber?\n\n294\n00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:50.210\nThat's the kind of stuff we'd\nsee at the physical layer.\n\n295\n00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.320\nLayer two, the data link layer,\n\n296\n00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.450\nwe're gonna be able to see a physical\ndevice known as the bridge, right.\n\n297\n00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:58.360\nSo a bridge would exist at\nlayer two of the OSI model.\n\n298\n00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.042\nNow you may or\nmay not be familiar with bridges,\n\n299\n00:14:00.042 --> 00:14:02.920\nyou're probably gonna be more familiar\nwith another layer two device.\n\n300\n00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.910\nCommonly what we more often than not are\nfamiliar with is what's called a switch.\n\n301\n00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.470\nRight, but switches and\nbridges are different devices,\n\n302\n00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.840\nthey do different things.\n\n303\n00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.740\nBoth of them are gonna be able\nto help us move information\n\n304\n00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.350\nfrom one place to another.\n\n305\n00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.915\nA bridge is gonna maintain a routing\ntable which may be unusual for\n\n306\n00:14:18.915 --> 00:14:22.905\nyou to hear because we often think about\nrouting tables associated with routers.\n\n307\n00:14:22.905 --> 00:14:24.812\nRouters are layer three devices, right.\n\n308\n00:14:24.812 --> 00:14:28.779\nSo at the network layer, we see a router\nbecause routers maintain routing tables\n\n309\n00:14:28.779 --> 00:14:31.865\nbut they maintain routing\ntables based on IP addresses.\n\n310\n00:14:31.865 --> 00:14:34.428\nIP is a level three or\na layer three protocol.\n\n311\n00:14:34.428 --> 00:14:38.500\nAt the layer two of the OSI\nmodel with the data link layer,\n\n312\n00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.980\nspecifically at the max sub layer of the\ndata link layer, we are gonna see switches\n\n313\n00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.460\nas well as bridges operate, because a\nbridge is gonna maintain a routing table,\n\n314\n00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:51.060\nbut based on MAC addresses as\nopposed to based on IP addresses.\n\n315\n00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.420\nSo bridges are gonna move in formation\naround based on MAC address association\n\n316\n00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.370\nof end points.\n\n317\n00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.890\nSwitches are gonna be able to move things\naround based on connection from a port.\n\n318\n00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.450\nWe plug into a switch.\n\n319\n00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.720\nAnd a port on the switch equals\nthe connection through a cable and\n\n320\n00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.230\nultimately back out the other side.\n\n321\n00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.370\nThat cable interconnects\nsomewhere through a wall port.\n\n322\n00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:11.646\nAnd that's how we connect machines up on\na LAN to communicate with each other.\n\n323\n00:15:11.646 --> 00:15:15.412\nNow you may know and may actually be\nsitting there thinking to yourself, hey,\n\n324\n00:15:15.412 --> 00:15:18.324\nisn't a switch potentially not\njust a layer two device, but\n\n325\n00:15:18.324 --> 00:15:21.770\ndon't switches in theory also get\nreferred to as layer three devices.\n\n326\n00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.390\nAnd don't we have switches that actually\nexist in multiple layers of the OSI model?\n\n327\n00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.240\nAnd the answer is absolutely, we do.\n\n328\n00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.880\nThere are more advanced switches,\n\n329\n00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.680\nmanaged switches that form the backbone of\nnetworks and the backbone of the Internet,\n\n330\n00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.250\nfor instance, that are gonna operate\nat higher levels of the OSI model.\n\n331\n00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.790\nBut a switch traditionally is\ndefined as a layer two device.\n\n332\n00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.010\nThat's where we would normally\nsee a standard switch.\n\n333\n00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:45.740\nThat's the generic switch that you will\noften see in networks and in your room,\n\n334\n00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.770\nconnecting up multiple machines,\nthings like that.\n\n335\n00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.320\nSo just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n336\n00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.310\nI forgot to put a hub into the mix.\n\n337\n00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.440\nMike was supposed to remind me.\n\n338\n00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.148\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And Mike's not doing his job here.\n\n339\n00:15:54.148 --> 00:15:56.992\nHe's off looking at cartoons, doing\nother stuff off to the side here, but\n\n340\n00:15:56.992 --> 00:15:58.130\nhe's not paying attention.\n\n341\n00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:59.268\nSo, a hub.\n\n342\n00:15:59.268 --> 00:16:01.323\nIs going to be a device that\nwe really don't see anymore.\n\n343\n00:16:01.323 --> 00:16:04.490\nI mean, if you think about it,\nwhen was the last time you saw a hub?\n\n344\n00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.260\n>> Years.\n\n345\n00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.475\n>> Probably a long time ago.\n\n346\n00:16:06.475 --> 00:16:11.034\nBut they do still exist in theory in the\nsense that they've been incorporated from\n\n347\n00:16:11.034 --> 00:16:14.310\na functionality perspective into\nbridges and switches and routers,\n\n348\n00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.210\nthat functionality of being\nable to connect things together\n\n349\n00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.415\nis really what forms\nthe basis of a switch.\n\n350\n00:16:19.415 --> 00:16:22.980\nThe idea is that a switch is really just\na smart hub, it does more than that,\n\n351\n00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.460\nI don't want to make light of\nthe fact that switch is much more.\n\n352\n00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.610\nThe reality is a switch we boil it down,\nis an interconnection device for\n\n353\n00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:30.060\nmultiple machines.\n\n354\n00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.270\nAnd so is a hub,\nexcept that a hub is dumb or was dumb.\n\n355\n00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:34.530\nA hub really had no knowledge,\n\n356\n00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.510\nno understanding of anything\nwe would connect into it.\n\n357\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.430\nIt was just simply a relay point.\n\n358\n00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.280\nYou would plug in and\n\n359\n00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.630\nexchange information with anything\nelse that was connected to the hub.\n\n360\n00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.920\nThis was back in the good old days\nof networking where we had hubs,\n\n361\n00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.810\nwe had repeaters which\nwere separate from hubs.\n\n362\n00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:54.365\nA repeater would effectively,\namplify is the word I'm looking for,\n\n363\n00:16:54.365 --> 00:16:58.915\nright, it would amplify the signal and\nallow us to overcome attenuation,\n\n364\n00:16:58.915 --> 00:17:02.625\nwhich is, effectively the loss of signal\nstrength over distance due to friction or\n\n365\n00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:04.215\nresistance on the wire.\n\n366\n00:17:04.215 --> 00:17:06.947\nSo we're gonna be putting on our\ndoctor networking ad here and\n\n367\n00:17:06.947 --> 00:17:09.317\ndoing a little physics demonstration for\nyou.\n\n368\n00:17:09.317 --> 00:17:12.697\nSo the reality is, in the old days,\nwe would have separate devices.\n\n369\n00:17:12.697 --> 00:17:14.597\nYou would have hubs,\nyou would have repeaters.\n\n370\n00:17:14.597 --> 00:17:16.488\nYou would also have something\ncalled a line conditioner.\n\n371\n00:17:16.488 --> 00:17:18.484\nI don't know if you remember those,\nand may have had those.\n\n372\n00:17:18.484 --> 00:17:21.507\nThat was a box that you would use\nthat would also be inline, and\n\n373\n00:17:21.507 --> 00:17:25.171\nyou would actually run your power through\nthat, and that would clean up and\n\n374\n00:17:25.171 --> 00:17:28.777\nkind of stabilize your power flow, so\nthat way you didn't have spikes and\n\n375\n00:17:28.777 --> 00:17:32.470\nbrownouts and sags and dips and all\nthe other stuff we deal with with power.\n\n376\n00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.650\nYou would get consistent, clean power.\n\n377\n00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.519\nToday, all that functionality,\nhub for just dumb interconnect,\n\n378\n00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.240\na line conditioner to effectively\ncondition power, a ability to be able to\n\n379\n00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.970\namplify signals through a repeater,\nall of that has been rolled up into newer\n\n380\n00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.490\ndevices, and so switches\nare effectively able to do all of this.\n\n381\n00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.870\nAnd we don't really see this\nindividual hardware any more.\n\n382\n00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:58.460\nSwitches are able to effectively do\nthe hub and the repeater thing, and\n\n383\n00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.180\nthey kinda function that way.\n\n384\n00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.980\nSo a hub would have been a Layer 1 device,\nwould have been a physical device we\n\n385\n00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.910\nwould interconnect down at\nthe bottom of the OSI model.\n\n386\n00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.670\nSo I just want to make sure we're\nthinking about these things and\n\n387\n00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:10.180\nhow they work, where we see them,\nwhat they are,\n\n388\n00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:13.410\nwhat kind of protocols may exist at\ncertain layers are also important.\n\n389\n00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:18.740\nI mentioned IP,\nI mentioned that IP is a Layer 3 protocol.\n\n390\n00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.846\nWe also wanna think about things\nlike OSPF, open shortest path first,\n\n391\n00:18:21.846 --> 00:18:23.728\nwould be a traditional Layer 3 protocol.\n\n392\n00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:26.789\nIGMP is gonna be a Layer\n3 protocol traditionally,\n\n393\n00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:30.345\nInternet group multicast\nprotocol is what IGMP stands for.\n\n394\n00:18:30.345 --> 00:18:33.010\nWe also wanna think about IPsec.\n\n395\n00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:34.840\nIPsec is something we've\ntalked about in certain area,\n\n396\n00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.320\nwe'll talk about more in others.\n\n397\n00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.030\nIt's also a Layer 3 protocol,\nInternet Protocol Security.\n\n398\n00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.097\nDid you know IPsec was a Layer 3 protocol?\n\n399\n00:18:41.097 --> 00:18:42.433\n>> I did.\n>> I know you knew that.\n\n400\n00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:44.834\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz Mike actually is feeding me.\n\n401\n00:18:44.834 --> 00:18:45.973\nHe's the smart guy.\n\n402\n00:18:45.973 --> 00:18:47.354\nI'm the ventriloquist dummy.\n\n403\n00:18:47.354 --> 00:18:47.935\nI'm sitting here.\n\n404\n00:18:47.935 --> 00:18:50.665\nIf you were to look at Mike in a wide shot\nright now, you would see him with the,\n\n405\n00:18:50.665 --> 00:18:52.585\nyeah, well,\nyou don't see him now cuz I warned him.\n\n406\n00:18:52.585 --> 00:18:55.730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But what you would see is actually Mike\n\n407\n00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.750\nis controlling all of the strings,\nhe's feeding me all of the information.\n\n408\n00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.920\nI'm just the one who's\njust gonna say it to you.\n\n409\n00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.320\n>> Yeah, and if you believe that, I've got\na bridge, I'm gonna sell you really cheap.\n\n410\n00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.790\n>> All right, so fine.\n\n411\n00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:10.300\nNo bridges, nothing for sale today,\njust trying to make Mike look good,\n\n412\n00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.810\nthat's what I was trying to do.\n\n413\n00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.580\nSo when we think about Layer 3, we're\nthinking about some of those protocols.\n\n414\n00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.460\nWhat about Layer 4, the transport layer.\n\n415\n00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.080\nWe've got protocols\nthere as well obviously,\n\n416\n00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.400\ndon't want to leave out Layer 4.\n\n417\n00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.740\nIt gets really lonely,\nstarts to not behave itself,\n\n418\n00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:25.250\nthings don't go well, packages get\nmisdirected, bad things can occur.\n\n419\n00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.350\nSo we're gonna be nice to Layer 4.\n\n420\n00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.666\nWhat are the protocols that exist there?\n\n421\n00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:29.767\nWe have TCP as in TCP/IP.\n\n422\n00:19:29.767 --> 00:19:34.594\nA TCP/IP, as people may or may not know,\nis actually two protocols that were\n\n423\n00:19:34.594 --> 00:19:38.100\njoined together,\nessentially at birth, if you will.\n\n424\n00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.030\nAnd we often refer to them as one,\nbut in fact,\n\n425\n00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.871\nthey actually are two separate protocols.\n\n426\n00:19:41.871 --> 00:19:46.133\nAnd we often refer to, actually,\nthe TCP/IP protocols suite because they\n\n427\n00:19:46.133 --> 00:19:50.529\nare two protocols and a collection of\ntools and supporting protocols that work\n\n428\n00:19:50.529 --> 00:19:54.235\ntogether to form routing and\nnetwork management capabilities.\n\n429\n00:19:54.235 --> 00:19:57.490\nSo things like ping, for instance,\nis going to be part of the protocol\n\n430\n00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.650\nsupport that is found in\nTCP/IP as a protocol suite.\n\n431\n00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:05.800\nBut TCP is a protocol as well as UDP,\nboth exist at Layer 4 of the OSI model,\n\n432\n00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.410\nso we just want to be thinking about that\nand understand that at transport layer.\n\n433\n00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.320\nRemember, the difference\nhere between TCP and\n\n434\n00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:15.170\nUDP quickly,\nTCP is a connection-oriented protocol.\n\n435\n00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.500\nWe have what's known as\nthe three-way handshake.\n\n436\n00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.910\nAnd UDP is going to be\na connectionless protocol.\n\n437\n00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.100\nIt's going to be a send and\nforget protocol, and\n\n438\n00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.890\nwe're gonna quickly show you, as seen\nin this screen in front of you here,\n\n439\n00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.840\nwhat the three-way handshake I just\nmentioned actually looks like.\n\n440\n00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:34.350\nWhen we use TCP, we are effectively\nsending a synchronization,\n\n441\n00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.390\nor set up request to the target\nthat we wanna communicate with.\n\n442\n00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.490\nAnd we have to then acknowledge that\nrequest with what's known as an ACK, or\n\n443\n00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:43.960\nacknowledgement packet.\n\n444\n00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.180\nAnd so for every SYN, or\n\n445\n00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:49.790\nevery synchronizer setup we send out, we\nmust receive an ACK, or an acknowledgment,\n\n446\n00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.410\nin order to close the circuit and\neffectively establish communication.\n\n447\n00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:57.858\nBut this is a one-way, unilateral\nconversation, so we have to do this in\n\n448\n00:20:57.858 --> 00:21:02.309\nboth directions in order to set up\nessentially a bidirectional TCP pipe or\n\n449\n00:21:02.309 --> 00:21:04.064\ncommunication mechanism.\n\n450\n00:21:04.064 --> 00:21:06.906\nSo when we talk about\nthe three-way handshake,\n\n451\n00:21:06.906 --> 00:21:11.619\nwe're talking about what you see on the\nscreen, which is the laptop or desktop or\n\n452\n00:21:11.619 --> 00:21:15.460\nmobile device on the left sending\nto the server on the right.\n\n453\n00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.320\nSo we see a SYN going out.\n\n454\n00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.700\nThat's the first part\nof the first handshake.\n\n455\n00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.250\nThe device that is receiving\nthe SYN must acknowledge.\n\n456\n00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:25.710\nThat is the ACK on the right-hand\nside of the SYN/ACK statement.\n\n457\n00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:29.210\nSo if you pair that top\nSYN with that middle ACK,\n\n458\n00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:34.120\ntogether we now have one complete\nside of the equation set up.\n\n459\n00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:39.030\nWe also send a SYN from the receiver\nover to the sender to set\n\n460\n00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.030\nup their side of the conversation.\n\n461\n00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.810\nAnd then there's an ACK\nthat goes back from that.\n\n462\n00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:47.865\nAnd we pair that second SYN in the middle\nwith the bottom ACK, and we have two\n\n463\n00:21:47.865 --> 00:21:52.350\nSYN/ACKs, and as a result, we now have\nbidirectional communication established,\n\n464\n00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.870\nand then we start talking and\ndoing what we need to do.\n\n465\n00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:57.170\nThis is what's known as\nthe TCP three-way handshake.\n\n466\n00:21:57.170 --> 00:21:59.170\nSo just wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n467\n00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:00.460\nWe also wanna make sure\n\n468\n00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.130\nthat we understand that TCP is\na connection-oriented protocol.\n\n469\n00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.640\nWe often refer to it as send and\n\n470\n00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:10.000\nacknowledge, hence\nthe three-way handshake.\n\n471\n00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.570\nUDP is a connectionless protocol.\n\n472\n00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:17.210\nWe call it send and forget, meaning you\nsend data, we don't have a handshake,\n\n473\n00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:21.850\nwe don't have an acknowledgement, so\nUDP is gonna rely on the application that\n\n474\n00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.010\nis sending the data to become\naware of the fact that there's\n\n475\n00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:29.220\nsomething that went wrong, and there is no\ncontinuity of the packets being received.\n\n476\n00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.510\nThe application itself probably doesn't\nknow that, so the application's actually\n\n477\n00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:36.480\nrelying on the user to tell us there's\nsomething wrong more often than not.\n\n478\n00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.080\nSo for instance, if we use streaming\nmedia, as a good example, so\n\n479\n00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:46.440\nyou know your Netflixes, and I don't know,\nwhat's Spotify, it's something like that.\n\n480\n00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.840\nIf you're talking about streaming media\nover the Internet, we're using UDP.\n\n481\n00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:53.100\nWe're not guaranteeing packet delivery,\nand we're not tracking and\n\n482\n00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.550\nsetting up sessions in\nterms of a handshake.\n\n483\n00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.010\nWe're simply sending you volumes of data.\n\n484\n00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:00.122\nIf you miss a frame here or\nthere, no big deal.\n\n485\n00:23:00.122 --> 00:23:02.908\nUnless you request a resend,\nthe application doesn't know.\n\n486\n00:23:02.908 --> 00:23:04.280\nHow do you do that?\n\n487\n00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.150\nYou hit Stop, Rewind,\nyou go back in the buffer, and you replay.\n\n488\n00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:09.450\nThat's how UDP works.\n\n489\n00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.280\nWe're not going to know\nthat you missed a frame.\n\n490\n00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.220\nWe're going to assume it's all good.\n\n491\n00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.830\nThat's the difference between TCP and UDP.\n\n492\n00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.030\nSo just be aware of that,\nobviously important to know.\n\n493\n00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.180\nAt Layer 5, the session layer,\nwe may have some additional protocols.\n\n494\n00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.780\nAgain, protocols that may be\nimportant to us to think about, PAP,\n\n495\n00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.920\npassword authentication protocol,\ntraditionally lives at Layer 5.\n\n496\n00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.020\nPoint-to-Point-Tunneling Protocol,\nPPTP, an oldie but a goodie,\n\n497\n00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.370\nit's what'll talk about later.\n\n498\n00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:33.672\n>> All right,\nwhat layer are we going to next, Adam?\n\n499\n00:23:36.146 --> 00:23:39.565\n[LAUGH] That's right, 5 comes after 4.\n\n500\n00:23:39.565 --> 00:23:43.466\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n501\n00:23:43.466 --> 00:23:46.170\nLayer 5, a little brevity and humor here.\n\n502\n00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.380\nLayer 5,\nwhat kind of protocol is this in Layer 5?\n\n503\n00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.930\nRemember, session layer.\n\n504\n00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:51.175\nAs we said, what layer?\n\n505\n00:23:51.175 --> 00:23:52.235\n>> Layer 5.\n\n506\n00:23:52.235 --> 00:23:56.577\n>> So today, remember on Sesame Street\nwriting the Electric Company?\n\n507\n00:23:56.577 --> 00:24:00.687\nToday's episode is brought to\nyou by letter A and number 5.\n\n508\n00:24:00.687 --> 00:24:01.693\n>> We're gonna have the Count come out.\n\n509\n00:24:01.693 --> 00:24:02.609\n>> Exactly, yeah, we can do all that.\n\n510\n00:24:02.609 --> 00:24:04.827\nSo what are five protocols?\n\n511\n00:24:04.827 --> 00:24:06.952\nSo we have PAP,\npassword authentication protocol.\n\n512\n00:24:06.952 --> 00:24:08.356\nAgain, an oldie but a goodie.\n\n513\n00:24:08.356 --> 00:24:11.270\nAlso, PPTP, Point to Point Tunneling\nProtocol, may be found there.\n\n514\n00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:15.100\nAnd one that you actually use on a regular\nbasis, but you may not think about.\n\n515\n00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.430\nRPC, remote procedure calls, are actually\nfound at layer five of the OSI model.\n\n516\n00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:20.320\nLayer six, the present.\n\n517\n00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.170\nPresentation layer.\n\n518\n00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:23.490\nWe're not so much concerned about\nprotocols here, because actually,\n\n519\n00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:25.160\nwe're not really dealing with protocols.\n\n520\n00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.200\nWe're dealing with structure,\nfunction, and formatting.\n\n521\n00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.080\nSo, we're dealing with things that\nare standards, like ASCII, and\n\n522\n00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.970\nEBCDIC, which is extended binary\ncoded decimal interchange code.\n\n523\n00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:36.940\nAlways get that one wrong.\n\n524\n00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.490\nSo, ASCII formatting, for instance, ASCII\ncharacter sets are gonna be dealt with and\n\n525\n00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.170\ndiscussed and figured out at layer six.\n\n526\n00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.070\nAt layer seven, the application layer,\n\n527\n00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:48.290\nwe do have a whole bunch of stuff\ngoing on as we've talked about.\n\n528\n00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:49.890\nWe got all sorts of functionality.\n\n529\n00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:52.820\nBut, we've got some surprising things that\nexisted though that you may not think of\n\n530\n00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.200\nas protocol slash services, but\nthey are both and they exist.\n\n531\n00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.470\nThings like DNS,\nDHCP are found at layer seven.\n\n532\n00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:01.910\nHTTP, classic web protocol.\n\n533\n00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:06.910\nAll of you are using that to be able to\ninteract with us SMTP, things like that,\n\n534\n00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:10.110\nLDAP, all of these things are gonna\nexist at this particular layer.\n\n535\n00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:13.330\nSo, wanna make sure we're thinking about\nthe kinds of things that may exist\n\n536\n00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.690\nat various layers of\nthe OSI model as well.\n\n537\n00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.880\nWhen we think about the OSI model,\nin other words, right,\n\n538\n00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:22.290\nwhat we're thinking about ultimately\nis the idea that we have to understand\n\n539\n00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:27.420\nthe logical way in which information\nis gonna be processed from the starting\n\n540\n00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.540\npoint, typically on the screen, let's say,\nin front of you at the application layer,\n\n541\n00:25:31.540 --> 00:25:34.050\nall the way through the functionality of\nall the things that have to happen in\n\n542\n00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.749\nthe computer to make that\ninformation manageable.\n\n543\n00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:42.150\nUltimately packetize it and make it\navailable, and then send it out remotely.\n\n544\n00:25:42.150 --> 00:25:45.450\nIt's a great video that if you have not\nwatched and I often give to my network\n\n545\n00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:49.690\nplus students, security plus students,\nwhen I teach classes in those areas.\n\n546\n00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:52.650\nI even use it with you'll all sorts\nof different classes that I do and\n\n547\n00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:54.490\nI do a lot of security work for\nvarious things.\n\n548\n00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:56.220\nI often use this video and refer to it,\n\n549\n00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:59.460\nyou may have seen it before it's called\nthe good warriors of the dot net.\n\n550\n00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:02.580\nIf you've never seen it it's actually\nreally cool as a matter of fact\n\n551\n00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.320\nMike's gonna google for\nus we're talking to you.\n\n552\n00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.950\nGood warriors of the dot.\n\n553\n00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:08.270\nAnd it is period, Mike, not dot.\n\n554\n00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:09.720\nSo, it's good warriors of the period net,\n\n555\n00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.840\nas in .Net framework,\ngood warriors of the .Net.\n\n556\n00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.870\nAnd if you go out and find this video,\nit's about a ten minute animated video,\n\n557\n00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:17.910\nit's made by Erickson Labs.\n\n558\n00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:19.020\nIt's really cool.\n\n559\n00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.470\nIt explains everything that we've\njust discussed about the OSI model,\n\n560\n00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:24.700\nlooking at the life of a data packet.\n\n561\n00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.430\nIt's a really neat little video.\n\n562\n00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:27.850\nAnd if you've never seen it before.\n\n563\n00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:28.350\n>> Network.\n\n564\n00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:32.840\n>> If you've never seen it before,\nthen it would be something for\n\n565\n00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.250\nyou to take a look at.\n\n566\n00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:38.260\nWhat we'll do is we'll make sure we put\nthe URL for it in the notes for you, so\n\n567\n00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.080\nthat you are actually able to find it.\n\n568\n00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.710\nWe're just having a little bit of trouble\nbringing it up right now, but no big deal.\n\n569\n00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:43.760\nRight?\nNo problem at all.\n\n570\n00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.010\nBut good warriors of the dot net,\ngreat video for you to go out and\n\n571\n00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.770\ntake a look at and for\nyou to at least be aware of,\n\n572\n00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:53.890\njust in terms of something that could help\nyou to frame this entire conversation.\n\n573\n00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:54.980\nBring it to life, if you will.\n\n574\n00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.840\nif you need just a little\nbit of that background,\n\n575\n00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.800\nright, with regards to everything,\nthen that's something that we'd want to\n\n576\n00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:03.700\nthink about and make sure that you have\nanother way to look at and consume.\n\n577\n00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.190\nAlright.\n>> Very good information Adam.\n\n578\n00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.670\nWe were looking at network security and\n\n579\n00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.050\ngetting some of that\nfundamental knowledge down.\n\n580\n00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:12.570\nIt's been a long time since some of\nus have gone through that OSI model,\n\n581\n00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:17.880\ncomparing it to the original TCPIP stack\nand listing all the different protocols\n\n582\n00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.910\nand applications and hardware devices\nthat exist at those different layers.\n\n583\n00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:23.170\nSo, thank you for that Adam.\n\n584\n00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:25.510\nRemember, if you want to attend\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n585\n00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:29.470\nshoot us an email at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n586\n00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:32.270\nFor now, signing off I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n587\n00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:32.970\nI'm Adam Gordon.\n\n588\n00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:34.370\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n589\n00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:35.661\nTake care.\n\n590\n00:27:35.661 -->

--> 00:00:17.410\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.340\nToday we're doing our CISSP content,\nand specifically,\n\n5\n00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.230\nwe're gonna be getting into\nIP networking and protocols.\n\n6\n00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.880\nWe've been looking at some foundational\nknowledge that's very important for\n\n7\n00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.060\nus to be able to properly secure our\nnetworks and secure our enterprise.\n\n8\n00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.620\nWe've gotta understand those basics,\n\n9\n00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.580\nas well as throwing in some\nmore advanced concepts.\n\n10\n00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.300\nAnd here to help us with all that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.221\nHow's it going, Adam?\n>> Good, good, very good.\n\n12\n00:00:42.221 --> 00:00:45.270\nSo we're gonna talk about IP\naddress a little bit here.\n\n13\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.690\nAnd we're gonna think about, and\n\n14\n00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.820\nthe good news is we're not\ngonna talk a lot about them.\n\n15\n00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.940\nSo when you tell people we're\ngonna talk about IP addresses,\n\n16\n00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.220\nthey start getting a little nervous,\noh my god, I have to subnet.\n\n17\n00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.351\nI have to figure out supernetting,\nclasses, Internet domain, routing.\n\n18\n00:00:56.351 --> 00:00:59.881\nWhat the hell's an IP address and\nall that kind of stuff, subnets, etc.\n\n19\n00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.900\nSo the good news is we're gonna\ndo a very high level on that,\n\n20\n00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.000\nthe bad news is if you need\nmore of that knowledge,\n\n21\n00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.260\nyou're not gonna get it in\nthis particular conversation.\n\n22\n00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.838\nIt is something we kind of assume,\nand I wanna be upfront with you and\n\n23\n00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.936\nmake sure you're comfortable\nwith this assumption.\n\n24\n00:01:13.936 --> 00:01:18.502\nWe assume that when you get to the level\nthat you would think about studying for,\n\n25\n00:01:18.502 --> 00:01:21.297\nultimately preparing for\nand taking the CISSP,\n\n26\n00:01:21.297 --> 00:01:24.320\nwe do have an experiential\nrequirements for CISSP.\n\n27\n00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.890\nYou have to have five years\nof experience across,\n\n28\n00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.290\nat least two of the eight domains\nin order to qualify to be a CISSP.\n\n29\n00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.770\nWe assume some prior knowledge.\n\n30\n00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.630\nOne of those things we assume is that\nyou understand the basic concepts\n\n31\n00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.410\nassociated with something\nlike what an IP address is.\n\n32\n00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.490\nWhy it's an IPV4 32-bit\naddress versus IPV6 128-bit?\n\n33\n00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.640\nWhat is a bit, how do we get 32-bits,\nwhy do we need to know them?\n\n34\n00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.920\nWhat are the value of the bits, how do\nyou subnet, what is a subnet address?\n\n35\n00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.320\nWe assume you have a sense\nof some of those things.\n\n36\n00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.940\nI also understand that not everybody does.\n\n37\n00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.590\nI get that.\n\n38\n00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.480\nSo I just want you to understand that\nwe're not gonna have that entire\n\n39\n00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.020\nconversation here.\n\n40\n00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.930\nYou certainly should go out and\npursue that information and\n\n41\n00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.220\nbe comfortable with it.\n\n42\n00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.790\nBut to be clear and to be fair,\nwhile we may ask you an IP address,\n\n43\n00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.330\na question here and there on an exam,\nthis is not a Cisco exam.\n\n44\n00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.660\nIt's not an Network Plus exam.\n\n45\n00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.130\nYou're not gonna be expected to do\nendless rounds of subnetting and\n\n46\n00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.370\nendless round of interpretation of IP\naddresses to understand how many hosts and\n\n47\n00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.350\nhow many networks you have and\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n48\n00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.560\nIt's not what this exam is structured for.\n\n49\n00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.420\nYou have 250 questions, some of those\nwill definitely deal with IP addresses.\n\n50\n00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.190\nI don't want you to be surprised, but\nit's gonna be a very small percentage.\n\n51\n00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.841\nSo this may be one of those things that\nif you're just not real good with,\n\n52\n00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:40.751\nyou're not comfortable with, and you're\nnot gonna investing time to get good\n\n53\n00:02:40.751 --> 00:02:43.634\nbefore the exam, that you may just say\nI'm not gonna answer those questions.\n\n54\n00:02:43.634 --> 00:02:44.865\nI may not know enough.\n\n55\n00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:47.950\nThere's a lot of other questions\nyou can answer and still do well.\n\n56\n00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.110\nYou need to get a 700 out of 1000 to\npass this exam or 70% mark correct.\n\n57\n00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.590\nYou do the math, 70% out of those\nnumber of questions you still have\n\n58\n00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.110\na certain number that you can miss.\n\n59\n00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.800\nSo I just want you to be aware of that\ngoing into our conversations here.\n\n60\n00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.880\nSo what we're going to do is talk\na little bit about network classes.\n\n61\n00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.331\nAnd we're gonna talk about the fact\nultimately, that the number of classes, as\n\n62\n00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:11.649\nyou can see on the screen in front of you,\nare going to allow us to structure, to\n\n63\n00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:16.246\nunderstand how IP addresses, specifically\nIPv4 addresses, are gonna be used.\n\n64\n00:03:16.246 --> 00:03:21.037\nWe're gonna talk about five network\nclasses or five address classes, rather,\n\n65\n00:03:21.037 --> 00:03:22.310\nA, B, C, D, and E.\n\n66\n00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.640\nAnd we're gonna talk about what occurs\nbased on the class designation,\n\n67\n00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.380\nin the middle column there,\nwith the first octet of the IP address.\n\n68\n00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.330\nSo if we imagine, and maybe,\nMike, down below the chart,\n\n69\n00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.920\nmaybe we can just type an IP\naddress there real quickly.\n\n70\n00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.710\nLet's just put in one for the first octet,\n\n71\n00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.410\nhit a period, and then maybe just\nput a dash for the remaining spaces.\n\n72\n00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.600\nLike an underscore maybe, so\nwe can see or differentiate that.\n\n73\n00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.410\nYeah, period, underscore,\nperiod, underscore, and\n\n74\n00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.560\nmaybe we can make it a little bigger.\n\n75\n00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.020\nMike will just blow that up for\nus for a second, so we can see that.\n\n76\n00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.270\nAnd you'll obviously see it\nat the right level there, so\n\n77\n00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.730\nyou can see what it looks like.\n\n78\n00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.770\nAnd so if we're talking about the first\noctet range, we're talking about what\n\n79\n00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.480\ngoes into that first box, or that\nnumerical area there with the number 1.\n\n80\n00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.030\nAnd so for Class A, we're talking about it\nbeing able to be anything from 1 to 126.\n\n81\n00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.140\nWe have some rules\nrelated to IP addresses.\n\n82\n00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.920\nThe first rule is that we\nnever start on a zero.\n\n83\n00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.525\nAnd we never start on a zero because\na zero implies no valid IP address,\n\n84\n00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:23.194\nin other words,\nwe're not able to send or receive.\n\n85\n00:04:23.194 --> 00:04:29.380\nWe don't also start on a 255 traditionally\nbecause that implies broadcast.\n\n86\n00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.181\nMeaning we're sending to everybody,\nnot having a unidirectional communication\n\n87\n00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:37.036\nbetween two known endpoints, but rather\na multi-partner communication, we're\n\n88\n00:04:37.036 --> 00:04:40.634\nbroadcasting to anybody and everybody\nthat maybe around and wants to hear us.\n\n89\n00:04:40.634 --> 00:04:43.761\nSo when we talk about the range for\nthe first octet with class A,\n\n90\n00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:47.910\nwe're talking about it being something\nin that first area there from 1 to 126.\n\n91\n00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.900\nThat's what we'll go into the first octet.\n\n92\n00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.789\nNow the second octet, class B.\n\n93\n00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.415\nExcuse me, not the second octet, but\nthe value rather, excuse me, for\n\n94\n00:04:56.415 --> 00:04:59.880\nthe first octet with Class B can\nalso anything from 128 to 191.\n\n95\n00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.280\nSo if it's a Class B address, it\n\n96\n00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.080\ncould be 128, 129, 130, 145,\n170, 190, all the way up to 191.\n\n97\n00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.190\nClass C will be anything from 192 to 223.\n\n98\n00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.809\nClass D is gonna be from 224 to 239,\nas you can see.\n\n99\n00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:19.637\nClass D is often used for multicasting,\n\n100\n00:05:19.637 --> 00:05:23.020\nso we typically refer to that as\nthe multicasting address range.\n\n101\n00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.260\nAnd then Class E is reserved,\nwe call that a reserved range.\n\n102\n00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.210\nYou can see the range\nthere is from 240 to 255.\n\n103\n00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.290\nSo one other thing we wanna talk\nabout quickly here before we actually\n\n104\n00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.570\nput some of the additional rules about\nIP addresses up on the screen for\n\n105\n00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.170\nyou, talk about the first one.\n\n106\n00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.670\nThat the first octet is\nnever gonna start on a 0,\n\n107\n00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.010\nnever start on a 255 because of\nlack of IP and broadcasting.\n\n108\n00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.050\nBut I wanna take notice of what's at the\nbottom of that chart down there quickly.\n\n109\n00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.340\nThe asterisk that says 127\nequals Loopback Adapter.\n\n110\n00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.910\nWe just wanna make sure we know that\nthe Loopback Adapter is gonna be the local\n\n111\n00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.750\ndiagnostics function on the network card\nto ensure the network card is plugged in,\n\n112\n00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.760\npowered on and working correctly.\n\n113\n00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.380\nWe often overlook it when we troubleshoot.\n\n114\n00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.150\nWe tend to ping an interface.\n\n115\n00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.120\nWe don't tend to ping\nthe Loopback Adapter.\n\n116\n00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.580\nBut the reality is you could.\n\n117\n00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.861\nThe address for\nthe Loopback Adapter is 127.0.0.1.\n\n118\n00:06:11.861 --> 00:06:16.130\nBut we actually reserve the entire\n127 address class block, and\n\n119\n00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.580\nwe don't use it for anything other\nthan this 127.0.0.1 address.\n\n120\n00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.050\nWe just kind of assume it's off limits,\nif you will.\n\n121\n00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.620\nCuz we don't really use it as\na networkable, or routable,\n\n122\n00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.060\nIP address range.\n\n123\n00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.480\nSo it does actually exist in Class A.\n\n124\n00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.410\nWe didn't put it up in the first\noctet range under Class A,\n\n125\n00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.120\nbecause we didn't want to confuse you.\n\n126\n00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.409\nBut reality is, 127 is considered part of\nthe Class A block, but it's a special,\n\n127\n00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:41.982\nwhat we call a set aside address,\nspecial address that's used just for\n\n128\n00:06:41.982 --> 00:06:43.192\ndiagnostic purposes.\n\n129\n00:06:43.192 --> 00:06:47.075\nSo what we're gonna do now is just quickly\nshow you what some of the remaining rules\n\n130\n00:06:47.075 --> 00:06:49.610\nfor IP addresses are that\nwe need to be aware of.\n\n131\n00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.270\nYou can see that Mike's gone ahead and\njust quickly pasted in a little\n\n132\n00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.480\nstatement there that modifies\nour IP address slightly.\n\n133\n00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.350\nAnd we show you that octet number two and\n\n134\n00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.480\noctet number three are essentially going\nto be able to be from 0 to 255, so\n\n135\n00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:10.130\noctets two and three can actually include\n0 and 255 in their address range.\n\n136\n00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.167\nAnd then octet number four, as you can\nsee at the bottom there, is going,\n\n137\n00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:17.766\nor rather on the right,\nis going to be anything from 1 to 254.\n\n138\n00:07:17.766 --> 00:07:21.366\nAgain, we don't want to end on a 0 or\nend on a 255,\n\n139\n00:07:21.366 --> 00:07:24.980\ntraditionally because that\ncauses problems for us.\n\n140\n00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.270\nIt implies either we don't have\na valid network address, and/or\n\n141\n00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.160\na rather valid IP address, generically,\nand/or that we may be broadcasting.\n\n142\n00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.760\nNow, while there may be\nsolutions where we can use 255,\n\n143\n00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.970\nwe're not really talking about them here.\n\n144\n00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.830\nWe're simply pointing\nout that traditionally,\n\n145\n00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.880\nwe refer to those as broadcast addresses.\n\n146\n00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.820\nThat's really all you need to\nbe concerned with right now.\n\n147\n00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.703\nThe other thing I just want to point out\nthere is the number of hosts on the table.\n\n148\n00:07:48.703 --> 00:07:50.653\nOff to the right third column,\n\n149\n00:07:50.653 --> 00:07:55.153\nwhat I want you to be aware of is that\nyou can see that as we go from Class A,\n\n150\n00:07:55.153 --> 00:07:59.301\nto Class B, to Class C,\nthe number of hosts drops dramatically.\n\n151\n00:07:59.301 --> 00:08:03.758\nAnd what we need to understand is,\nthat as we move from Class A to Class B,\n\n152\n00:08:03.758 --> 00:08:07.706\nwhat we're actually doing is\ntaking one octet, and using it for\n\n153\n00:08:07.706 --> 00:08:12.450\nthe first octet value in Class A,\nClass B, Class C, it doesn't matter.\n\n154\n00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.780\nWhatever that value is,\nis always in the first octet.\n\n155\n00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.500\nBut as we actually move into Class B,\nand we talk about a Class B address,\n\n156\n00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.350\nblock, we're actually taking two\noctets to actually represent Class B.\n\n157\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.250\nWhen we go to Class C,\nwe're actually taking three of the four\n\n158\n00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.470\noctets in the IP address\nto represent Class C.\n\n159\n00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.775\nSo what that means is that a 1.001\naddress is the first addressable or\n\n160\n00:08:34.775 --> 00:08:40.167\nusable address in the Class A address\nblock, but it takes 1 of the octets,\n\n161\n00:08:40.167 --> 00:08:44.959\n1 of the 4, to represent the network,\nthe Class A network of 1,\n\n162\n00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:49.777\nand 3 octets to represent the hosts,\n001, 002, 003.\n\n163\n00:08:49.777 --> 00:08:54.130\nThose are unique host identifiers within\nthe address block for the network.\n\n164\n00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.112\nThat's why we can have almost\n17 million approximately hosts,\n\n165\n00:08:58.112 --> 00:09:03.445\nbecause when you do 1001 all the way\nto 126255255254, if, in theory,\n\n166\n00:09:03.445 --> 00:09:08.208\nyou were to count all of those up, you\nwould ultimately wind up with close to 17\n\n167\n00:09:08.208 --> 00:09:13.147\nmillion individual, uniquely addressed\nhosts within all the Class A networks.\n\n168\n00:09:13.147 --> 00:09:18.816\nWell, when move to Class B and we say it's\n128.0, which is the first Class B network,\n\n169\n00:09:18.816 --> 00:09:22.840\n128.1 is the second one,\n128.2 is the third.\n\n170\n00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:28.054\nThe first host on the 128.0 network\nis the 01 host, then the 02 host,\n\n171\n00:09:28.054 --> 00:09:33.742\nthe 03 host etc., and if we were to go all\nthe way through that for all the networks,\n\n172\n00:09:33.742 --> 00:09:39.194\nwe get roughly about 65,534 so\nalmost approximately 66,000 hosts.\n\n173\n00:09:39.194 --> 00:09:44.243\nWhen we go to Class C we're taking three\nof the first four octets to B network\n\n174\n00:09:44.243 --> 00:09:49.228\nwhich means 19200 is the first\nnetwork in the Class C address block.\n\n175\n00:09:49.228 --> 00:09:54.570\n223, 255, 255 is the last network\nin the Class C address block.\n\n176\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.621\nSo what that means is\nthat the number of hosts\n\n177\n00:09:57.621 --> 00:10:02.251\nis only 254 because the last\noctet can only be from 1 to 254.\n\n178\n00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:05.300\nThat's the value range we've set\nas a rule for IP addressing.\n\n179\n00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:09.160\nSo as a result we have 254\nhosts per Class C network.\n\n180\n00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.020\nThat's why the number of hosts\ndrops dramatically because we're\n\n181\n00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.460\nincreasing the octets given to the network\n\n182\n00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.010\nat the expense of the octets\nthat are available for hosts.\n\n183\n00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.750\nAnd that's why we see that\nnumber going down in a very,\n\n184\n00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.260\nvery dramatic drop as they say.\n\n185\n00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.170\nSo we do just wanna be aware of that.\n\n186\n00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.400\nDo wanna be aware of that.\n\n187\n00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.760\nSo when we're thinking\nabout address classes,\n\n188\n00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.870\nwe have a lot of information that we have\nto remind ourselves of and be aware of.\n\n189\n00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.920\nWe have IP address classes,\nwe have IP address ranges for\n\n190\n00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.650\nthe first octet or multiple octets\ndepending on the class range, and\n\n191\n00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:42.910\nthen we have a set of rules that govern\nwhat values go into those octets.\n\n192\n00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.590\nAnd as a result will then be able to\nshow us what kind of addresses we have\n\n193\n00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.360\nin terms of how many addresses\noctet as a part network and\n\n194\n00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.480\nhow many are gonna be\nassociated with the host.\n\n195\n00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.400\nRemember, the subnet mask ultimately\nhelps us to figure that out and\n\n196\n00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.790\nidentifies that for us.\n\n197\n00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.760\nThat's the role of the subnet mask.\n\n198\n00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.180\nWe also need to talk quickly\nabout IPv6 addresses,\n\n199\n00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.480\nwhat we wanna do is just quickly show you\nthe difference between IPv4 and IPv6.\n\n200\n00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.170\nAnd so, we wanna be able to see, and on\nthe screen in front of us we can do that.\n\n201\n00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.520\nWe can see an IPv4 address\nversus an IPv6 address.\n\n202\n00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.430\nMike is gonna just highlight those for us.\n\n203\n00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.530\nAnd I'm just gonna ask Mike quickly to\nnarrate because I just, unfortunately,\n\n204\n00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.390\nI can't see the actual because\nthe background color is exactly what\n\n205\n00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.230\nhe's highlighting.\n\n206\n00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.080\nLooks like an IPv4 address.\n\n207\n00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.997\n>> IPv4 current.\n\n208\n00:11:21.997 --> 00:11:22.681\n>> But I can't read it.\n\n209\n00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:24.105\nSo Mike's gonna quickly just narrate and\n\n210\n00:11:24.105 --> 00:11:26.320\ntell us what he what we're looking\nat there for just a minute.\n\n211\n00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.090\n>> Correct so\nit's an IP config on a Windows machine.\n\n212\n00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.780\nMy IPv4 address listed here.\n\n213\n00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.220\nYou see the four octets filled in.\n\n214\n00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.405\nI've got a Class C address.\n\n215\n00:11:35.405 --> 00:11:40.830\nSo 192.168 238.140 right\nabove that address you\n\n216\n00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:46.360\nwill see an IPv6 address and\nI'll highlight that there for you.\n\n217\n00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:48.591\nScroll over and grab that.\n\n218\n00:11:48.591 --> 00:11:51.343\nSo there's my IPv6 address.\n\n219\n00:11:51.343 --> 00:11:55.470\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> It's a new class of IP addresses.\n\n220\n00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.460\n>> We got the reindeer coming in\nit's Christmas time and all that.\n\n221\n00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:02.200\nAlso down at the bottom you can see\nI have a tunnel adapter, a adapter.\n\n222\n00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.689\nAlso has an IPv6 address\nassociated with it.\n\n223\n00:12:05.689 --> 00:12:08.625\nNow, what is interesting what\nyou'll just notice and Mike,\n\n224\n00:12:08.625 --> 00:12:10.890\nI think it's still\nhighlighted in that piece.\n\n225\n00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.712\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> So what we see there if you'll notice\n\n226\n00:12:14.712 --> 00:12:19.352\nis that the IPv6 address looks\nstructurally different than the IPv4.\n\n227\n00:12:19.352 --> 00:12:24.542\nThe IPv4 address is 32 bits,\nthe IPv6 is going to be 128 bits.\n\n228\n00:12:24.542 --> 00:12:25.818\n>> We're gonna bump that\nup just a little bit.\n\n229\n00:12:25.818 --> 00:12:26.373\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Okay,\n\n230\n00:12:26.373 --> 00:12:27.675\nno problem just make it\na little bigger for you.\n\n231\n00:12:27.675 --> 00:12:29.010\nGreat that will be good to see.\n\n232\n00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:30.206\nBecause I'm squinting and\n\n233\n00:12:30.206 --> 00:12:33.642\nI still [LAUGH] can't see from where I'm\nstaring on the monitor across from us.\n\n234\n00:12:33.642 --> 00:12:35.887\nSo that's a little bit better so\n\n235\n00:12:35.887 --> 00:12:40.805\nwhat we can see now is that ultimately\nthe IPv6 address, there we go.\n\n236\n00:12:40.805 --> 00:12:44.580\nThe IPv6 address is going to\nhave a different structure.\n\n237\n00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.230\nIt's an alpha numeric string.\n\n238\n00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.350\nActually you got some special\ncharacters thrown in there, as well.\n\n239\n00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.890\nYou got a percent sign\nsitting off to the side.\n\n240\n00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:55.329\nOn the far end, and we've got a set of\ncolons as opposed to individual decimals\n\n241\n00:12:55.329 --> 00:12:59.579\nrepresenting the breaks for the octete,\nso it's now 128 bit address.\n\n242\n00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:02.511\nSo we do just wanna understand and\njust be aware of that and\n\n243\n00:13:02.511 --> 00:13:05.700\nfocus on that quickly as well\nwhen we're talking about both.\n\n244\n00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.722\nVery good.\n\n245\n00:13:06.722 --> 00:13:10.670\nThankful to Mike and thanks for\nhelping us out with that.\n\n246\n00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.472\nIt's always good when you can rely on\na little help from your friends as\n\n247\n00:13:13.472 --> 00:13:15.480\nJoe Cocker and\nThe Beatles has told us many times.\n\n248\n00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.191\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n249\n00:13:16.191 --> 00:13:17.735\nwhat we think about different protocols?\n\n250\n00:13:17.735 --> 00:13:20.974\nWhat we're thinking about obviously\nwe've talked about a little bit already.\n\n251\n00:13:20.974 --> 00:13:24.959\nTCP, talking about IP,\nthe Transmission Control Protocol,\n\n252\n00:13:24.959 --> 00:13:28.580\nremember send and acknowledge,\nUDP, send and forget.\n\n253\n00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.600\nSo we're thinking about\nthose protocols here.\n\n254\n00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.320\nSo TCP and\nUDP are gonna be common protocols, but\n\n255\n00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.770\nwe also have to link those\nto something known as ports.\n\n256\n00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.487\nAnd ports are gonna be important for us,\n\n257\n00:13:37.487 --> 00:13:40.840\nbecause ports are where we're gonna\nlogically, again, quote unquote.\n\n258\n00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.610\nWe use air quotes for that.\n\n259\n00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.002\nRemember join me, air quotes are fun.\n\n260\n00:13:44.002 --> 00:13:46.191\n>> [SOUND]\n>> We're going to plugin and\n\n261\n00:13:46.191 --> 00:13:50.103\nwhen we plugin what we're really talking\nabout is accessing a service and\n\n262\n00:13:50.103 --> 00:13:53.511\na function in the system through\na port number, a designation,\n\n263\n00:13:53.511 --> 00:13:57.505\nthat the networking stack, the protocol\nstack, makes available for us.\n\n264\n00:13:57.505 --> 00:14:04.150\nWe have 65,535 ports virtually\navailable in every system in the world.\n\n265\n00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.240\nWhether it's a Linux system, Unix system,\n\n266\n00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.880\nWindows system, every computer\nhas ports associated with it.\n\n267\n00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.677\nThis is how networking and services and\n\n268\n00:14:11.677 --> 00:14:15.821\napplications are able to communicate with\nother networks, applications and services.\n\n269\n00:14:15.821 --> 00:14:18.601\nSo ports are available in all systems,\n\n270\n00:14:18.601 --> 00:14:22.620\nany device that uses IP has\nports associated with it.\n\n271\n00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.230\nAs part of its networking stack.\n\n272\n00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.234\nThere are 65,535 of them.\n\n273\n00:14:26.234 --> 00:14:28.915\nYou don't turn your computer over,\nthis would be really cool if you could.\n\n274\n00:14:28.915 --> 00:14:30.842\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You don't turn your computer over,\n\n275\n00:14:30.842 --> 00:14:32.755\npick it up,\nlook at the back of the device and go,\n\n276\n00:14:32.755 --> 00:14:34.650\nlook there's a whole\nlittle set of dots there.\n\n277\n00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:39.070\nI'm gonna find number 22 and plug into\nthat one, or number 21 or whatever it is.\n\n278\n00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:39.880\nIt doesn't work that way.\n\n279\n00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.490\nThese are logical, they are not real.\n\n280\n00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:43.580\nThey are virtual in the sense\nthat they exist, but\n\n281\n00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.280\nwe don't really interact\nwith them directly.\n\n282\n00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.580\nBut they are mapped and\nwe have to understand what they are.\n\n283\n00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.520\nThere are three categories of\nports that you should be aware of.\n\n284\n00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.905\nThey're what's known as well-known ports,\nfrom 0 to 1,023.\n\n285\n00:14:53.905 --> 00:14:56.714\nThat is the range for well-known ports.\n\n286\n00:14:56.714 --> 00:15:01.617\nMost of the protocols we talk about\nare in that range, so HTTP is refer to\n\n287\n00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:06.625\nas the web protocol, protocol of\nthe World Wide Web, that is port 80.\n\n288\n00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:09.051\nHTTPS port 443.\n\n289\n00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:12.497\nWhen we think about DNS as a service,\nit's not a protocol but\n\n290\n00:15:12.497 --> 00:15:16.220\nit's a service,\nDNS uses a well-known port, as well.\n\n291\n00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.720\nWe know what DNS uses?\n\n292\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.929\nAnybody, anybody?\n>> 53.\n\n293\n00:15:18.929 --> 00:15:21.040\n>> I'm gonna give you a hint and uses.\n\n294\n00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.180\nOne second,\nprops are always very important.\n\n295\n00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.890\nIt uses a port that begins with.\n\n296\n00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:25.580\n>> Wait, I don't have a pen.\n\n297\n00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:26.654\n>> I know you don't have\nthe other one right.\n\n298\n00:15:26.654 --> 00:15:28.151\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> With the number 5.\n\n299\n00:15:28.151 --> 00:15:30.265\nThis session is brought\nto you by the number 5.\n\n300\n00:15:30.265 --> 00:15:33.583\nSo it uses a port associated\nwith the number five.\n\n301\n00:15:33.583 --> 00:15:34.361\nDoes anybody know?\n\n302\n00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:37.588\nIf you don't know, I'm not gonna tell you,\ncuz you should know.\n\n303\n00:15:37.588 --> 00:15:39.109\nIts port 53.\n\n304\n00:15:39.109 --> 00:15:41.640\nSo make sure you know\nthat DNS runs on port 53.\n\n305\n00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:45.530\nSo well-known ports are gonna be\nin the first 0 to 1,023 range.\n\n306\n00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:50.303\nRegistered ports from 1,024 to 49,151.\n\n307\n00:15:50.303 --> 00:15:54.908\nSupports that are in that range are\nregistered, meaning somebody, some entity,\n\n308\n00:15:54.908 --> 00:15:59.602\nsome software company, something has gone\nout and said, I'm gonna use this port.\n\n309\n00:15:59.602 --> 00:16:02.190\nAnd they've mapped it to their\nsoftware and that's what's used.\n\n310\n00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.383\nCan it be used by you if it's\nnot in use by something else?\n\n311\n00:16:05.383 --> 00:16:08.413\nIt could be, but the problem is, you may\nrun into a problem on the other side\n\n312\n00:16:08.413 --> 00:16:11.590\nsomewhere, because something else may be\nusing that and may not be using it for\n\n313\n00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.300\nthe same thing that you're using it for.\n\n314\n00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.520\nSo that can prove to be\na bit of a challenge.\n\n315\n00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.186\nAnd then dynamic or private ports, this\nis where you go to just randomly select\n\n316\n00:16:20.186 --> 00:16:24.498\na port if you wanna randomize and\nuse a port that's not normally in use for\n\n317\n00:16:24.498 --> 00:16:28.195\nanything else,\nwill be from 49,152 to 65,535.\n\n318\n00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:32.260\nSo we wanna make sure we know\nthe three standard port categories.\n\n319\n00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.380\nWell known, registered, and dynamic.\n\n320\n00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.510\nKnow the numbers,\nthe ranges associated with them.\n\n321\n00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.700\nWill be very important for\nyou to be aware of that.\n\n322\n00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.130\nWe've talked about UDP and TCP.\n\n323\n00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:44.187\nWe've talked about the different\nkinds of ports that exist.\n\n324\n00:16:44.187 --> 00:16:48.388\nWe also want to talk about things\nlike networks such as internets,\n\n325\n00:16:48.388 --> 00:16:53.116\nintranets, extranets, a lot of times\ntoday we're calling extranets and\n\n326\n00:16:53.116 --> 00:16:55.500\nintranets and internet the cloud.\n\n327\n00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.530\nThis has become the new marketing mantra\n\n328\n00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.440\nthat somebody somewhere\nhas come up with right?\n\n329\n00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.510\nA traditional old school\nway of thinking about this,\n\n330\n00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:07.150\nthe internet is the largest private cloud\nwe have, or the world wide web internet.\n\n331\n00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.102\nIt's the largest private,\n\n332\n00:17:08.102 --> 00:17:12.070\nexcuse me, I said private, largest public\ncloud example we have in the world today.\n\n333\n00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:15.252\nAnd internet is just gonna be an outside\nuntrusted network traditionally.\n\n334\n00:17:15.252 --> 00:17:18.286\nAn intranet is an internal\nprivate network that's trusted,\n\n335\n00:17:18.286 --> 00:17:20.926\nthis would be an example of\na private cloud in theory.\n\n336\n00:17:20.926 --> 00:17:24.370\nAnd an extranet is an outside\nsemi trusted network.\n\n337\n00:17:24.370 --> 00:17:26.100\nOne that runs on the outside network, but\n\n338\n00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:28.900\nis gonna require log on and\nauthentication, in effect for\n\n339\n00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.740\nyou to be able to get in and\nuse, something like that.\n\n340\n00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.840\nSo, older ways of referring to more\nmodern thought processes around cloud,\n\n341\n00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.892\nand some of the cloud networks we see.\n\n342\n00:17:37.892 --> 00:17:40.340\nWe wanna think also about the fact\nthat a lot of the protocols,\n\n343\n00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.550\na lot of the services that run in\nnetworks may have compromises, and\n\n344\n00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.900\nprotocols are only as secure\nas we implement them.\n\n345\n00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.590\nAnd they may have issues\nassociated with them.\n\n346\n00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.230\nFor instance, DHCP can be compromised.\n\n347\n00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:55.230\nSomebody can set up a rogue DHCP server\nand if we don't authenticate our DHCP\n\n348\n00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.040\nservers, we don't lock them down,\nwe may be able to give out addresses\n\n349\n00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:03.490\nin a different address range and redirect\nclients or hosts into a different network.\n\n350\n00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.670\nIf we're not paying attention to that,\nthat could be one thing that goes on.\n\n351\n00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:09.100\nWe may have trace route\nexploitation taking place,\n\n352\n00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.820\nwhere effectively we can\nuse trace route as a tool.\n\n353\n00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.550\nSometimes people call this tracerts,\nbut it's generically trace route.\n\n354\n00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:19.020\nAnd we can use that tool,\nwhich is an extended ping tool.\n\n355\n00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:21.730\nPing really just gives you back\nsome very basic information.\n\n356\n00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:25.000\nTrace route gives you diagnostic\ninformation per hop all the way\n\n357\n00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.500\nthrough the path, so\nit's an extended ping.\n\n358\n00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.370\nAnd we can use trace route\nto be able to diagnose, but\n\n359\n00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.710\nwe could also use it to map networks.\n\n360\n00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.840\nAnd so we may be able to use trace\nroute exploitation techniques\n\n361\n00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.600\nto be able to map networks, and\nfigure out how to then fingerprint and\n\n362\n00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.010\nultimately exploit systems.\n\n363\n00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:43.370\nSo, there's lots of different things that\ncan go on with protocols and services.\n\n364\n00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:46.700\nAnd we have to be aware of these and\nreally understand what they are as well.\n\n365\n00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.220\nWe have a bunch of directory services.\n\n366\n00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.090\nWanna think about these and\njust be aware of them and\n\n367\n00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:52.640\nmake sure we are thinking\nabout what they may be.\n\n368\n00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.350\nWe have DNS's directory services, Go.\n\n369\n00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:57.220\nDNS is probably the most important\n\n370\n00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:04.280\nadditional capability of service that we\nadd in with regards to protocol services,\n\n371\n00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.610\nand specifically LDAP or\ndirectory-based services.\n\n372\n00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.620\nWe don't often think about DNS\nperhaps in the same light.\n\n373\n00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:10.880\nAnd in the same breath.\n\n374\n00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.340\nWhen we say, directory services,\n\n375\n00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.400\nwe often think LDAP, Active Directory,\nthings of that nature.\n\n376\n00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.020\nBut the reality is without DNS, you've got\nno way to use a directory service cuz we\n\n377\n00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.730\nhave no way to do name resolution.\n\n378\n00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:24.505\nNow without name resolution to look ups,\nto find things like service records,\n\n379\n00:19:24.505 --> 00:19:26.565\nthings of that nature, it's impossible for\n\n380\n00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:28.855\nus to actually make use\nof the LDAP directory.\n\n381\n00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:32.605\nSo we do wanna make sure we think about\nDNS with regards to directory services but\n\n382\n00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:34.167\nLDAP certainly is there.\n\n383\n00:19:34.167 --> 00:19:36.597\nWe may have NIS,\nNetwork Information Service,\n\n384\n00:19:36.597 --> 00:19:40.277\nNIS Plus, later versions of\nthe Network Information Service, or\n\n385\n00:19:40.277 --> 00:19:44.467\nanother directory solution that may not be\nWindows-based for the active directory,\n\n386\n00:19:44.467 --> 00:19:48.570\nbut LDAP and certainly open LDAP\nare all examples of directory services.\n\n387\n00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.860\nAn oldie but a goodie, that isn't really\nused much anymore, is specific and\n\n388\n00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.880\nproprietary to Windows, NetBIOS.\n\n389\n00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:55.120\nPeople often leave that one off and\n\n390\n00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.520\ndon't think about the fact that\nNetBIOS was actually the original\n\n391\n00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.460\nWindows directory service solution\nbefore we had the Active Directory.\n\n392\n00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.280\nBefore Microsoft went out and figured out\nhow to create the Active Directory, and\n\n393\n00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.820\nto use something, was very similar\nto Novella's directory tree.\n\n394\n00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.510\nThe idea is that we had Net BIOS for\nname resolution.\n\n395\n00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:15.290\nSo it would've been a different\nway of doing things, but it still\n\n396\n00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.840\nallowed us to effectively centrally\nmanage and understand how to find and\n\n397\n00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.700\nresolve resources, hosts, on a network,\nand to do that through look-ups.\n\n398\n00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.780\nWith Wins, if you were doing it\nin Microsoft in Windows, but\n\n399\n00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.900\nyou would have done host lookups.\n\n400\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.280\nYou would have done NetBIOS name lookups,\nin other words.\n\n401\n00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:30.000\nWe can think about FTP.\n\n402\n00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.850\nFTP, file transfer protocol.\n\n403\n00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.490\nThis is gonna be a protocol that's\nused traditionally to move large\n\n404\n00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.840\namounts of files, large amounts\nof information between systems.\n\n405\n00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.980\nIt is a stateful protocol.\n\n406\n00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.890\nIt allows us to connect the host\nto a server to be able to transmit\n\n407\n00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.260\ninformation back and forth.\n\n408\n00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.330\nBut it may not be secure.\n\n409\n00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.390\nYou have to keep in mind the fact that FTP\ntraditionally is anonymously accessed.\n\n410\n00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.980\nYou may make it secure,\nyou may require authentication.\n\n411\n00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.240\nBut the traditional way\nFTP may be installed and\n\n412\n00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.640\nused, is that it may be anonymous.\n\n413\n00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.290\nSo it may not be the best solution,\ndepending on what we're doing.\n\n414\n00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.480\nWe also have things like TFTP,\ntrivial file transfer protocol.\n\n415\n00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.800\nSometimes referred to as FTP light\nwhich is effectively gonna give us\n\n416\n00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.120\nthe capability to run FTP but\nwith as much overhead and\n\n417\n00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.650\nnot with as much of the constraints\nthat FTP provides and uses.\n\n418\n00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:16.080\nSo we tend to use TFTP to upload images,\nthings like iOS images to routers for\n\n419\n00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.740\ninstance, are TFTPed up or TFTPed down.\n\n420\n00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.750\nWe may use TFTP to drive desktop imaging.\n\n421\n00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.660\nMay connect to a TFTP server and\ndownload an image, for instance,\n\n422\n00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.540\nright, things like that.\n\n423\n00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.160\nSo there's no authentication or\nencryption.\n\n424\n00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.840\nThere really is only the ability to use\nthat in trusted networks where there's\n\n425\n00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.480\nreally low latency.\n\n426\n00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:36.540\nSo you're gonna use it, it's a wide open\nprotocol when it's deployed as TFTP.\n\n427\n00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.860\nWe really only wanna do that when we're\nsure nobody's gonna snoop on the wire and\n\n428\n00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.650\npotentially get our passwords and\nusernames.\n\n429\n00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.210\nSo important to think about that.\n\n430\n00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.810\nWe've talked about http.\n\n431\n00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.860\nTalked about https.\n\n432\n00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:49.600\nWhat about things like SCADA and\nICS systems?\n\n433\n00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.570\nWe talked about ICS, Industrial Control,\n\n434\n00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:55.158\nin one of our other conversations on\nsystems engineering and that domain.\n\n435\n00:21:55.158 --> 00:21:58.650\nI mentioned SCADA in that regard as well,\nsupervisory control and\n\n436\n00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:02.960\ndata acquisition, is what SCADA is\nrepresenting as or stands for, SCADA\n\n437\n00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.060\nsystems are also very important because\nthey use a specific set of protocols.\n\n438\n00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.220\nThey use what are known as DNP3 protocols,\ndistributed network protocol.\n\n439\n00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.870\nCommonly version 3 so we call it DNP3.\n\n440\n00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.890\nThis is a common SCADA protocol but\n\n441\n00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.780\nthe problem is, it has no security\nfeatures built in whatsoever.\n\n442\n00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.470\nNo authentication, no encryption,\nwe send stuff on the wire, and\n\n443\n00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.330\nwe just assume that nobody's gonna see it,\n\n444\n00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.260\nbecause traditionally these networks have\nnever been hooked up to the internet,\n\n445\n00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.970\nthey've never really been IP\nenabled to the outside world.\n\n446\n00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.350\nBut that's changing.\n\n447\n00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.617\nBecause now we're monitoring\nthese things from far away,\n\n448\n00:22:33.617 --> 00:22:35.120\nwe're doing a lot with them.\n\n449\n00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.762\nThe fact that we now open these networks\nup and these protocols were never designed\n\n450\n00:22:38.762 --> 00:22:42.507\nto be used on open networks, in the sense\nthat people can now see what's happening,\n\n451\n00:22:42.507 --> 00:22:44.708\nis a source of great concern and\ncomplications.\n\n452\n00:22:44.708 --> 00:22:48.150\nSo we just wanna be aware of that and\nthink about these kinds of things as well.\n\n453\n00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:51.270\nWe also have storage networks and\nstorage protocols we have to consider.\n\n454\n00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.708\nThings like fiber channel over ethernet,\nor FCOE, or\n\n455\n00:22:53.708 --> 00:22:55.535\njust fiber channel generically.\n\n456\n00:22:55.535 --> 00:22:56.955\nThings like iSCSI, right,\n\n457\n00:22:56.955 --> 00:22:59.625\nbeing able to understand that\nthese are both storage protocols.\n\n458\n00:22:59.625 --> 00:23:00.895\nFor instance, in fiber channel and\n\n459\n00:23:00.895 --> 00:23:04.075\niSCSI people often talk\nabout them as storage types.\n\n460\n00:23:04.075 --> 00:23:07.065\nThey often misrepresent them and don't\nrealize that they actually are storage\n\n461\n00:23:07.065 --> 00:23:10.665\nprotocols as well and so we have to\nthink about those and how they're used.\n\n462\n00:23:10.665 --> 00:23:13.265\niSCSIs probably the most common\nstorage protocol in use today on\n\n463\n00:23:13.265 --> 00:23:14.455\nthe planet, right.\n\n464\n00:23:14.455 --> 00:23:15.765\nSo if you don't understand it,\n\n465\n00:23:15.765 --> 00:23:19.000\ndon't know how to secure it, then you may\nhave a problem in your storage networks,\n\n466\n00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.880\nthere may be something you\nwanna think about there.\n\n467\n00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.160\nYou may be able to use CHAP\nauthentication on your iSCSI connections,\n\n468\n00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.870\non your endpoints for instance,\nto drive authentication and\n\n469\n00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.410\nprovide a layer of security with iSCSI.\n\n470\n00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.840\nSo it's something to consider.\n\n471\n00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.180\nFiber channel over ethernet,\n\n472\n00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.790\nFCOE, is gonna typically only\nbe used in the data center.\n\n473\n00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:41.230\nIt's gonna be really what we call a short\nhall protocol, meaning it can only be used\n\n474\n00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:44.750\nover a very small distances about 100\nfeet, maybe 200 to 300 feet at the most.\n\n475\n00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:47.180\nIt's not really meant for\nlong distance transmission.\n\n476\n00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.869\nAnd we use it with what is known as DCB,\nData Center Bridging protocols and\n\n477\n00:23:50.869 --> 00:23:52.788\nData Center Bridging capabilities.\n\n478\n00:23:52.788 --> 00:23:57.007\nBe able to use it on the back plane with\nspecial what we call fiber interconnects,\n\n479\n00:23:57.007 --> 00:23:58.010\nspecial cabling.\n\n480\n00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.342\nTo be able to transmit data over fiber\nchannel, or fiber channel over ethernet,\n\n481\n00:24:01.342 --> 00:24:03.061\ndepending on the version you're using.\n\n482\n00:24:03.061 --> 00:24:05.848\nAs a result of that it's\na very fast protocol.\n\n483\n00:24:05.848 --> 00:24:10.016\nIt allows for speeds up to 40 gigabytes\ntoday, and potentially 100 gigabytes and\n\n484\n00:24:10.016 --> 00:24:12.140\nbeyond in the coming months and years.\n\n485\n00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:15.950\nVery shortly after the 40\ngig standard was announced,\n\n486\n00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:18.350\nthey've already announced that they're\nworking on 100 gig standards for that.\n\n487\n00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:23.040\nSo reality is that we have very fast\nspeeds on the back plane for storage, but\n\n488\n00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.590\nover very small distances.\n\n489\n00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:27.320\nHow do we transmit securely on those\nnetworks is also a challenge for\n\n490\n00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.930\nus and something else we have to\nthink about and be concerned about.\n\n491\n00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.740\nAnother good one to be aware of,\nanother good one to think about,\n\n492\n00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:34.560\nMPLS, Multiprotocol Label Switching.\n\n493\n00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.055\nAnother real popular one today in\nparticular with regards to how we route\n\n494\n00:24:38.055 --> 00:24:38.604\ntraffic.\n\n495\n00:24:38.604 --> 00:24:41.550\nWell, MPLS is kind of interesting,\ndo we have a minute or so\n\n496\n00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.180\nto talk about MPLS, Mike?\n\n497\n00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.370\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Are you gonna help me\n\n498\n00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.980\ntalk about MPLS Mike?\n\n499\n00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:44.860\n>> Absolutely not.\n\n500\n00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.065\n>> Absolutely not, okay.\n\n501\n00:24:46.065 --> 00:24:46.830\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just wanna check,\n\n502\n00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.600\nyou never know, right?\n\n503\n00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.290\nMike's kinda bored,\n\n504\n00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.340\nhe's standing over there look\nlike he doesn't have much to do.\n\n505\n00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.170\nThought I'd give him an opportunity,\nbut obviously one that will be lost.\n\n506\n00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:54.540\nSo let's talk about MPLS.\n\n507\n00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:58.190\nSo, with regards to how we normally will\nroute traffic, and I know Mike certainly\n\n508\n00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.730\ncan help me understand this part\nof the conversation, right?\n\n509\n00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.870\nSo, when we think about routing,\n\n510\n00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:06.060\nwhat we traditionally do is we're\ngonna be able to exchange information.\n\n511\n00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:08.540\nMaybe we can just quickly show\nboth of us cuz I wanna just do\n\n512\n00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:09.300\na quick-\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n513\n00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:11.040\n>> Visual between Mike and I together.\n\n514\n00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.930\nSo if we're going to exchange something,\nright?\n\n515\n00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:16.150\nLet's just say hypothetically we're gonna\nexchange this piece of paper, right?\n\n516\n00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:18.070\nIt really doesn't matter what it's on,\njust this piece of paper.\n\n517\n00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.153\nIt's number five, by the way, right?\n\n518\n00:25:19.153 --> 00:25:20.271\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we're gonna send this\n\n519\n00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:20.850\npiece of paper.\n\n520\n00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.760\nIf I want to route this piece of\npaper between myself and Mike.\n\n521\n00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.470\nI, let's say I'm one router,\nrouter A, Mike is gonna be router B,\n\n522\n00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:30.330\nif I want to send it, then somebody\non the far side of this router,\n\n523\n00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:34.890\non my side, on the LAN has transmitted\nthis to me, I'm the gateway, right?\n\n524\n00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:38.709\nAnd so I've moved it from the LAN side of\nthe gateway, so I've taken it from this\n\n525\n00:25:38.709 --> 00:25:42.430\nside, from the LAN side, over to the WAN\nside, between Mike and I is the WAN.\n\n526\n00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:46.640\nAnd now I'm gonna transmit this over\nthe WAN from my router to Mike's.\n\n527\n00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.900\nWe call this a hop, right,\nthis is what we call.\n\n528\n00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.072\nSo we're gonna hop this data over to Mike.\n\n529\n00:25:51.072 --> 00:25:54.740\nMike's gonna receive it on the WAN\nside of his routed interface and\n\n530\n00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:58.637\nMike's gonna examine that packet and\nunderstand, two things about.\n\n531\n00:25:58.637 --> 00:26:00.995\nHe's gonna look for an address,\nand he's gonna see whether or\n\n532\n00:26:00.995 --> 00:26:03.585\nnot that address is something\nthat is known to him.\n\n533\n00:26:03.585 --> 00:26:06.915\nHe has a routing table, so in that\nrouting table because he's a router\n\n534\n00:26:06.915 --> 00:26:09.485\nhe's gonna look for\nIP addresses or Mac addresses.\n\n535\n00:26:09.485 --> 00:26:11.774\nWhat do we look for\nin routers with routing tables?\n\n536\n00:26:11.774 --> 00:26:13.602\n>> IP.\nIP addresses, right?\n\n537\n00:26:13.602 --> 00:26:17.512\nSo we're gonna look for a routing\nIP address that is known to Mike.\n\n538\n00:26:17.512 --> 00:26:19.142\nIf Mike has that in his router,\n\n539\n00:26:19.142 --> 00:26:23.072\nin his routing table, he knows that\nthat packet is local, it belongs to him.\n\n540\n00:26:23.072 --> 00:26:25.342\nSo not to him specifically,\nbut somebody behind him.\n\n541\n00:26:25.342 --> 00:26:28.182\nSo he'll move back to the LAN side and\nhe'll transmit and\n\n542\n00:26:28.182 --> 00:26:30.570\nsend it off into the local area network.\n\n543\n00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:34.580\nIf it is not known to him,\nif it's not in his routing IP table,\n\n544\n00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.980\nhe's gonna take that packet and\nhe's gonna hop it to the next router\n\n545\n00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:41.460\nthat he knows how to connect to, cuz\nrouters know how to do only two things.\n\n546\n00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.910\nThey know how to either deliver locally\nbased on routing table match, or\n\n547\n00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:48.445\nthey know how to deliver to the next hop,\nwhatever their next distant router is.\n\n548\n00:26:48.445 --> 00:26:52.390\nIt's the only two things routers\nknow how to do, is very simple but\n\n549\n00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:53.328\nvery effective system.\n\n550\n00:26:53.328 --> 00:26:57.800\nBut here is the problem, right, so when\nwe deliver back and forth that's good.\n\n551\n00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:02.006\nBut in this process every router that\ntouches the packet all the way through all\n\n552\n00:27:02.006 --> 00:27:05.637\nthe hops all the way up to maybe 30\nhops down the line has to read that\n\n553\n00:27:05.637 --> 00:27:08.336\npacket address has to\nexamine its routing table.\n\n554\n00:27:08.336 --> 00:27:10.950\nHas to figure out whether it knows\nhow to deliver that packet and\n\n555\n00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:12.910\nif it doesn't what it has to do with it.\n\n556\n00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:17.220\nThis takes time, and if we multiply that\nby multiple hops over time, that's gonna\n\n557\n00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.020\nbecome a significant amount of time that\nwe delay the transmission of the data.\n\n558\n00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:24.452\nSo instead we come up with\nsomething known as MPLS right?\n\n559\n00:27:24.452 --> 00:27:29.270\nMPLS, multiprotocol label switching is\nactually kinda cool, because what MPLS\n\n560\n00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:32.420\ndoes, we're gonna go back to\nthe graphic here for just a second.\n\n561\n00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.770\nWhat MPLS does, is it takes the packet\nthat's initially sent to me,\n\n562\n00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.350\nthe first router, remember,\nI'm the first router.\n\n563\n00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:41.831\nAnd what I'm gonna do with the packet,\ninstead of what I just traditionally did,\n\n564\n00:27:41.831 --> 00:27:42.544\nis to follow it.\n\n565\n00:27:42.544 --> 00:27:46.523\nI'm gonna put a label on this\npacket that says deliver to\n\n566\n00:27:46.523 --> 00:27:49.241\nMike at IP address whatever, right?\n\n567\n00:27:49.241 --> 00:27:50.444\nAnd when I do that,\n\n568\n00:27:50.444 --> 00:27:56.040\nwhat's gonna happen is that we're gonna\nput this label on the front of the packet.\n\n569\n00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.270\nAnd instead of having to read the packet\nheader information, looking for\n\n570\n00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:03.860\nthe IP address, and every router examining\nthe packet to figure out in depth whether\n\n571\n00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.600\nit knows how to deal with it,\nit's gonna read the ship to label.\n\n572\n00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.210\nThis is kinda like going to UPS and\ndropping off a package saying,\n\n573\n00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:12.310\nhey, I wanna ship my package\nto my friend in Washington.\n\n574\n00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.690\nHis name is Mike and\nhis address is 123 Circle Lane, right?\n\n575\n00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:18.625\nSo as a result of that,\nnotice I didn't say Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n576\n00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:19.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I said Circle Lane, right?\n\n577\n00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:24.750\nSo, what happens is, instead of examining\nthe packet header in great detail,\n\n578\n00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.620\nthe router just looks at\nthe ship to label with MPLS.\n\n579\n00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.960\nIf it doesn't know how to\nprocess that ship to label,\n\n580\n00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.500\nit just sends it to the next hop,\ngoes on about its way.\n\n581\n00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.790\nIt doesn't do any deep packet inspection,\ndoesn't bother to look at IP addresses,\n\n582\n00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.400\njust reads the ship to label.\n\n583\n00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.590\nSo, as a result it ships\nmuch more quickly.\n\n584\n00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:45.620\nIn other words, we send data out\npast the router on the first hop\n\n585\n00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.320\nwith a deliver to label.\n\n586\n00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.600\nAnd as a result of that we then direct\nit directly to where it needs to go.\n\n587\n00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.030\nAlong the way those routers in\nthe hop lane are gonna read it, but\n\n588\n00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.640\nthey're just going to forward it on\nbecause the know it's now for them.\n\n589\n00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.190\nWhen it gets to where it needs to be,\nwe stop, we deliver it,\n\n590\n00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:01.650\nwe hand the packet over,\nit's delivered locally.\n\n591\n00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:03.870\nSo MPLS speeds up that process for\n\n592\n00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:07.920\nus dramatically because it allows us to\nuse effectively ship to labels that allow\n\n593\n00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.930\nus to streamline the process of processing\nhow we're gonna get from here to there.\n\n594\n00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:13.550\nPretty cool technology\nwhen you think about.\n\n595\n00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.586\nI'm obviously making it\na little bit simplistic,\n\n596\n00:29:15.586 --> 00:29:17.500\nright, there's a little\nbit more to it than that.\n\n597\n00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.340\nBut the reality is, for\nour purposes, mile wide inch deep,\n\n598\n00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:24.490\nthis is the exact level of definition we\nneed to understand, with regards to MPLS.\n\n599\n00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.570\nSo this is the kind of thing,\nthese are the kind of protocols,\n\n600\n00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:29.142\nthis is the kind of story that\nwe wanna be able to tell.\n\n601\n00:29:29.142 --> 00:29:33.150\nThis is the kind of depth we want to be\nable to go to in this particular area with\n\n602\n00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:37.910\nregards to IP security, IP protocols,\nhow we move information around,\n\n603\n00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:41.490\nwhat are our considerations and our\nconcerns, what are the things we look at?\n\n604\n00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:44.450\nAlways remember, we've said is several\ntimes just in this episode alone,\n\n605\n00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:48.950\nespecially in these kinds of conversations\nwhere the technical specificity is so\n\n606\n00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.230\nincredibly deep and potentially tempting,\ncuz you wanna jump in and\n\n607\n00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:53.770\nlearn more about these things,\nI know that.\n\n608\n00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.890\nAnd that's good and you should, but\nnot when you're preparing for the exam.\n\n609\n00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.720\nYou wanna be successful first,\nand then go out and practice and\n\n610\n00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.870\nbecome better over time as we said.\n\n611\n00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.150\nAnd with that comes knowledge and\nknowledge acquisition.\n\n612\n00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:08.900\nBut the first stop on that journey, first\nstages for you to master this material and\n\n613\n00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.630\npass the CISSP exam.\n\n614\n00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:14.310\nMile wide, right,\ninch deep, that's the goal.\n\n615\n00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:15.020\n>> Very good, Adam.\n\n616\n00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.072\nGreat stuff there, love it,\ncomplete with visual aids.\n\n617\n00:30:18.072 --> 00:30:21.100\nBut a really good look at IP\nnetworking and protocols,\n\n618\n00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.330\nand how we can use those in securing\nour networks, so thanks for that.\n\n619\n00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:27.160\nRemember, if you guys wanna attend\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n620\n00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.070\nall you gotta do is shoot us\nan email SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n621\n00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.010\nThat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n622\n00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.910\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n623\n00:30:33.910 -->

--> 00:00:20.320\nI'm your host, Mike Broderick and\ntoday we're doing our CISSP.\n\n4\n00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.200\nAnd specifically, we're gonna continue\nour conversation on IP networking and\n\n5\n00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.230\nprotocols.\n\n6\n00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.690\nAnd we're gonna start moving into\nthe world of wireless protocols.\n\n7\n00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.510\nAnd that changes security up a little bit.\n\n8\n00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.375\nIt may change what security methods\nwe're using what protocols we're using.\n\n9\n00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.155\nSo, here to help us with all\nof that is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:37.155 --> 00:00:37.665\nHow ya doing, Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:38.825\n>> I'm good, i'm good.\n\n12\n00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:40.185\nI am untethered.\n\n13\n00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:41.610\nI am wireless.\n\n14\n00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.115\n>> Woo-hoo.\n\n15\n00:00:42.115 --> 00:00:44.135\n>> Awesome.\nI still have however really cool socks.\n\n16\n00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:44.895\nNonetheless.\n\n17\n00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:46.205\n>> Polka dots.\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so.\n\n18\n00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:47.605\nLet's talk a bit about wireless, right.\n\n19\n00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:51.935\nSo, we're gonna continue our conversation\nwith regards to IP networks, protocols,\n\n20\n00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:55.270\nhow we deal with security related issues,\nall those kinds of things very important.\n\n21\n00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.820\nWe don't want to leave wireless\nout because as we know,\n\n22\n00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.360\nultimately, a lot of network traffic\ngoes across wireless networks.\n\n23\n00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.070\nFor instance, right now,\nsitting here talking to you\n\n24\n00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.470\nI'm using a wireless network in order to\nstay connected and do various things.\n\n25\n00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.340\nYou know, it's very common\ntoday in the enterprise that we\n\n26\n00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.890\nuse wireless communications.\n\n27\n00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.630\nIf you think about the fact that your\ncell phone, your \"smart device\" right?\n\n28\n00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.530\nThat we use because remember I love\napps so, we have lots of apps on phones.\n\n29\n00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.580\nSmart devices are typically connected\nwirelessly tablets a lot of the times\n\n30\n00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.910\nare connected wirelessly.\n\n31\n00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.630\nWe're using more and more of these\ndevices in the enterprise today.\n\n32\n00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.540\nBecoming more prevalent in fact for us to\nuse wireless networks than it may be for\n\n33\n00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.620\nus to be wired or\ntethered to a traditional network for\n\n34\n00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.980\nthe majority of the work we do everyday so\nthis is not uncommon.\n\n35\n00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.720\nAnd for CISSP,\nwe have to be able to understand\n\n36\n00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.870\nthe generic concepts\nassociated withe wireless.\n\n37\n00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.170\nWe have to be able to\nunderstand the topology,\n\n38\n00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.580\nthe design of the network\nwhen ti comes to wireless.\n\n39\n00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.610\nWe have to understand how wireless\nnetworks actually back into\n\n40\n00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.830\nwired networks because there really is no\nsuch thing as truly wireless networking.\n\n41\n00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.300\nWe tether and connect a wireless access\npoint somewhere back to our network stac,\n\n42\n00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.390\nso there is a wire component of that.\n\n43\n00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.390\nWe wanna understand that,\n\n44\n00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.490\nbecause that communication channel\nhas to be managed as well.\n\n45\n00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.032\nWe wanna understand that wherever\nwe put the put the word, wireless,\n\n46\n00:02:10.032 --> 00:02:11.165\nin front of something.\n\n47\n00:02:11.165 --> 00:02:13.855\nWhile it may change certain things,\nthe reality is,\n\n48\n00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:16.165\nthe laws of networking don't change,\nright?\n\n49\n00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:17.235\nPackets are packets.\n\n50\n00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:20.395\nIP addresses are IP addresses,\nas we've discussed with you.\n\n51\n00:02:20.395 --> 00:02:24.977\nAnd the concept of wireless networking\nis simply an extension of networking.\n\n52\n00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:26.847\nAnd so, we want to think of\nit from that perspective,\n\n53\n00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:28.387\nat least to begin our conversation.\n\n54\n00:02:28.387 --> 00:02:30.387\nKind of as a base line if you will.\n\n55\n00:02:30.387 --> 00:02:33.117\nSo, wireless networking,\nwhat we would think of as wireless LANs,\n\n56\n00:02:33.117 --> 00:02:35.967\nwhat's commonly referred\nto today as wi-fi,\n\n57\n00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:39.417\nis really the traditional thought process\nthat we use when we talk about and\n\n58\n00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:44.070\nframe and think about the conversation\nwith regards to wireless networks.\n\n59\n00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.010\nWe have a standard that we often\nrefer to for wireless networks.\n\n60\n00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.480\nIEEE802.11 is going to be\nthe wireless specification, overall.\n\n61\n00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.627\nAnd we're gonna then talk about\ncategories within 802.11.\n\n62\n00:02:54.627 --> 00:02:58.960\nThere's 802.11A, B, G, I, etcetera.\n\n63\n00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.690\nBut generically, the 802.11 specification,\noverall, deals with wireless, so\n\n64\n00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.680\nwe're going to focus on that.\n\n65\n00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.180\nOne of the first things we want to know.\n\n66\n00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.312\nAs a CISSP, is that when we throw\nout an IEEE standard designation,\n\n67\n00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:15.150\n802.11 for wireless, 802.3 for\nethernet, 802.5 for, Mr. Mike?\n\n68\n00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.675\n>> I do not know.\n\n69\n00:03:16.675 --> 00:03:23.130\n>> Is that the token ring?\n\n70\n00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.920\nToken ring, right?\n\n71\n00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.380\n>> I knew my network would\ncome back to me eventually.\n\n72\n00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.920\n>> Just got to occasionally prod him\nwith a stick to get him to remember\n\n73\n00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.630\nthese things, right?\n\n74\n00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.510\nSo, just like Mike, right and\n\n75\n00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.470\nin this case you actually want to\nbe like Mike, let me explain why.\n\n76\n00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.550\nYou may not remember 802.5,\nand that's okay.\n\n77\n00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.710\nMost people don't.\n\n78\n00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.930\nBut you have to remember it\nwhen you are taking the exam so\n\n79\n00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.210\njust like Mike went through\nthe process thinking what is that?\n\n80\n00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.800\nI'm not sure.\n\n81\n00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.450\nIs it a token ring?\n\n82\n00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.470\nYou've gotta keep in mind that these\nstandards, at least the three or\n\n83\n00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.120\nfour we throw out at you\nare gonna be important so\n\n84\n00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.915\nyou wanna make sure you\nknow what they are.\n\n85\n00:03:52.915 --> 00:03:56.710\n802.3 is probably the most widely used and\ntalked about standard because it's\n\n86\n00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.640\nethernet, it's been the most\nwidely deployed and\n\n87\n00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.340\nused forever in a day, but 802.11 for\nwireless is obviously very important.\n\n88\n00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.250\nToken ring is gone\nthe way of the dinosaur.\n\n89\n00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.980\nNobody hears about that or\ntalks about that anymore.\n\n90\n00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.340\nBut the reality is you still need to\nknow about it as a historical footnote.\n\n91\n00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.810\nSo, just make sure that\nyou're familiar with those.\n\n92\n00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.760\nEquate the numerical designation\nwith the name and you're fine.\n\n93\n00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.090\nWe're not gonna ask you anything\nmore about it than that.\n\n94\n00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.080\nBut, you may very well need to\nknow with regards to scenario,\n\n95\n00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.910\nwith regards to a sentence or two and\n\n96\n00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.360\na question that if we say the 802.3\nstandard and we don't spell out ethernet.\n\n97\n00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.650\nYou still understand what we're\ntalking about, in other words, right?\n\n98\n00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.970\nIf we said 802.11, we didn't spell out\nwireless, you would pick up on that and\n\n99\n00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.480\nanswer the questions appropriately.\n\n100\n00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.300\nThat would also be important so\nmake sure you're aware of that.\n\n101\n00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.470\nThe idea behind this thought process\nis ultimately to help us to figure out\n\n102\n00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.760\nhow to communicate wirelessly.\n\n103\n00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.790\nThat's what the 802.11 stems\nare all about In a modern network,\n\n104\n00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.260\nwe often talk about the point\nwhat's known as a Mesh.\n\n105\n00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.140\nA mesh is an overlapping\ntechnology architecture or\n\n106\n00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.100\ntopology type that allow us to\ninterconnect every device to every other\n\n107\n00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.860\nthrough redundant and\nmultiple connections.\n\n108\n00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.540\nSo, if Mike and\nI we're both being networked together and\n\n109\n00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.560\nwe wanted to create a single connection,\nright?\n\n110\n00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.490\nWe would, in effect, we would just string\none line between the two of us and\n\n111\n00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.660\nthat would effectively be\njust a single connection.\n\n112\n00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.940\nIf we wanted to have a mesh,\na redundancy, built into that,\n\n113\n00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.620\nwe'd have to have two lines of\ncommunication between us and\n\n114\n00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.180\nby doing that we would have\na secondary connection.\n\n115\n00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.030\nIf we added a third a person or\nthird point into the connection.\n\n116\n00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.090\nModel so if we had Mike, myself and\nperhaps Bob or Alice sitting over there\n\n117\n00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.250\nin the corner we'd have to then\nspool connections out to them and\n\n118\n00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.930\nmake sure those connections went from\nmyself to Bob, Bob to Mike, Mike to me and\n\n119\n00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.200\nthen, we'd have to have Bob to me and\nBob to Alice.\n\n120\n00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.320\nAnd you know you get the idea\neverybody connects to everybody.\n\n121\n00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.350\nAnd so, the idea with a wireless\nmesh is simply the same thing but\n\n122\n00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.110\nwe are simply doing this on a wireless\nnetwork as opposed to on a wired network.\n\n123\n00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.320\nRadio nodes are going to organized in\nmeshed topologies when we deal with\n\n124\n00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.200\nwireless networks, many wireless access\npoints and the transmission mechanism\n\n125\n00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.800\nwe use to be able to send or\nreceive are going to be set up this way.\n\n126\n00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.660\nEach node forwards information on behalf\nof all the other nodes if needed and\n\n127\n00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.550\nit can self heal.\n\n128\n00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.210\nMeaning if one node is to fall out for\nsome reason,\n\n129\n00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.390\nwe turn one off, something gets unplugged,\nsomething fails.\n\n130\n00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.500\nWhatever it is all the others because\nof the overlapping connections,\n\n131\n00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.730\nare still able to reach all the other\nareas and communicate and so,\n\n132\n00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.960\na single node failure in a mesh,\nis not really gonna be a problem.\n\n133\n00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.820\nWe simply just close ranks if you will and\nroute traffic\n\n134\n00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.330\nback through the other areas in the mesh\nand effectively, the mesh holds.\n\n135\n00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.850\nAnd as a result of that, everything is\nstill going to be able to connect and\n\n136\n00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.760\nwe consider everything still be\nredundant and therefore online.\n\n137\n00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.100\nWe always wanna talk about Bluetooth, one\nof my most favorite technologies as you've\n\n138\n00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.680\nheard me rant and rave about before,\nwith regards to wireless, a wireless PAN,\n\n139\n00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.420\na personal area network is what we\noften think of as Bluetooth, or\n\n140\n00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.180\nthink about with regards to Bluetooth.\n\n141\n00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:52.260\nWe interconnect devices, as I explained in\none of our prior episodes, within a small,\n\n142\n00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.070\nrelatively controlled\ngeographic area two to three,\n\n143\n00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.620\nmaybe three to four feet at the most.\n\n144\n00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.320\nThey'd be able to go out to up to about 30\nfeet depending on the configuration and\n\n145\n00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.330\nthe power rating on the bluetooth device.\n\n146\n00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.660\nBut certainly very, very narrowly defined,\nwithin 5 to 10 feet of you.\n\n147\n00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.250\nCertainly, it's about the extent of what\nmost bluetooth networks will be good for.\n\n148\n00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:13.229\nThis is going to be the 802.15 standard.\n\n149\n00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:14.489\nSo, 802.11 is wireless.\n\n150\n00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:19.330\n802.15 is going to be the bluetooth or\nwireless PAN standard.\n\n151\n00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.830\nWiMAX which is WiFi, wireless across\na very large distance, very high speed.\n\n152\n00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.610\nIt's going to hit potentially up to it's\nabout 30 megabits per second right now.\n\n153\n00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.750\nEven higher depending on where they're\ndeploying this technology kind of\n\n154\n00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:32.730\nhow it's set up.\n\n155\n00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:37.400\nData rates of over 30 megabits\nper second potentially\n\n156\n00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.170\non a wireless network are pretty\nrobust and pretty high.\n\n157\n00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.240\nThe ideas that we use WiMAX networks\nto be able to wire up large\n\n158\n00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.253\ngeographic areas like the downtown\ncorridor of the city for\n\n159\n00:07:46.253 --> 00:07:50.129\ninstance right, or residential\nneighborhood maybe wire it up with WiMAX.\n\n160\n00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:55.098\nSo, where my parents live there is a WiMAX\nnetwork that's actually been set up and\n\n161\n00:07:55.098 --> 00:07:59.924\nso, the whole area in the residential\ncommunities where they are are wired up so\n\n162\n00:07:59.924 --> 00:08:02.230\nor wirelessly rather but connected so\n\n163\n00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.590\neffectively you can go drive through\nthere sit in a park do whatever.\n\n164\n00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.450\nAnd the reality is that\n\n165\n00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:10.087\nyou have wireless anywhere you go\nwithin the residential corridor.\n\n166\n00:08:10.087 --> 00:08:14.290\nSo it's becoming more common in cities\ntoday to see this kind of stuff.\n\n167\n00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.190\nWe also have a wireless MAN,\na wireless Metropolitan Area Network.\n\n168\n00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.070\nThis is gonna connect several\ndifferent wireless LANs together\n\n169\n00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.215\ninto a larger geographic area as well.\n\n170\n00:08:23.215 --> 00:08:30.480\n802.16 is the standard for wireless MAN,\n802.15 would be Bluetooth Wireless PAN.\n\n171\n00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.910\n802.11 is a wi-fi overall, right?\n\n172\n00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.580\nSo, just be aware of that,\n\n173\n00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.910\njust be thinking about the different\ncircumstances associated with it.\n\n174\n00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:41.140\nWe also have wireless WANs, wireless wide\narea networks, we can in other words\n\n175\n00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.710\nlink large geographies together\nwirelessly and create a WAN.\n\n176\n00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.430\nBranch offices may be connected this way.\n\n177\n00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:50.770\nThings of that nature, if we have\na campus scenario where we have multiple\n\n178\n00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:54.600\ndifferent offices in different parts\nof a city, may connect them up and\n\n179\n00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.330\nusing wireless WAN technology.\n\n180\n00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.040\nTo be able to do that so if you go to\nlike a college campus for instance.\n\n181\n00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.540\nRight?\n\n182\n00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.270\nYou may have all the buildings\nwirelessly interconnected for\n\n183\n00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:06.155\na common wireless system that\nwould constitute a wireless\n\n184\n00:09:06.155 --> 00:09:09.120\nWAN if it's large and\ngeographically spread out.\n\n185\n00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.570\nWe don't want to leave\nout cellular networks.\n\n186\n00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:11.780\nRight?\nSo your networks are going to be\n\n187\n00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.030\nthe standard that we often think of\nwhen we think about wireless today.\n\n188\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.490\nBut they are actually radio networks.\n\n189\n00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.820\nThey are wireless but they are wireless\nradio transmission networks.\n\n190\n00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.450\nAnd they're going to be able\nto effectively transmit over\n\n191\n00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.720\nusually about one to two, two and a half\nor so, maybe a three mile radius at most.\n\n192\n00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.370\nWe have cell towers in other words, or\nradio towers that repeat the signal\n\n193\n00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.720\nevery two and a half to three miles,\ngive or take.\n\n194\n00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.160\nAnd the idea is that we propagate that\nsignal as we move between cell sites or\n\n195\n00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.990\ncell towers, we propagate that signal and\nit follows you,\n\n196\n00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.940\nwhich is why your hand-held device\neffectively stays connected.\n\n197\n00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.145\nYou're really just using a very\nexpensive Apple branded walkie talkie.\n\n198\n00:09:48.145 --> 00:09:49.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz that's really more or\n\n199\n00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:52.400\nless what you have a cellular network and\nof course,\n\n200\n00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.650\nmy most favorite thing,\nwe have apps on that.\n\n201\n00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.810\nSo that's very important as well.\n\n202\n00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.200\nBut the idea is that basically we're\njust going to have a very very large,\n\n203\n00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.740\nobviously technically complex much\nmore complex today than a standard,\n\n204\n00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.300\nold fashioned radio, solution or\n\n205\n00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.050\na hand-held set of walkie-talkies\nthat we used to have years ago.\n\n206\n00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:15.420\nBut this is till basically a land\ncarrier-based radio network that's\n\n207\n00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.690\ntransmitting cell tower to tower or\n\n208\n00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.270\nradio tower to tower to be\nable to propagate your signal.\n\n209\n00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:24.020\nIt's just that we have thousands of towers\nset up everywhere which is why we have\n\n210\n00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.770\ncoverage over very, very large\ndistances with cellular networks.\n\n211\n00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.650\nBut with all these kinds of networks,\nwe have security issues,\n\n212\n00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:31.990\nlike we do with everything else.\n\n213\n00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.860\nWe have the worries about authentication.\n\n214\n00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.950\nHow do we authenticate to\nget on to this system?\n\n215\n00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:38.050\nIs it an open authentication solution?\n\n216\n00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.530\nIs it a proprietary solution?\n\n217\n00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.290\nCertain vendors use their own APIs.\n\n218\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:42.920\nWe have to be aware of that.\n\n219\n00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.850\nAre we gonna run the wireless network\nin what's called ad hoc mode?\n\n220\n00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.520\nEffectively just allowing\nindividual workstations.\n\n221\n00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.250\nPerhaps my computer and Mike's\ncomputer sitting here on the podium,\n\n222\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.850\nwe could connect together in\nwhat's called ad hoc mode.\n\n223\n00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.010\nAnd never need a wireless access point,\neffectively, to associate.\n\n224\n00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.800\nWe can do that, if we allow that to occur,\n\n225\n00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.200\ndevice to device within a couple of\nfeet of each other, we can do that.\n\n226\n00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.062\nBut the problem is,\nwe don't authenticate for\n\n227\n00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:09.240\nad hoc, at least traditionally we don't.\n\n228\n00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.380\nMike's device,\n\n229\n00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:14.540\nbecause he's running an Apple device will\nprobably challenge my non Apple device\n\n230\n00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.760\nto a duel because Apple always thinks\nit's better then everybody else.\n\n231\n00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.580\nSo when I try to connect to him and ad hoc\nmode it will probably challenge me and\n\n232\n00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.020\nsay, hey, who are you?\n\n233\n00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.540\nBut we can get around that pretty easily\nand he and I could communicate and\n\n234\n00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.982\nconnect with minimal difficultly,\nminimal authentication required.\n\n235\n00:11:29.982 --> 00:11:31.407\nSo ad hoc mode may be good, but\n\n236\n00:11:31.407 --> 00:11:34.170\nthe problem is it also can\nlead to complications.\n\n237\n00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.752\nWhat if somebody gets within a couple of\nfeet of your system, connects up to you\n\n238\n00:11:37.752 --> 00:11:41.350\nthroughout ad hoc without you necessarily\nknowing, and as a result of that,\n\n239\n00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.280\nthey're able to then get access to\ninformation that you've shared.\n\n240\n00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.400\nThey may be able to take information off\nyour system without your knowledge and,\n\n241\n00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.960\nimportantly, without your consent.\n\n242\n00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.180\nSo we have to think about that.\n\n243\n00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.290\nWe want to try to run\nan infrastructure mode.\n\n244\n00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.920\nInfrastructure mode is what we\nrefer to where we actually use\n\n245\n00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.430\nwireless access points.\n\n246\n00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:58.420\nWe use authentication mechanisms.\n\n247\n00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.060\nWe use the traditional knowledge we have\nfor wireless network in the enterprise.\n\n248\n00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:02.830\nTo set things up and\n\n249\n00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:06.170\nuse that knowledge to secure\nthe systems the right way in all this.\n\n250\n00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.820\nWe know, and I've talked about.\n\n251\n00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.450\nWe will obviously continue in some points\nin our conversation, to mention WEP.\n\n252\n00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.110\nWe know that WEP is something\nwe should not be using anymore.\n\n253\n00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:19.140\nThe Wired Equivalent Privacy protocol has\nbeen deemed dead for several years now.\n\n254\n00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.990\nIt is still, interestingly enough,\na choice you can make in many devices,\n\n255\n00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.450\neven though we don't recommend you use it.\n\n256\n00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:26.890\nSo, figure that out, right?\n\n257\n00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:28.240\nWe've talked about common sense,\n\n258\n00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.290\nthe fact that when something's bad,\nyou really just shouldn't do it.\n\n259\n00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.210\nBut clearly the reason that\nthat's still showing up and\n\n260\n00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.040\nis still there is that we have so\nmuch older infrastructure out there that\n\n261\n00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.950\nhas never just been updated or it's never\nbeen replaced at least up until now.\n\n262\n00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.230\nSo WEP was still a viable option at\nthe point where those devices we\n\n263\n00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.990\ndeployed initially.\n\n264\n00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.400\nAnd even though they may have been\nupdated with firmware updates and\n\n265\n00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.540\nthings like that.\n\n266\n00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.590\nWEP may not have been\nremoved as the underlying,\n\n267\n00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:51.705\none of the underlying, protocol.\n\n268\n00:12:51.705 --> 00:12:53.345\nSo we do want to know that but\n\n269\n00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:56.635\nin new devices you'll typically\nnot see WEP as an option.\n\n270\n00:12:56.635 --> 00:12:58.995\nWhat you do see is\ncertainly things like TCIP,\n\n271\n00:12:58.995 --> 00:13:00.665\nwhich is initially what replaced WEP.\n\n272\n00:13:00.665 --> 00:13:04.312\nAlthough it also has had problems that\nwe don't tend to use that much anymore.\n\n273\n00:13:04.312 --> 00:13:07.332\nYou'll see WPA,\nfollowed by WPA2 Enterprise,\n\n274\n00:13:07.332 --> 00:13:11.362\nbecause that's currently the most secure\nversion of wireless authentication and\n\n275\n00:13:11.362 --> 00:13:13.432\nsecurity protocols we can deploy.\n\n276\n00:13:13.432 --> 00:13:14.942\nSo you will see things like that.\n\n277\n00:13:14.942 --> 00:13:18.400\nAnd so WPA2 Enterprise would\nbe the preferred option,\n\n278\n00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.810\nwould be what you'd want to use for\nauthentication and crypted solutions.\n\n279\n00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:22.700\nI mention TCP/IP.\n\n280\n00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.202\nYou may see TCP/IP there as well.\n\n281\n00:13:24.202 --> 00:13:28.740\nAlthough TCP/IP, as I said, has also\nhad problems and is suspect as a use,\n\n282\n00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.600\nor rather suspect for\nuse, as a result of that.\n\n283\n00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.300\nWe may be able to fall prey to things\ncalled parking lot attacks which sound\n\n284\n00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.910\na little bit sinister, but the reality\nit's a very simple thought process.\n\n285\n00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.380\nWhen you set up your wireless networks,\nif we're not doing a site survey and\n\n286\n00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.170\nwe're not checking on\nwhere our signals are,\n\n287\n00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:48.570\nhow far out they propagate\nbeyond the border of our office.\n\n288\n00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:52.160\nSo in other words you can simply set up\na wireless network inside of an office,\n\n289\n00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.930\nwe have glass, we have walls, we have\npermeable substances that sit there.\n\n290\n00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:01.690\nIf we put a wireless access point right up\nagainst the outer wall of a building and\n\n291\n00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.840\nwe angle the antennas facing out,\nthe wireless signal's gonna\n\n292\n00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.080\nshoot out into the parking lot or\nwhatever's beyond the building for\n\n293\n00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.700\nup to several hundred yards depending\non how powerful that system is.\n\n294\n00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.740\nIf we've done that without\nreally thinking about that,\n\n295\n00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.530\nwe've effectively now given\neverybody in the parking lot\n\n296\n00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.070\naccess to the wireless network even\nthough we may not want them to have that.\n\n297\n00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.190\nYou'll have to talk to this about this and\nexplain it to customers and\n\n298\n00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:27.120\nto students by talking about fact that\nwhen you often drive up to Starbucks or\n\n299\n00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.690\nMcDonald's, or wherever you get wireless\naccess today that's free, it's in a lot of\n\n300\n00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:34.970\nthese places, almost every restaurant,\nevery bar, every coffee shop has it.\n\n301\n00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.910\nBut when you drive up to Starbucks\nespecially, depending on where you live,\n\n302\n00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:42.110\nyou often see three or four people sitting\nin cars outside on computers, doing work.\n\n303\n00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.930\nAnd they're just sitting there in the\nparking lot because the wireless signal\n\n304\n00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:47.505\nbleeds out of Starbucks, depending\non the structure of the building.\n\n305\n00:14:47.505 --> 00:14:49.505\nAnd is strong enough that\nthey could just sit there.\n\n306\n00:14:49.505 --> 00:14:51.205\nSo they'll go through the drive through,\nget their coffee.\n\n307\n00:14:51.205 --> 00:14:53.365\nThey'll park, and\nthese are usually salespeople.\n\n308\n00:14:53.365 --> 00:14:55.895\nAnd you'll see them on the phone,\ndoing the computer thing.\n\n309\n00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.065\nThankfully, they're not trying to\ndrive while they're doing that, so\n\n310\n00:14:58.065 --> 00:15:00.025\nthat is a improvement definitely.\n\n311\n00:15:00.025 --> 00:15:03.095\nBut they're sitting there effectively\nusing the open wireless signal.\n\n312\n00:15:03.095 --> 00:15:07.560\nThat's fine, nothing wrong with that,\nbut if that was a company and\n\n313\n00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.510\nthat signal was supposed to be protected\nand now your sitting out there and\n\n314\n00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:11.760\neffectively squatting on it.\n\n315\n00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.820\nWe call that a parking lot attack cause\nyour effective sitting in the parking lot\n\n316\n00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:16.970\nand you're using the system\nwhen you're not supposed to be.\n\n317\n00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.760\nAnd that can easily happen if\nwe're not doing site surveys and\n\n318\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.380\nthinking about stuff like that.\n\n319\n00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.190\nShared key authentication flaws.\n\n320\n00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.810\nIf we have a shared key and\n\n321\n00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.440\nwe're not authenticating properly\nwe may actually run into issues.\n\n322\n00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.860\nSo things like, for instance,\nbroadcasting the SSID\n\n323\n00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.410\nis something we often talk about and\nsay well we shouldn't do that.\n\n324\n00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.570\nPeople should now what it is and\nhow to connect.\n\n325\n00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.128\nWell okay, that's right.\n\n326\n00:15:36.128 --> 00:15:36.640\nAnd you could do that.\n\n327\n00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.120\nAnd you do that at home probably, right?\n\n328\n00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.670\nTo protect your neighbors from\n\n329\n00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:44.420\ndoing something illegal from taking\nyour wireless signal for free.\n\n330\n00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.150\nBecause we don't want them to do that.\n\n331\n00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:49.750\nSo if you don't broadcast the SSID,\nthey won't be able to connect.\n\n332\n00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.880\nYou may use Mac address filtering for\ninstance.\n\n333\n00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:52.448\nYou may say,\n\n334\n00:15:52.448 --> 00:15:55.920\nonly these Mac addresses are allowed to\nconnect to this wireless access point.\n\n335\n00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.837\nAgain, it's another step, another link in\nthe chain to create wireless security.\n\n336\n00:15:59.837 --> 00:16:01.703\nAny or all of these things\nare going to be helpful so\n\n337\n00:16:01.703 --> 00:16:03.046\nwe have to be aware of these issues.\n\n338\n00:16:03.046 --> 00:16:04.912\nWe have to think about\nthe use of certificates,\n\n339\n00:16:04.912 --> 00:16:08.090\nare we gonna use certificates in wireless\nnetworks to be able to authenticate?\n\n340\n00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:09.650\nWe may, it's up to us.\n\n341\n00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.920\nWe've talked about in prior episodes\nthe use of certificate authorities,\n\n342\n00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.860\nthe issuance of digital certificates,\n\n343\n00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:20.310\nremember an X509 V3 is the formal\nstandard and version forced certificate.\n\n344\n00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.600\nAnd we've talked about why\ncertificates are important.\n\n345\n00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.920\nWe could use certificates on the client\nside so on the endpoints on a laptop,\n\n346\n00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.290\na desktop, a mobile handheld device,\nwhatever it is.\n\n347\n00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:32.040\nWe can use them on the server side.\n\n348\n00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.490\nWe can use them to be able to do\nsigning to be able to authenticate.\n\n349\n00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.670\nThere's all sorts of that server or\n\n350\n00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.840\nrather genarcRe certificates are going to\nbe good for server side or client side.\n\n351\n00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.402\nSo wanna be thinking about those things,\nwith regards to how we secure and\n\n352\n00:16:44.402 --> 00:16:48.093\nwhat kind of protocols we use,\nespecially with regards to wireless right?\n\n353\n00:16:48.093 --> 00:16:51.245\nWe also wanna think about light\nweight directory protocol LDAP.\n\n354\n00:16:51.245 --> 00:16:54.840\nWe've talked about this before, this is\nanother area that we have to consider.\n\n355\n00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.480\nDo we allow directory services to be able\nto be used with or without certificates?\n\n356\n00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.190\nNormally without exception,\nwe use certificates to identify users.\n\n357\n00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.830\nWe link them to user accounts\nin the LDAP directory.\n\n358\n00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.917\nBut those certificates\nare traditionally self-signed.\n\n359\n00:17:07.917 --> 00:17:11.772\nWe may wanna issue different certificates,\nand we;ve talked about perhaps not using\n\n360\n00:17:11.772 --> 00:17:15.789\nthe default self-signed certificates, but\nrather using additional certificates that\n\n361\n00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:19.297\nwe will create directly through the CA,\nthrough the certificate authority.\n\n362\n00:17:19.297 --> 00:17:22.290\nSo wanna be thinking about\nthese things and what they are.\n\n363\n00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:25.180\nManaging the certificates\nthrough the L Dapt Directory\n\n364\n00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.691\ngives us enhanced capabilities and\nenhanced and flexibility and\n\n365\n00:17:28.691 --> 00:17:32.260\nvisibility, with regards to being able to\nmanage certificates and use them securely.\n\n366\n00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:35.550\nWe also want to think about how we get\nfrom point A through point B to point C,\n\n367\n00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.880\nrouting is obviously what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n368\n00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.240\nWe talked in one of our prior\nepisodes about MPLS, and\n\n369\n00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.930\nhow we can slap a ship to or send to\nlabel on a packet and streamline routing,\n\n370\n00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.820\nby using MPLS to effectively identify\nthe last point of delivery, and\n\n371\n00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.290\nthen quickly expedite routing\npackages to get there, right.\n\n372\n00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.880\nThis is pretty cool technology.\n\n373\n00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:57.350\nWe can also use what's known\nas deterministic routing.\n\n374\n00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:01.190\nDeterministic routing is effectively\nhardcoding a path and saying I wanna be\n\n375\n00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:05.430\nable to go from A to B then to C,\nand I only wanna travel that path.\n\n376\n00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:08.130\nIf I can't go A, B,\nC I don't wanna deliver the packet,\n\n377\n00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:09.500\nI don't wanna transmit.\n\n378\n00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.850\nSo we can statically hardcode an effect,\nwhat the route is,\n\n379\n00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.550\nit's called deterministic routing.\n\n380\n00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.170\nRoutes that are known,\nthat are protected, that are identified,\n\n381\n00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.410\nthat are entered are gonna be used.\n\n382\n00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.000\nThe idea behind it is if we\nstatically control the routes and\n\n383\n00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.100\ndetermine them, it's less likely\nthat a hacker can get in and\n\n384\n00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.850\nsomehow create some sort of misdirection,\nand move us off that path,\n\n385\n00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.450\nand effectively then try\nto hack into our systems.\n\n386\n00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:34.380\nSo this is important also,\nthis could be a mechanism for\n\n387\n00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.010\nprotection that may be valuable.\n\n388\n00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.170\nBut again, we'd have to plan ahead and\nthink about this.\n\n389\n00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:41.430\nAnd decide how are we gonna get from\nA to B to C, what is that route?\n\n390\n00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.850\nIdentify it, and then actually enter it,\nnot just into one router, but\n\n391\n00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:45.570\ninto all of them.\n\n392\n00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.250\nSo that everybody knows what that route\nlooks like both going and coming.\n\n393\n00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.600\nBecause we have to be able to tell A to\nbe able to send through B to get to C.\n\n394\n00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.620\nBut C also has to be told how\nto send back going the other way\n\n395\n00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:58.460\nusing a deterministic route, or\nit may not be able to get there.\n\n396\n00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.870\nSo we have to think about that, as well.\n\n397\n00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.820\nWhat about boundary routers?\n\n398\n00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:05.140\nThese are routers that sit out on\nthe gateway area of our networks.\n\n399\n00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.730\nIn other words,\nat the edge between a LAN and a WAN.\n\n400\n00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.990\nAt the edge between the known,\ninternally, and the unknown.\n\n401\n00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.610\nThe outside dark scary world, right?\n\n402\n00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:14.960\nWe have to think about that,\n\n403\n00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.740\nbecause boundary routers are effectively\ngoing to be our first line of defense.\n\n404\n00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.150\nLogically they may not be, right?\n\n405\n00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.940\nPhysically they may not be, in the sense\nwe may have routers there, but\n\n406\n00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.975\nwe certainly are gonna also have\nfirewalls, we may have, filtering devices,\n\n407\n00:19:27.975 --> 00:19:32.265\nmay have packet accelerators,\nencryption decryption hardware.\n\n408\n00:19:32.265 --> 00:19:36.445\nThere's a lot of things that may in line\nsit in front of or next to a router, and\n\n409\n00:19:36.445 --> 00:19:39.830\nso you may not get to the router before\nyou get to some of these devices.\n\n410\n00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:43.440\nInbound packet filtering, in other words,\ntypically, done before you are going to\n\n411\n00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.890\nnecessarily touch all aspects of the\nboundary, is all I'm suggesting to you.\n\n412\n00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.440\nSome may be in front of others,\nwe have to think about that.\n\n413\n00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.570\nBut a router is usually gonna be one of\nthe very first things you connect to,\n\n414\n00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.140\nbecause on your way into the network\nyou have to cross the router\n\n415\n00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.200\nto then be able to get to the inside.\n\n416\n00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.590\nSo boundary routers are important.\n\n417\n00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:01.000\nHow are we securing those?\n\n418\n00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.620\nAre we making sure that\nthe routing tables are protected?\n\n419\n00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:07.370\nAre we making sure that if\nanybody is able to get in and\n\n420\n00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:11.850\nreconfigure the information in a router,\nchange paths, add static routes for\n\n421\n00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.640\ninstance, that we're aware of that.\n\n422\n00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.930\nIt may not be any harder than using\na route out command, by the way.\n\n423\n00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:21.270\nRoute add and then the path minus\nS at the end to make it static\n\n424\n00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.500\nis not much of a complicated\ncommand line to type in.\n\n425\n00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.630\nIt may be a little bit more than\nthat depending on the kind of router\n\n426\n00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:27.610\nthat you use.\n\n427\n00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.430\nBut even in the most complex routers,\n\n428\n00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.220\nyou basically have a very\nsimple command to add a path.\n\n429\n00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.640\nAnd so\nit's not very complicated potentially.\n\n430\n00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.460\nThe trick is,\nwe need administrative rights and\n\n431\n00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.090\nwe need the administrative configuration\nand log on to be able to do that.\n\n432\n00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.660\nBut if we're good at what we do,\nin terms of being a defender,\n\n433\n00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.160\nwe're gonna make sure that\nthat information is secure.\n\n434\n00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.650\nIf we're lax, that information may be\nfound out, and then an acry may come and\n\n435\n00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.900\nbe able to effectively take\nover the boundary router.\n\n436\n00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.625\nSo we do wanna think about that.\n\n437\n00:20:52.625 --> 00:20:56.045\nAre we advertising those routes,\nmaking them available easily, and\n\n438\n00:20:56.045 --> 00:20:58.655\nmaking them broadcast them out so\nother people can see them?\n\n439\n00:20:58.655 --> 00:21:00.647\nOr are we hiding those routes and\nnot making them available?\n\n440\n00:21:00.647 --> 00:21:02.485\nBut these are all things\nwe'd want to think about.\n\n441\n00:21:02.485 --> 00:21:04.257\nWhen we think about non blind and\n\n442\n00:21:04.257 --> 00:21:07.885\nblind hijacking,\nanother very specific kind of solution.\n\n443\n00:21:07.885 --> 00:21:12.350\nWe have to think about different ways that\nwe may be able to manipulate traffic.\n\n444\n00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:15.570\nAnd generically understand what traffic\nis and how to use it to our advantage.\n\n445\n00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:16.330\nSo, for instance,\n\n446\n00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:20.930\nin non-blind hijacking we're\neffectively gonna be inside the subnet.\n\n447\n00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.760\nAs the, as effectively as\nthe attacker as the bad actor.\n\n448\n00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.750\nWe're gonna be inside.\n\n449\n00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.840\nThe non-blind refers to having\nknowledge of the network.\n\n450\n00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.900\nSo we're gonna be on the inside.\n\n451\n00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.047\nThis may be a bad actor on\nthe inside of your network.\n\n452\n00:21:31.047 --> 00:21:34.799\nThis could be somebody who has perhaps\ntaken over a machine, so they've rooted\n\n453\n00:21:34.799 --> 00:21:38.775\na machine, put a back door in it, they now\nhave an entry point into your network, and\n\n454\n00:21:38.775 --> 00:21:42.471\nthey're operating from that inside\nvantage point to then observe traffic and\n\n455\n00:21:42.471 --> 00:21:44.387\nunderstand what traffic may look like.\n\n456\n00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:47.711\nAs a result of that, they then may\nbe able to figure out how to send\n\n457\n00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:51.100\ndata to other systems inside that subnet,\ninside that network,\n\n458\n00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.080\nbecause effectively they\nare seen as being local.\n\n459\n00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.640\nThey're seen as being trusted.\n\n460\n00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.660\nThis is a non-blind hijacking attack.\n\n461\n00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.490\nA blind hijacking attack\non the other hand.\n\n462\n00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.140\nBlind implies no knowledge.\n\n463\n00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.090\nWe're outside of the subnet, we really\ndon't know what's going on inside,\n\n464\n00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.690\nbut we wanna try to figure out a way to\nsneak traffic in there, and communicate,\n\n465\n00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.160\nand take over systems.\n\n466\n00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.149\nSo in a blind hijacking solution,\n\n467\n00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.130\nmore sophisticated obviously because\nit's harder to do from outside.\n\n468\n00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:20.750\nWe have to figure out how to effectively\nguess what the packets look like, and\n\n469\n00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.810\nmost importantly what sequence\nnumbers are used with the packs.\n\n470\n00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:25.780\nWe're gonna do a little\ndemonstration here for you,\n\n471\n00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.325\nwe're gonna take a look\nat picture right now.\n\n472\n00:22:27.325 --> 00:22:31.250\nAnd we're actually gonna take a look\nat what a data capture looks like\n\n473\n00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.190\nin WireShark.\n\n474\n00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.580\nI see the little blue fin in\nthe upper left hand corner there.\n\n475\n00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.290\nSo we're gonna show you WireShark.\n\n476\n00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:41.350\nWireShark is a newer version of\na years old product called EatherReel,\n\n477\n00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.870\nit was the original product.\n\n478\n00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.317\nIt was bought, updated, and\nrebranded as WireShark.\n\n479\n00:22:45.317 --> 00:22:48.617\nAnd so you're looking at\nWireShark on a Windows machine.\n\n480\n00:22:48.617 --> 00:22:51.320\nAnd what we've done is\njust capture some traffic.\n\n481\n00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.270\nAnd then, and you guys think we sit around\nwith nothing to do when we're not talking\n\n482\n00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:54.890\nto you, right?\n\n483\n00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:59.370\nWe're working hard here at ITPro.tv\nwhen we're not on talking to you guys.\n\n484\n00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.321\nSo, what we did is we did\na little quick capture.\n\n485\n00:23:01.321 --> 00:23:03.190\nAnd actually, we didn't do it,\nbecause Mike did it.\n\n486\n00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:06.660\nI'm using the royal we, because Mike's the\none who actually did all the work here.\n\n487\n00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:09.090\nBut what we're looking\nat is a data capture.\n\n488\n00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.320\nAnd we've examined one packet.\n\n489\n00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.980\nSo we blew up just any one of the packets\nthat was in there, didn't really matter\n\n490\n00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:17.200\nwhich Now we're down on the TCP,\nTransmission Control Protocol line.\n\n491\n00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.930\nDown towards the bottom of the middle\nviewer window, which is the actual frame\n\n492\n00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:25.665\nthat we can see packet information,\nin what is acceptable to us as humans.\n\n493\n00:23:25.665 --> 00:23:27.130\nNon-hex in other words.\n\n494\n00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:28.410\nAnd then if we look\ndown below at the very,\n\n495\n00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.030\nvery bottom frame,\nwe're actually seeing it in hex.\n\n496\n00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.220\nSo we're seeing the hexadecimal\ninformation there.\n\n497\n00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.630\nBut that's not really going\nto do us to much good.\n\n498\n00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:35.930\nWe gotta to look up above.\n\n499\n00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:40.139\nAnd so what we're looking for in this case\nto execute a blind high jacking attack is\n\n500\n00:23:40.139 --> 00:23:43.738\nthe packet sequence number, and\nI believe Mike is pointing to it, and\n\n501\n00:23:43.738 --> 00:23:47.906\nhas it highlighted there for us and it's\na sequence packet number ID [CROSSTALK].\n\n502\n00:23:47.906 --> 00:23:51.151\n>> This one was started with 0, and\nthen I can jump down to the next,\n\n503\n00:23:51.151 --> 00:23:55.163\nyou can actually see what Adam was talking\nabout earlier with the Sin and Syntax.\n\n504\n00:23:55.163 --> 00:23:56.810\nAnd yeah,\nwhat I did is I went out to Google.\n\n505\n00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:57.540\n>> Oh, through a handshake.\n\n506\n00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.320\n>> Through a webpage see.\n\n507\n00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.786\n>> Awesome.\n>> You can actually see the three\n\n508\n00:23:59.786 --> 00:24:01.754\nway handshake that Adam\nwas talking about earlier.\n\n509\n00:24:01.754 --> 00:24:05.129\nAnd then the second pack went Adam\njumps to a sequence number of 1.\n\n510\n00:24:05.129 --> 00:24:07.628\nNow these are Setting\nrelative sequence numbers.\n\n511\n00:24:07.628 --> 00:24:09.004\n>> Okay so we have our sequence number.\n\n512\n00:24:09.004 --> 00:24:10.463\nWe went from zero, we went to one.\n\n513\n00:24:10.463 --> 00:24:14.003\nAnd so the idea is that every packet\nis gonna be given an identifier, or\n\n514\n00:24:14.003 --> 00:24:15.030\na sequence number.\n\n515\n00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.280\nI'm one of seven.\n\n516\n00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.140\nI'm one of five.\n\n517\n00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.565\nRight?\nIt's kind of like the Borg, right?\n\n518\n00:24:18.565 --> 00:24:20.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> One of seven.\n\n519\n00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.960\nSo the idea is that that\nsequence number is critical.\n\n520\n00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:28.110\nIt is effectively going to tell us what\npart of the puzzle that data packet\n\n521\n00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:31.770\nbelongs to in terms of stitching\nback together our information.\n\n522\n00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:37.395\nIf you'll imagine basically\na jigsaw puzzle right?\n\n523\n00:24:37.395 --> 00:24:40.865\nAnd you imagine all these pieces\nthat together form a picture, but\n\n524\n00:24:40.865 --> 00:24:43.965\nthey're scattered broken up,\nand although they're numbered\n\n525\n00:24:43.965 --> 00:24:46.515\nthey're not necessarily gonna\nbe coming in in the right order.\n\n526\n00:24:46.515 --> 00:24:49.805\nAnd they have to be put back together\nin the right way to effectively create\n\n527\n00:24:49.805 --> 00:24:51.095\nthe overall picture.\n\n528\n00:24:51.095 --> 00:24:54.225\nThe sequence number is that number you\nwould see on the back of the piece of\n\n529\n00:24:54.225 --> 00:24:56.995\nthe puzzle where you'd turn it over and\nsay oh its number five I\n\n530\n00:24:56.995 --> 00:25:00.590\nhave to hook that up with one through\nfour and then I gotta put six after it.\n\n531\n00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.590\nAnd that's what the sequence number does.\n\n532\n00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.990\nThe blind hijacking attack\ntakes advantage of this.\n\n533\n00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:08.900\nWill send several packets into the network\nfrom outside and we will try to then get\n\n534\n00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:12.810\nback information to help us figure\nout what the sequence numbers are.\n\n535\n00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.350\nWe'll then try to sample\nthe sequence numbers in effect.\n\n536\n00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.420\nBy doing that we're then gonna start\ncrafting attack packets that jump in and\n\n537\n00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.150\ntake advantage of that sequencing and\nbecause of that if we get it right, and\n\n538\n00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:26.670\nagain these are hard attacks to\npropagate the sophisticated stuff.\n\n539\n00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.450\nYou gotta use automated technology and\n\n540\n00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:33.170\nyou gotta be quick because thousands\nof packets are transiting every second.\n\n541\n00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:37.860\nSo if we could get it right what happens\nis we now substitute our packets in\n\n542\n00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.600\nthe sequence for\nthe packets that should have been there.\n\n543\n00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:44.370\nWe obviously attack and take offline the\nmachine that was sending these packets,\n\n544\n00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:48.730\nand we substitute our self for that, and\nwe make the attack packets look like it\n\n545\n00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.988\ncame from that machine\nwith the right sequencing.\n\n546\n00:25:50.988 --> 00:25:54.600\nWe in effect would pick up the\nconversation right where we left off, and\n\n547\n00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.930\nas a result of that, right?\n\n548\n00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:59.660\nWhat ultimately happens is\nthat we effectively are seeing\n\n549\n00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.500\nas if that's really us, or at least\nto the receiving system it seems like\n\n550\n00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.820\nwe're still having the same conversation,\nbut in effect we've taken it over and\n\n551\n00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:10.360\nwe're now sending you crafted packets\nspecific to our needs and what we want to\n\n552\n00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.050\naccomplish typically to get some sort of\nadvantage on the machine and take it over.\n\n553\n00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.360\nSo this is what's called\na blind hijacking attacking.\n\n554\n00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.064\nWe may also have man\nin the middle attacks.\n\n555\n00:26:18.064 --> 00:26:20.920\nMan in the middle attacks another\nkind of attack that occurs.\n\n556\n00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.360\nThis is where effectively we try to\ninsert ourselves between the sender and\n\n557\n00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.210\nthe receiver.\n\n558\n00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:28.380\nWe may just surreptitiously\nquietly listen and observe, but\n\n559\n00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:31.850\nultimately we may go active try\nto knock the sender off line and\n\n560\n00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.840\nthen effectively take over their identity.\n\n561\n00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.740\nSo a man in the middle attack then becomes\na spoof, or masquerade attack because now\n\n562\n00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:41.010\nwe've gone active and we're trying to\npretend to be somebody that we're not, but\n\n563\n00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.740\nif all we're doing is\nsurreptitiously quietly listening\n\n564\n00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.540\nrecording information for future use,\nthen it's a man in the middle attack.\n\n565\n00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.210\nBecause we're not really doing anything.\n\n566\n00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:51.940\nWe're just effectively gathering\nall the communications and\n\n567\n00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.070\nmonitoring them as they go back and forth.\n\n568\n00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:57.140\nVery insidious very,\nvery dark and scary stuff.\n\n569\n00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.060\nTo combat all these kind of things we want\nto think about establishing what's known\n\n570\n00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.180\nas a security perimeter.\n\n571\n00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.650\nWe've talked about this with\nthe outer edge the boundary.\n\n572\n00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.510\nThe idea's that we may have\nmore than one boundary.\n\n573\n00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:10.760\nWe're gonna take a look at something\ncalled a DMZ in just a second, but\n\n574\n00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.000\nwe may actually have the ability to\nbe able to go in and create a DMZ.\n\n575\n00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.920\nAnd you've probably heard\nus talk about DMZs before.\n\n576\n00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.140\nThe demilitarize zone.\n\n577\n00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:22.020\nThe thought process behind it being\nthat we can create an external\n\n578\n00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.490\nuntrusted area of the network as\nI do this and my arm goes away.\n\n579\n00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:27.960\nWe do an internal untrusted\nnetwork like that.\n\n580\n00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.080\nWe do an internal trusted,\nexternal untrusted, and we have a place\n\n581\n00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.710\nin the middle which is labeled the DMZ\non this beautiful diagram we have here.\n\n582\n00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:38.730\nAnd that DMZ is gonna be semi-trusted,\nsemi-untrusted.\n\n583\n00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.620\nSo the internet cloud on\nthe right of the diagram\n\n584\n00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:43.790\nis gonna be external untrusted network.\n\n585\n00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.840\nThe first brick like structure\nthere is a firewall.\n\n586\n00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.100\nWe're then gonna have an internal\nnetwork that is partially trusted,\n\n587\n00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.260\npartially untrusted.\n\n588\n00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:53.590\nThe DMZ.\nWe're then gonna have another firewall.\n\n589\n00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:56.540\nWe're then gonna have\nan internal intranet.\n\n590\n00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.885\nI like how you use the old school\nstyle as opposed to the private cloud\n\n591\n00:28:00.885 --> 00:28:04.167\nupdated version that we buy into for\nmarketing purposes.\n\n592\n00:28:04.167 --> 00:28:05.165\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH] I haven't updated my\n\n593\n00:28:05.165 --> 00:28:05.855\nterminology.\n\n594\n00:28:05.855 --> 00:28:07.185\n>> We havent updated the terminology yet.\n\n595\n00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:09.080\nMike's a little behind\nthe times unfortunately.\n\n596\n00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.095\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we have the internal intranet and\n\n597\n00:28:12.095 --> 00:28:15.525\nthe idea is that the DMZ is gonna offer\nus the capability to host things, and\n\n598\n00:28:15.525 --> 00:28:18.805\nI'm guessing Mike those maybe\nweb servers for instance right.\n\n599\n00:28:18.805 --> 00:28:21.475\nThey may be boundary security devices.\n\n600\n00:28:21.475 --> 00:28:23.480\nThey may be-\n>> Front end mail server.\n\n601\n00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.700\n>> Front end mail server, so yeah like\na client access server, or CAS or\n\n602\n00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:27.900\nsomething like that.\n\n603\n00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.540\nSo whatever they may be they're gonna be\nsystems that we want to make available,\n\n604\n00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.030\nbut we don't totally wanna expose\nbeyond the external firewall, so\n\n605\n00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.420\nthey have no protection.\n\n606\n00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:37.880\nAnd so this a security perimeter.\n\n607\n00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.930\nThis is one example of one.\n\n608\n00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.609\nI think we have another picture of one\nthat's taken also that shows a slightly\n\n609\n00:28:42.609 --> 00:28:44.779\ndifferent view of\nthe same thought process.\n\n610\n00:28:44.779 --> 00:28:47.630\nIt's a single firewall based DMZ.\n\n611\n00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:52.180\nWe can create a firewall rather a DMZ\nphysically by having two firewalls and\n\n612\n00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:55.890\nputting stuff between them, or we can\ncreate it off one firewall logically by\n\n613\n00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:59.370\nhaving multiple network access points,\nnetwork cards, or\n\n614\n00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:02.640\ninterfaces that effectively\nconnect to different networks, and\n\n615\n00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.450\ncreate a sub area the DMZ off to one side,\nbut we use a single device to do so.\n\n616\n00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:10.730\nNeither of these is good or bad,\nneither of these is right or wrong.\n\n617\n00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:13.180\nIt's just a matter of how you\nchoose to architect it, but\n\n618\n00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:16.610\ndo understand that the one disadvantage\nwith this particular model\n\n619\n00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.840\nIs that we have what's known\nas a single point of failure.\n\n620\n00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:21.910\nIf that firewall were for\nany reason be compromised, or for\n\n621\n00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:26.460\nsome reason to fail, then in effect\nthe best case in that scenario would be\n\n622\n00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.740\nthat all traffic stops flowing\nbecause then we can't get anywhere.\n\n623\n00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.600\nThat's gonna be bad, but it's gonna\nbe good from a security perspective.\n\n624\n00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.770\nThe worst case would be that it fails\nopen instead of failing secure,\n\n625\n00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:39.220\nand if it fails open and\nall the traffic is simply exposed, and\n\n626\n00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.590\nthe networks are exposed we may\nnow actually have a problem.\n\n627\n00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:44.330\nSo again we have to think\nabout the architecture and\n\n628\n00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:45.940\nthe logic of how we set this up, right.\n\n629\n00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.980\nThis is all obviously\ngonna be very important.\n\n630\n00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.590\nSo security perimeters\nare gonna be important and\n\n631\n00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.960\nnetwork partitioning is\nalso very important.\n\n632\n00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:59.200\nWe may see internal network areas within\nthe LAN overall being carved out for\n\n633\n00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.010\nextra security, and extra focus,\nextra capabilities about this, right?\n\n634\n00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:06.620\nWe just showed you one way to create\na DMZ with a single firewall, but\n\n635\n00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:09.890\nwe would call that a dual honed or\nmulti honed device.\n\n636\n00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.520\nMultiple network connections\non there that we can use, and\n\n637\n00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.720\nwe can use that thought process to be able\nto create secure internal areas as well.\n\n638\n00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.490\nSo wanna be thinking about\nnetwork partitioning and\n\n639\n00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:22.380\nsecurity perimeters both external to\nthe network, on the boundary, but\n\n640\n00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:25.530\nalso potentially internally as we step\nback, cuz we may have a need to be able to\n\n641\n00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:29.890\nsecure internal areas and make sure\nthat we are doing so in a proper way.\n\n642\n00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:31.660\nSo we just wanna make sure that\nyou're aware of those things, and\n\n643\n00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.840\nthe last thing we wanna\nthrow out there for\n\n644\n00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.590\nyou is something called a bastion host.\n\n645\n00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.340\nIt's fun to say also by the way.\n\n646\n00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.440\nBastion host.\n\n647\n00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.478\nSounds impressive and dark and doomy.\n\n648\n00:30:39.478 --> 00:30:40.640\nHave a bastion host.\n\n649\n00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.540\nStripe.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n650\n00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.200\n>> Luke I'm your father all right.\n\n651\n00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.380\nBy the way hey isn't that like\na big thing right Star Wars?\n\n652\n00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:45.890\n>> Yeah coming up.\n\n653\n00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.040\n>> Luke I'm your father that's coming up,\nso Star Wars.\n\n654\n00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:51.680\nSo the bastion host is gonna be a machine\n\n655\n00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.250\nthat is going to be effectively\nwhat we call fortified.\n\n656\n00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:55.340\nIt's a hardened machine.\n\n657\n00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.130\nWhen we use the term bastion\nhost what we mean is a machine\n\n658\n00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:02.400\nthat is all services that are no longer\nnecessary, no longer needed, stripped out.\n\n659\n00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.850\nAll the applications we don't\nneed are stripped away.\n\n660\n00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:09.340\nWe should just be running the minimal\nthings necessary to make that system work,\n\n661\n00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.420\nand if we do that we're\nhardening the host, and\n\n662\n00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.620\nwe formally refer to\nthat as a bastion host.\n\n663\n00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.570\nJust wanna make sure you're aware\nof that terminology as well.\n\n664\n00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.320\n>> Very good Adam.\n\n665\n00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:18.600\nA lot of great information there.\n\n666\n00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.960\nWe took a look at wireless networks\nsome of the encryption that we would use\n\n667\n00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:22.950\non wireless.\n\n668\n00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:26.990\nSome of the different IEEE\nstandards we gotta be familiar with\n\n669\n00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:31.580\nas well as starting getting into laying\nout your network and creating DMZ, or\n\n670\n00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:34.700\nscreen sub-nets or perimeters both\n\n671\n00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:39.070\nwith outside of our network to keep the as\nyou say the bad actors from getting in.\n\n672\n00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:42.450\nBut then possible internally as well for\nmore restricted portions of our network\n\n673\n00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:45.420\nthat not everybody in\nthe company needs access too.\n\n674\n00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:47.920\nSo great information Adam thank you for\nall of that.\n\n675\n00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.600\nRemember if you guys want to sit in one\nof Adam's classes live shoot us an email\n\n676\n00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.080\nat

00:32:09.510\nJust before we sign off quick.\n\n685\n00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.870\nDo you guys really know what IEEE is?\n\n686\n00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:11.750\nDo you know what IEEE is?\n\n687\n00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:12.640\nWe often talk about it.\n\n688\n00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.440\n>> Let's see.\n\n689\n00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.090\nInstitute of Electronics and\nElectrical

formal title,\n\n692\n00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.850\nbut either way Mike was right,\nso bonus points for him.\n\n693\n00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:27.200\nBut when we talk about IEEE we want you to\nknow that it is an actual organization.\n\n694\n00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.120\nYou should go out and check it out.\n\n695\n00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.700\nThat's where all the standards come from.\n\n696\n00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:30.380\nHaving said that.\n\n697\n00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.030\n>> It makes for great bed time reading.\n\n698\n00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.340\n>> It does.\nVery, very good stuff.\n\n699\n00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:35.450\nIt's better than hitting yourself\nin the head with a phone book.\n\n700\n00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:36.170\n>> There you go.\n\n701\n00:32:36.170

--> 00:00:17.500\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.090\nToday we're doing our cissp content and\n\n5\n00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.790\nspecifically we're going to be going\ninto securing our network devices.\n\n6\n00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.910\nThese are things like routers, switches,\nwireless access points to name a couple.\n\n7\n00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.090\nAs well as the media that we\nuse to connect these devices.\n\n8\n00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.690\nAnd to help us with all that,\nwe get a mister Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.920\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.750\n>> Good.\nYou know\n\n11\n00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.950\nit's great when we can talk\nabout this stuff obviously.\n\n12\n00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.120\nRight and we have a lot of fun talking\nabout it with you but obviously when\n\n13\n00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.080\nwe focus in on one specific area we\nwant to spend a little bit of time.\n\n14\n00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.970\nAnd so what we're going to do here\nin particular is talk about some of\n\n15\n00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.930\nthe hardware.\n\n16\n00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.780\nSome of the things that we often use and\nwe may take for\n\n17\n00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.640\ngranted in order to\nconnect things together.\n\n18\n00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.460\nSome old stuff.\n\n19\n00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.590\nThings like modems.\n\n20\n00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.300\nSome new stuff.\n\n21\n00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.490\nYou heard Mike talk about routers and\nswitches.\n\n22\n00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.250\nWe'll mix and blend things together, but\nwhat we want to do ultimately is talk\n\n23\n00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.200\nabout how we can see these devices,\nnot so much from the usage perspective.\n\n24\n00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.620\nWe're not gonna tell\nyou what a modem does,\n\n25\n00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.900\nI'm not gonna spend time\nexplaining what devices do.\n\n26\n00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.780\nI'm gonna remind you of what they do but\nmost importantly we're gonna focus on how\n\n27\n00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.900\nwhat they do can be used to\npotentially cause security problems.\n\n28\n00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.930\nSo as a result of that, how do we defend\nagainst those prompts really what the goal\n\n29\n00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.240\nof securing network components and\ndevices is going to be.\n\n30\n00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.890\nSo lets jump in.\n\n31\n00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.710\nLets start with something\nknown as a modem.\n\n32\n00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.310\nAn older school technology, modulation\ndemodulation is what modem stands for,\n\n33\n00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.290\ngoing from analog to digital,\ndigital back to analog.\n\n34\n00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.000\nThe idea very popular many,\nmany moons ago.\n\n35\n00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.780\nIf you remember a movie called WarGames,\nMatthew Broderick and\n\n36\n00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.580\nAlly Sheedy were both I think like 12\nyears old when this movie came out.\n\n37\n00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.225\nOne of the first things he did,\ncinematographic masterpiece, a classic.\n\n38\n00:01:47.225 --> 00:01:47.775\nPretty cool movie.\n\n39\n00:01:47.775 --> 00:01:51.805\nOne of the interesting things about it\nwas that we saw Matthew Broderick doing\n\n40\n00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:54.635\nthe whole hacking thing,\nwhich is one of the premises of the movie.\n\n41\n00:01:54.635 --> 00:01:58.625\nHe was using a Haze Bar 1,200 modem,\nso you saw this massive modem,\n\n42\n00:01:58.625 --> 00:02:00.335\nit's probably the size of my laptop.\n\n43\n00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:04.905\nBig suction cups on it with big\nanalog rotary dial phone on it, and\n\n44\n00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:07.015\nhe was actually using that and\nhacking in and\n\n45\n00:02:07.015 --> 00:02:09.660\nultimately finds out how\nto get in the computers.\n\n46\n00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.770\nAnd he uses a modem to do this.\n\n47\n00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.320\nThis is kind of the premise of the movie.\n\n48\n00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.040\nIf you haven't seen this you\nshould go out and rent it.\n\n49\n00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.165\nIt's actually a pretty cool movie.\n\n50\n00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:15.800\n>> Absolutely.\n\n51\n00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.750\n>> So the idea behind a modem is\neffectively a translation device.\n\n52\n00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.660\nModems allow us to hook up a phone line,\nan analogue phone line\n\n53\n00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.120\nin the old school way of thinking about\nthings, and communicate across it.\n\n54\n00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.220\nModems are still around.\n\n55\n00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.220\nIt's not as if they've totally gone away.\n\n56\n00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.580\nWe don't see them very often.\n\n57\n00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.220\nWe don't use them very often.\n\n58\n00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.400\nWell we may not realize they're there.\n\n59\n00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.350\nWe've talked a little bit about creating\na security perimeter, creating a boundary\n\n60\n00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.260\nwithin the network, outside of the\nnetwork, in the network, things like that.\n\n61\n00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.960\nThought about DMZ's for instance.\n\n62\n00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.870\nWe've also talked about doing a survey\nto understand what is there and\n\n63\n00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.970\nthen how to protect the things you find.\n\n64\n00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.410\nOne of the things we often find when\nwe come in and do audit work and\n\n65\n00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.970\nsurveys it that you may still have\nmodems that are sitting in systems, but\n\n66\n00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.729\nyou're just not familiar\nwith the fact they're there.\n\n67\n00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.750\nPbx systems traditionally will have\nmodems in them for maintenance purposes.\n\n68\n00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.840\nSo a vendor may have installed the pbx and\nif you are still using an older analog pbx\n\n69\n00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.500\nnot a digital one,\nyou haven't gone to a gateway.\n\n70\n00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.300\nAn h3 23 voice gateway for\n\n71\n00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.080\nvoid but rather an older pbx\nthat's mounted up on the wall.\n\n72\n00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.760\nThe way you know this is if you go into\nyour network telco system or your closet,\n\n73\n00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.950\nwherever your wiring is.\n\n74\n00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.770\nAnd if you see three or four big gray or\nbrown looking boxes hanging\n\n75\n00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.910\nabout halfway up on the ceiling and\nthey're kind of bolted to the wall,\n\n76\n00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.670\nthere's a bunch of cables\ngoing to the bottom of them,\n\n77\n00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.980\nthen you probably have an older PBX, cuz\nthat's what those things would have been.\n\n78\n00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.160\nThose have modems in them.\n\n79\n00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.710\nThat's how the vendor would\nbe able to get in and\n\n80\n00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.000\nservice them from externally,\nfrom outside.\n\n81\n00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.900\nAnd that's how we would often\ndo updates to the system.\n\n82\n00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.010\nSo if you have those still active,\n\n83\n00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.390\nyou actually have modems\nwhether you realize it or not.\n\n84\n00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.820\nLaptops, older laptops, come with modems.\n\n85\n00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.370\nMine actually doesn't have a modem, but\nit does have a cover over the modem\n\n86\n00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.640\nport back here somewhere where\nthe modem would have gone.\n\n87\n00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.520\nSo there's no modem in my machine but\n\n88\n00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.720\nyou actually can still\nget systems with modems.\n\n89\n00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.000\nYou just have to order them specially.\n\n90\n00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.470\nSo the reality is you still\nmay see them out there.\n\n91\n00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.440\nThe trick with a modem is to understand\nthat if a modem is plugged in,\n\n92\n00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.250\nyou essentially are going over\nan unrestricted, uncontrolled,\n\n93\n00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.150\nunmonitored separate communication\nchannel, an analog phone line.\n\n94\n00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.810\nAnd the problem is,\n\n95\n00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.530\nit's not going to be subject to\nthe normal monitoring we often do.\n\n96\n00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.340\nMeaning the IDS, the IPS, the firewall\nis not going to be aware of the analog\n\n97\n00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.840\ncommunication taking\nplace across the modem.\n\n98\n00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.353\nWe don't tend to have systems that\nmonitor phone lines that way is what I'm\n\n99\n00:04:26.353 --> 00:04:27.318\nsuggesting to you.\n\n100\n00:04:27.318 --> 00:04:30.950\nAnd those systems we use today were\nnot designed with that in mind.\n\n101\n00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.370\nSo if you have a modem and\nyou're communicating across it,\n\n102\n00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.160\nyou're effectively communicating on a\nseparate network we have no knowledge of.\n\n103\n00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.390\nWe will call this an out of band, right?\n\n104\n00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.400\nCommunication mechanisms\nwe've talked about.\n\n105\n00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.230\nAnd this would be a communication channel\nthat we don't have any real knowledge of\n\n106\n00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.720\nor vision of or ability to understand.\n\n107\n00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.220\nI'm not saying that's a good or\na bad thing.\n\n108\n00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.680\nI'm just pointing out to you\nthat from that perspective\n\n109\n00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.360\nit's effectively an unrestricted\ncommunication channel.\n\n110\n00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.150\nNo knowledge of what goes on there,\nit could be good,\n\n111\n00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.080\nit could be bad, we don't really know.\n\n112\n00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.560\nIt's not gonna be fast, we know that, but\n\n113\n00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.540\nit's not gonna be necessarily\nsomething that we have knowledge of.\n\n114\n00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.510\nIt was like a delayed joke reaction.\n\n115\n00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.560\n>> Sorry.\n>> I threw that out there,\n\n116\n00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.330\nMike's going along, yeah okay,\nAdam's talking, I'm cool.\n\n117\n00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.495\nOh wait, he said something funny,\nlet me laugh for a second.\n\n118\n00:05:10.495 --> 00:05:13.090\n>> [LAUGHTER]\n>> So remember what my, my reference to\n\n119\n00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.870\nthat is the fact that modem lines are\ntraditionally much, much slower, right?\n\n120\n00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.060\nThis is an analog communication mechanism.\n\n121\n00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.030\nWe're ranking and\nrating this in kilobits per second.\n\n122\n00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.990\nNot megabits per second,\nnot gigabits per second.\n\n123\n00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.510\nThis is hurry up and wait.\n\n124\n00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.580\nThis is not hurry up and send,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n125\n00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.350\nWe also have concentrators,\nmultiplexers, hubs and repeaters.\n\n126\n00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.540\nA lot of this is old technology we haven't\nreally seen or talked about much or\n\n127\n00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.430\neven know much about anymore.\n\n128\n00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.400\nI mentioned hubs and repeaters in our\nconversation about the OSI model.\n\n129\n00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.940\nIf you remember they\nare a layer one device.\n\n130\n00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.800\nEven though we don't see them\nindependently anymore they've been rolled\n\n131\n00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.670\nup into the functionality of a switch, but\n\n132\n00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.820\nwe do still want to at\nleast be aware of those.\n\n133\n00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.740\nConcentrators and multiplexers are things\nthat you may actually see, still,\n\n134\n00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.890\nin certain systems.\n\n135\n00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.360\nA concentrator's going to affect when we\ntake multiple devices, multiplex them,\n\n136\n00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.050\nconnect them into a system that allows\nthem to effectively be seen as one and\n\n137\n00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.530\ntransmit as one signal.\n\n138\n00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.680\nSo a concentrator will typically bring\ntogether multiple system signals and\n\n139\n00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.020\nthen, effectively,\ncreate one channel for them.\n\n140\n00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.730\nA multiplexer is gonna effectively\ngoing to be able to effectively,\n\n141\n00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.170\nI just said effectively twice didn't I.\n\n142\n00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.020\nEffectively, Effectively.\n\n143\n00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.306\nWill effectively combine,\nit's very effective.\n\n144\n00:06:19.306 --> 00:06:20.350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Will effectively combine\n\n145\n00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.770\nmultiple signals into a single signal for\ntransmission as well.\n\n146\n00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.170\nSimilar to what a concentrator does.\n\n147\n00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.970\nA concentrator will multiplex, or\ntake multiple devices, transmit and\n\n148\n00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:33.790\ncreate one association for them, so\n\n149\n00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.840\nthe concentrator brings together\nmultiple devices to multiplex,\n\n150\n00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.840\nwhereas the multiplexer is effectively\njust focusing on the signal.\n\n151\n00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.230\nIn sending out one signal.\n\n152\n00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.590\nWe used to see these with early T1 lines,\nwith DSL technology,\n\n153\n00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.060\nso if you had business DSL you\nwould have seen multiplexers and or\n\n154\n00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.580\nconcentrators probably.\n\n155\n00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.780\nIf you got a fractional T1,\nat some point in time,\n\n156\n00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.370\nyou would have seen a multiplexer which\nwe often would call a channel bank.\n\n157\n00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.640\nIt's what you sometimes referred to as.\n\n158\n00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.160\nYou would see these,\nthey were usually rack mounted devices\n\n159\n00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.930\nthat would sit in the network room, be\nconnected up to the big box on the wall.\n\n160\n00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.150\nThe huge cable coming out of it\nwith the T1 circuits early on.\n\n161\n00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.750\nThese are the kinds of\nthings you may have seen.\n\n162\n00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.290\nYou don't tend to see them much anymore.\n\n163\n00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.970\nThese are just not devices and\ntechnologies that tend to be very\n\n164\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:17.120\nprevalent, but you at least wanna\nhave a sense of what they are.\n\n165\n00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.950\nWe also want to think about front end\nprocessors, again older technology.\n\n166\n00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:26.190\nThis is just IT geek speak for\na front end or a thin client system\n\n167\n00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:29.640\nthat would do the data input for\na back end main frame system.\n\n168\n00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:32.780\nThat's what front end processors\ntraditionally were referred to as.\n\n169\n00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:33.770\nWe talked about the fact,\n\n170\n00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.020\nin one of our prior conversations\nin the OSI model episode,\n\n171\n00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.850\nthat bridges are gonna be seen as a layer\ntwo device, just reminding you about that.\n\n172\n00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:44.530\nSwitches are also seen as a layer two\ndevice, wanna remind you about that, even\n\n173\n00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.670\nthough we agreed and talked about, may\nsee them as other layer devices as well.\n\n174\n00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.200\nCertainly layer three switches\nare very common today.\n\n175\n00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.940\nBut you traditionally think of\na switch as a layer two device.\n\n176\n00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:55.852\nWe talked about routers\nbeing a layer three device.\n\n177\n00:07:55.852 --> 00:07:57.896\nWant to know that and\nbe aware of that as well.\n\n178\n00:07:57.896 --> 00:08:00.518\nRemember routers are gonna\nroute packets between networks.\n\n179\n00:08:00.518 --> 00:08:04.676\nWe talked about how deterministic\nrouting works Talk about how MPLS works.\n\n180\n00:08:04.676 --> 00:08:06.197\nYou know, these are things to consider.\n\n181\n00:08:06.197 --> 00:08:09.949\nWe have firewalls, firewalls are gonna\nbe devices that are border devices, or\n\n182\n00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:12.490\ngateway devices, that provide protection.\n\n183\n00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.230\nThey provide inbound and\noutbound, or ingress and\n\n184\n00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.630\negress as it's often referred to,\nfiltering.\n\n185\n00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.400\nSo they examine packet flow.\n\n186\n00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.240\nThey can work as either stateful or\nstateless, meaning earlier,\n\n187\n00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:29.070\nfirst generation devices, what we call\nfirst gen firewalls were often stateless.\n\n188\n00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:30.760\nThey did not pay attention to state.\n\n189\n00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.520\nWhat we mean by state is\nactually session continuity.\n\n190\n00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.270\nAnd so when we would send a packet\nthrough the firewall, let's say I'm on\n\n191\n00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.350\nthe outside of the firewall and\nI'm gonna send the packet over to Mike.\n\n192\n00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.190\nCan do a, just a slightly wider shots so\nboth of us can be in the shot and\n\n193\n00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.090\nwe'll kind of do a demonstration for\nyou in real time.\n\n194\n00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:46.970\n>> Let's do number five.\n\n195\n00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:50.392\n>> No we don't need our number five,\nwe're gonna use our trusty packet device.\n\n196\n00:08:50.392 --> 00:08:53.970\nWe're gonna our trusty packet\ndevice that has a real face on it.\n\n197\n00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.980\nSo what we're going to do is we're\ngoing to transmit a packet here.\n\n198\n00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.520\nWe're going to think about\nthis as being a firewall.\n\n199\n00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.230\nIf we're going to transmit\npackets back and forth,\n\n200\n00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.680\nright, what we have to do is we have to\nunderstand that when I'm sending, and\n\n201\n00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.240\nMike is the firewall, so\nI'm going to send the packet to Mike.\n\n202\n00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.620\nThis is going to be our packet right here.\n\n203\n00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.510\nWhatever we call him, Shaggy, right?\n\n204\n00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:13.640\nSo Shag,\nyou're a little hairy pin guy here.\n\n205\n00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.480\nWe're gonna send Shaggy over to Mike.\n\n206\n00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.870\nI'm gonna send this to the firewall.\n\n207\n00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.700\nSo I'm gonna transmit this to Mike,\nMike's gonna get the packet.\n\n208\n00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.070\nMike's gonna examine the packet.\n\n209\n00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:23.585\nHe's gonna look at it,\nfigure out what's going on with it.\n\n210\n00:09:23.585 --> 00:09:26.485\nIt's a nice-looking packet,\nvery sharp, got a good hairdo, right?\n\n211\n00:09:26.485 --> 00:09:28.285\nSo Mike's gonna note was that packet is.\n\n212\n00:09:28.285 --> 00:09:32.285\nAnd Mike's gonna use a set of rules on the\nfirewall to be able to decide whether or\n\n213\n00:09:32.285 --> 00:09:34.525\nnot he wants to be able to\naccept that packet, right?\n\n214\n00:09:34.525 --> 00:09:38.905\nAnd so if that rule says accept all blue\nshaggy haired packets that come through\n\n215\n00:09:38.905 --> 00:09:42.625\nthe firewall coming from Adam,\nMike's gonna pass that on, as he's doing.\n\n216\n00:09:42.625 --> 00:09:44.920\nAnd he'll just transmit\nit somewhere over there.\n\n217\n00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.440\nNow if I send another packet in, and we'll\nsay that the next packet is just going to\n\n218\n00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.960\nbe the plain old fashioned pen,\nnot blue and shaggy here.\n\n219\n00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.360\nI'm going to send Mike another packet.\n\n220\n00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.570\nSo I send that over to Mike.\n\n221\n00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.480\nHe again accepts the inbound packet.\n\n222\n00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.070\nHe examines it based on the same rules.\n\n223\n00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.580\nIf Mike is operating as a stateless\nfirewall, a 1st gen firewall,\n\n224\n00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.700\nMike has no knowledge.\n\n225\n00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.650\nHe has no memory of what he just\nsaw with that other packet.\n\n226\n00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:07.510\nIt's gone.\n\n227\n00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.660\nHe saw it, he did what he had to do and\nhe forgot about it promptly.\n\n228\n00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:14.150\nSo the problem becomes that\nthis packet that I just sent in\n\n229\n00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.380\nis in now way connected\nto the other packets.\n\n230\n00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:20.110\nAnd this is obviously still an issue\nbecause the problem can become if I\n\n231\n00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.680\nreally meant for those two\npackets to be linked together and\n\n232\n00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.900\nI was trying to push attack\ntraffic through the firewall.\n\n233\n00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.990\nBut I was fragmenting and\nI was breaking it up and\n\n234\n00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.450\nmaking it look like it\ndoesn't belong together.\n\n235\n00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.840\nI'd been successful if the firewall\nis stateless, because the problem\n\n236\n00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.450\nis that if it's stateless he's\nnot paying attention to state.\n\n237\n00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.550\nHe doesn't know the session connection and\nthe continuity of that packet.\n\n238\n00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.120\nHowever, if we are doing\na stateful firewall, right,\n\n239\n00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.450\na firewall that is stateful that\nis next gen or second, third,\n\n240\n00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.210\nfourth generation firewalls\nwhich are stateful.\n\n241\n00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:52.440\nWhat's gonna effectively happen is\nultimately he's gonna keep track of,\n\n242\n00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.040\nMike our firewall, he's gonna keep track\nof both packets, and so when I send packet\n\n243\n00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.940\nnumber one over to Mike, right, and I send\nit and he processes it, does his thing.\n\n244\n00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.980\nAnd I then send packet number two, Mike's\ngonna stop and say well wait a second,\n\n245\n00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.640\nI have to examine both, but\nI already examined one.\n\n246\n00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.160\nIs this packet part of\nthat same transmission?\n\n247\n00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.960\nAnd he's gonna effectively\nlook at where it came from and\n\n248\n00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.120\nthe details around it and say,\n\n249\n00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.550\nyou know this is part of the same session,\npart of the same stateful transmission.\n\n250\n00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.190\nSo if Mike is a stateful firewall, he's\ngonna look at the two packets together and\n\n251\n00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:27.252\nhe's gonna examine them and\nunderstand that they may mean something\n\n252\n00:11:27.252 --> 00:11:30.770\njoined together that they may not\nmean when they're split apart.\n\n253\n00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:34.010\nAnd as result of that we are gonna\nhave a stronger solution for\n\n254\n00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.020\nsecurity, because now we are going to be\nable to track states now we are going to\n\n255\n00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.500\nbe able to track intent\nof the packets sent.\n\n256\n00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.580\nThis is very important because when we\ndo this, we now can actually understand\n\n257\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.780\nwhat's going on with all\nthe packets in the stream.\n\n258\n00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:50.450\nIf you remember we talked about session\nIDs in one of our earlier episodes, right?\n\n259\n00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.000\nAnd we took a look at a network capture.\n\n260\n00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.810\nWe had Wireshark up and\n\n261\n00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:56.930\nwe saw that every packet has\na session ID associated with it.\n\n262\n00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.210\nWhat we didn't show you was that\nthere's also a fragment offset,\n\n263\n00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:04.720\na fragment ID is part of the process\nof what goes on inside that host tab.\n\n264\n00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.650\nWe didn't show it to you,\nit wasn't important at the time but\n\n265\n00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.350\nits just good to know it's there.\n\n266\n00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.230\nPoint is if we were setting\nboth these packets,\n\n267\n00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.170\nright, and I said this is packet one but\n\n268\n00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.220\nI'm fragmenting the over-arching amount\nof data that is represented by the send.\n\n269\n00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.560\nI really have multiple packets, right?\n\n270\n00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.190\nDo a little branding here.\n\n271\n00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.190\nWe have multiple packets,\nlook packets right?\n\n272\n00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.410\nSo we have multiple packets and if I\nsay that all three of these are joined\n\n273\n00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:32.130\ntogether as one overarching piece\nof data but I have to segment and\n\n274\n00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.910\nbreak them up I'm gonna frag them.\n\n275\n00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.790\nThis is gonna be, I'm gonna fragment them,\nnot frag them that would be bad.\n\n276\n00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.910\nI'm gonna fragment them.\n\n277\n00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.580\nPacket number one, right?\n\n278\n00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.420\nPacket number two.\n\n279\n00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.160\nRemember the order.\n\n280\n00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.250\nIt's gonna to be important later.\n\n281\n00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:44.010\nPacket number three.\n\n282\n00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.030\nWe're going to play the packet shell game,\nall right.\n\n283\n00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.680\nSo if I send all three packets in to Mike,\nI have to identify this is packet\n\n284\n00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.010\none of three, this is packet two of three,\nthis is packet three of three.\n\n285\n00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:58.150\nAs a result of that when I do that Mike\ncan keep track of all the packets at\n\n286\n00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.170\nthe firewall.\n\n287\n00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.060\nI can keep track of them when I send them\nand the recipient knows what they got and\n\n288\n00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:05.460\nif they got all of them,\nthey're all going to show up.\n\n289\n00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.060\nSo we have several different ways of\nkeeping track of this information.\n\n290\n00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.560\nFragment offsets means,\n\n291\n00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.170\nyou know, it's a larger group of packets\nwe have to identify and put back together.\n\n292\n00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:18.700\nAnd the sequence number is going to tell\nus what packet that is, as part of that.\n\n293\n00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.920\nSo we have to understand that\nwe put these things together.\n\n294\n00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.710\nAnd so a firewall can either\nbe stateful or stateless.\n\n295\n00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.710\nWe really want stateful firewalls today.\n\n296\n00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:26.990\nWe wanna understand state.\n\n297\n00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.960\nThis is very important for us.\n\n298\n00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.660\nPacket filtering can be done by address,\nby service, by protocol, by port.\n\n299\n00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.770\nWhen we talk about address, it could\nbe IP address, could be MAC address.\n\n300\n00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.260\nIt's different ways for\nus to do filtering at the firewall.\n\n301\n00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:42.400\nSo we do wanna make sure\nwe understand that and\n\n302\n00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.240\ndo wanna make sure that we\nare aware of that as well.\n\n303\n00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.080\nThere we go.\n\n304\n00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.090\nMy slides are not moving up and\ndown the way they're supposed to.\n\n305\n00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:50.400\nSo when we think about filtering,\n\n306\n00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.280\nwe're thinking about the idea\nof being able to do this.\n\n307\n00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:57.430\nNow sometimes, we refer to firewall\nfiltering as static versus dynamic.\n\n308\n00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.300\nAs opposed to stateless versus stateful.\n\n309\n00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.530\nStateless versus stateful, static packet\nfiltering versus dynamic packet filtering,\n\n310\n00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.410\nsame conversation ultimately.\n\n311\n00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.670\nStateful inspection is referred\nto as dynamic packet filtering.\n\n312\n00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:14.250\nStatic packet filtering is\noften referred to as stateless.\n\n313\n00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.500\nSo you just may hear it\ninterchangeably either way.\n\n314\n00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.770\nJust want to make sure you're\ncomfortable with the definition or\n\n315\n00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.370\nthe criteria because obviously it's\nimportant to know those things are.\n\n316\n00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:24.290\nWhen we think about transmitting and\n\n317\n00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.520\ndoing things like at a firewall looking\nat traffic, we also have to think about\n\n318\n00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:32.390\nthe media, the actual way in which we\nconnect and the pipe that we create.\n\n319\n00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:36.940\nIs the media gonna be, or the transmission\nmechanism going to be big enough?\n\n320\n00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:37.870\nDo we have enough throughput?\n\n321\n00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.180\nDo we have enough bandwidth?\n\n322\n00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.140\nDo we have too much distance between\nendpoints because we may run out\n\n323\n00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.150\nof ability to send that data forward\nbecause of something known as attenuation?\n\n324\n00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:50.000\nAttenuation implies that we lose forward\nmotion, the ability to effectively send\n\n325\n00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.270\na packet because of resistance or\nfriction on the wire.\n\n326\n00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.210\nSo we have to be aware of that and\nthink about that.\n\n327\n00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.710\nWhat about data sensitivity.\n\n328\n00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:58.260\nAre we sending sensitive data on the wire?\n\n329\n00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.170\nAre we not protecting and encrypting it?\n\n330\n00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.390\nThat obviously can lead to complications\nbecause as you saw with the packet\n\n331\n00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.250\ncapturing we did in a prior episode,\nwe can actually\n\n332\n00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.310\npull data packets right off the wire in\nreal time if the data's not encrypted.\n\n333\n00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.200\nWe didn't really show you\nthe actual message payload, and\n\n334\n00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:15.300\nshow you the data that's\nin the headers there.\n\n335\n00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.870\nBut we actually could have delved right\ninto the middle of the data frame.\n\n336\n00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.810\nAnd we could have seen,\nif it was unencrypted, what that data was.\n\n337\n00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.935\nMike had mentioned he had gone out\nto Google, and kind of looked at\n\n338\n00:15:23.935 --> 00:15:27.355\na page exchange, to be able to set up\nthe three way handshake and do some stuff.\n\n339\n00:15:27.355 --> 00:15:29.995\nHow we actually looked at one of\nthe packets that came back from the web\n\n340\n00:15:29.995 --> 00:15:33.215\nserver, we would have seen the HTTP\ninformation, and would have seen\n\n341\n00:15:33.215 --> 00:15:36.777\nthe raw data inside of there if it\nwasn't encrypted with HTTPS and SSL.\n\n342\n00:15:36.777 --> 00:15:39.457\nSo we would have actually\nbeen able to see that.\n\n343\n00:15:39.457 --> 00:15:42.397\nSo that's something to consider and\nobviously to think about as well.\n\n344\n00:15:42.397 --> 00:15:45.567\nWhen we think about transmission, and\nwe think about something called media,\n\n345\n00:15:45.567 --> 00:15:46.727\nspecifically, the cabling and\n\n346\n00:15:46.727 --> 00:15:50.620\nwiring, we have to also understand\nthere are different types of cable.\n\n347\n00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:54.069\nWe may have twisted pair cable, we may\nhave coaxial cable kinda a really old\n\n348\n00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:56.778\nschool stuff cuz you don't\ntend to see coax much anymore.\n\n349\n00:15:56.778 --> 00:15:59.694\nYou see it at home for your cable-cable\nbut you're not tend to see for\n\n350\n00:15:59.694 --> 00:16:00.655\nnetworking as often.\n\n351\n00:16:00.655 --> 00:16:02.129\nWe may have fiber optic cables.\n\n352\n00:16:02.129 --> 00:16:05.594\nTwisted bear cable is the traditional\nethernet copper wire you're used to\n\n353\n00:16:05.594 --> 00:16:06.930\nusing all the time.\n\n354\n00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.080\nThis may be shielded or unshielded.\n\n355\n00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.610\nIt's simply a matter of whether we wrap it\nwith some additional clatting to protect\n\n356\n00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:18.100\nit from cross talk and to protect it\nfrom electromagnetic interference.\n\n357\n00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.400\nThings of that nature.\n\n358\n00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:24.210\nBut if we use unshielded twisted pair,\nit's still gonna be copper wire cable.\n\n359\n00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:28.360\nThe key there is that effectively it's\njust twisted a certain number of times.\n\n360\n00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.880\nThe more twists we have in the line,\nthe higher the transmission speed,\n\n361\n00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.020\nthe more data that can be\ncarried across in a effect.\n\n362\n00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.830\nI've been talking about this with\nmy students when they ask me okay,\n\n363\n00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.830\ntwisted pair cable, I don't really get it.\n\n364\n00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:41.770\nPeople don't ever stop and\nreally only look at cable today.\n\n365\n00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.570\nThey just have cable and they hook it up.\n\n366\n00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.210\nDid you ever wire up a set of speakers,\nis what I ask people, right?\n\n367\n00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.385\nBecause if you ever did the old fashioned\nway, I'm not talking bluetooth, right?\n\n368\n00:16:49.385 --> 00:16:51.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Where wiring up speakers means I hit\n\n369\n00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.380\na button and boom, they connect.\n\n370\n00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.910\nThat's not wiring, right?\n\n371\n00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:55.510\nThat's something totally different.\n\n372\n00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:57.340\nThe old school way of doing things, right?\n\n373\n00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.220\nThe way we used to do it,\nwas you actually had speaker wire.\n\n374\n00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:00.790\n>> Speaker wire, yeah.\n\n375\n00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.280\n>> Speaker wire would tend to be,\nliterally, just the same kinda thing as\n\n376\n00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.880\ntwisted pair, except it was made from\na different grade of cooper, and it was\n\n377\n00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:14.150\naffected with just small strands of copper\nwire that looked like the end of a broom.\n\n378\n00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.920\nIt was just a whole bunch\nof these little wires.\n\n379\n00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.550\nYou would be twisted,\nthey would be twisted inside the line.\n\n380\n00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.410\nYou would then effectively,\nit was all clear.\n\n381\n00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:22.850\nIf you remember it often came\nwith that polyvinyl coating.\n\n382\n00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:26.490\nYou would cut the end off, kind of\nstrip off maybe about that much or so,\n\n383\n00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.760\nand then you would wrap it, so\nyou would kind of twist them a little bit,\n\n384\n00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.290\ncuz you had to fit them into this hole\nthat was a tenth the size of the actual\n\n385\n00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.420\ngirth of this speaker wire.\n\n386\n00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.600\n>> At some crazy angle.\n\n387\n00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.900\n>> Yeah, at like a 43 and a half degree\nangle, while you're standing on your head.\n\n388\n00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.500\nAnd so you would have to hit the black or\n\n389\n00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.700\nred connectors in the back of the speaker,\nand you would then plug the wire in.\n\n390\n00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.300\nAnd you would do the same thing on\nthe opposite end on the tuner or\n\n391\n00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.710\nwhatever you were connecting it up to,\nand you would effectively then transmit.\n\n392\n00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:54.310\nSpeaker wire is the identical kind of wire\nwe use for twisted pair except it's just\n\n393\n00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:58.200\na better quality wire when we talk about\ntwisted pair, but it's the same thing.\n\n394\n00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.090\nSo if you've ever seen that that's\neffectively what we're talking about.\n\n395\n00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:03.830\nCoax cable is I said,\nis effectively cable cable.\n\n396\n00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.320\nYour at home, I have cable TV cable.\n\n397\n00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.760\nThat's what coax is.\n\n398\n00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.610\nAgain, it's just a slightly\ndifferent grade of cable.\n\n399\n00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.870\nWe use the same general thought\nprocess to produce it though.\n\n400\n00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:15.820\nIt's got a copper wire core in the middle.\n\n401\n00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.840\nIt's wrapped around with\npolyvinyl chloride,\n\n402\n00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.870\nwith PFC kind of a hard\nshell to protect it.\n\n403\n00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.800\nThe coax cable we use for networking\nhas a copper wire mesh inside of it to\n\n404\n00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.920\nprotect it from electromagnetic\ninterference and things like that.\n\n405\n00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.380\nCoax cable at home may not have that, and\n\n406\n00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:34.480\neffectively we would use what\nis known as a BNC connector.\n\n407\n00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.384\nAnd we can get in on that whole myth and\nurban legend of what BNC really means,\n\n408\n00:18:38.384 --> 00:18:41.678\nwhere it came from,\nwhether it is the British Navel Connector,\n\n409\n00:18:41.678 --> 00:18:43.218\nor refers to something else.\n\n410\n00:18:43.218 --> 00:18:48.197\nDon't really care, don't wanna know, but\nif you are interested a BNC connector was\n\n411\n00:18:48.197 --> 00:18:51.515\neffective, if you go look at\nthe back of your cable TV, or\n\n412\n00:18:51.515 --> 00:18:54.932\nthe cable that goes into your\nTV from your VCR or whatever.\n\n413\n00:18:54.932 --> 00:18:57.690\nAgain, older technology you\nmay not have VCR anymore.\n\n414\n00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:58.960\nEverybody has Netflix today,\n\n415\n00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:02.980\nwhy do we need that we can just stream\neverything from the cloud right.\n\n416\n00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:05.780\nI sound bitter when I do that,\nI really do, I sound bitter.\n\n417\n00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:09.510\nI shouldn't say that, I'm not bitter\nI'm a happy person by nature,\n\n418\n00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.730\nI just happen to really\nnot like the cloud.\n\n419\n00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.970\nThat's really the only difference.\n\n420\n00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:15.490\nI'm only kidding, I like the cloud too,\nI'm being facetious.\n\n421\n00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:17.320\nBut when you look at the back of your TV,\n\n422\n00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.210\nespecially if its been hooked up to\na cable box, however you do that.\n\n423\n00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.790\nIf it's not an HDMI connection, or\nyou're not streaming or Chromecasting or\n\n424\n00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.590\nwhatever, but you literally have\na cable hooked up to the back,\n\n425\n00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.550\nif you pull that cable off and\nunscrew it, you're going to see\n\n426\n00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.000\nwhat looks to be similar to a BNC\nconnector, what it would have looked like.\n\n427\n00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:33.960\nIt wasn't exactly that but\n\n428\n00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.190\nit was similar, it would have been\na metal sleeve that's fit over the cable.\n\n429\n00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.030\nThe copper wire core will fit\nthrough the middle of it.\n\n430\n00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:44.050\nWe clamp it down on the cable\nto create a secure connection.\n\n431\n00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.960\nAnd you may have had a screw kind of\nconnection that would wrap around\n\n432\n00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:50.580\nthe connector, that's what the cable-cable\nconnector looks like today.\n\n433\n00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:53.480\nA BNC connector would have been\nsomething like that but it twisted and\n\n434\n00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.460\nlocked onto the back of the network card.\n\n435\n00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:58.820\nThe network card effectively had a prong\nthat would come out of it on the back,\n\n436\n00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.520\nlittle tube that you could\ninsert the copper wire through.\n\n437\n00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.360\nAnd it had prongs that sat out\non either side, kinda like this.\n\n438\n00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:07.400\nYou'd lock the BNC connector onto it,\nand it would turn and\n\n439\n00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.860\nlock around the little prong\nconnector that stuck out,\n\n440\n00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.340\nit would lock it in place so you couldn't\nyank it and pull it off easily, all right.\n\n441\n00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.840\nSo that's what a coax cable\nwould have looked like.\n\n442\n00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.700\nAnd then fiber-optic cable's all about\neffectively transmitting using light.\n\n443\n00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:21.300\nSo effectively,\n\n444\n00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.130\nwe're using light pulses instead of\nelectrical pulses to transmit down wire.\n\n445\n00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.060\nBut it's not copper that's\nthe conductive element, it's glass.\n\n446\n00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.320\nSo inside fiber optic cables\nwe have a center core\n\n447\n00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.570\nof glass that then transmits\nthe light pulse down the wire.\n\n448\n00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.530\nNow we also, typically,\n\n449\n00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:40.230\ntalk about transmission distances\nwith these kind of cables.\n\n450\n00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:44.900\nSo a twisted pair cable, traditionally\nwill transmit at about 100 meters,\n\n451\n00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.130\nbefore we have to amplify\nthe signal because of attenuation,\n\n452\n00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.800\nloss of signal strength is\nattenuation due to resistance.\n\n453\n00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.700\nSo traditional twisted bare cable is\nrated at approximately 100 meters,\n\n454\n00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.800\nwe do use meters, that's the way it is,\n\n455\n00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.410\neven though we never formally adopted the\nmetric system here in the United States.\n\n456\n00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:05.390\nOne of the only countries in the world\nnot to, good job by the way.\n\n457\n00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.400\nAbout 100 meters, right,\nso roughly about 300 feet.\n\n458\n00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.660\nDoes that mean that in at 100 meters\nit stops, does it mean at 95 it stops,\n\n459\n00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:12.790\n105 it stops?\n\n460\n00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:16.330\nIt means that's an average estimate,\ndepending on the quality of the cooper\n\n461\n00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.780\nwire in the cable and\ncertain environmental conditions.\n\n462\n00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.160\nIt may transmit slightly longer,\nit maybe transmit slightly less, but\n\n463\n00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.050\non average we say it attenuates\nat about 100 meters.\n\n464\n00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.720\nCoax cable depending on\nthe nature of the cable there\n\n465\n00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.220\nwere two forums you could use what\nwas known as thin net or thick net.\n\n466\n00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.950\nThin net was quarter\ncircumference copper wire coax.\n\n467\n00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.030\nThick net was half inch\ncircumference copper wire coax.\n\n468\n00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:45.360\nThin net would attenuate at roughly\nabout 125 meters or so coax that\n\n469\n00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.640\nwas thick net half inch diameter would\nattenuate at approximate of 500 meters.\n\n470\n00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.070\nSo you can just kind of\na sense of that as well.\n\n471\n00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:56.720\nThe downside of a coax was it would\nonly transmit at 10 megabits of speed.\n\n472\n00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:01.011\nWhereas twisted pair coax, or excuse me,\ntwisted pair coax, that's a new one.\n\n473\n00:22:01.011 --> 00:22:02.615\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Twisted pair copper wire\n\n474\n00:22:02.615 --> 00:22:06.210\ncable is capable of transmitting\nat gigabit speeds or higher today.\n\n475\n00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:09.470\nCat 6, Cat 7, things of that nature,\nobviously very high-speed cable.\n\n476\n00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.800\nFiber optic cable is gonna use,\nas we said,\n\n477\n00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.250\nglass as the conductive element\ninstead of copper wire, and\n\n478\n00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:19.125\nuses light pulses instead of electrical\npulses, so we're talking about a system\n\n479\n00:22:19.125 --> 00:22:24.255\nthat is capable of transmitting before\nattenuation over much greater distances.\n\n480\n00:22:24.255 --> 00:22:28.915\nMost people don't realize that fiber optic\ncable is still susceptible to attenuation.\n\n481\n00:22:28.915 --> 00:22:31.365\nIt's just that it attenuates\nat a greater distance.\n\n482\n00:22:31.365 --> 00:22:34.035\nBut we still have friction,\nwe still have resistance in the line,\n\n483\n00:22:34.035 --> 00:22:35.915\nand we still have to worry about that.\n\n484\n00:22:35.915 --> 00:22:37.785\nCopper wire attenuates as we said for\n\n485\n00:22:37.785 --> 00:22:41.140\ntwisted pair at 100 meters,\nfiberoptics transmits and\n\n486\n00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:45.100\nis gonna attenuate at approximately\n2,000 meters or 2 kilometers on average.\n\n487\n00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.660\nSo a much longer distance before we have\nto worry about continuing a ramp up that\n\n488\n00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.488\nsignal in effect, so just wanna think\nabout that and be aware of that.\n\n489\n00:22:51.488 --> 00:22:54.960\nWe also wanna think about how\nwe actually are sending and\n\n490\n00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.670\nreceiving data across\nour boundary interface.\n\n491\n00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.680\nAre we exposing internal addresses?\n\n492\n00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.306\nWe've talked a lot about IP addresses.\n\n493\n00:23:01.306 --> 00:23:06.695\nAre we using internal addresses\nlike a 10.005, or 10.0020,\n\n494\n00:23:06.695 --> 00:23:11.255\nor 192168, you know 0.,\nsomething or whatever it is?\n\n495\n00:23:11.255 --> 00:23:13.499\nThose are internal private networks,\nright?\n\n496\n00:23:13.499 --> 00:23:17.214\nAnd we're not suppose to send that\ntraffic, with that internal private IP,\n\n497\n00:23:17.214 --> 00:23:18.310\nto the outside world.\n\n498\n00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:20.950\nIt's not routable,\nat least not beyond the gateway anyway.\n\n499\n00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:24.830\nAnd so the reality is that we have to use\ntechnology that we often refer to as NAT,\n\n500\n00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.260\nNetwork Address Translation.\n\n501\n00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:31.390\nWhat NAT does is effectively allows\nus to strip off the internal IP.\n\n502\n00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:32.320\nThat's private.\n\n503\n00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.740\nWe keep that safe and secure,\nwe don't expose it to the outside world.\n\n504\n00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:40.160\nWe put a new package, a new envelope\nheader on top of that packet, and,\n\n505\n00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:43.650\neffectively, we make all the traffic that\ngoes through the border gateway device,\n\n506\n00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.370\nthe router, the firewall,\nwhatever it is that's doing the natting,\n\n507\n00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.010\nwe make everything look like\nit is coming from that device.\n\n508\n00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:53.655\nSo we put the public routable external\nIP of that device on the WAN side,\n\n509\n00:23:53.655 --> 00:23:56.310\nonto all the emerging\npackets that come out.\n\n510\n00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:00.263\nWhen the data comes back the other way,\nthat packet header is read, opened up,\n\n511\n00:24:00.263 --> 00:24:01.043\nstripped off.\n\n512\n00:24:01.043 --> 00:24:04.592\nWe look at the additional information\nin the secondary header that tells us\n\n513\n00:24:04.592 --> 00:24:08.648\neffectively, oh, you're really looking\nto translate that back into 10005 or\n\n514\n00:24:08.648 --> 00:24:12.532\nyou know, wherever we want to go and then\nwe're gonna deliver that to the Internal\n\n515\n00:24:12.532 --> 00:24:15.290\nside of the LAN,\nto that particular machine.\n\n516\n00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:19.670\nSo, and that device effectively\nstands as a guard, a border proxy\n\n517\n00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:23.870\nbetween internal and external networks\ndoing translation back and forth.\n\n518\n00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.120\nWe could do the same thing\nwith ports on a switch.\n\n519\n00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.720\nWe could do what's called\nPort Address Translation.\n\n520\n00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.881\nWe call that PAT.\n\n521\n00:24:29.881 --> 00:24:31.950\nYou remember Pat,\nthe character from Saturday Night Live?\n\n522\n00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:32.810\n>> I do! [LAUGH] >> From years ago.\n\n523\n00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:34.110\nThe androgynous character.\n\n524\n00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:35.750\n>> Yes.\n>> Wasn't quite man, wasn't quite woman.\n\n525\n00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.535\nReally unsure what Pat was.\n\n526\n00:24:37.535 --> 00:24:41.475\nSo, Port Address Translation is\ngonna be an extension of that.\n\n527\n00:24:41.475 --> 00:24:44.703\nIn other words it acts like NAT,\nbut it takes NAT to the next level.\n\n528\n00:24:44.703 --> 00:24:46.105\nIt extends NAT to the switch and\n\n529\n00:24:46.105 --> 00:24:49.905\nallows us to do this on the ports\nas oppose to at the device itself.\n\n530\n00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:52.805\nWe translate all addresses and\nwe deal with all that,\n\n531\n00:24:52.805 --> 00:24:54.855\nbut we're gonna do this now\nat the switch level and\n\n532\n00:24:54.855 --> 00:24:58.725\nwe're gonna do port translation so that\nway we can have the firewall keep track of\n\n533\n00:24:58.725 --> 00:25:01.790\nmultiple sessions simultaneously\nlooking at all traffic.\n\n534\n00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.260\nRemember, we wanna be stateful.\n\n535\n00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.280\nWe wanna do that based on port mapping.\n\n536\n00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.620\nSee where the traffic's coming\nfrom through the switch.\n\n537\n00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:11.080\nPort Address Translation allows us\nto translate the source port numbers\n\n538\n00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.050\ninside of the header of\nthe data traffic frame.\n\n539\n00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.330\nInside the data header,\ninto unique values,\n\n540\n00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:20.770\nfurther masking not just the IP addresses,\nwhich is what we're doing with NAT.\n\n541\n00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:23.210\nRemember, NAT is like Level one.\n\n542\n00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:26.440\nPort is not plus, if you wanna think\nwith that way, it's an addition.\n\n543\n00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:30.480\nSo, Port Address Translation or\nPAT is gonna be doing adding, but\n\n544\n00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.850\nit's also gonna take the port information.\n\n545\n00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:36.470\nThat is gonna be in the header of that\npacket, translated to a unique value.\n\n546\n00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:40.180\nEffectively obfuscating and\nstealthing that so we can't see that.\n\n547\n00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.110\nSo, we don't gain valuable insight to\nwhat's going on inside the network.\n\n548\n00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:45.590\nThat's what port address\ntranslation does for us as well.\n\n549\n00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.400\nPretty cool stuff.\n>> Absolutely.\n\n550\n00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.410\n>> You know, when you think\nabout sitting around a room and\n\n551\n00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.140\ncoming up with ways to\ndo this kind of stuff.\n\n552\n00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.610\nPretty interesting right?\n\n553\n00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:54.330\nSo, when we think about this kind\nof stuff, think about firewalls,\n\n554\n00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.710\nthink about NAT address translation,\nthink about port address translation.\n\n555\n00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.460\nThe other thing we have to think\nabout quickly is proxies, right?\n\n556\n00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:04.600\nThe other device we often talk about, but\nwe forget to mention sometimes, because we\n\n557\n00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.720\ndon't realize that today a lot of this\nfunctionality exists in one specific area.\n\n558\n00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.300\nIn other words, typically,\nfor instance at home, right,\n\n559\n00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.895\nwhen you get your cable service\nfrom your cable provider\n\n560\n00:26:14.895 --> 00:26:17.735\nthey send you a nifty little box,\nyou take it out, plug it in.\n\n561\n00:26:17.735 --> 00:26:22.085\nIt's a firewall, a router, it's probably\ngot wireless as well as wired capabilities\n\n562\n00:26:22.085 --> 00:26:23.745\ntoday, so it's got wireless built in.\n\n563\n00:26:23.745 --> 00:26:26.605\nIt's a firewall router and\nit's also a Proxy all in one,\n\n564\n00:26:26.605 --> 00:26:28.245\nit's typically an all in one device.\n\n565\n00:26:28.245 --> 00:26:32.685\nIt may even have IDS and or\nIPS capabilities built into it as well.\n\n566\n00:26:32.685 --> 00:26:34.735\nSo, it's an all in one device\nthat does a lot of these things.\n\n567\n00:26:34.735 --> 00:26:38.670\nIt typically can It may not do PAT, it\nmay not do port address translation, but\n\n568\n00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:39.940\nit certainly does NATing.\n\n569\n00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:43.040\nSo, it has these capabilities and\nit acts as a proxy as well.\n\n570\n00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.410\nA proxy generically is a device\nthat is gonna do two things.\n\n571\n00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.260\nIt does stealth the Internal Network\nfrom the outside so\n\n572\n00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.340\nit masks the Internal Network.\n\n573\n00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:54.890\nIt does that by effectively intercepting\nall outbound requests for service.\n\n574\n00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:58.660\nStopping them, interrogating them,\nsaying what are you looking to do?\n\n575\n00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.710\nYou wanna go to this web\nserver to get this web page.\n\n576\n00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:01.950\nWell, you stay here.\n\n577\n00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:03.970\nLet me go get that for you, right?\n\n578\n00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.840\nHow can I be of service today, right?\n\n579\n00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.140\nAnd so, the Proxy goes out and\nfinds that information of your behalf.\n\n580\n00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.930\nComes back and gives it back to you,\nbut here's the cool part.\n\n581\n00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:17.210\nIt makes a note of that information,\nin other words it caches that information\n\n582\n00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:21.160\ninside its memory, or in its hard drive\nfor a period of time, however it's set up.\n\n583\n00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.320\nAnd then, next time you ask for that\ninformation it doesn't have to go out and\n\n584\n00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.750\nget it because it's already got it there.\n\n585\n00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.210\nIt just gives it to you and\n\n586\n00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.980\nit then effectively speeds\nup access to the content.\n\n587\n00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.620\nSo, proxies are cashing devices that\neffectively allow us to speed up access,\n\n588\n00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:38.220\nonce we've initially primed that\ndevice by getting information in.\n\n589\n00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.630\nNow, proxies, in addition, can go out and\ndo what's called crawling.\n\n590\n00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:45.600\nThey can actually go out and get content\nand preload it into the cash, so that way,\n\n591\n00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:46.790\nit's always there.\n\n592\n00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.860\nSo, for instance, if you are in\na big company, and the home page for\n\n593\n00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.590\nyour website is something\neverybody is always going to.\n\n594\n00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:56.492\nWe preload that into the cache,\nwe call it a pre-fetching so,\n\n595\n00:27:56.492 --> 00:28:00.200\nwe pre-fetch that put in the cache,\nrefresh it all the time.\n\n596\n00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.300\nSo, whenever anybody wants the portal,\nthey don't have to go out and wait for\n\n597\n00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.290\na web request they simply get\nit directly from the device.\n\n598\n00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.700\nIt speeds up access dramatically\ncuz if you have thousands of people\n\n599\n00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:13.110\nhitting that website simultaneously it's\ngonna slow down dramatically if you have\n\n600\n00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.860\nto go out and\nquery DNS to find it every time.\n\n601\n00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.945\nProxies can help with that,\nproxy's exist as two types.\n\n602\n00:28:18.945 --> 00:28:21.435\nCircuit level, and or\napplication level proxies.\n\n603\n00:28:21.435 --> 00:28:23.885\nApplication level proxies\nrelay traffic from\n\n604\n00:28:23.885 --> 00:28:26.955\ntrusted end points running certain\napplications, whatever they are,\n\n605\n00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:30.755\nwe assign the proxy based on\nthe application that it services.\n\n606\n00:28:30.755 --> 00:28:34.205\nCircuit level proxies create what\nare called conduits or tunnels\n\n607\n00:28:34.205 --> 00:28:38.450\nthat trusted host can communicate through\nat the networking layers of the OSI model.\n\n608\n00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:41.860\nSo, application proxies work at\nthe highest level at layer seven.\n\n609\n00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.390\nCircuit level proxies work down\nbelow in the networking and\n\n610\n00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.940\ntransport layers of the OSI model to\ncreate connections at a lower level with\n\n611\n00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.660\ndifferent kinds of functionality.\n\n612\n00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.410\nUsing the kinds of proxies\nthat we often see as well.\n\n613\n00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:55.270\nNow, the last thing we wanna think about\nin this area is something known as\n\n614\n00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:57.060\nthe content distribution network.\n\n615\n00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:01.700\nThese today, are typically gonna be\nlarge scale systems that are going to,\n\n616\n00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.990\nlike proxies, cache information and\nstore them for us.\n\n617\n00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:07.950\nBut, they're typically gonna\nhave multiple copies of files or\n\n618\n00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:11.360\nwhatever we need, you'll think of\nNetflix streaming movies to you.\n\n619\n00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.160\nThis is a content distribution\nnetwork that goes global.\n\n620\n00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.100\nThey've got hundreds of copies\nof these movies loaded up on\n\n621\n00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:20.530\nhundreds of servers around the world that\nare load balanced so when you come in and\n\n622\n00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.890\nsay I want, you know, the X-Men or\nwhatever, you're gonna get it but\n\n623\n00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:27.330\nyou may get it from a server near you\nmay get it from a server far away.\n\n624\n00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.900\nYou may see copy 20 of 25,\nor copy 1 of 100.\n\n625\n00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.500\nIt depends on what's\nup in the rotation and\n\n626\n00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.570\nwhat the load balancer says we're gonna\ngive you, because that's gonna be the most\n\n627\n00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.470\nadvantageous, quickest way,\nto serve that content up.\n\n628\n00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:42.290\nThis is what's known as\na content distribution network.\n\n629\n00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:43.555\n>> Fantastic stuff.\n\n630\n00:29:43.555 --> 00:29:46.330\nGreat look at a lot of the hardware\nthat we see on a daily basis.\n\n631\n00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.390\nAnd some of the hardware that we might\nnot see, even though it's there.\n\n632\n00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.230\nAnd some of the hardware that from the\ndays of the glory, the good old modems,\n\n633\n00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:55.710\nand I'm telling you,\nyou take his recommendation,\n\n634\n00:29:55.710 -->

--> 00:00:20.250\nI'm your host Mike Roderick,\ntoday we're doing our CISSP content.\n\n4\n00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.930\nAnd specifically we're gonna\nbe going into designing and\n\n5\n00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.630\nestablishing secure communications or\nsecure communication channels, right?\n\n6\n00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.087\nWe've talked about communication\nchannels in previous conversations.\n\n7\n00:00:32.087 --> 00:00:35.698\nGotta make sure that that information that\nwe're sending across those channels is\n\n8\n00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:39.270\nprotected and that those bad actors,\nwhoever wants it, can't get access to it.\n\n9\n00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.350\nSo here to help us with all that, is Mr.\nAdam Gordon, how's it going, Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.050\n>> It's going well.\n\n11\n00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.960\nNow I can tell you that, except if I\ntell you that securely, then I'd have to\n\n12\n00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.400\nhave us encrypt that communication and\nnobody would understand it.\n\n13\n00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.118\nSo instead, what I'm gonna do is this.\n\n14\n00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:51.936\nAwesome.\n\n15\n00:00:51.936 --> 00:00:53.710\n>> [LAUGH] I like it.\n\n16\n00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.340\n>> All right, so let's talk a bit\nabout secure communication channels,\n\n17\n00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.710\nhow they work, what they are.\n\n18\n00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.670\nWe often start out at kind\nof the baseline, right?\n\n19\n00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.780\nAnd we've talked a lot about\nolder technologies and\n\n20\n00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.420\nkind of worked our way up to newer ones.\n\n21\n00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.300\nReminding ourselves historically,\nsome of the things that's gone on.\n\n22\n00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.150\nWhere we've been, in other words, to\nhelp us to understand where we're going.\n\n23\n00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.550\nSo, when we start this conversation,\n\n24\n00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.540\nwe want to start out talking\nabout voice generically.\n\n25\n00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.180\nNot because it's older or newer, but\n\n26\n00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.690\njust because it's a great place to think\nabout starting a conversation like this.\n\n27\n00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.180\nBecause voice touches,\nvoice communication does,\n\n28\n00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.660\nmany of the things that we think about and\nwe do today.\n\n29\n00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.290\nWe have what's called the plain\nold fashion telephone system,\n\n30\n00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.510\nwhat we commonly refer\nto as the POTS network.\n\n31\n00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.100\nThat would have been the PSTN, the\npublicly switched telephone network that\n\n32\n00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.780\nwe historically have used for\nanalog communication.\n\n33\n00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.700\nWe would send voice\ncommunication over that.\n\n34\n00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.870\nWe may have what I mentioned earlier,\n\n35\n00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.510\nwhich would have been the PBX,\nthe private branch exchange.\n\n36\n00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.570\nWould have been an analog PBX, these\ndays would be a digital VOIP solution,\n\n37\n00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.800\na voice over IP solution kind\nof morphing that technology.\n\n38\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.962\nBlending data and voice on the same\nsystem, through the same network lines.\n\n39\n00:01:50.962 --> 00:01:53.522\nAnd then having to secure and\nsegment that traffic,\n\n40\n00:01:53.522 --> 00:01:56.390\nmanage it with quality of service,\nwhat we call QOS.\n\n41\n00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.340\nSecuring it with encryption, but also\ndealing with things such as jitter and\n\n42\n00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.200\nsequencing errors.\n\n43\n00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.800\nWhere we may have problems because\nof latency in the communication,\n\n44\n00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.305\ncausing disruption of the signal.\n\n45\n00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:09.676\nAnd/or sequencing errors, where packets\nshow up out of sequence as we talk\n\n46\n00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:12.003\nabout sequence numbers and\nhow important they are.\n\n47\n00:02:12.003 --> 00:02:16.295\nAnd if packets show up out of sequence,\nthen we may start hearing things that\n\n48\n00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:19.462\nsound much like, and\nthis may [NOISE] like that, right?\n\n49\n00:02:19.462 --> 00:02:20.267\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> And\n\n50\n00:02:20.267 --> 00:02:23.780\nthat's not you by the way, it's not your\nears, that's me purposely doing that.\n\n51\n00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.420\nThat could be jitter but that could\nalso be a question of sequencing errors.\n\n52\n00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.552\nAnd what a sequence error would actually\nsound like would be that you would hear,\n\n53\n00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:34.556\ninstead of the dog is blue,\nyou would hear the blue is dog.\n\n54\n00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:36.852\nBecause the packets show\nup out of sequence, and\n\n55\n00:02:36.852 --> 00:02:39.870\nare delivered and\nthen reconstructed in an incorrect manner.\n\n56\n00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.550\nSo we could have all of these problems and\nconcerns, right?\n\n57\n00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.418\nShowing up and doing these kind of things.\n\n58\n00:02:44.418 --> 00:02:47.610\nSo we wanna be thinking about this when\nwe think about securing channels, and\n\n59\n00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.500\ncommunications, and\n\n60\n00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.900\nnetworks, we have to think about\nnot just the actual encryption.\n\n61\n00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.700\nDo I keep the packets and\nthe data away from the bad guys?\n\n62\n00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.970\nBut I'm also securing,\nin a sense that I'm optimizing and\n\n63\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.550\nperformance management data, so it shows\nup the right way, follows the right path,\n\n64\n00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.230\nis reproduced correctly?\n\n65\n00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.660\nLatency, in other words, right,\ntransmission errors due to latency and\n\n66\n00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.337\nsequencing problems,\ncan present as big of a challenge.\n\n67\n00:03:10.337 --> 00:03:14.593\nBecause they knock out the concept of\navailability as packets that are not\n\n68\n00:03:14.593 --> 00:03:18.660\nencrypted and are stolen from us and\nexpose confidentiality.\n\n69\n00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.320\nSo we remember,\nwe have three distinct pillars\n\n70\n00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.600\nof information security\nmanagement we focus on.\n\n71\n00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.720\nIn this case, availability is gonna be a\nvery, very significant concern for us and\n\n72\n00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.840\nwe have to equally focus there.\n\n73\n00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.485\nWe talked about modems earlier\nin one of our prior episodes,\n\n74\n00:03:32.485 --> 00:03:34.090\ntalked about them here with voice.\n\n75\n00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.579\nI mentioned the whole\nconcept of what a modem does.\n\n76\n00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.560\nGave you the historical reference for\n\n77\n00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.640\nthinking about why modems may be\nimportant, why they are valuable to us.\n\n78\n00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.320\nWe talked about War Games, potentially,\nas a movie you may want to watch.\n\n79\n00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.830\nAnd another thing you saw in War Games\naside from the modem being used to hack,\n\n80\n00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.145\nwas that actually that hacking that\nthe modem was used to carry out,\n\n81\n00:03:55.145 --> 00:03:56.810\nis given a very specific name.\n\n82\n00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.080\nIt's called war dialing.\n\n83\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.200\nAt least that was the old school way\nof breaking into systems with modems.\n\n84\n00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.570\nNow war dialing is, these days,\nprimarily a historical footnote, but\n\n85\n00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.760\nit's actually making a comeback,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n86\n00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.960\nBecause we have modems, as I've said,\nin a lot of these older systems.\n\n87\n00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.110\nAnd from a maintenance perspective,\n\n88\n00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.500\nwe are seeing them being exposed now\nto the Internet through IP enabling\n\n89\n00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.890\non systems that may not realize they\nstill have modems associated with them.\n\n90\n00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.540\nAnd because of that, because we're now\nseeing these systems be effectively\n\n91\n00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.940\nmodernized and be exposed, the evidence\nof modems being there may be found by\n\n92\n00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.430\nhackers when they're probing and looking.\n\n93\n00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.250\nAnd they may now try to get into\nthose modems and use them against us.\n\n94\n00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.070\nSo yet again,\ndoing the security inventory.\n\n95\n00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.910\nUnderstanding what's available\nto you becomes very important.\n\n96\n00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.128\nCuz what's available to you,\nis also available to the bad actors.\n\n97\n00:04:41.128 --> 00:04:42.230\n>> Bad actors.\n\n98\n00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.930\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n99\n00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.600\nSo, war dialing,\nsomething very important to think about.\n\n100\n00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.975\nNow a more modern version of war dialing\nis something called war chalking and/or\n\n101\n00:04:49.975 --> 00:04:51.590\nwar driving.\n\n102\n00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.740\nWar driving and\nwar chalking are kind of the same thing.\n\n103\n00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.310\nOne is done in a car,\none is done without a car.\n\n104\n00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.070\nBut they both focus on the same activity.\n\n105\n00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.590\nHopefully you picked up on that subtle but\n\n106\n00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.460\nimportant difference in\nthe reference there.\n\n107\n00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.580\nThey both deal with wireless networks.\n\n108\n00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.130\nAnd they deal with the fact that war\ndriving is effectively somebody driving,\n\n109\n00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.310\nliterally, more of often than not\nin a car, going around looking for\n\n110\n00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.030\nwireless signals that are open.\n\n111\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.927\nAnd when I travel, and\nI travel a great deal to do what I do,\n\n112\n00:05:15.927 --> 00:05:19.671\nI spend a lot of time in various places\naround the world, not just in the US.\n\n113\n00:05:19.671 --> 00:05:23.120\nBut I travel globally, internationally,\nto do a lot of the work I do.\n\n114\n00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.880\nI'm often looking to get on the Internet.\n\n115\n00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.120\nWhen I'm in strange places,\n\n116\n00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.320\nI may or may not necessarily\nhave access to it directly.\n\n117\n00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.490\nSo, I will typically go online ahead\nof time, knowing where I'm going, and\n\n118\n00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.780\nI will look for coverage maps.\n\n119\n00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.050\nMaps that people have actually\nput up ahead of time and\n\n120\n00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.800\nthere are sites out there you can go and\nfind.\n\n121\n00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.990\nAnd I'm not talking about\ncell phone coverage maps.\n\n122\n00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.820\nI'm talking about open wireless\naccess point coverage maps.\n\n123\n00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.880\nSo people have war drove,\nif I can say that,\n\n124\n00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.205\nor war drived, I don't know if that's\nthe proper terminology for the past tense.\n\n125\n00:05:50.205 --> 00:05:53.660\nWar driven perhaps,\nI'm not an English grammatician.\n\n126\n00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.290\nI'm definitely not.\n\n127\n00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.120\nMath, English, not my forte at all.\n\n128\n00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.110\nBut if they have war driven\nthrough an area, and\n\n129\n00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.870\nthey have marked all the open wireless\naccess points, they will typically put\n\n130\n00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.830\ncoverage maps up, that will then\ntell you how you can find them.\n\n131\n00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.410\nAnd then obviously, you can potentially\nchoose to take advantage of that.\n\n132\n00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.450\nLet me be clear, I'm not suggesting for\n\n133\n00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.910\na minute, that you use this\ninformation to hack into a business.\n\n134\n00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.770\nI'm not suggesting for a minute that you\nuse this information to get up to no good.\n\n135\n00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.160\nI'm merely pointing out to you that\nsomebody's probably done the due diligence\n\n136\n00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.230\nand homework,\nin terms of mapping the open sites.\n\n137\n00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.330\nIf you choose to connect across one and\nuse it, that's up to you.\n\n138\n00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.587\nThat may or may not be legal.\n\n139\n00:06:30.587 --> 00:06:33.440\nI'm simply pointing out that that\ninformation exists out there.\n\n140\n00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.980\nAnd I want to be clear about that, right?\n\n141\n00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.120\nNever want you to think for\n\n142\n00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.340\na minute that I'm suggesting you should\nengage in a certain kind of behavior\n\n143\n00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.190\njust because I talk about the fact\nthat that's a possibility.\n\n144\n00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.485\nSo it is possible to find\nthis information online.\n\n145\n00:06:44.485 --> 00:06:47.610\nWar chalking allows you, and\n\n146\n00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.710\nit's done typically in the inner\ncity core, in downtown areas.\n\n147\n00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.950\nTypically in the financial districts,\n\n148\n00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.450\nbusiness districts, where people actually\nwalk around instead of war driving, right?\n\n149\n00:06:56.450 --> 00:07:00.004\nThey'll mark the buildings and the open\naccess points on a site coverage map.\n\n150\n00:07:00.004 --> 00:07:01.918\nBut they actually will also use chalk,\n\n151\n00:07:01.918 --> 00:07:05.235\nthey will mark the actual open\naccess points in front of buildings.\n\n152\n00:07:05.235 --> 00:07:06.995\nSo if you know what to look for,\n\n153\n00:07:06.995 --> 00:07:09.455\nyou may see graffiti tags\non the side of a building,\n\n154\n00:07:09.455 --> 00:07:12.785\nyou may see literally somebody's\npainted something on the sidewalk.\n\n155\n00:07:12.785 --> 00:07:13.997\nIt takes different forms.\n\n156\n00:07:13.997 --> 00:07:15.791\nThere may be a street sign\nin front of the building,\n\n157\n00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:18.027\nsomebody's put a sticker up there,\nkind of hidden from view.\n\n158\n00:07:18.027 --> 00:07:19.297\nYou have to know what to look for.\n\n159\n00:07:19.297 --> 00:07:23.357\nBut war shocking is the idea of marking\nthese open access points in buildings so\n\n160\n00:07:23.357 --> 00:07:25.517\nthat people that know what to look for\nknow that they are there and\n\n161\n00:07:25.517 --> 00:07:26.637\nknow how to use them.\n\n162\n00:07:26.637 --> 00:07:28.817\nJust another way to\ncommunicate this information.\n\n163\n00:07:28.817 --> 00:07:31.848\nIt's got a lot of interesting little\nsubcultural context going on with\n\n164\n00:07:31.848 --> 00:07:32.462\nsome of this.\n\n165\n00:07:32.462 --> 00:07:35.604\nWe have, indeed, an entire community and\na language and a context and\n\n166\n00:07:35.604 --> 00:07:39.436\nbehavior around these kind of activities,\nthat, as security professionals, we at\n\n167\n00:07:39.436 --> 00:07:43.170\nleast have to educate ourselves about\nenough to understand how to interact with.\n\n168\n00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.940\nBecause that is indeed what\nwe are talking about here.\n\n169\n00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.620\nRemember peer to peer applications?\n\n170\n00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.597\nRemember P to P applications,\nfile sharing, Napster,\n\n171\n00:07:50.597 --> 00:07:52.153\nbig huge issue with Napster?\n\n172\n00:07:52.153 --> 00:07:55.804\nYou had Filezilla, you had Morpheus,\nLimewire, Kazaa, Bear to Bear, or\n\n173\n00:07:55.804 --> 00:07:58.953\nBearshare or Sharebear, Bearshare,\nwhatever the hell it was.\n\n174\n00:07:58.953 --> 00:08:01.216\nRight, you had all these\ndifferent ones out there.\n\n175\n00:08:01.216 --> 00:08:02.314\nYou know, and they're still around.\n\n176\n00:08:02.314 --> 00:08:04.101\nThere are some that are still around.\n\n177\n00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:07.816\nBut the reality is they really\nhave not become common anymore,\n\n178\n00:08:07.816 --> 00:08:11.110\nin a sense that they are illegal for\nthe most part.\n\n179\n00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.690\nThe government tends to crack down on\nthese when they become a little too big.\n\n180\n00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.130\nIf you remember the whole\nMegaUpload disaster and\n\n181\n00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.660\nwhat went on with that system.\n\n182\n00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.215\nWhere people were eventually, because they\nwere using this technology to effectively\n\n183\n00:08:21.215 --> 00:08:23.964\nshare files illegally,\nthe government came in and shut down Mega.\n\n184\n00:08:23.964 --> 00:08:26.999\nTook all their servers, took all their\ndata, and just one day they're there,\n\n185\n00:08:26.999 --> 00:08:28.290\nnext day they were gone.\n\n186\n00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.160\nSo these applications can\nhave a dark side to them.\n\n187\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.503\nBut we wanna know that peer\nto peer applications and\n\n188\n00:08:33.503 --> 00:08:36.019\npeer to peer sharing protocols\ndo exist potentially.\n\n189\n00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:38.330\nThey may still be use and\nin play in your networks.\n\n190\n00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:42.012\nAnd they effectively allow for\nwhat I'll call unmonitored and\n\n191\n00:08:42.012 --> 00:08:43.757\nunrestricted file sharing.\n\n192\n00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:46.516\nWe may be aware of them,\nwe may know they're happening,\n\n193\n00:08:46.516 --> 00:08:48.075\nwe may be able to pick up on this.\n\n194\n00:08:48.075 --> 00:08:52.117\nBut the challenge is it's very difficult\nto constrain this traffic because they\n\n195\n00:08:52.117 --> 00:08:55.408\nusually would use dynamically\nassigned ports and jump, right?\n\n196\n00:08:55.408 --> 00:08:57.470\nSo the systems would\njump from port to port,\n\n197\n00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.760\ntrying to find open places where they\ncould transmit through the firewall.\n\n198\n00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.440\nSo this became a bit of a challenge.\n\n199\n00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.940\nSo botnets, spyware, viruses were\nall fed by these kind of networks.\n\n200\n00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.822\nIf you would go, out and a modern version\nof this would be using bittorrents, right?\n\n201\n00:09:09.822 --> 00:09:13.485\nSo, if you're familiar with bittorrents\nand downloading, and shame on you,\n\n202\n00:09:13.485 --> 00:09:15.900\nby the way,\nif you said yes that you do this, right?\n\n203\n00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:17.699\nBecause if you're using it for\ngood, not a problem.\n\n204\n00:09:17.699 --> 00:09:21.389\nBut the reality is, for every good reason\nthat you may go out and use a bittorrent\n\n205\n00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:25.357\nto download something legitimate, you also\nsee a lot of people using bittorrents and\n\n206\n00:09:25.357 --> 00:09:29.324\ntorrent software to download things like\nmovies and software that are not licensed,\n\n207\n00:09:29.324 --> 00:09:32.070\nthat are not legal,\nthat they're not paying for.\n\n208\n00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.242\nThat is illegal activity.\n\n209\n00:09:33.242 --> 00:09:36.280\nYou wanna be clear about that and\nthat is not something we should sponsor or\n\n210\n00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.530\nsupport as a CISSP.\n\n211\n00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.540\nWe should not allow others to engage in\nthat behavior and that activity at work.\n\n212\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.970\nWhat they do on their own\ntime privately is up to them.\n\n213\n00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:45.800\nBut that activity can lead to compromise.\n\n214\n00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.910\nBecause even if they're downloading stuff\nthat may be legitimate from those sites,\n\n215\n00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.120\na lot of the times that stuff\nis laced with malware or\n\n216\n00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.610\nviruses in software that can do harm.\n\n217\n00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:56.050\nAnd by executing that program,\n\n218\n00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:00.180\nwhat we would call a trojan program,\na program within a program may pop up.\n\n219\n00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.685\nAnd you may execute the pink\npurple unicorn wallpaper program,\n\n220\n00:10:03.685 --> 00:10:05.030\ncuz that's what you want.\n\n221\n00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.975\nAnd inside is the nasty little spyware\nmalware program that crawls out and\n\n222\n00:10:08.975 --> 00:10:10.855\ninfects your system\nwithout your knowledge.\n\n223\n00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:12.925\nSo you have to be very careful\nabout these kinds of systems,\n\n224\n00:10:12.925 --> 00:10:15.305\nthey can really lead to\na lot of compromise.\n\n225\n00:10:15.305 --> 00:10:16.870\nRemote meeting technologies, right?\n\n226\n00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.955\nNow we use things like Skype for Business,\n\n227\n00:10:18.955 --> 00:10:22.735\nwe probably use WebEx,\nthings of that nature, all the time.\n\n228\n00:10:22.735 --> 00:10:24.825\nThis is just another area that\nwe have to think about and\n\n229\n00:10:24.825 --> 00:10:26.825\nexamine as a security professional.\n\n230\n00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:30.314\nHow are we allowing technology to\neffectively drive communication?\n\n231\n00:10:30.314 --> 00:10:33.150\nAnd how is communication through\nthis technology platform\n\n232\n00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.130\ndriving information dissemination?\n\n233\n00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.660\nThese are things we have to think about.\n\n234\n00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.232\nCan I do a file share, a desktop share,\na audio and a video share or\n\n235\n00:10:41.232 --> 00:10:44.300\nprovisioning of information through\nthese technology platforms?\n\n236\n00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.900\nAbsolutely.\n\n237\n00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.297\nCan I turn on a camera in one of these\nplatforms, pan it around a room, and\n\n238\n00:10:49.297 --> 00:10:52.311\nsee everything in there,\nincluding pictures of proprietary or\n\n239\n00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:54.799\nsensitive information that\nmay be hanging around?\n\n240\n00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:55.983\nAbsolutely.\n\n241\n00:10:55.983 --> 00:10:58.919\nThis is one of the reasons when you\ngo into secure private facilities or\n\n242\n00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:02.570\nmilitary installations, you're not\nallowed to carry electronics with you.\n\n243\n00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.690\nOnly under special circumstances\ncan you bring in a laptop and\n\n244\n00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.790\nit takes almost an act of Congress\nto get one onto a base today.\n\n245\n00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:12.300\nAnd I can tell you that from first hand\nexperience because I spend a lot of time\n\n246\n00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.550\nin these places, and\n\n247\n00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.720\nI can tell you I'm never allowed to\nbring my technology platforms in.\n\n248\n00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.050\nI'm not allowed to bring a phone in.\n\n249\n00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.440\nBecause they are worried about\nthe fact that these have microphones,\n\n250\n00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.540\nthey have cameras.\n\n251\n00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.030\nThey could be rooted today so\nsomebody could have put malware in there.\n\n252\n00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.270\nThey could be remotely controlled and\n\n253\n00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:29.440\nturned on as a listening device\ninside of a sensitive area.\n\n254\n00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.090\nThey could be recording information.\n\n255\n00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.040\nSame thing with laptops.\n\n256\n00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.670\nYou're hooking up an unknown\nquantity to a secure network.\n\n257\n00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.200\nThere's no way, right,\n\n258\n00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.260\nthat that's every gonna happen,\nin most of the places I work in.\n\n259\n00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:41.951\nSo I'm politely told, listen,\nwhatever you need make sure\n\n260\n00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:45.222\nit's available to you in another form\nthat we approve before you show up,\n\n261\n00:11:45.222 --> 00:11:47.540\ncuz you're not bringing it in on a laptop.\n\n262\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.080\nI taught a class just,\nprobably about six or\n\n263\n00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:55.430\neight weeks ago, set of classes,\ntwo classes about a week break in between,\n\n264\n00:11:55.430 --> 00:12:00.280\non a secure, on a base, right,\na secure Army base or Navy base.\n\n265\n00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.170\nWon't tell you which but\nit was a secure base, right?\n\n266\n00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:03.560\nAnd so I was on a secure base and\n\n267\n00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.510\nI was actually inside an incredibly\nsecure perimeter of a secure base.\n\n268\n00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.840\nSo I was working a very secure area of\na base that was already highly secured.\n\n269\n00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.282\nAnd I had brought my, as I typically do,\nI have my go bag with me, right?\n\n270\n00:12:15.282 --> 00:12:18.674\nSo I have my laptop, my tablet all that\nstuff, I was very politely told hey,\n\n271\n00:12:18.674 --> 00:12:20.440\nthat's all good bring it with you.\n\n272\n00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.990\nIt stays in the dorm,\nyou don't walk out with it.\n\n273\n00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.279\nBetween the car and the dorm,\nokay, out beyond that perimeter,\n\n274\n00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:27.650\ndon't even think about bringing it\nwith you to the other building,\n\n275\n00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:29.350\ncuz we're not gonna let you in with it.\n\n276\n00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:33.352\nSo we had a bit of a challenge the first\nday of class because we had to get\n\n277\n00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:35.629\nthe courseware material and slides and\n\n278\n00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:38.600\nall the stuff I needed into\nthe training facility.\n\n279\n00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.607\nAnd I wasn't able to bring\nit in any other way.\n\n280\n00:12:41.607 --> 00:12:45.493\nAnd I had to bring it in on a USB drive so\nit could be on a USB drive, so I did that.\n\n281\n00:12:45.493 --> 00:12:47.959\nBut then they stopped me right at\nthe border there and said, well,\n\n282\n00:12:47.959 --> 00:12:50.230\nwhat the hell's this thing,\nyou're not bringing this in.\n\n283\n00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:54.000\nAnd I said, okay, well talk to\nthe guy who told me to bring it in.\n\n284\n00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.740\nSo now we have the whole discussion\nabout how are we gonna transmit this\n\n285\n00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.327\ndata through the security checkpoint.\n\n286\n00:12:58.327 --> 00:13:01.380\nSo somebody had to come out from IA,\nfrom Information Assurance.\n\n287\n00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.671\nHad to take that device, scan it,\n\n288\n00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:07.779\nthen certify it was okay to bring\nit into a secure area to then,\n\n289\n00:13:07.779 --> 00:13:12.998\nnot let me use it, but to transfer the\ndata off that removable device onto a CD.\n\n290\n00:13:12.998 --> 00:13:17.139\nAnd then give me the burned CD that could\nthen be put into the training machines\n\n291\n00:13:17.139 --> 00:13:20.460\nthat were set up, so\nthat we could transmit that data.\n\n292\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.720\nThere was no way, in other words,\nI was bringing a USB device onto the base.\n\n293\n00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.450\nBecause it's effectively a mechanism\nthat I could export data out with and\n\n294\n00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:29.940\nit was just unacceptable.\n\n295\n00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.405\nSo this was, again, pretty common,\nthis happens all the time.\n\n296\n00:13:33.405 --> 00:13:35.922\nBut this is the kind of thing\nwe think about and CISSPs have\n\n297\n00:13:35.922 --> 00:13:39.595\nto be involved with when we're thinking\nabout how we manage these technologies and\n\n298\n00:13:39.595 --> 00:13:40.969\nthese levels of access today.\n\n299\n00:13:40.969 --> 00:13:42.485\nRight, very important stuff.\n\n300\n00:13:42.485 --> 00:13:45.697\nSo remote meeting technology and\nremote meeting technology risks obviously.\n\n301\n00:13:45.697 --> 00:13:47.757\nFor many of them we wanna\nthink about as well.\n\n302\n00:13:47.757 --> 00:13:49.349\nInstant messaging,\ntalked a bit about this.\n\n303\n00:13:49.349 --> 00:13:51.815\nWe talked about Skype and\nthings like that, but\n\n304\n00:13:51.815 --> 00:13:55.987\ninstant messaging in general can\nlead to all sorts of complications.\n\n305\n00:13:55.987 --> 00:13:58.207\nThere are different categories\nof instant messaging.\n\n306\n00:13:58.207 --> 00:14:03.223\nWe may have text messages between\nphone systems, say, what we call SMS.\n\n307\n00:14:03.223 --> 00:14:05.853\nOr short message capabilities.\n\n308\n00:14:05.853 --> 00:14:08.243\nSo you traditionally text message.\n\n309\n00:14:08.243 --> 00:14:09.443\nThat can lead to compromise.\n\n310\n00:14:09.443 --> 00:14:12.283\nI think I made this reference in at\nleast one other episode early on.\n\n311\n00:14:12.283 --> 00:14:15.733\nSomebody can send you a link to\nsomething in an SMS message.\n\n312\n00:14:15.733 --> 00:14:17.630\nAnd you may click on it on a phone.\n\n313\n00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.350\nThat link is effectively an invitation\nto connect to something.\n\n314\n00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.710\nIf that something is gonna have\na system that has malware on it,\n\n315\n00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.450\nyou may very well infect\nthe platform you're connecting from.\n\n316\n00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.760\nNow it's kind of interesting,\nright, because I run a Blackberry.\n\n317\n00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.110\nAnd I'm very open about that.\n\n318\n00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.110\nI'm a proud Blackberry user, all right?\n\n319\n00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:34.740\nAnd I have been since very\nfirst Blackberrys came out.\n\n320\n00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:39.250\nWhen they first previewed,\nI bought several of those devices and\n\n321\n00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.820\nI've basically been a Blackberry\nadherent ever since.\n\n322\n00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.570\nWhether you like Blackberry or\nnot, sucks for you.\n\n323\n00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.950\nI don't really care, I like them,\nthat's all that matters.\n\n324\n00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:51.200\nBut one of the most secure platforms you\ncan use today still, almost 15 to17 years\n\n325\n00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.720\nlater since they first previewed for\nenterprise level communications, right?\n\n326\n00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.640\nI'm not talking about consumer devices\nthat we do a lot of other things on.\n\n327\n00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.120\nI'm talking about a secure device\nI can run a business off of.\n\n328\n00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.480\nI can send secure email, I can have\ncommunications, I can do certain things.\n\n329\n00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.910\nSo the idea with a Blackberry,\nit's kind of interesting because,\n\n330\n00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:12.290\nunlike a lot of other mobile devices,\nI can preview an email on the Blackberry.\n\n331\n00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.470\nAnd we can all do this on our devices.\n\n332\n00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.230\nI can click on a link to\na website on the Blackberry.\n\n333\n00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.750\nBut because of the browser\nthe Blackberry uses natively,\n\n334\n00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:26.010\nwhich is not an Internet Explorer, not a\nChrome browser, right, not Safari, right?\n\n335\n00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:26.970\nIt's a different browser.\n\n336\n00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.450\nIt's a secure browser, and\n\n337\n00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:32.190\nI have several other secure browsers\nloaded on my Blackberry as well.\n\n338\n00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.560\nBut because of that, when I preview\nsomething, if I click on a link and\n\n339\n00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.230\nI go out to that website,\nit it is in any way compromised,\n\n340\n00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.920\nBlackberry basically just says,\nhey, guess what?\n\n341\n00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.840\nA, number one, this is not a good idea,\nso we're not gonna show it to you.\n\n342\n00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.620\nBut more importantly,\neven if you go there,\n\n343\n00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.310\nyou're not gonna be able\nto download anything.\n\n344\n00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:50.202\nSo nothing's gonna infect my platform.\n\n345\n00:15:50.202 --> 00:15:55.176\nThere's really minimal of any malware out\nthere specifically targeted at Blackberry.\n\n346\n00:15:55.176 --> 00:15:57.256\nBecause five people on\nthe planet still use it,\n\n347\n00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:59.028\nso it's really not a high value target.\n\n348\n00:15:59.028 --> 00:16:02.277\nBut the five of us are very happy with\nthe security level in terms of our\n\n349\n00:16:02.277 --> 00:16:04.170\ncommunication platform, right?\n\n350\n00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:07.250\nBut when you think about Windows mobile\ndevices, think about Android devices,\n\n351\n00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:11.610\nthink about Apple devices,\nwe hear stories on a fairly regular basis\n\n352\n00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.690\nabout now we're hitting these mobile\nplatforms because hackers have realized\n\n353\n00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:19.440\nthat a lot of electronic information,\na lot of payment information,\n\n354\n00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.930\na lot of sensitive data,\nis transiting these devices today.\n\n355\n00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.870\nAnd as a result of that,\nit's a primary target for\n\n356\n00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.190\nus to go out and try to think about.\n\n357\n00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.342\nSo, instant messaging is also one of these\nareas that we want to be thinking about.\n\n358\n00:16:29.342 --> 00:16:32.511\nWe don't tend to use a lot of IRC anymore,\nInternet relay chat.\n\n359\n00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:36.331\nYou know, maybe at the height of IRC\non one of the most up to date and\n\n360\n00:16:36.331 --> 00:16:40.155\nreally robustly used networks today,\nyou may have 30 or 40,\n\n361\n00:16:40.155 --> 00:16:43.930\nmaybe 50,000 users at a peak\non any one of these networks.\n\n362\n00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.220\nVery, very small, kind of off in\nthe corner business case today.\n\n363\n00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.670\nA lot of die hard advents\nthat are still using it.\n\n364\n00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.820\nIt's still a valid\ncommunication mechanism.\n\n365\n00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.660\nIt's a client server based solution\nthat allows us to effectively\n\n366\n00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.990\nexchange information.\n\n367\n00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.720\nThis is the precursor to what,\nnow, texting and\n\n368\n00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.065\nchatting through something like Link or\nSkype for\n\n369\n00:17:01.065 --> 00:17:05.155\nbusiness or AOL's instant messenger or\nYahoo or whatever would have been.\n\n370\n00:17:05.155 --> 00:17:08.945\nIRC is like old school Internet\nversion one for that, but\n\n371\n00:17:08.945 --> 00:17:11.915\nthere's still systems out there that\nare doing this kind of chatting and\n\n372\n00:17:11.915 --> 00:17:14.040\nare still used to exchange information.\n\n373\n00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.260\nAgain, as the CISSP, if one of\nthose 50,000 users is one of ours,\n\n374\n00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.080\nwe gotta understand the impact of that and\nunderstand that traffic, monitor it,\n\n375\n00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.010\nand make sure we're aware of it\nbecause that can lead to compromise.\n\n376\n00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.460\nWe effectively are sending\nunencrypted traffic through IRC,\n\n377\n00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:33.570\nwhich means if somebody is spending\ntime on these platforms chatting and\n\n378\n00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:36.200\nascending proprietary\nsensitive information.\n\n379\n00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.030\nIt goes unencrypted across the wire and\nsomebody could then pick up on that as we\n\n380\n00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.310\nshowed you with something like\na capture program such as ether reel or\n\n381\n00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:47.350\nany of the programs out there today so\nthat's again something to think about.\n\n382\n00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.420\nVPNs, Virtual Private Networks,\na very valuable resource and\n\n383\n00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.800\ntool that we've used for a very long time,\n\n384\n00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.730\nwe're moving away from the general thought\nprocess of VPNs in the traditional sense,\n\n385\n00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:01.380\nclient server yes, but agent-based\nclient software installed to do VPNs.\n\n386\n00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.290\nWe're now effectively moving\ntowards VPN-less VPNs in effect,\n\n387\n00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:07.760\nno agent-based software but still getting\nthe advantage of using tunneling and\n\n388\n00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.240\nthe encryption and\nprotection capabilities that we have.\n\n389\n00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.790\nSome of the newer more\nmodern versions of VPNs in\n\n390\n00:18:12.790 --> 00:18:15.070\nother words don't require\nagent-based software.\n\n391\n00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:19.010\nThey ae using tunneling across common\nprotocols to be able to effectively set up\n\n392\n00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:23.840\nand establish these secure\ncommunication channels.\n\n393\n00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.740\nSo VPNs are very valuable and\nimportant for us to be aware of.\n\n394\n00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.306\nBut again, one of the challenges with\nthem, is because they were complicated for\n\n395\n00:18:30.306 --> 00:18:33.199\nus to set up, because we had\nagent-based software, that had to be\n\n396\n00:18:33.199 --> 00:18:36.298\nconfigured a certain way, and we had\nto make sure it was not only set up,\n\n397\n00:18:36.298 --> 00:18:38.340\nbut that we had the right\ncredential in there.\n\n398\n00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.990\nIf we didn't remember the credential,\nwe didn't know what it was,\n\n399\n00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:42.400\nthere were all these headaches.\n\n400\n00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.420\nSo, a lot of times,\nyou'd have a VPN which was a good,\n\n401\n00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.260\nsecure communication mechanism, but\n\n402\n00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.460\nthen you'd spend a lot of time on support\ntrying to get it to work the right way.\n\n403\n00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.360\nPeople got frustrated, and as a result,\n\n404\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.980\nthey bypassed using it and would take data\nout of the network and use it locally,\n\n405\n00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.420\ninstead of connecting to\nit remotely as an offset.\n\n406\n00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.780\nThey would effectively\ngo around the control.\n\n407\n00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.540\nThe problem was that now the data\nwas on the local machine.\n\n408\n00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.900\nIf they did that, and\nthe local machine was compromised,\n\n409\n00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.830\nthen all of a sudden we've exposed all the\ndata that would have been safely secure,\n\n410\n00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.500\nif we left it in the network and\nconnected to it remotely through a VPN.\n\n411\n00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.300\nSo technology can be good.\n\n412\n00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.960\nA technology that is good but\ncomplicated and doesn't work easily and\n\n413\n00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.890\nwell is actually bad.\n\n414\n00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:22.720\nIt's not bad because it didn't do its job.\n\n415\n00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.950\nIt's bad because ultimately the end\nusers don't find value in it.\n\n416\n00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:29.730\nAnd this is one of the things that\na CISSP really have to be aware of.\n\n417\n00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.200\nWe can come up with\nincredibly complicated,\n\n418\n00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.690\ncomplex technological\nsolutions to problems.\n\n419\n00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:39.780\nI don't doubt for a minute that most of\nyou out there are capable of coming up\n\n420\n00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.710\nwith some really cool and innovative\nways to do the things we do everyday.\n\n421\n00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.090\nThat may involve new technologies,\nthat may or may not be well understood.\n\n422\n00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:50.530\nThat's all good, we want that innovation,\nwe want that to happen, that's good.\n\n423\n00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.570\nProblem is if it's not something that's\neasily translatable into a user's world\n\n424\n00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.640\nthen what will ultimately happen is\nthe users will simply ignore and\n\n425\n00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.970\nbypass that control.\n\n426\n00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:00.110\nThey just won't use it.\n\n427\n00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.365\nAnd VPNs effectively are good\nexample of that technology.\n\n428\n00:20:03.365 --> 00:20:05.640\nThey became very difficult and\ntedious to use.\n\n429\n00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.750\nMost users decided it\nwasn't worth the trouble.\n\n430\n00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.850\nSo while we had a good solution\nit was implemented poorly.\n\n431\n00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.400\nThis is the web conversation\nright all over again and\n\n432\n00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.750\nas a result of that because it wasn't\neasy to use it became less valuable.\n\n433\n00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.490\nCISSP's have to do two things and\ndo them well.\n\n434\n00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.580\nWe ultimately have to make sure that\nwe are able to translate the incredibly\n\n435\n00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.900\ncomplex environments we operate in\ninto simple distillable solutions for\n\n436\n00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:32.340\nusers that allow them to operate securely.\n\n437\n00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.190\nAnd we then have to document\nwhat we've done and\n\n438\n00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.670\nmake sure we test to enforce\nthe documentation and the policies and\n\n439\n00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.390\nprocedures, make sure we\nknow what's going on.\n\n440\n00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:43.090\nAnd if we find a problem,\nwe have to step back and\n\n441\n00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.530\nreengineer the solution to\nmake sure that it is usable.\n\n442\n00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.660\nThis is really distilled down in\nit's essence, what CISSP's do.\n\n443\n00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.980\nWe do a lot more than that, by the way.\n\n444\n00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.610\nI'm not saying that's\nthe only thing we do.\n\n445\n00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:52.950\nBut when you get right down to it,\n\n446\n00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.300\nit's our job to make\nthe incredibly complex simple.\n\n447\n00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.490\nSimple enough that average users\nwill actually follow the rules.\n\n448\n00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.700\nIf we can do that,\nwe've done our job well.\n\n449\n00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.130\nIf we can't, we gotta really\nthink about what we're doing and\n\n450\n00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:05.210\nare we doing the right things for\nthe right reasons?\n\n451\n00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:10.010\nSo, VPNs are good technology but VPNs can\nalso lead to challenges and concerns.\n\n452\n00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.950\nHow do we use a VPN,\nwell we connect up and\n\n453\n00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.200\nwe create what's called a tunnel\nultimately to secure two end points and\n\n454\n00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.060\nthen to effectively establish\ncommunication between them.\n\n455\n00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.390\nWhat are the protocols that\nmay be used to create tunnels?\n\n456\n00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:23.150\nOne of them is PPTP,\npoint to point tunneling protocol.\n\n457\n00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:26.350\nAnother one is L2TP,\nlayer two tunneling protocol.\n\n458\n00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:31.130\nLayer two tunneling protocol is gonna\nactually take PPTP which is the gen one,\n\n459\n00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.930\nfirst generation tunneling protocol that\nwas very popular and still remains so and\n\n460\n00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.260\nis still used but it's used under\nthe guise of a new technology.\n\n461\n00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.340\nCombines PPTP with something known as L2F,\n\n462\n00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.630\nlayer two forwarding protocol\nwhich is a proprietary Cisco\n\n463\n00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:48.110\nprotocol that exists at layer two of\nthe OSI model at the data link layer.\n\n464\n00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:51.150\nWe combine the two together and\nwe get a rebrand and\n\n465\n00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.880\nrepurpose protocol called L2TP,\nlayer two tunneling.\n\n466\n00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:58.370\nSo PPTP is gonna be a tunneling\nprotocol that's actually very valuable.\n\n467\n00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:02.450\nAnd the reason it sits at the heart of\nL2TP is for two very important reasons.\n\n468\n00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:03.800\nYou actually know what they might be.\n\n469\n00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.685\nYou may or may not know.\n\n470\n00:22:04.685 --> 00:22:06.500\n>> Built-in encryption capabilities.\n\n471\n00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.610\n>> So it does have built-in\nencryption capabilities, absolutely.\n\n472\n00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.550\nSo that's one of the very\nimportant reasons why we do this.\n\n473\n00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:13.380\nBecause one of the downsides\nto L2TP by itself,\n\n474\n00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.100\nwithout something else,\nis that it does not encrypt natively.\n\n475\n00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.760\nSo that is something to consider.\n\n476\n00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.570\nBut there's also another reason.\n\n477\n00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.530\nAnother reason that PBTP was very,\n\n478\n00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:25.420\nvery important is that it allowed us to\ntunnel protocols and run them over other\n\n479\n00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:29.210\nprotocols that normally would not allow\nfor those protocols to be transmitted.\n\n480\n00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:31.080\nIn other words like all\ngood tunneling protocols,\n\n481\n00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.410\nright, we're able to transmit\nprotocols that may or\n\n482\n00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:37.070\nmay not be routable inside of\na tunnel through protocols that are.\n\n483\n00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.610\nSo in other words we could take\nif we really wanted to right,\n\n484\n00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:44.060\nthink about the logic of this, you could\ntake Net Bios and tunnel it through a PPTP\n\n485\n00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.860\nconnection and route it even though it\nwas never supposed to leave your subnet.\n\n486\n00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.550\nNow that's kind of silly and\nif you do that you need a hobby.\n\n487\n00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:51.995\nGet out and talk to people more, right.\n\n488\n00:22:51.995 --> 00:22:53.230\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Square dancing, something, but\n\n489\n00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:53.970\nyou don't wanna do that.\n\n490\n00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:57.720\nBut my point is, it would allow us\nto be able to tunnel non-routable\n\n491\n00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.140\ntransmissions through a tunnel and\nsend it out.\n\n492\n00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:03.670\nIt does allow for things like\nthe addition of IPsec, PPTP does.\n\n493\n00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:05.120\nSo certainly, that's important.\n\n494\n00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:11.280\nIt does offer potentially the opportunity\nto include encryption depending on how\n\n495\n00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.650\nwe would set it up and what we would do\nwith it but it really formed the basis for\n\n496\n00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:18.685\nus for what we think of is [INAUDIBLE]\nprotocols because it was so flexible.\n\n497\n00:23:18.685 --> 00:23:19.905\nAnd it did so many things.\n\n498\n00:23:19.905 --> 00:23:23.375\nBut there were limitations, and\nso we updated it with L2TP,\n\n499\n00:23:23.375 --> 00:23:27.905\nLayer 2 Tunneling Protocol,\nPPTP plus L2F, but the downside to\n\n500\n00:23:27.905 --> 00:23:31.635\nL2TP is that there's no native encryption,\nno native authentication.\n\n501\n00:23:31.635 --> 00:23:34.590\nSo we often pair that with\nwhat's known as IPsec.\n\n502\n00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:36.920\nIP security which is\nthe security protocol.\n\n503\n00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.878\nWe talked about that,\nwhen we talked about the OSI model.\n\n504\n00:23:38.878 --> 00:23:41.705\nIP sec provides authentication and\nencryption for us or\n\n505\n00:23:41.705 --> 00:23:45.024\nat least the ability to provide\nauthentication and encryption.\n\n506\n00:23:45.024 --> 00:23:49.120\nAnd so we often will see and\nhear L2P deployed with IP sec.\n\n507\n00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.950\nIP sec effectively is a suite of\nprotocols for communicating securely if\n\n508\n00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:55.660\nyou want to think of it that way and\nthat's what we do there.\n\n509\n00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:57.171\nIPsec is made of up several components.\n\n510\n00:23:57.171 --> 00:23:59.143\nWe want to have a general\nknowledge of what they are.\n\n511\n00:23:59.143 --> 00:24:02.055\nWe have authentication headers,\nwhat are known as.\n\n512\n00:24:02.055 --> 00:24:05.258\nHeaders, Headers,\nauthentication headers, or.\n\n513\n00:24:05.258 --> 00:24:08.970\nThe authentication headers are gonna\nprovide the authentication capabilities.\n\n514\n00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:11.080\nSo, the integrity capabilities, and\n\n515\n00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.330\nthe authentication\ncapabilities come to us there.\n\n516\n00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.030\nWe also have encapsulation or\nencapsulated security pay load.\n\n517\n00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.900\nESP wich is providing\nthe confidentiality protection,\n\n518\n00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.320\nthe encryption if you will of the data.\n\n519\n00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.490\nAnd then we have what is known\nas the security association or\n\n520\n00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:24.890\nwhat's known as an SA.\n\n521\n00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:29.690\nThe SA is a one way agreement, a one way\nnegotiated agreement, uni-directional,\n\n522\n00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.990\nwe ultimately need two, so it's gonna be\na two one-way communication agreement\n\n523\n00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:38.670\nconversation to get bi-directional\ncapabilities for ITSEC to be applied.\n\n524\n00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.470\nBut an SA is effectively a one\nway communication agreement\n\n525\n00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:46.140\nnegotiated between, let's say the sender\nand the receiver in one direction,\n\n526\n00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.910\nthat stipulates how IPsec\nwill be set up and used.\n\n527\n00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.820\nSo it's effectively like a SLA\nif you wanna think about it,\n\n528\n00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.090\nfor a one-way communication channel to\nbe set up, established, and managed.\n\n529\n00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.680\nThat's what an SLA represents.\n\n530\n00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:58.380\nSo you have authentication headers.\n\n531\n00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:02.060\nYou have encapsulating security payload,\nwhich is the extensible protocol set\n\n532\n00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:05.900\nthat allows us to provide confidentiality,\nand then security associations that\n\n533\n00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.010\nare negotiated one-way agreements\nto govern communication.\n\n534\n00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.490\nThese are the building blocks\nto components of IPSEC.\n\n535\n00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.980\nNow IPSEC with L2TP is now\ngonna be implemented, or\n\n536\n00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:18.330\nL2TP with IPSEC is implemented\nin one of two modes.\n\n537\n00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:20.790\nWe're gonna implement that in\neither what's called tunnel mode or\n\n538\n00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:21.940\ntransport mode.\n\n539\n00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:25.070\nSo we have to just quickly talk about\nthe difference between the two.\n\n540\n00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.560\nWe often talk about the fact when we\nthink about IPSEC or L2TP with IPSEC,\n\n541\n00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.450\nwe think about how we tunnel and how we\ntransport, and what I often remind my\n\n542\n00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:36.400\nstudents of is that we transport\nup to the LAN or through the LAN.\n\n543\n00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.689\nAnd you can think of us transporting to\nthe LAN side of the router or the gateway,\n\n544\n00:25:40.689 --> 00:25:43.180\nand then we tunnel through the router.\n\n545\n00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:47.170\nSo we transport on the LAN,\nand we tunnel through the WAN.\n\n546\n00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.900\nBecause we tunnel between end points,\nbetween wide area network end points,\n\n547\n00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:51.975\nwhich are routers.\n\n548\n00:25:51.975 --> 00:25:54.130\nHow we transport on\nthe local area network.\n\n549\n00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.930\nSo transport mode is used on the LAN.\n\n550\n00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:59.620\nTunnel mode is used between\nrouting endpoints on the WAN, and\n\n551\n00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.280\nif that works for you and helps you\nto figure that out then, obviously,\n\n552\n00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.550\nthat's something to consider.\n\n553\n00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.790\nBut tunnel mode is gonna be implemented\nbetween routers, transport mode is\n\n554\n00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:11.450\nimplemented on the local area network\nside, to be able to effectively transmit\n\n555\n00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:16.480\nbetween a endpoint, a workstation of\nsome kind, and or server, excuse me.\n\n556\n00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:20.440\nAnd ultimately up the the local area\nnetwork side, the LAN side of the router,\n\n557\n00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.100\nor the LAN side of the gateway if you\nwill, is where we see transport mode.\n\n558\n00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.220\nSo we just want to think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n559\n00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.240\nWe also have something known as\nInternet key exchange, or IKE.\n\n560\n00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.880\nIKE is going to allow us to effectively\nexchange keys, between the members\n\n561\n00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.605\nthat are going to be involved in\nnegotiating the SAs, and using an IPSEC.\n\n562\n00:26:37.605 --> 00:26:39.975\nThis is all still part of\nthe IPSEC conversation.\n\n563\n00:26:39.975 --> 00:26:43.885\nSo two devices that are exchanging\nsymmetric keys, private keys for\n\n564\n00:26:43.885 --> 00:26:48.055\nthe use of encryption,\ninside of IPSEC are gonna use IKE,\n\n565\n00:26:48.055 --> 00:26:49.615\nInternet key exchange in order to do that.\n\n566\n00:26:49.615 --> 00:26:51.945\nNow, we have a couple of\ndifferent key exchange methods.\n\n567\n00:26:51.945 --> 00:26:54.905\nIKE is the overarching thought\nprocess we think about.\n\n568\n00:26:54.905 --> 00:26:56.071\nWe use Diffie-Hellman.\n\n569\n00:26:56.071 --> 00:26:59.800\nDiffie-Hellman is the traditional\nkey exchange method that we use.\n\n570\n00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.830\nWe could also use public key certificates,\nand we've talked about certificates, and\n\n571\n00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:05.670\nif you remember that conversation\nhow certificates can be used and\n\n572\n00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.620\nwhy, we can also use that.\n\n573\n00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:10.780\nBut Internet key exchange,\ngenerically, refers to the idea of\n\n574\n00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.240\nbeing able to exchange these private\nkeys and negotiate the use of them.\n\n575\n00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.800\nAnd the mechanism for doing so\n\n576\n00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.250\nis typically referred to as\nthe use of Diffie-Hellman,\n\n577\n00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:22.556\nwhich is a key exchange protocol that\nwe can use to do that with IPSEC.\n\n578\n00:27:22.556 --> 00:27:25.410\nAnd we also wanna think about\nremote control protocols, or\n\n579\n00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:29.760\nexcuse me remote authentication protocols,\nthat track usage across systems.\n\n580\n00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.310\nWe commonly refer to this\nas RADIUS technology.\n\n581\n00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:36.210\nRemote authentication dial in user\nservice is what RADIUS stands for.\n\n582\n00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.550\nRadius systems, believe it or\nnot, are still very popular,\n\n583\n00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:42.070\nit's just you don't really tend to see\nthem in most modern networks directly,\n\n584\n00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.590\nbecause they are typically\nused by service providers.\n\n585\n00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.170\nSo we often see them at the Internet\nservice provider level,\n\n586\n00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.340\nwhere they are using them to\nbe able to do three things.\n\n587\n00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:53.210\nWe refer to the triple\nA of radius traditionally.\n\n588\n00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.990\nWe think about authentication.\n\n589\n00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:57.130\nWe think about authorization.\n\n590\n00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:00.890\nAnd we think about auditing as the three\nAs that are represented by the radius\n\n591\n00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:01.760\ncapability.\n\n592\n00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:05.830\nSo, radius is effectively going to sit\non the border, right, of your network,\n\n593\n00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:07.300\na radius solution will.\n\n594\n00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:11.029\nAnd it's gonna intercept all inbound\ntraffic that is actually looking to come\n\n595\n00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:12.975\nin and gain access to your system.\n\n596\n00:28:12.975 --> 00:28:16.425\nSo any of the remote access technology,\nremote access traffic coming in,\n\n597\n00:28:16.425 --> 00:28:19.835\nis gonna pass it's traffic\nstream through a radius device.\n\n598\n00:28:19.835 --> 00:28:23.715\nRadius is then gonna look to authenticate,\nto authorize, and to audit, so\n\n599\n00:28:23.715 --> 00:28:25.205\nwhat radius does is it's a cut out.\n\n600\n00:28:25.205 --> 00:28:28.580\nIt's a proxy for\ninbound authentication traffic.\n\n601\n00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:32.230\nRadius server says hey, stop right\nhere on the border, stay right here,\n\n602\n00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:35.720\nI'm going to go check on your credentials,\nand see if you're legitimate or not.\n\n603\n00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.390\nAnd the radius server goes off over here,\nright there,\n\n604\n00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:43.750\nright over there, and let's pretend for\njust a minute that that\n\n605\n00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:48.310\nthing I'm pointing to right there is\nactually our directory service controller.\n\n606\n00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.300\nIn plain old fashioned English,\nthat's a domain controller.\n\n607\n00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.070\nSo the radius server's gonna talk\nto the domain controller, and\n\n608\n00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.870\nfind out whether the credentials\nprovided are legitimate.\n\n609\n00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.830\nThe goal is, we don't want\nthe inbound traffic to talk directly\n\n610\n00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:03.040\nto the domain controller,\nbecause if it's a spoofed traffic send,\n\n611\n00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:05.920\nor a masquerade of some kind,\nwe may have a bad actor that gains\n\n612\n00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.060\nadvantage by getting\ndirectly into the network.\n\n613\n00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.670\nAnd then can take advantage of that\naccess to do evil and to do harm.\n\n614\n00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:16.220\nSo, the radius box cuts out that\ntraffic's end, proxies get in effect.\n\n615\n00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:20.940\nStops it at a boarder, it goes over\non behalf of the system, says hey,\n\n616\n00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.170\nis this authentic?\n\n617\n00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:26.100\nThe transmission then comes back to\nthe radius server, and says yes, it is.\n\n618\n00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.690\nIf that's the case,\nwe then authorize the user, and\n\n619\n00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.465\nthen we allow that traffic stream in.\n\n620\n00:29:30.465 --> 00:29:33.400\nIf the answer is no, we'e shut it off,\nand don't allow it in.\n\n621\n00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.220\nThis is how a radius box works.\n\n622\n00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.800\nBut in addition, if we do allow it in,\nwe then are doing what's called auditing.\n\n623\n00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:41.110\nOur third A in the AAA.\n\n624\n00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.810\nThe auditing is the actual\nsession management and\n\n625\n00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.385\nmore importantly session\nmonitoring that takes place.\n\n626\n00:29:46.385 --> 00:29:49.240\nSo that we log all the events that\ntake place during the session.\n\n627\n00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:49.950\nWho are you?\n\n628\n00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:50.550\nWhere you going to?\n\n629\n00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:51.460\nWhere are you coming from?\n\n630\n00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.410\nWhat are you doing?\n\n631\n00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:56.320\nSo ISPs use this to be able to keep track\nof what is going on in their systems.\n\n632\n00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.790\nWhen you get that nasty cease and\n\n633\n00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:01.430\ndesist letter from the ISP because\nyou're using P2P technology,\n\n634\n00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:05.120\nto bit torrent files you're not supposed\nto, the reason they know that is because\n\n635\n00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.570\nyou're using radius servers to\nkeep track of what you're doing.\n\n636\n00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.790\nAnd they can tell that you're up to\nno good because they're auditing\n\n637\n00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.290\nyour connections.\n\n638\n00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.990\nWake up people, everybody's\nlistening to what you're doing,\n\n639\n00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:16.340\nyou should know better, right?\n\n640\n00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:19.020\nThere's no such thing as privacy\nin the digital domain anymore.\n\n641\n00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.010\nSo this is what radius technology does and\n\n642\n00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:23.050\nthis is how radius servers\nare gonna be used.\n\n643\n00:30:23.050 --> 00:30:27.380\nWe also have older old school real old\nschool technology, Diameter and TACACS or\n\n644\n00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:32.160\nTACACS plus reaching back into our\ngrab bag of historical irrelevancies.\n\n645\n00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.630\nSo Diameter was actually\nan improvement on radius.\n\n646\n00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.620\nSo it's like radius but radius plus.\n\n647\n00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:37.810\nIt was never really very popular.\n\n648\n00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:39.650\nIt never really was deployed widely.\n\n649\n00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.430\nIt was a standard that was\nthrown out there for a while.\n\n650\n00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:44.330\nPeople thought about it.\n\n651\n00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:47.560\nNever really went anywhere, so\nit's just a historical footnote, but\n\n652\n00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.830\nit was kinda like an improved\nversion of Radius.\n\n653\n00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:52.460\nRadius was good enough that we kind of\njust have it around still doing what it\n\n654\n00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:53.468\ndoes today.\n\n655\n00:30:53.468 --> 00:30:57.690\nTACACS or TACACS plus were really just\nanother version of this thought process to\n\n656\n00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:00.390\nkeep track of things that were going on.\n\n657\n00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:03.920\nBut what they really did was they\nencrypted the entire transmission for us,\n\n658\n00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.220\nso the exchange of user credentials during\nauthentication would not be exposed.\n\n659\n00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:12.210\nAnd so this is what the TACACS or\nTACACS plus solutions also did for us.\n\n660\n00:31:13.342 --> 00:31:16.330\n>> All right, well you know there's\na lot of good information about these\n\n661\n00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:19.830\nestablishing these secure\ncommunication channels.\n\n662\n00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:22.730\nI know we've got more to go, but\nunfortunately we're out of time for\n\n663\n00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:23.630\nthis particular episode.\n\n664\n00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:25.877\nSo we're gonna break right here,\nwe're gonna come back for more.\n\n665\n00:31:25.877 --> 00:31:30.321\nRemember if you guys wanna see Adam or\nattend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n666\n00:31:30.321 --> 00:31:32.767\nshoot us an email SeeAdam@Itpro.tv.\n\n667\n00:31:32.767 --> 00:31:34.590\nFor this one we're gonna go ahead and\nsign off.\n\n668\n00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:35.820\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n669\n00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:36.910\n>> I am a modem.\n\n670\n00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:38.955\nI'm analog and digital all in one.\n\n671\n00:31:38.955 --> 00:31:40.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Here I am.\n\n672\n00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.354\nI'm a teapot.\nHere's my pretty spout, right?\n\n673\n00:31:42.354 --> 00:31:43.650\nNo I'm only kidding.\n\n674\n00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:44.570\nI'm Adam Gordon.\n\n675\n00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.396\nCome on back and join us for\nour next conversation,\n\n676\n00:31:46.396 --> 00:31:49.069\nwe're gonna keep talking about this stuff,\nand get through all the rest of\n\n677\n00:31:49.069 --> 00:31:51.756\nthe technology you need to know about\nin order to be successful on the exam.\n\n678\n00:31:51.756 --> 00:31:53.243\n>> Very good.\nWe'll see you

--> 00:00:19.600\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick,\ntoday we're doing our CISSP content.\n\n4\n00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.689\nAnd specifically,\n\n5\n00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.540\nwe're going back into setting up\nour secure communication channels.\n\n6\n00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.810\nThis is our part two, we've already talked\nabout we started way back in our history,\n\n7\n00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.050\nmodems this like that.\n\n8\n00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.760\nMight have worked our way up, I think we\nended somewhere, Adam, around radius and\n\n9\n00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.200\nwe're gonna just continue on.\n\n10\n00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.460\nSo here with me is Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.530\nHow are you doing, Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.990\n>> I'm good.\nI'm good, Hopefully everyone out there is\n\n13\n00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.190\ndoing as well.\n\n14\n00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.270\nSo, we're gonna continue our conversation,\nas Mike was saying, what we're gonna do is\n\n15\n00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.525\njump back in, literally, to the middle end\nas opposed to the deep end of the pool.\n\n16\n00:00:48.525 --> 00:00:51.530\n[LAUGH] We're gonna talk about some of\nthe management protocols that run on top\n\n17\n00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.030\nof networks.\n\n18\n00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.586\nWe just left off,\nas Mike did indicate, with radius.\n\n19\n00:00:54.586 --> 00:00:56.690\nWe had a conversation\nabout radius is in AAA.\n\n20\n00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.790\nAnd what we need to understand with\nradius in any remote access technology\n\n21\n00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.760\nis that there's different kinds of\ntraffic that may actually come through\n\n22\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.840\nthose devices, right?\n\n23\n00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.160\nSo one of the common traffic\nelements that we often see Is\n\n24\n00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.010\nsomething that's driven by SNMP,\nSimple Network Management Protocol.\n\n25\n00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.010\nWhich is effectively a protocol\nthat allows us to manage remotely\n\n26\n00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.490\ndevices like routers, switches, and\n\n27\n00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.950\nall sorts of additional systems that will\nthen allow us to effectively connect,\n\n28\n00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.880\nprobe the device, be able to get\nconfiguration information out of it,\n\n29\n00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.134\nchange the settings on the device if\nnecessary, manage it, get a status update.\n\n30\n00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:33.431\nThings of that nature, right.\n\n31\n00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:38.385\nAnd so we are gonna have now, currently,\nthree versions of SNMP, v1, v2, v3.\n\n32\n00:01:38.385 --> 00:01:41.025\nV3 is the most recent version.\n\n33\n00:01:41.025 --> 00:01:42.415\nThat is the most secure.\n\n34\n00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:44.790\nIt does encrypt the traffic flow,\nnatively.\n\n35\n00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.495\nSNMPv1 was encrypted by default.\n\n36\n00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:50.155\nLet to some issues and\nconcerns about traffic management,\n\n37\n00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:53.815\nexposure of passwords and\nthings of that nature.\n\n38\n00:01:53.815 --> 00:01:57.515\nWe actually use what is known as a\ncommunity string to be able to effectively\n\n39\n00:01:57.515 --> 00:01:59.840\ninteract with V as an SNMP device.\n\n40\n00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.410\nYou can think of it like a password.\n\n41\n00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.370\nYou would have to revive the community\nstream to associate to the device.\n\n42\n00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.630\nAnd they'll be able to manage it\nusing get and put information or\n\n43\n00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.870\ncommands to be able to get information or\nput information there and\n\n44\n00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.980\nset it to get,\nput set things like that were used.\n\n45\n00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.390\nBut ultimately, the idea is that\nSNMPv3 encrypts that traffic and\n\n46\n00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.900\nallows us to be more secure\nin our communication.\n\n47\n00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.300\nSo you want to know about SNMP,\nobviously important as a protocol.\n\n48\n00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.910\nWe have a lot of remote access services.\n\n49\n00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.070\nWe've talked about several of them.\n\n50\n00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.220\nA lot of them are generic and\n\n51\n00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.180\nare used regardless of what\nkind of technology you may use.\n\n52\n00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.630\nBut there are other ones we haven't really\ntalked about that are gonna be older and\n\n53\n00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.700\nperhaps used on certain platforms only.\n\n54\n00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.280\nSo something like Telnet,\nwhich is an old historical footnote, but\n\n55\n00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.470\nit's something we should not really\nsee being used in production today,\n\n56\n00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.190\nbecause it is essentially a wide open,\nno encryption based,\n\n57\n00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.180\nclear communication solution for,\nagain, remote management of a system.\n\n58\n00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.140\nSo instead we replaced Telnet with\nsomething like SSH, and some sort of\n\n59\n00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.710\na secure communication client,\nwhether you use PuTTY or something else.\n\n60\n00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.670\nWith SSH to then be able to encrypt that\ntraffic and remotely manage that system,\n\n61\n00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.960\nis going to be a good alternative\nsolution for the use of Telnet.\n\n62\n00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.910\nWe may be using, if we're on a Linux or\nUnix based system,\n\n63\n00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.720\nthings like rlogon,\nRCP remote copy, RSH remote shell.\n\n64\n00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.420\nSo these are going to be tools\nthat are effectively able,\n\n65\n00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.120\nor do enable us to able to do\nremote access services securely\n\n66\n00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.060\nacross the Linux UNIX based\nplatforms of the world.\n\n67\n00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.440\nSo we're gonna be able to think about\nhow to implement them securely and\n\n68\n00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.740\nhave to again think about are we\ntunneling, are we gonna be encrypting,\n\n69\n00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.010\nare we gonna be able to just\nuse these are they open,\n\n70\n00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.780\nare they not open, are they encrypted,\nare they secure or are they not.\n\n71\n00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.140\nYou know, some of these things\nare older technologies that may not\n\n72\n00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.410\nhave transmitting with encryption.\n\n73\n00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.030\nMay have transmitted in the clear.\n\n74\n00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.440\nAnd we have to be aware of that.\n\n75\n00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.050\nSo the use of something like remote shell\nmay or may not be secure by itself.\n\n76\n00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.850\nAnd we have to understand that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n77\n00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.340\nSo these are all things to be consider.\n\n78\n00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.570\nScreen scraping technology is something\nthat's been around forever and a day.\n\n79\n00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.510\nYou know we've had a print screen button\non most of our systems for some time.\n\n80\n00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.800\nWe can effectively take\na picture of whatever's there.\n\n81\n00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.196\nIt's very hard to prevent that from\nhappening, because the reality is,\n\n82\n00:04:13.196 --> 00:04:16.703\nif we're running software that allows\nus to screen capture what's there,\n\n83\n00:04:16.703 --> 00:04:19.587\nwe can then take that screen capture and\ndo something with it.\n\n84\n00:04:19.587 --> 00:04:22.650\nAnd we may or may not be able to\nprevent that behavior from occurring.\n\n85\n00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.500\nYou know, in Windows 7,\nwe have the ability to use the,\n\n86\n00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.000\nwith the built in Program\nthat we can go in.\n\n87\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.710\nYeah, the snipping program,\nthe snipping tool is what it's called.\n\n88\n00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.440\nWe can go in and take a screen\ncapture of anything on the screen.\n\n89\n00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.720\nYou could also do a shift print screen\nfrom anywhere in any program and\n\n90\n00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.480\npretty much capture stuff as well.\n\n91\n00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.280\nPaste that into a document, and\nthen potentially exoltrate,\n\n92\n00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.280\nsend that off the system in some way.\n\n93\n00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.930\nSo remember that there may be ways for\n\n94\n00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.150\nus to get around most of the controls that\nyou've put in place in the system already.\n\n95\n00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.970\nWe want to be thinking about that as well.\n\n96\n00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.001\nWe may open up terminal connections,\nright, a remote desktop connection, an RDP\n\n97\n00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:59.873\nconnection, or some sort of remote console\nto a system and remotely manage it.\n\n98\n00:04:59.873 --> 00:05:03.355\nSo we want to be thinking about that, how\nsecure is that, and how secure will those\n\n99\n00:05:03.355 --> 00:05:06.081\ncommunications be is something\nelse that we have to consider and\n\n100\n00:05:06.081 --> 00:05:07.350\nbe concerned about.\n\n101\n00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.600\nToday with virtual technologies,\nespecially virtualization,\n\n102\n00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.890\nwe don't directly connect to these systems\nthrough a one to one connection, right.\n\n103\n00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.560\nWe're not using, even if we're\ngetting into a virtual machine,\n\n104\n00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.670\nthrough a KBM of some kind directly at the\nrack, right, it's still gonna be a remote\n\n105\n00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.970\ncommunication that we effectively\nare using to connect up to that system.\n\n106\n00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.740\nMore often than not,\n\n107\n00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.370\nwe're using a console that's opened\nup through a desktop of some kind.\n\n108\n00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.640\nWe want to know that those console\nsessions may or may not be protected,\n\n109\n00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.720\nand again we have to think\nabout the architecture, and\n\n110\n00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.250\nthink about the protocols, and think about\nthe ways in which we're communicating.\n\n111\n00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.250\nSpeaking of protocols,\n\n112\n00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.925\nspeaking of architectures, speaking\nabout the ways in which we communicate.\n\n113\n00:05:44.925 --> 00:05:48.815\nWe want to think about certain topologies\nor just generic designs that certain\n\n114\n00:05:48.815 --> 00:05:52.685\nnetwork systems are gonna have for us and\nwe want to be able to think about the fact\n\n115\n00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:56.515\nthat these designs, classic though they\nare, are important for us to be aware of.\n\n116\n00:05:56.515 --> 00:06:01.155\nSo we're gonna take a few minutes to take\na little guided tour here, if you will,\n\n117\n00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:04.308\ndown into the design area\nhere of our little workshop.\n\n118\n00:06:04.308 --> 00:06:05.679\nAnd we're gonna take a look and\n\n119\n00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:09.080\njust talk about some of the classic\nnetwork topologies that exist.\n\n120\n00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.260\nThis first one is gonna be a bus topology.\n\n121\n00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.770\nAnd what we see on the screen in\nfront of us is two terminators,\n\n122\n00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.920\ntwo connectors on either end, right.\n\n123\n00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.920\nAnd we see that in the middle we've got\na black line that represents that network\n\n124\n00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.600\nconnection point for all of the numbered\ncircles that are connecting.\n\n125\n00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.870\nThese are gonna be the workstations,\nor endpoints on the bus line.\n\n126\n00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.870\nAnd all of them are connected up to\nthe bus and are able to send and\n\n127\n00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.130\ntransmit as long as they\nstay connected to the bus.\n\n128\n00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.260\nYou'll connect in other words\nthrough a the whatever we would use,\n\n129\n00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.220\na network tap or a network connection.\n\n130\n00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.650\nDepending on the nature of\nthe technology at the time.\n\n131\n00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:44.770\nBut think of it as just\nplugging in our computer\n\n132\n00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.360\ndirectly to the bus line in some way.\n\n133\n00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.760\nA bus is really just a dedicated\nconnection that exists between two\n\n134\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.080\nterminated endpoints that allows us to\neffectively be able to communicate.\n\n135\n00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.380\nThe challenge of course is with this,\nright, if we were to take one of\n\n136\n00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:04.260\nthose numbered circles and remove them\nfrom the line by disconnecting them,\n\n137\n00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.430\nmaybe cutting the orange connection\nthat would connect it in,\n\n138\n00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.320\nwe may run into a problem because the boss\ncircuit may now have been broken.\n\n139\n00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.460\nAnd so the problem would be that\nnow the other systems that remain\n\n140\n00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.600\nmay no longer be able to communicate.\n\n141\n00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.260\nAnd so you can see that Mike is attempting\nto create a cable break there for us,\n\n142\n00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.715\nright and so we could potentially,\neffectively disconnect the system.\n\n143\n00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:27.112\n[LAUGH] This is live TV folks,\nremember that.\n\n144\n00:07:27.112 --> 00:07:30.600\n[LAUGH] So sometimes things work\nas planned, other times not so\n\n145\n00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.520\nmuch, but that's okay.\n\n146\n00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.410\nSo, if we have a little break line there\nfor instance, right, item number 3,\n\n147\n00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.140\nmaybe you're experiencing some\nsort of trouble communicating.\n\n148\n00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:42.745\nWe now may have a problem with maintaining\nthe integrity of that bus line.\n\n149\n00:07:42.745 --> 00:07:46.300\nAnd all the other systems on there may\nbe impacted negatively as a result.\n\n150\n00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.530\nIf we lose the terminator on either end,\n\n151\n00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.770\nwe lose the ability to communicate because\nwe no longer have a closed system either.\n\n152\n00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.506\nThat's also a problem.\n\n153\n00:07:52.506 --> 00:07:55.879\nIf one of the terminators were to fail or\nsomehow become unavailable,\n\n154\n00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:57.730\nthat could also be an issue.\n\n155\n00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.456\nWe have another diagram, if I'm not\nmistaken that we're going to go to.\n\n156\n00:08:00.456 --> 00:08:03.176\nThis one is going to be a token ring,\nor a ring network,\n\n157\n00:08:03.176 --> 00:08:05.080\nthat we're gonna be taking a look at.\n\n158\n00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.635\nAnd so, another topology of ring.\n\n159\n00:08:06.635 --> 00:08:10.960\nIt's interesting because,\nlogically, the ring runs,\n\n160\n00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.020\nor the topology runs, in a ring.\n\n161\n00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.160\nSo, when we look at it logically in terms\nof the data flow, we see a ring, or\n\n162\n00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.290\nat least we envision a ring.\n\n163\n00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:22.625\nAnd we envision a ring that gets situated,\nor it gets started up if you will,\n\n164\n00:08:22.625 --> 00:08:26.380\ninitialized, in either clockwise or\ncounter clockwise rotation.\n\n165\n00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.450\nThis ring is rotating clockwise,\nas we can see.\n\n166\n00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.040\nAt least, if I'm standing correctly and\nlooking at that properly, it's clockwise.\n\n167\n00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.050\nSo, it is a clockwise rotation.\n\n168\n00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.240\nWe could have initiated the ring\ngoing counter clockwise.\n\n169\n00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.990\nThe arrows would have, obviously,\nflipped around and gone the other way.\n\n170\n00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:43.410\nRings were only initialized in\none direction at any one time.\n\n171\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:48.070\nIt can only transmit either clockwise or\ncounterclockwise at any one time.\n\n172\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.340\nWe may have two rings that\nare co-terminus with each other,\n\n173\n00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.830\nthat run one inside the other.\n\n174\n00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.060\nThat would be a FDDI solution,\na fiber ring,\n\n175\n00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.290\nthat is used today with\nfiber-optic cabling.\n\n176\n00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:00.020\nAnd these kinda ring\nsolutions are still used.\n\n177\n00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.810\nBut the updated version of it is\nused to wire up entire city cores.\n\n178\n00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.860\nBecause now we can transmit over\ngreat distances, kilometers.\n\n179\n00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.910\nAnd we can have redundancy with the rings\nbecause they are transmitting in\n\n180\n00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:10.790\nopposite directions.\n\n181\n00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:13.250\nOne is clockwise, one is counterclockwise.\n\n182\n00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.070\nAnd the rings are then, as a result,\ngonna become resilient.\n\n183\n00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.700\nBecause if one ring were to fail,\n\n184\n00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.860\nthen the transmissions on the other\nring can pick up the slack, in effect.\n\n185\n00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.680\nSo, this is kind of a modern\nversion that we see of token ring.\n\n186\n00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.290\nBut the interesting thing about\ntoken ring is that physically,\n\n187\n00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.292\nwhen you wire it up,\nit actually looks like a star topology.\n\n188\n00:09:29.292 --> 00:09:32.160\nWe're gonna take a look at a star\ntopology here in a couple of minutes.\n\n189\n00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.220\nBut the idea behind a star is,\neffectively,\n\n190\n00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.050\nthat all the endpoints\nare gonna be connected up.\n\n191\n00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.100\nAnd they're gonna be laid out,\nnot in a circle,\n\n192\n00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.460\nthis is not like a duck duck goose\nkind of networking topology, but\n\n193\n00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.920\nrather they're wired up to\na central connectivity device.\n\n194\n00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:49.160\nYou can see on the left side of that\ndiagram there that we see switch.\n\n195\n00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.550\nWe've got a bunch of work\nstations hanging off it, and\n\n196\n00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.680\nthat is going to represent\na star topology.\n\n197\n00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.100\nWe've got a bunch of systems connecting\nthrough a common connection point.\n\n198\n00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.220\nIn this case, a switch, and allowing for\n\n199\n00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.870\ninterchanger exchange of\ninformation between them.\n\n200\n00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:06.290\nSo, token rings, physically, when you\nlook at them, look like star networks.\n\n201\n00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.260\nBut logically, they actually run as\nif they were connected in a rings.\n\n202\n00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.735\nIt's kind of an interesting\ndichotomy there, right?\n\n203\n00:10:12.735 --> 00:10:15.484\nBecause, physically, when you walk into\nan office building that would have\n\n204\n00:10:15.484 --> 00:10:18.250\nbeen running token ring, the network was\nlaid out like it was set up as a star.\n\n205\n00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.030\nYou would see people in cubes, right?\n\n206\n00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.105\nThey weren't sitting in\na circle facing each other.\n\n207\n00:10:22.105 --> 00:10:23.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They would have been in a cube or\n\n208\n00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.140\nsomething, and they would have\nbeen just set up working normally.\n\n209\n00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.120\nBut when you looked under the hood,\n\n210\n00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.540\nyou would have found that they were\nactually transmitting on a token ring.\n\n211\n00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.220\nSo, it would've been kind of\ninteresting in that respect.\n\n212\n00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.740\nSo, we have our star\ntopology there as well.\n\n213\n00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.130\nAnd the idea with star, which is kind of\ninteresting is, as you see on the right,\n\n214\n00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.430\nI believe, item number one kind of has\nthe orange lines here indicating a break,\n\n215\n00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.370\nin theory, for connectivity\nfrom that endpoint to the star.\n\n216\n00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.355\nAs long as the central connection device,\nin this case the switch, stays up and\n\n217\n00:10:49.355 --> 00:10:52.655\nis running, all the other end points 2,\n3, and 4 are gonna still be\n\n218\n00:10:52.655 --> 00:10:56.945\nable to connect to communicate through the\nswitch, and are not impacted by the fact\n\n219\n00:10:56.945 --> 00:10:59.715\nthat connection point or\nunpoint number one goes dark.\n\n220\n00:10:59.715 --> 00:11:02.220\nSo, obviously that's gonna be valuable for\nus.\n\n221\n00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.245\nWanna make sure we're\naware of that as well.\n\n222\n00:11:04.245 --> 00:11:05.325\nSo, we've done a star.\n\n223\n00:11:05.325 --> 00:11:06.135\nWe've done a ring.\n\n224\n00:11:06.135 --> 00:11:08.345\nWe've done a bus as well,\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n225\n00:11:08.345 --> 00:11:08.895\nRight?\n\n226\n00:11:08.895 --> 00:11:10.900\nWe also have a mesh topology.\n\n227\n00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.560\nAnd we may have a mesh there,\nI believe, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n228\n00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.030\nA mesh is going to look much\nlike what you see there.\n\n229\n00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.490\nAgain, logically,\n\n230\n00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:22.330\nwhat we're thinking of is interconnects\nfrom one system to all other systems.\n\n231\n00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:26.471\nSo, we're seeing what looks like a star\ndesign in effect there in the middle of\n\n232\n00:11:26.471 --> 00:11:27.043\nthe mesh.\n\n233\n00:11:27.043 --> 00:11:30.387\nBecause the lower item,\nlet's say just item number 4 down there,\n\n234\n00:11:30.387 --> 00:11:34.609\nat the lower left hand corner, is you'll\nsee connected up to number 1, is connected\n\n235\n00:11:34.609 --> 00:11:38.654\nout to number 2, is connected over to\nnumber 3, is connected over to number 5,\n\n236\n00:11:38.654 --> 00:11:42.210\nand has a point coming off it that\nconnects to every other system.\n\n237\n00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:45.080\nAnd all the other systems\nare interconnected to each other as well.\n\n238\n00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.170\nAnd so, in terms of a mesh,\n\n239\n00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.650\nwhat we're seeing is that every system has\nmultiple connections to every other one.\n\n240\n00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:51.610\nNow, this scales.\n\n241\n00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.420\nBut it doesn't scale very far, right?\n\n242\n00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.140\nYou get 20, 30, 40, 100 machines,\nand try to set up a mesh,\n\n243\n00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.900\nyou're gonna run out of rubber bands\nto wrap all the cables with, right?\n\n244\n00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.230\nBecause cable stacks are gonna get so\nlarge, and the interconnects are so\n\n245\n00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.670\nmassive, that it's very difficult\nto scale this technology\n\n246\n00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.750\nout beyond a very small\nnumber of workstations.\n\n247\n00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.660\nSo, while we do see meshes, we see them\nreally used for very small numbers of\n\n248\n00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:18.490\nsystems, traditionally, to create\nredundancy in some very specific topology.\n\n249\n00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.790\nSo, for instance, you may see a 911\nsystem that can never go offline,\n\n250\n00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.960\nthat has to be triple redundant or\nquadruple redundant.\n\n251\n00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.660\nAnd all the systems may be\ninterconnected with a mesh\n\n252\n00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.150\nto make sure that no matter where the\nfailure occurs, those systems stay online.\n\n253\n00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.240\nBut we're talking about a very\nsmall finite number of workstations\n\n254\n00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.650\nin terms of the 911 operators and\nthe interconnects back to the server core.\n\n255\n00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:39.520\nThat kind of thing.\n\n256\n00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.880\nThat would be a mesh, traditionally.\n\n257\n00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.680\nAnd so, we think about these\nkinds of topologies, and\n\n258\n00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.540\nwe think about the standard,\nclassic network designs.\n\n259\n00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:51.410\nWe also think about hybrid, or\na star bus topology, right, as well.\n\n260\n00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.120\nAnd I think we have a diagram for that.\n\n261\n00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.640\nWhen we have a hybrid topology,\nwe often think of it as a star bus.\n\n262\n00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:59.090\nThe reality is,\nwe use the star topology, but\n\n263\n00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.100\nwe use a bus to interconnect\nthe various stars.\n\n264\n00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:03.100\nSo, where would you see this?\n\n265\n00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.930\nIf you think about a multistory\noffice building, for example, where\n\n266\n00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:10.250\nwe're gonna have stars laid out on every\nfloor, but between the floors we have to\n\n267\n00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.812\nrun networking interconnects and conduit\nso that we can connect the network up.\n\n268\n00:13:13.812 --> 00:13:16.850\nWe're gonna use bus lines to\nconnect the stars together.\n\n269\n00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.290\nAnd so, we often refer to\nthat as a hybrid network.\n\n270\n00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:20.720\nAnd we call it a star bus,\n\n271\n00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.040\nnot to be confused with my\nfavorite place in the world.\n\n272\n00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:23.974\nStarbucks, right?\n\n273\n00:13:23.974 --> 00:13:25.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It is a star bus network.\n\n274\n00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.220\nSo, make sure we're aware of that.\n\n275\n00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.650\nBut these are all the different topology\ntypes, right, that we're gonna see and\n\n276\n00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:31.920\nthat we wanna be aware of.\n\n277\n00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.840\nSo, just a quick guide there for\nyou, if you will,\n\n278\n00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.610\na visual guide to all of the different\nnetwork topologies we see.\n\n279\n00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.190\nWhen we think about network topologies,\nwe think about the physical design,\n\n280\n00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.320\nthe layout of the network.\n\n281\n00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.140\nWe also have to think about the different\nways in which we transmit data\n\n282\n00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.010\nacross those networks.\n\n283\n00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.730\nThis would get into a conversation\nquickly about unicast, multicast and\n\n284\n00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:51.170\nbroadcast transmissions.\n\n285\n00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:55.220\nUnicast transmissions are literally, point\nto point between two defined endpoints.\n\n286\n00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:57.200\nA one to one communication.\n\n287\n00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.700\nSo, if Mike and I are having conversation\nwithout anybody else being involved, and\n\n288\n00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.820\nI say, Mike,\nhave you heard about this or that?\n\n289\n00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.060\nAnd Mike says, Adam, yeah,\nabsolutely that's kinda cool.\n\n290\n00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:07.820\nWe're talking to each other directly.\n\n291\n00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.030\nThat's an example of\na unicast transmission.\n\n292\n00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.110\nThink of picking up the phone and\ncalling somebody, right?\n\n293\n00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.750\nIt's also a good example\nof a unicast transmission.\n\n294\n00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.640\nMulticast transmissions\nare one to a group.\n\n295\n00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.790\nSo, I send out a communication, but\nI send it to a well defined group.\n\n296\n00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.530\nAnd it's by invitation only,\nin effect, right?\n\n297\n00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.018\nMay be subscription based.\n\n298\n00:14:25.018 --> 00:14:26.630\nMaybe membership based.\n\n299\n00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.210\nSo, think of ITPro TV.\n\n300\n00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.420\nGood example of multicasting in the sense\nthat, if you pay your membership fee\n\n301\n00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.990\nevery month, right, and then you're able\nto access all the content in the library.\n\n302\n00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:37.080\nYou're a member.\n\n303\n00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.280\nYou are, then, part of the multicast\ngroup that gets that content.\n\n304\n00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.560\nIf you're not a member, you may get\naccess to some of the demos, but\n\n305\n00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.040\nyou're not gonna obviously see\nall the full-featured content\n\n306\n00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.470\nthat we provide to all of our members.\n\n307\n00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.810\nSo, this is an example of multicasting.\n\n308\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.340\nWe tend to use multicasting for\nstreaming media.\n\n309\n00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.090\nWe use it for desktop imaging.\n\n310\n00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.990\nWe use it for situations where we\nhave to be a member of a group.\n\n311\n00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.700\nWe then receive information\nbased on that membership.\n\n312\n00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.465\nBroadcast transmission\nis one to everybody.\n\n313\n00:15:02.465 --> 00:15:03.415\nWalk into a room,\n\n314\n00:15:03.415 --> 00:15:07.815\nstand up on the table, scream at the top\nof your lungs, that's a broadcast.\n\n315\n00:15:07.815 --> 00:15:09.565\nWhether everybody in the room\nwants to hear you or\n\n316\n00:15:09.565 --> 00:15:13.685\nnot, is interested in what you have to\nsay, wants what you are talking about\n\n317\n00:15:13.685 --> 00:15:17.047\nto be part of their world, they're gonna\nhear it, whether they want it or not.\n\n318\n00:15:17.047 --> 00:15:17.757\nThat's a broadcast.\n\n319\n00:15:17.757 --> 00:15:19.057\nThey could choose to ignore it.\n\n320\n00:15:19.057 --> 00:15:21.837\nBut they're gonna be there and be present\nfor it whether they would like to or not.\n\n321\n00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:22.557\nThat's a broadcast.\n\n322\n00:15:22.557 --> 00:15:24.527\nSo, unicast, one to one.\n\n323\n00:15:24.527 --> 00:15:25.957\nMulticast, one to a group.\n\n324\n00:15:25.957 --> 00:15:30.277\nBroadcast, one to everybody, or one to\nanybody within distance, if you will.\n\n325\n00:15:30.277 --> 00:15:32.567\nTypically, within the sudden\nof the broadcast domain\n\n326\n00:15:32.567 --> 00:15:33.827\nis what the broadcast represents.\n\n327\n00:15:33.827 --> 00:15:37.627\nBecause broadcast transmissions\nare traditionally not propagated,\n\n328\n00:15:37.627 --> 00:15:41.430\nnot routed beyond the router to prevent\nwhat are known as broadcast storms.\n\n329\n00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:44.350\nNow, there are certain\nspecial exceptions to that.\n\n330\n00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:48.300\nWe do see bootstrap traffic being used and\npropagated out beyond the router.\n\n331\n00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:52.290\nSo, for instance, DHCP broadcast\nmessages are propagated through routers.\n\n332\n00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.629\nBecause the special use of the protocol\nand the ways we implement it.\n\n333\n00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:59.003\nBut out beyond that we don't typically\ntend to transmit broadcasts out beyond\n\n334\n00:15:59.003 --> 00:16:00.035\nour routed interface.\n\n335\n00:16:00.035 --> 00:16:03.170\nSo, just wanna think about that and\nbe aware of that as well.\n\n336\n00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.700\nWe also wanna talk about switch networks.\n\n337\n00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:08.150\nAnd switch networks are gonna be the way\nin which we actually move information back\n\n338\n00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.910\nand forth.\n\n339\n00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:11.640\nWe can have circuit switching or\npacket switching networks.\n\n340\n00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.850\nCircuit switch networks dedicate or create\ndedicated circuits between endpoints.\n\n341\n00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:19.460\nThese are basically going to be set up and\nare going to be on all the time, and\n\n342\n00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.220\nthey're always available for us.\n\n343\n00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.440\nPacket switch networks, data is\ndivided into packets, it's chunked.\n\n344\n00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:28.880\nAnd transmitted over a shared network, so\na circuit switch network creates dedicated\n\n345\n00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.000\ntransmission connections that are\nbasically used for you in all your data.\n\n346\n00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.540\nBut they're exclusive to you.\n\n347\n00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.590\nPacket switch networks are gonna\nsend all your packetized data\n\n348\n00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.910\nacross a common network mixed with\nall other data from all other people.\n\n349\n00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.790\nThink of the Internet as being the largest\npacket switch network in the world,\n\n350\n00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:44.990\nthe World Wide Web.\n\n351\n00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.580\nThink of circuit switch networks as\nbeing networks that are dedicated\n\n352\n00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.040\ncommunication channels.\n\n353\n00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.460\nSo think, for instance,\nabout maybe a tunnel between you and\n\n354\n00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.410\nultimately an endpoint that\nyou wanna communicate with.\n\n355\n00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.850\nThat's not quite an example of a circuit\nswitch network but it's kinda like that.\n\n356\n00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:04.880\nA better example would be buying a\ndedicated T1 line or dedicated OCS circuit\n\n357\n00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:08.790\nenabling that as a point to point\nbetween two known endpoints.\n\n358\n00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:11.870\nThat will be an example of a circuit\nswitch network that's dedicated to your\n\n359\n00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:13.120\nparticular needs.\n\n360\n00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.132\nAnd then, we also have what\nare called virtual circuits.\n\n361\n00:17:15.132 --> 00:17:17.220\nWe have what are known as\npermanent virtual circuits.\n\n362\n00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.210\nPVCs.\n\n363\n00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.098\nThese are established and\nalways there in effect always on.\n\n364\n00:17:21.098 --> 00:17:23.270\nOr we have what are known\nswitch virtual circuits.\n\n365\n00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.150\nSVCs.\n\n366\n00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:27.930\nThese are on demand, you initialize\nthe circuit when you have to send.\n\n367\n00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.760\nYou send it out based on the best\navailable path at the time.\n\n368\n00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.010\nYou tear it down when you're done and then\nyou no longer have to worry about that, so\n\n369\n00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.200\nthat's what's known as a switch,\na virtual circuit.\n\n370\n00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.820\nSo we have both dedicated and\nswitched systems.\n\n371\n00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:43.210\nExcuse me, dedicated and virtual solutions\nthat you can use so be aware of that.\n\n372\n00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:46.910\nWe also have to talk about access control\nbut not from the traditional perspective\n\n373\n00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.210\nwe think about,\nthat's gonna be coming up in domain five.\n\n374\n00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:53.960\nWhat we have to think about rather is\nhow we monitor on the wire for the send.\n\n375\n00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.270\nAnd or the send request that's\ngonna happen to transmit.\n\n376\n00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.629\nAnd what happens if we have a collision\nand we have to then monitor what's\n\n377\n00:18:00.629 --> 00:18:04.209\nhappening on the cable to ensure that,\nthat data collision is not gonna get in\n\n378\n00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:08.036\nthe way other communications and that we\nresend the data when we actually need to.\n\n379\n00:18:08.036 --> 00:18:12.400\nSo this is actually known as carrier sense\nmultiple access, or what's known as CSMA.\n\n380\n00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.680\nCSMA, generically, is this idea of\ncontrolling access to the cable,\n\n381\n00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.510\nto the send or transmission media.\n\n382\n00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.640\nSo that way,\nwe don't wind up with data collisions.\n\n383\n00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.190\nAnd we don't wind up with problems\nthat prevent us from transmitting.\n\n384\n00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.060\nBut what we have to talk about\nare the two specific variations.\n\n385\n00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:32.050\nCSMACA, carrier sense multiple\naccess collision avoidance, and\n\n386\n00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:36.400\nCSMACD, carrier sense multiple\naccess collision detection.\n\n387\n00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.120\nCarrier sense multiple access\ncollision avoidance, CA,\n\n388\n00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.150\nis always gonna be used\nwith wireless technologies.\n\n389\n00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:47.020\nCarrier sense multiple access collision\ndetection, CD, is always associated with\n\n390\n00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.340\nwired technologies,\nEthernet-based networks that are wired.\n\n391\n00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.420\nSo let's talk about\ncollision detection first.\n\n392\n00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:56.460\nCollision detection allows us\nto listen to the wire, listen or\n\n393\n00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.200\nmonitor to the cable or\non the wire for the scent.\n\n394\n00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.100\nNow, how do we do that?\n\n395\n00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.410\nThink about the logic of this.\n\n396\n00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:05.710\nWe're listening to a copper wire,\nwhere in effect we'll be monitoring it\n\n397\n00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:08.050\nto see if there's any data\ntransmitter to cross it.\n\n398\n00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:12.070\nWell, we know that we send data on\na copper wire with electrical impulses,\n\n399\n00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.630\nelectrical pulses,\nlittle pulses of electricity.\n\n400\n00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.020\nNot enough to hurt you, but\n\n401\n00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.050\nenough to register voltage\ntransmitting across the copper wire.\n\n402\n00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:21.190\nCopper's a great conductor\nof electricity so\n\n403\n00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.390\nwe can send it down the wire very easily.\n\n404\n00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:28.380\nAs a result, every network card is going\nto be able to effectively sense the spike\n\n405\n00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.840\nor the change in voltage\nstatus on the wire.\n\n406\n00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:34.760\nWhen there's a spike, there's voltage on\nthe wire, we know somebody's transmitting.\n\n407\n00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.750\nWhen there's no spike, there's no voltage\non the wire, nobody's transmitting.\n\n408\n00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:40.210\nIt's a very straightforward\nsystem when you think about it.\n\n409\n00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.940\nAs a result of that collision detection\nallows everybody all the endpoints\n\n410\n00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.100\non the system to monitor for\neffectively the voltage change.\n\n411\n00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:48.840\nIf we see or\n\n412\n00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.670\nhear a voltage change occurring we know\nthat some thing is trying to transmit.\n\n413\n00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.260\nWell, if they're trying to transmit we're\nprobably gonna wait and not transmit so\n\n414\n00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:57.720\nthat way we don't have a collision.\n\n415\n00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.124\nA collision implies the two data\npackets effectively run into each other\n\n416\n00:20:01.124 --> 00:20:02.815\nmay disintegrate, they explode.\n\n417\n00:20:02.815 --> 00:20:03.769\nIt's actually really cool.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n418\n00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:05.190\n>> There's little fireworks that go off.\n\n419\n00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.115\nThere's a little fire truck that\ncomes out on the Internet pathway,\n\n420\n00:20:09.115 --> 00:20:12.360\nputs out the fire,\nsweeps it all off to the side.\n\n421\n00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.640\nLittle Lego fire guys are running around.\n\n422\n00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.840\nIt's actually really cool.\n\n423\n00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.628\nYou need a microscope to see all this,\nbut it's really cool.\n\n424\n00:20:17.628 --> 00:20:20.761\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This doesn't happen [LAUGH] by the way.\n\n425\n00:20:20.761 --> 00:20:22.340\nNobody believe when I say that.\n\n426\n00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.210\nThat is not the cases.\n\n427\n00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.540\nI'm just fooling around with you guys.\n\n428\n00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.296\nBut what does happen, actually,\nis when the packets collide, the packets\n\n429\n00:20:28.296 --> 00:20:32.463\neffectively self-destruct, because they\ncannot be transmitted within the TTL,\n\n430\n00:20:32.463 --> 00:20:36.238\nthe time to live variable that says\npackets are good for this amount of time.\n\n431\n00:20:36.238 --> 00:20:38.630\nAnd as a result of that,\nthey basically disappear.\n\n432\n00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.410\nAnd so because of that,\nthey never get to where they're going.\n\n433\n00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.850\nAnd remember, TCP is a send and\nacknowledge protocol.\n\n434\n00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:47.980\nIf they don't get to where they're going,\nand we're using TCP, we have to wait for\n\n435\n00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.610\nthe acknowledgement.\n\n436\n00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.650\nWe don't get it, we say, well, didn't\nmake it there, we gotta send it again.\n\n437\n00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:55.460\nCuz we're automatically gonna resend that\npacket, if it's UDP we forget about it and\n\n438\n00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.270\nwe just keep transmitting,\nwe don't realize it didn't get there.\n\n439\n00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.890\nBut somebody may ask for a resend, which\ncase we have to send it again anyway.\n\n440\n00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:06.150\nSo when this happens we have to resend the\npacket, now if we just keep resending and\n\n441\n00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.050\nwe keep doing the same thing over, and\nover and over again, chances are good.\n\n442\n00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.656\nBoth parties resending, we're gonna keep\nhaving collisions, this is a problem.\n\n443\n00:21:12.656 --> 00:21:15.290\nWhat we have to do is,\nboth of us have to step back.\n\n444\n00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:17.100\nWe have to stop transmitting and\n\n445\n00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:20.520\none of us has to transmit before the other\nin order to make sure that our data gets\n\n446\n00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:24.000\nto where it's going before something\nelse gets on the wire and interrupts it.\n\n447\n00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.680\nBecause we can't really have multiple data\npackets existing in the same space at\n\n448\n00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:28.830\nthe same time.\n\n449\n00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.520\nSo as a result, we're gonna have\na problem if we keep trying to do this.\n\n450\n00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.700\nSo we use an offset.\n\n451\n00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:37.110\nWe actually use a timing algorithm\nthat supplies a variable of some kind,\n\n452\n00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.230\na millisecond offset, whatever that is.\n\n453\n00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.630\nFive milliseconds, ten milliseconds,\nwherever it may be.\n\n454\n00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.210\nIt's usually spanning tree algorithm,\nbut it may be other algorithms.\n\n455\n00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.130\nIt just depends on the nature of\nthe system, and how it's set up.\n\n456\n00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.500\nBut it will generate\na random offset value.\n\n457\n00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.280\nBoth parties will step\nback in other words,\n\n458\n00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.820\nwill generate a random offset value for\ntime and we'll wait.\n\n459\n00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.150\nI'm gonna wait three milliseconds.\n\n460\n00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.150\nMike, you're gonna wait\nseven milliseconds.\n\n461\n00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.380\nI'm gonna go before Mike\nbecause my value is smaller.\n\n462\n00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:04.790\nI'll resend as long as my send is\nsuccessful, I avoid the collision again,\n\n463\n00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:05.810\nthere's no collision.\n\n464\n00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.610\nI don't detect it,\nthen everything is good.\n\n465\n00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.730\nEverybody else keeps transmitting,\neverybody's happy.\n\n466\n00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:14.010\nSo we do have lots of collisions, and we\nhave lots of collisions that are detected,\n\n467\n00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.770\nand we have lots of collisions that\nare then gonna be having to effectively\n\n468\n00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:22.210\nyield resends on a collision detection\nsystem until we can safely send\n\n469\n00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:25.280\nwithout having a collision occur,\nthis is collision detection.\n\n470\n00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.090\nCollision avoidance works.\n\n471\n00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:28.640\nIn a slightly different way.\n\n472\n00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.980\nThe problem with collision avoidance\nis that it's used on wireless networks.\n\n473\n00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.730\nAnd that's not a problem, that's a fact.\n\n474\n00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.651\nBut the issue is on wireless networks\nwe have nothing to listen to.\n\n475\n00:22:37.651 --> 00:22:42.020\nThere's no cable to actually link to and\nsay, oh, there's electrical impulse there.\n\n476\n00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:43.500\nThere must be a transmit.\n\n477\n00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:44.523\nBecause remember,\n\n478\n00:22:44.523 --> 00:22:47.539\nmost of that infrastructure is\nnot connected up to a cable.\n\n479\n00:22:47.539 --> 00:22:50.050\nThe cable terminates at the wireless\naccess point in other words.\n\n480\n00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:53.320\nNo way to transmit and see that\nelectrical impulse out beyond that.\n\n481\n00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.340\nWe get wireless transmissions,\nbut that's not the same thing.\n\n482\n00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:59.670\nAnd so, what we do in CA,\nin collision avoidance instead,\n\n483\n00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.170\nis we actually follow\na slightly different process.\n\n484\n00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:06.520\nWe actually have to all step back, and\nwhat we do is instead of waiting for\n\n485\n00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:11.050\ndetection of a collision, we actually ask\nfor permission to be able to transmit.\n\n486\n00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:15.790\nSo collision avoidance implies everybody\neffectively connecting to the system and\n\n487\n00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:19.120\nthen patiently waiting and saying,\nI would like to transmit, but\n\n488\n00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.740\nI'm not sure if I can.\n\n489\n00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.591\nLet me send out a packet that effectively\nasks everybody on the network that's\n\n490\n00:23:24.591 --> 00:23:26.765\nconnected if they would\nmind if I transmit.\n\n491\n00:23:26.765 --> 00:23:28.915\nIt's a very civil, very genteel.\n\n492\n00:23:28.915 --> 00:23:32.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Very, very polite way of doing things.\n\n493\n00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.010\nSo as a result of that, what happens is\n\n494\n00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.650\nwe send out a request to be able to\neffectively get permission to transmit.\n\n495\n00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:42.110\nIf nobody objects,\nwe then assume that we have authorization.\n\n496\n00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.550\nEverybody understands\nwe're gonna transmit.\n\n497\n00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.020\nAnd then, we transmit.\n\n498\n00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.390\nAnd then, we do our thing, and\nthen when we're done we stop.\n\n499\n00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.240\nSomebody else says,\nI would like to transmit now.\n\n500\n00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.410\nMother may I, so can I transmit?\n\n501\n00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:55.100\nAnd then we wait, and then if\nnobody objects, then they transmit.\n\n502\n00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.580\nSo there's additional time built into\nthis process, cuz we have to ask for\n\n503\n00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.250\npermission.\n\n504\n00:23:59.250 --> 00:24:02.695\nWe have to wait for the time to expire\nbefore we are or are not granted that, and\n\n505\n00:24:02.695 --> 00:24:05.580\nthen we are transmitting if\nwe are given the right to.\n\n506\n00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.720\nSo on wireless networks,\n\n507\n00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.710\nthis is how we do the effective thought\nprocess of collision detection.\n\n508\n00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.450\nIt's translated into collision avoidance.\n\n509\n00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.180\nAnd this is how actually carrier\nsense multiple access works.\n\n510\n00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.660\nSo we have a different process for\nwireless, different process for wired.\n\n511\n00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.270\nJust want to make sure we're familiar\nwith that and aware of that as well.\n\n512\n00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.880\nAnd this also involves\na lot of other things.\n\n513\n00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.084\nSo for instance, you ever wonder why\nwhen you're on a wireless network,\n\n514\n00:24:28.084 --> 00:24:31.802\nlet's say it's rated at oh, I don't know\n11 megabytes, while you only really get\n\n515\n00:24:31.802 --> 00:24:35.078\napproximately half the bandwidth at\nany given time, that's connect up.\n\n516\n00:24:35.078 --> 00:24:37.058\nAnd it says hey, it rated at 11 megs, but\n\n517\n00:24:37.058 --> 00:24:40.858\nyou look at your little wireless\nindicator, you're transmitting like 5.5.\n\n518\n00:24:40.858 --> 00:24:42.050\nYou ever wonder why that is?\n\n519\n00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.660\nIt's exactly because of what we just\ndescribed, collision avoidance.\n\n520\n00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:47.810\nBecause it takes approximately half\nthe bandwidth to manage the setup and\n\n521\n00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:50.395\nthe management of all that\ntraffic to transmit, and\n\n522\n00:24:50.395 --> 00:24:52.910\nthen half of that is actually\ngiven over to data transmission.\n\n523\n00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.530\nNow there are some other reasons why\nyou get less bandwidth ultimately, but\n\n524\n00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:58.271\none of the key reasons is the overhead\nto implement collision avoidance,\n\n525\n00:24:58.271 --> 00:25:00.160\nit's kind of interesting when\nyou delve under the covers and\n\n526\n00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.870\nfind out about all these things.\n\n527\n00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.276\nSo remember we talked about\nsome standards from the IEEE,\n\n528\n00:25:04.276 --> 00:25:07.316\nI'm not gonna put Mike on the spot and\nask him to tell us what IEEE is again,\n\n529\n00:25:07.316 --> 00:25:09.845\nhe almost got it right the last time,\nwe'll call that good.\n\n530\n00:25:09.845 --> 00:25:14.050\nBut IEEE 802.3, quick quiz, 802.3 is?\n\n531\n00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.000\n>> Ethernet.\n\n532\n00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.310\n>> Anybody, I don't hear anything.\n\n533\n00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:17.930\nAnybody out there, anybody at all?\n\n534\n00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:20.128\nEthernet, yes, absolutely correct,\nMike, ethernet.\n\n535\n00:25:20.128 --> 00:25:21.460\nSo 802.3 is the ethernet standard.\n\n536\n00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.460\nRemember we want to know\nthat 802.5 is token ring.\n\n537\n00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.540\nTalked about that as well, so\nmake sure we're aware of that.\n\n538\n00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:30.140\nWe talked about FDDI.\n\n539\n00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.270\nI mentioned FDDI,\nfiber rings in relation to token ring.\n\n540\n00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:37.270\nFiber token rings, FDDI,\nalso pretty popular today.\n\n541\n00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.844\nFDDI is effectively a backbone\ntechnology as I mentioned,\n\n542\n00:25:40.844 --> 00:25:44.282\nit's used to wire up pretty\nmuch large intercity pores.\n\n543\n00:25:44.282 --> 00:25:48.099\nSo large volumes of traffic moving through\ndowntown areas are gonna run over fiber\n\n544\n00:25:48.099 --> 00:25:51.419\nnetworks that are controlled by\nthe Internet search providers today,\n\n545\n00:25:51.419 --> 00:25:52.040\nthe telcos.\n\n546\n00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:55.420\nAnd they're going to use FDDI in\norder to wire these solutions up.\n\n547\n00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.430\nWe use two rings running\nin different directions.\n\n548\n00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.200\nOne is gonna go clockwise,\nthe other counterclockwise.\n\n549\n00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.750\nOnly one primary ring\nis used to transmit on.\n\n550\n00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.278\nSecondary ring is used as the backup,\nas I said.\n\n551\n00:26:05.278 --> 00:26:08.842\nBut if the primary fails, we can fail\nthe data over the transmissions over to\n\n552\n00:26:08.842 --> 00:26:11.359\nthe secondary ring with\nminimal loss of continuity.\n\n553\n00:26:11.359 --> 00:26:15.543\nAnd we have just a total solution\nthere that allows us to keep or\n\n554\n00:26:15.543 --> 00:26:18.610\nto create continuity for our transmission.\n\n555\n00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:19.320\nI'm slowly but\n\n556\n00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.600\nsurely losing my command of the English\nlanguage here as I start talking.\n\n557\n00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.790\nSo just keep that in mind,\nFDDI is fiber token basically.\n\n558\n00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.130\nWe talked a bit about Secure Shell.\n\n559\n00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:29.680\nJust reminding you about that and\nthe use of that as well.\n\n560\n00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.460\nWe've also talked about VPNs and\nwhy they're so important.\n\n561\n00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.740\nThe use of a secure communication and\ntransmission technologies,\n\n562\n00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:37.946\nalways a good thing to keep in mind and\nremember.\n\n563\n00:26:37.946 --> 00:26:43.115\nAs a CISSP, I've talked about this\nin several other places as well.\n\n564\n00:26:43.115 --> 00:26:45.959\nYou may not have complete\nknowledge on how to setup a VPN.\n\n565\n00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:46.808\nIt just may not be your thing.\n\n566\n00:26:46.808 --> 00:26:48.360\nYou may not do this everyday.\n\n567\n00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.400\nYou may know you use one.\n\n568\n00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.680\nYou may understand\nthe conceptual idea behind it.\n\n569\n00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.780\nBut you may not be the nuts and\n\n570\n00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.190\nbolts mechanic that goes in and\nsets these things up every day.\n\n571\n00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:56.810\nThat's okay.\n\n572\n00:26:56.810 --> 00:27:00.230\nBut you do want to understand enough about\nthe technology to be able to summarize\n\n573\n00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:01.010\nits function.\n\n574\n00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.392\nSo point number one if you\nthink about a mile wide,\n\n575\n00:27:03.392 --> 00:27:05.841\ninch deep here is just a reality check for\na minute.\n\n576\n00:27:05.841 --> 00:27:09.420\nSummarize the function, couple of\nsentences that explain what a VPN is.\n\n577\n00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.440\nMaybe a good working example of where and\nwhen a VPN will be appropriate and\n\n578\n00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.560\nwhy we need one, also very important.\n\n579\n00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:20.220\nYou may want to have an example of not\njust how to apply VPN, not just why it's\n\n580\n00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.480\nimportant, but what kind of control,\nwhat kind of value does a VPN provide.\n\n581\n00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:26.197\nIt's good because it tunnels our data,\n\n582\n00:27:26.197 --> 00:27:29.083\nprovides secure endpoint\ncommunication that's authenticated.\n\n583\n00:27:29.083 --> 00:27:32.867\nTypically is also gonna be encrypted,\nallows remote workers to be able to\n\n584\n00:27:32.867 --> 00:27:36.955\nconnect from outside the unsecure part of\nour network into the secure inner core\n\n585\n00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:41.227\nwith dedicated pathing that will restrict\nand only allow them to see the things that\n\n586\n00:27:41.227 --> 00:27:43.940\nwe want them to see and\nwe want them to interact with.\n\n587\n00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.620\nThis is generically what a VPN is and\nwhat it does.\n\n588\n00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:50.240\nAs a result of that, if you can kind of\nsummarize at that level, you're good.\n\n589\n00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.420\nYou're a mile wide, inch deep.\n\n590\n00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.410\nYou may even be mile wide,\nand two inches deep.\n\n591\n00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:57.190\nBut being a little bit deeper is okay, as\nlong as you're not down the rabbit hole,\n\n592\n00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:00.760\ntrying to dig a five foot hole that's\ngonna get you into trouble on the exam.\n\n593\n00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.960\nTalked about virtual private networks,\n\n594\n00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.370\nlet's talk about VLANs,\nvirtual local area networks.\n\n595\n00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:10.180\nWe create virtual local area networks or\nVLANs on our switches.\n\n596\n00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.290\nSo we often will set them up on\nthe switches, program them in.\n\n597\n00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.250\nAnd VLANs go back to this idea of\nthe packet header that we examined when we\n\n598\n00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.410\nlooked at the sequencing when we\ntalked about fragmentary offsets.\n\n599\n00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.880\nAnother area inside that packet\nheader would be the VLAN ID.\n\n600\n00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.710\nAnd a VLAN ID is gonna be a numerical ID,\nanything from what,\n\n601\n00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:30.860\nsay 1 to 4,094,\nthat's typically the range for VLANs.\n\n602\n00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.970\nAnd we'll take a number,\nwe'll say it's gonna be number 25.\n\n603\n00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:33.870\nYou like 25?\n\n604\n00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:34.497\n>> I like 25.\n\n605\n00:28:34.497 --> 00:28:38.740\n>> I like 25, too, so 25's a good number,\nso our VLAN ID today is gonna be 25.\n\n606\n00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:42.850\nWhat that means is that if\nyou are in the 25 VLAN,\n\n607\n00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:47.190\nyou're gonna have all of your data, all\nthe packets you generate on the system,\n\n608\n00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:50.770\ntagged in that data header\nwith a VLAN ID that says 25.\n\n609\n00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:52.760\nThat's gonna be set up and\n\n610\n00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.980\neffectively programmed into every\nport on the switch that's active.\n\n611\n00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.942\nSo we know that that VLAN\nincorporates all the members,\n\n612\n00:28:58.942 --> 00:28:59.970\nwhoever's a part of that VLAN.\n\n613\n00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.610\nWe have what's called a VLAN group,\nthat VLAN group stipulates who's a member.\n\n614\n00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:07.670\nAll the members of that group,\nwith the VLAN ID 25 associated with them,\n\n615\n00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:11.140\nare then gonna be able to transmit and\nsend and receive to each other.\n\n616\n00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.680\nAnybody outside that group is\nthat's not a member of the VLAN\n\n617\n00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.220\ndoesn't see that traffic.\n\n618\n00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:19.230\nSo the traffic is logically isolated\nas opposed to physically isolated.\n\n619\n00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:22.200\nIt's just another level of security and\ncontrol we can apply.\n\n620\n00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.080\nSo VLANs also become very important,\n\n621\n00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.950\nthings that we want to be\nthinking about as well.\n\n622\n00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:27.510\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n623\n00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:31.470\nObviously, VLANs are valuable, but\nVLANs can also lead to complications.\n\n624\n00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.670\nWhat if we don't set\na VLAN up the right way?\n\n625\n00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:35.310\nWe put the wrong people in the VLAN or\n\n626\n00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.690\nexposed information in the VLAN\nto people that shouldn't see it.\n\n627\n00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:39.440\nWell, then we have a problem.\n\n628\n00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.020\nWe have these things called primary VLANs.\n\n629\n00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.790\nThe main VLAN is a primary VLAN.\n\n630\n00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:47.630\nWe also have what's known as a private or\nsecondary VLAN, not a primary,\n\n631\n00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:48.900\nbut a secondary VLAN.\n\n632\n00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.950\nThis is a nested VLAN,\na VLAN inside of another VLAN.\n\n633\n00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:55.450\nWe can actually nest VLANs,\nand I have a secondary VLAN ID\n\n634\n00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:58.150\nthat further segments and\nfurther divides up our traffic.\n\n635\n00:29:58.150 --> 00:29:59.740\nThis is implemented in certain systems.\n\n636\n00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:03.250\nNot on all of them, but traditionally most\nmodern switching systems will support\n\n637\n00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:05.910\nboth primary and secondary,\nor nested VLANs,\n\n638\n00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.969\nas you often hear them referred to,\nyet another way to safeguard traffic.\n\n639\n00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:13.170\nWe also need to think about the amount\nof bandwidth we bring to the party.\n\n640\n00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:15.670\nNo good party would be complete\nwithout some sort of bandwidth.\n\n641\n00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:19.020\nWe may have a T-carrier, may have\na E-carrier, may have an optical carrier,\n\n642\n00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:20.622\nI mentioned OCS earlier.\n\n643\n00:30:20.622 --> 00:30:23.874\nSo T-carrier's a very popular prevalent\nwithin North America, for instance,\n\n644\n00:30:23.874 --> 00:30:25.014\nit's in the United States.\n\n645\n00:30:25.014 --> 00:30:30.540\nWe'll talk about a T1, T2, T3 as being the\nlevel of bandwidth we'll get from an ISP.\n\n646\n00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:36.400\nA T1's approximately about 1.4, 5, almost\n1.5 megs about 1, 1.5 megs approximately.\n\n647\n00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.880\nA T3 is gonna be significantly\nhigher than that,\n\n648\n00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.990\nabout 45 megs approximately as we\nlink multiple T-carriers together.\n\n649\n00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.700\nSo the idea is that we're talking\nabout a dedicated amount of bandwidth.\n\n650\n00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.951\nIn Europe, which is where E-carriers\nare traditionally gonna be found and\n\n651\n00:30:48.951 --> 00:30:51.459\nprevalent, we have a slightly\ndifferent way of ranking.\n\n652\n00:30:51.459 --> 00:30:53.520\nAn E1 is going to be close to a T1.\n\n653\n00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.650\nIt's about 2 megs approximately,\nabout just over 2 megs.\n\n654\n00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:00.780\nAnd then a T3, or excuse me,\na T3 versus an E3 is going to be a very,\n\n655\n00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.370\nvery different scenario.\n\n656\n00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:03.990\nSo it's not really that important for\n\n657\n00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.900\nyou to necessarily know all the bandwidth\nrequirements on a T1 versus an E1.\n\n658\n00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:11.020\nBut it is important for\nyou to differentiate that a T-carrier\n\n659\n00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:14.820\nis going to be a North American, typically\na US-centric way of dealing with bandwidth\n\n660\n00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:19.030\nfrom a provider, whereas an E-carrier is\na European-centric way of identifying and\n\n661\n00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:20.270\ndealing with bandwidth from a carrier.\n\n662\n00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:22.300\nSo I just want to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n663\n00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.430\nThose of you that may be in other\nparts of the world, in other words,\n\n664\n00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:25.490\nwe don't want you to feel left out.\n\n665\n00:31:26.945 --> 00:31:29.980\nOptical carrier networks\nare gonna be dedicated high-speed\n\n666\n00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.270\nbandwidth that a service provider\nwill sell to you and provide to you.\n\n667\n00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:36.136\nThis could go up as say\nas hundreds of megabytes.\n\n668\n00:31:36.136 --> 00:31:38.261\nOr excuse me, hundreds of megabytes,\nthat's gonna be really fast.\n\n669\n00:31:38.261 --> 00:31:38.877\n>> Smoking.\n\n670\n00:31:38.877 --> 00:31:39.709\n>> Smoking fast.\n\n671\n00:31:39.709 --> 00:31:41.462\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Hundreds of gigabytes,\n\n672\n00:31:41.462 --> 00:31:44.329\nif my mind was operating at gigabyte\nspeed before my mouth engaged,\n\n673\n00:31:44.329 --> 00:31:47.820\nwe wouldn't have as many of these little\noopsies as we're talking about things.\n\n674\n00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:52.290\nOptical carrier networks can get up to\nhundred of gigabytes in speed, very,\n\n675\n00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:52.994\nvery fast.\n\n676\n00:31:52.994 --> 00:31:54.590\nYou're buying very high speed,\n\n677\n00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:58.181\nvery large amounts of data on dedicated\nbandwidth And dedicated provision\n\n678\n00:31:58.181 --> 00:32:01.615\ncircuits from a provider when you're\ndealing with optical carriers.\n\n679\n00:32:01.615 --> 00:32:04.480\nSo you may get very,\nvery large volumes of data in other words.\n\n680\n00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.370\nSo you just want to be\nthinking about that as well.\n\n681\n00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:09.482\nWe also have older technologies that\nmaybe use things like frame relay.\n\n682\n00:32:09.482 --> 00:32:10.459\nRemember frame relay?\n\n683\n00:32:10.459 --> 00:32:11.570\nATM.\n\n684\n00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:13.040\nNot the kind where you go and\n\n685\n00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.560\nget money out of the bank but\nasynchronous transfer mode technologies.\n\n686\n00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.030\nThis was gonna basically divide\ndata up into 53 byte cells.\n\n687\n00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:22.040\nIt's what ATM technology would do.\n\n688\n00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.390\nWe used a fixed length for\nthat technology transfer.\n\n689\n00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:28.625\nPretty fast, up to about 150 or\nso megabytes.\n\n690\n00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:31.623\nWhen I say fast and megabytes,\nwhat I'm saying is at the time,\n\n691\n00:32:31.623 --> 00:32:34.405\nthis technology was really prevalent and\nwas being used.\n\n692\n00:32:34.405 --> 00:32:38.630\n150 or 155 megabytes of transmission\nspeed was very, very fast.\n\n693\n00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:41.290\nIt is still very fast\non the back end plane,\n\n694\n00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:44.070\nbecause most of our networks transmit\nat gigabit speeds internally,\n\n695\n00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.880\nbut when we get out on the Internet,\nthey transmit much slower.\n\n696\n00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.070\nWhich is why you tend to have to wait for\n\n697\n00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:51.000\nthings to show up, cuz it's not\nalways as fast as you would think.\n\n698\n00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.910\nBut a frame relay network is gonna be\na network that's made up of the carrier\n\n699\n00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:58.550\nprovider switches linked together,\nthat's gonna rely on typically TCP\n\n700\n00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:01.320\nbased protocols to do error connection and\ncontrol.\n\n701\n00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.400\nSo a lot of the carrier providers\nare using frame or ATM.\n\n702\n00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:07.930\nNow the other key thing that we wanna just\nmention quickly here is software defined\n\n703\n00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:11.850\nnetworking which is a big technology\nthat we're hearing a lot about today.\n\n704\n00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:14.871\nSoftware defining anything today,\nsoftware defining networks,\n\n705\n00:33:14.871 --> 00:33:17.892\nsoftware defining shortage,\nsoftware defining the data center,\n\n706\n00:33:17.892 --> 00:33:20.025\nall of this implies two\nvery important things.\n\n707\n00:33:20.025 --> 00:33:24.931\nSoftware defining implies configuration\nbased on some sort of software file so\n\n708\n00:33:24.931 --> 00:33:26.915\na config file, an answer file.\n\n709\n00:33:26.915 --> 00:33:30.482\nAnd it implies automation to be able\nto provision quickly and to use that\n\n710\n00:33:30.482 --> 00:33:34.168\nanswer file to effectively create\nthe opportunity for us to provision and\n\n711\n00:33:34.168 --> 00:33:37.750\ntherefore to manage whatever\nthe infrastructure is that we wanna use.\n\n712\n00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:41.550\nWhen we think about software defining\nnetworking, we're thinking about an SDN,\n\n713\n00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:43.710\na software defined network controller.\n\n714\n00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.370\nYou can think of this as\nthe brains of the operation.\n\n715\n00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:49.665\nThe controller is gonna use\ntwo specific control elements.\n\n716\n00:33:49.665 --> 00:33:54.070\nWhat's called a northbound API and\na southbound API.\n\n717\n00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.710\nThe southbound API or\nthe southbound interface,\n\n718\n00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.900\nit's sometimes called an interface but\noften called an API.\n\n719\n00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.000\nBut the southbound implies direction\ngoing down from the controller,\n\n720\n00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.170\ninto the networking stack itself,\ninto the networking elements.\n\n721\n00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:10.120\nThe routers, the switches, etc.\n\n722\n00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:14.500\nTo implement configuration and\ncontrol at the networking layer.\n\n723\n00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:18.410\nThe northbound API and the northbound\ninterface implies going up in direction.\n\n724\n00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:22.830\nThis implies going up in to the user and\nthe application business logic here\n\n725\n00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:25.740\nto be able to interact with\nthe configuration information and\n\n726\n00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:29.200\nprovisioning we need, that the application\nneeds in order to consume data.\n\n727\n00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:33.900\nSo software defined networking\nimplies interacting with and linking\n\n728\n00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:38.910\nthe application of the user data through\na control interface in to the networking.\n\n729\n00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:41.110\nAnd the actual configuration\nthat takes place there.\n\n730\n00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.720\nThrough northbound and southbound APIs\nthrough a common control interface.\n\n731\n00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.490\nSo we often talk about\nan application layer.\n\n732\n00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:48.780\nAnd the northbound API addresses that.\n\n733\n00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.320\nWe talk about the control layer.\n\n734\n00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.570\nThat's where the software\ndefined controller is.\n\n735\n00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:54.400\nAnd we talk about an infrastructure layer.\n\n736\n00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.023\nThat it's the southbound API's business.\n\n737\n00:34:56.023 --> 00:34:58.836\nThat's where the infrastructure\nis created and managed.\n\n738\n00:34:58.836 --> 00:35:01.130\nIt's where we actually connect to\nthe routing and the switching.\n\n739\n00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:03.610\nSo this is how software\ndefined networking is set up.\n\n740\n00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:05.619\nAnd this is ultimately how we can,\n\n741\n00:35:05.619 --> 00:35:09.580\nnot only as I said, provision and\nvery quickly spin up technology.\n\n742\n00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:11.722\nBut we can actually automate\nthe provisioning and\n\n743\n00:35:11.722 --> 00:35:14.527\nautomate the control of that\ntechnology through answer files and\n\n744\n00:35:14.527 --> 00:35:18.250\nthrough what we will call workflow or\nconfiguration management.\n\n745\n00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:19.340\n>> All right, very good Adam,\n\n746\n00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.730\nthere's a lot of stuff that goes into\nsecuring your communication channels.\n\n747\n00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.090\nA lot of different channels.\n\n748\n00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:25.640\nReally depends on\nthe technology you're using.\n\n749\n00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.090\nWe had a great look it from\nthe past to the present,\n\n750\n00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:30.180\nkind of a glimpse into\nwhere we might be heading.\n\n751\n00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.438\nSo appreciate that Adam.\n\n752\n00:35:31.438 --> 00:35:35.162\nRemember if you guys wanna\nsit in one of Adam's classes,\n\n753\n00:35:35.162 --> 00:35:37.730\nsend us an email SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n754\n00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:38.670\nThat's gonna do it for this one.\n\n755\n00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.110\nSigning off, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n756\n00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.730\n>> Oh, wait.\n\n757\n00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:42.370\nThat's me, yeah.\n\n758\n00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.190\nI'm Adam Gordon, I forgot.\n\n759\n00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.200\nWe'll see you soon.\n\n760\n00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:45.880\nIt's been a long day.\n\n761\n00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.500\nWe'll see you soon.\n\n762\n00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.302\nCome on back.\n\n763\n00:35:47.302 --> 00:35:48.501\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.270\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.158\nToday we're doing our CISSP.\n\n5\n00:00:19.158 --> 00:00:20.588\nAnd specifically in this one,\n\n6\n00:00:20.588 --> 00:00:23.550\nwe're going to be looking at\nmitigating network attacks.\n\n7\n00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.460\nWe've talked a lot about networks,\n\n8\n00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.040\nwe've talked a lot about the attacks\nthat can occur over these networks so\n\n9\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.710\nthat we better understand what\nthose bad guys are trying to do.\n\n10\n00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.760\nIt's important that we know how to try to\ndefend ourselves against these attacks as\n\n11\n00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.460\nwell and Mr. Adam Gordon here is\ngonna help us through that we hope.\n\n12\n00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.430\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n13\n00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.520\n>> I am good, I am feeling attack\nworthy today so exciting stuff.\n\n14\n00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.270\nWhen we think about defending ourselves\nagainst attacks we've often talked about\n\n15\n00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.020\nthe three pillars of information\nsecurity management.\n\n16\n00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.430\nI want to remind ourselves of them,\nright, what are they?\n\n17\n00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.040\nConfidentiality, very important, keeping\ninformation secret keeping it secure.\n\n18\n00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.330\nIntegrity, ensuring information is not\ncompromised without our knowledge,\n\n19\n00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.560\nwithout our consent.\n\n20\n00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.020\nAnd availability, making sure that\ninformation is going to be there and\n\n21\n00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.572\navailable to be able to be used when and\nwhere necessary.\n\n22\n00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:14.420\nSo I want to start our conversations\nhere by thinking about this.\n\n23\n00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.850\nWhen we think about preventing or\nmitigating network security attacks or\n\n24\n00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.725\npreventing or mitigating network\nconcerns with network security.\n\n25\n00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:25.130\nWe want to make sure that we are thinking\nabout what it is we are focusing on,\n\n26\n00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.550\nthe things that impact confidentiality,\nthings that impact availability,\n\n27\n00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.190\nthings that impact integrity\nare our goal here.\n\n28\n00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.380\nMinimize those.\n\n29\n00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.810\nAnd as a result, maximize security.\n\n30\n00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.540\nDefense in depth is the order of the day,\nwe talked about this in other episodes.\n\n31\n00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.490\nCreating a defense in depth architecture\n\n32\n00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.800\nis really about making sure ultimately\nthat we are going to be able to\n\n33\n00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.120\nensure that we have mutually-reinforcing\nconcentric rings of protection.\n\n34\n00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.310\nAnd when we do that and we're able to\ndo that, hopefully successfully and\n\n35\n00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.130\nwell, we're gonna architect\na solution that would allow us, for\n\n36\n00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.160\ninstance, to be able to put\nboundary routers on our border.\n\n37\n00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.570\nWe're gonna put firewalls with NAT\ncapabilities there along with our routers.\n\n38\n00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.970\nWe're gonna run an IDS and or an IPS\nsolution along with them and in addition,\n\n39\n00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.680\nstepping back let's say maybe three or\n\n40\n00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.840\nfour layers from there, we're then gonna\nalso be using multi-factor access control.\n\n41\n00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.370\nWe're gonna be using a RADIUS\ndevice to allow inbound\n\n42\n00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.090\nremote access to be monitored and proxied.\n\n43\n00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.110\nWe're gonna go ahead and\n\n44\n00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.000\nuse certificates to be able to\nauthenticate individuals uniquely.\n\n45\n00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.380\nWe're going to in addition not\nonly do all those things, but\n\n46\n00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.270\nwe're also gonna go ahead and we're gonna\nensure that we're up to date with all of\n\n47\n00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.780\nour patch management on\nall of our endpoints.\n\n48\n00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.380\nWe're gonna make sure that we've\nhardened all of our hosts,\n\n49\n00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.840\nstripping out all unnecessary software,\nall unnecessary services.\n\n50\n00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.410\nWe're gonna make sure that we\nare encrypting all traffic in transit and\n\n51\n00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.520\nat rest.\n\n52\n00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.270\nAnd I could go on and on, right, but\nthe idea is that by adding in all of these\n\n53\n00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.300\nlayers of capabilities and mutually\nreinforcing each other with these layers,\n\n54\n00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.210\nwe're gonna create a defense\nin depth solution.\n\n55\n00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.790\nAn architecture that hopefully is gonna\nput security first and is also gonna\n\n56\n00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.670\nprevent bad actors from gaining access\nall the way in to the infrastructure.\n\n57\n00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.550\nIn other words, they may get past\nthe boundary router, they may get past\n\n58\n00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.620\nthe firewall, but are they gonna get\npast the other 25 things on that list?\n\n59\n00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.470\nYeah, they may or they may not.\n\n60\n00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.100\nIt really just depends on how dedicated\nthey are and how good we are.\n\n61\n00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.040\nBut the point is the more things we\nput between us and the bad people,\n\n62\n00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.810\nthe less likely it is the bad people will\nget all the way through to touch us, and\n\n63\n00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.230\nget to our information.\n\n64\n00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.150\nAnd if that's the case, that's what\nwe really have to think about and\n\n65\n00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.030\nwhat we wanna strive for.\n\n66\n00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.549\nSo defense in depth, very,\nvery important solution.\n\n67\n00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.400\nWe showed you in one\nof our prior episodes,\n\n68\n00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.740\nMike was kind enough to help me out with\nthis, we put up a network sniffer and\n\n69\n00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:42.550\nshowed you what Ethereal was capable of.\n\n70\n00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.833\nReally Wireshark, but I just prefer\nsaying Ethereal because that's how I know\n\n71\n00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:47.360\nthe product when I started using it.\n\n72\n00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.950\nWhen I grew with it it\nwas called Ethereal.\n\n73\n00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.150\nIt sad that it's not there more.\n\n74\n00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.645\nI should shed a tear.\n\n75\n00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:54.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Perhaps we'll have a candle or\n\n76\n00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.220\na wake for it at some point later.\n\n77\n00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.230\nBut for now, we'll simply just\nrefer to it as Wireshark.\n\n78\n00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.580\nWhen we talk about sniffing,\nwe're talking about being able to\n\n79\n00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.760\neffectively capture all the packets\nthat run across our network.\n\n80\n00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.530\nIt's kind of interesting\nhow sniffing works, right?\n\n81\n00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.910\nBecause we have to do what's\ncalled putting the network card,\n\n82\n00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.100\nthe interface, into promiscuous mode.\n\n83\n00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.990\nIt's pretty important to think about,\nright?\n\n84\n00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.840\nSo when we think about something\nbeing in promiscuous mode,\n\n85\n00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.110\nwhat we think about it doing is\neffectively being able to examine and\n\n86\n00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.290\nget copies of everything that\ncomes across that interface.\n\n87\n00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.900\nI mentioned when we did that OSI\nmodel conversation in that episode\n\n88\n00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.280\nthat at the physical layer we examine and\n\n89\n00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.830\npull all the traffic up through\nthe physical layer in to the data link\n\n90\n00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.170\nlayer and then actually examine\nthe packets at the data link layer.\n\n91\n00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.260\nIf we're running the model\nfrom the physical layer up,\n\n92\n00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.890\nwe're seeing traffic transmitted into\nthe system instead of traffic being\n\n93\n00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.610\ntransmitted out of the system.\n\n94\n00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.810\nWhen we see it coming in,\nwe go to layer two.\n\n95\n00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.920\nAnd layer two is really the border,\nit's the boundary, it's the gateway\n\n96\n00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.260\nthat we have to get past if we want to get\nthat packet into the system and processed.\n\n97\n00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.600\nAnd if you think about what\nhappened to layer two,\n\n98\n00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.430\nthe real interesting control mechanism\nis the MAC address sublayer.\n\n99\n00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.540\nBecause what we do is we look at the data\nheader of every packet that's coming into\n\n100\n00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.720\nthe system and we examine the MAC address.\n\n101\n00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.410\nAnd when we took a look at\nthe packet capture that Mike did and\n\n102\n00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.060\nwe looked at the session ID and\nthe sequencing information.\n\n103\n00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.470\nWe didn't really point it out, but it was\nthere, you just might not have seen it.\n\n104\n00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.210\nBut the MAC address as well as\nthe IP address of the source and\n\n105\n00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.320\ndestination was involved in that packet.\n\n106\n00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.260\nIt was further up beyond the TCP layer,\nfurther up in the initial information of\n\n107\n00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.690\nthe packet near IP layer,\na little bit further up.\n\n108\n00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.520\nWe didn't really take a look at,\nbut it was there.\n\n109\n00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.320\nAnd what we would have\nseen was the MAC address.\n\n110\n00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.130\nAnd what is happening is that we look\nat that MAC address and we do a match.\n\n111\n00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.630\nIt's a very quick binary yes/no,\non/off kind of conversation.\n\n112\n00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.060\nDoes that MAC address match our interface?\n\n113\n00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.702\nIf the MAC address in the packet, in the\ntwo field matches us, meaning it's meant\n\n114\n00:05:45.702 --> 00:05:50.000\nfor us, we accept the packet and\nwe process it up the rest of the model.\n\n115\n00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.950\nIf the address, the MAC address on the two\nfield, does not match our MAC address or\n\n116\n00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.520\nany MAC address on our system.\n\n117\n00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.890\nCuz remember we may have more\nthan one network interface,\n\n118\n00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.370\nthey have more than one MAC address,\nright?\n\n119\n00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.610\nIf it doesn't match, we ignore the packet.\n\n120\n00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.290\nIn fact, we just discard it and\nit goes on its way.\n\n121\n00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.980\nSo this is how the normal\ninteraction takes place.\n\n122\n00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.570\nWhat changes with eavesdropping or\n\n123\n00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.880\nsniffing is that we change that\ninterface to work in promiscuous mode.\n\n124\n00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.220\nMeaning it will examine and capture every\npacket regardless of whether the two\n\n125\n00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.170\nfield matches the MAC address or not.\n\n126\n00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.320\nWe suck it up, in other words,\ninto the interface.\n\n127\n00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.710\nWe effectively photocopy it.\n\n128\n00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.800\nIt's like a Xerox concept, right?\n\n129\n00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.370\nWe're photocopying every packet as it\ncomes through, examining it just long\n\n130\n00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.720\nenough to get a copy of it and\nthen it all goes on its way.\n\n131\n00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.510\nWe're not stopping the packets.\n\n132\n00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.320\nWe're not preventing them\nfrom being delivered.\n\n133\n00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.520\nWe're just making them stop\nat our location long enough\n\n134\n00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.310\nto copy what's inside of them.\n\n135\n00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.795\nThis allows us to do sniffing but\nmore broadly allows us to do packet\n\n136\n00:06:43.795 --> 00:06:46.971\ninterrogation, allows us to\nunderstand what's inside for\n\n137\n00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:50.040\nthe use of technology such as DLP,\ndata loss prevention.\n\n138\n00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.504\nWe can encrypt and decrypt on the fly\nif we have the proper encryption and\n\n139\n00:06:53.504 --> 00:06:56.930\ndecryption capabilities,\nwe've talked about that how that works.\n\n140\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.400\nYou guys should hopefully now\nbe experts at all of that.\n\n141\n00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.240\nIf you're not, what do you need to do?\n\n142\n00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.160\nRewind and\nreview often is what you need to do.\n\n143\n00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.070\nGo back and look at those episodes, right?\n\n144\n00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.530\nBut we've talked about all this and\nhow this works.\n\n145\n00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.230\nThe idea with eavesdropping or\nsniffing, what we're really doing\n\n146\n00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.580\nis we're examining packet traffic\nthat wasn't necessarily meant for us.\n\n147\n00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.860\nWe're somehow capturing\nthat packet traffic and\n\n148\n00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.400\nthen we're going to decide\nwhat to do with it.\n\n149\n00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.750\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of this\nbehavior because obviously if we let this\n\n150\n00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.790\ngo on and somebody is able to do\nthis without our knowledge, we're\n\n151\n00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:33.570\npotentially risking confidentially being\nbreached and information being exposed.\n\n152\n00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.600\nWe also have to worry\nabout open mail relays.\n\n153\n00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.460\nAre we able to effectively send\ninformation into a system,\n\n154\n00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.330\nconnect to a mail relay,\nan SMTP mail relay?\n\n155\n00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.720\nAnd are we able to then effectively\nsend data through that system and\n\n156\n00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.390\nmake it look as if it came from there?\n\n157\n00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.570\nIf we have an open mail relay,\nwe have a significant problem.\n\n158\n00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.645\nBecause we're probably spewing spam\nout of our networks into others.\n\n159\n00:07:52.645 --> 00:07:54.595\nWe probably have also been blacklisted.\n\n160\n00:07:54.595 --> 00:07:56.383\nNobody will talk to us ever again.\n\n161\n00:07:56.383 --> 00:07:58.252\nAnd no one's ever gonna\nget our email anyway.\n\n162\n00:07:58.252 --> 00:07:59.512\nBut their going to get all the other junk.\n\n163\n00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:00.629\nThat were spewing out.\n\n164\n00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:04.997\nSo the problem with Open Mail Relays is\nthat somebody has an SMTP protocol that\n\n165\n00:08:04.997 --> 00:08:09.095\neffectively has been exposed to other\npeople and allowing it to be used to\n\n166\n00:08:09.095 --> 00:08:12.740\nforward mail without any controls\neffectively enabled on it.\n\n167\n00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:17.700\nNo authentication, no control mechanisms\nof any kind to specify a white or\n\n168\n00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.980\na black list, who can or cannot send.\n\n169\n00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.700\nWho has acknowledged it, it isn't\navailable and therefore authorized user or\n\n170\n00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:25.458\nsend it in point for that.\n\n171\n00:08:25.458 --> 00:08:28.530\nSo the SMTP service will in and of itself,\n\n172\n00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.170\nif we don't control it,\naccept inbound mail from anybody.\n\n173\n00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.690\nIt's not going to ask you to\nauthenticate unless we ask it to.\n\n174\n00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:37.710\nAnd if it doesn't do that, it will\neffectively act as an open or blind relay.\n\n175\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.950\nAnd if that is happening you may find\nout that somebody has decided to use you\n\n176\n00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.985\nas effectively a launching pad\nto go into business themselves,\n\n177\n00:08:44.985 --> 00:08:46.510\nadvertising Viagra to the world.\n\n178\n00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.760\nSo, you wanna make sure you're aware of\nthat, you don't allow that to happen.\n\n179\n00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.050\nOpen mail relay servers,\nobviously, can be a problem.\n\n180\n00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.550\nThey lead to spam as we discussed and\nspam as we know, is a bad thing.\n\n181\n00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.900\nWe don't want spam happening.\n\n182\n00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.220\nWe can get blacklisted,\nas I said, if we do.\n\n183\n00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.770\nBlacklisting implies that you\nare listed on one or more published and\n\n184\n00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.080\navailable blacklists\noutside in the Internet,\n\n185\n00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.370\nout on the world wide web that\na lot of people will subscribe to.\n\n186\n00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.170\nWhen I say people,\nI mean organizations, and\n\n187\n00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:14.600\nmore importantly, email servers and\nemail monitoring systems\n\n188\n00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.050\nare gonna automatically\nsubscribe to these blacklists.\n\n189\n00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.340\nSpamhaus, for instance,\nis an example of one.\n\n190\n00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.660\nThere are many of them out there.\n\n191\n00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.870\nYou ever use Spamhaus, by the way?\n\n192\n00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.950\nYou ever subscribe to it?\n\n193\n00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.810\n>> No.\n>> You guys have not?\n\n194\n00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.780\nOkay, but\nit's one of those common lists, right?\n\n195\n00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.720\nAnd so the idea is that the email\nsystem will subscribe, and\n\n196\n00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.770\nif the email server sees that that\ninbound IP is on that blacklist,\n\n197\n00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.460\nit will drop the inbound traffic and\nnot allow it to be delivered.\n\n198\n00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.200\nIf you get on a blacklist,\nit is very difficult to get off.\n\n199\n00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.670\nAnd it's problematic,\n\n200\n00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:45.030\nbecause some systems may blacklist\nyou across multiple blacklists.\n\n201\n00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.090\nOthers may only blacklist you on one or\ntwo.\n\n202\n00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.890\nSo if you don't know all the blacklisted\nlists you're on, you may get off some but\n\n203\n00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:51.810\nmay not get off others.\n\n204\n00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.210\nAnd in effect some people will then\naccept your email, others will also say,\n\n205\n00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:55.870\nhey, who are you?\n\n206\n00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.550\nAnd I don't wanna know who you are and\nI don't wanna talk to you.\n\n207\n00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.260\nBecause you're on a blacklist.\n\n208\n00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.400\nSo this could be a problem, right?\n\n209\n00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.150\nSo it's one of those things\nthat once you get on,\n\n210\n00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.470\nit's very difficult to separate\nyourself from, ultimately.\n\n211\n00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.630\nSo you want to make sure you don't\nget listed in the first place,\n\n212\n00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.510\nis I guess what we would say with that.\n\n213\n00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.120\nAnother thing that we could do is\nwe could do port scanning, right?\n\n214\n00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.060\nAnd the idea is that we can look for\nopen ports.\n\n215\n00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.110\nAnd we've talked about open ports\nbefore and why they could be important,\n\n216\n00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.640\nwhy it's important to know what\nprotocol is using what port,\n\n217\n00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.020\nbecause you can tell what\nservices are being offered.\n\n218\n00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.480\nSo that's important information for\nus, it's also valuable information for\n\n219\n00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.330\nan attacker.\n\n220\n00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:30.780\nIf we scan a system and find port 80\nopen we know there's HTTP protocol,\n\n221\n00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.730\nweb service traffic coming in and out.\n\n222\n00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:34.200\nWe may not know what web server but\n\n223\n00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.710\nI bet we could find out pretty easily if\nwe issue a malform get HTTP request to\n\n224\n00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.800\nthat interface we'll get back\nthe host header from the web server.\n\n225\n00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.450\nThe web server is giving out host headers.\n\n226\n00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.640\nThey may not be, but if they are, we'll\nprobably find out what version of web\n\n227\n00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.380\nserver we are looking at or\nwhat's running.\n\n228\n00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.220\nIs it a Microsoft IAS server?\n\n229\n00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.430\nIs it an Apache Linux based web server?\n\n230\n00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.590\nWe can find out a lot about it.\n\n231\n00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.650\nIf we find port 25 running,\nwe may be able to connect and\n\n232\n00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:00.940\nto interact with the email system.\n\n233\n00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:06.720\nSo we can use a, either SMTP or\nESMPT, extended SMPT command set and\n\n234\n00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.230\nwe can actually issue emails\ndirectly from a command shell.\n\n235\n00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.375\nWe don't need a graphical mail client,\nright?\n\n236\n00:11:12.375 --> 00:11:14.080\nWe make it easy on you guys today.\n\n237\n00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:17.060\nWe give you pretty point and\nclick interfaces to write email.\n\n238\n00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.960\nOld world, hardcore, old school stuff.\n\n239\n00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.160\nWe didn't give you point and\nclick interfaces.\n\n240\n00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.460\nYou wanted to write an email,\nyou entered it from a command line and\n\n241\n00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.450\nyou figured out how to\nwrite it from there.\n\n242\n00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.800\nThis is how the old school\nway of doing things was done.\n\n243\n00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.100\nNow I'm not suggesting for\na minute that you have to go back to that.\n\n244\n00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.990\nWhat I'm suggesting is, however, something\nvery interesting as an observation.\n\n245\n00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.040\nThe best hackers in the world, people\nthat really know what they're doing,\n\n246\n00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:41.110\nare not five year old kids\nthat play Nintendo for\n\n247\n00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.580\na living, despite what the urban myths and\nlegends are.\n\n248\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.610\nBut these are people,\nin many cases, older people.\n\n249\n00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:47.830\nThat have been doing this for so\n\n250\n00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.670\nlong that they understand enough about\nthis technology and they understand\n\n251\n00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:55.660\nthe old ways of doing things that still\nare available and we often forget about.\n\n252\n00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.010\nIf you can connect to an SMTP relay and\nyou can use a command line to do so,\n\n253\n00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:01.920\nyou don't need a graphical\ninterface to send and\n\n254\n00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.330\nreceive mail, you just need the ability\nto enter SMTP based commands.\n\n255\n00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.850\nSo if you can interact with that command\nserver and you can make it talk to you,\n\n256\n00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:14.360\nyou can actually draft and\nemail and hit enter from a shell.\n\n257\n00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.080\nAnd send that email without\nconnecting a mail client to it.\n\n258\n00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.610\nIf you're able to do that and\nI'm not saying that's easy to do.\n\n259\n00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:23.130\nYou have to learn the old\nforgotten knowledge and\n\n260\n00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.170\nlore that's in the old books, right?\n\n261\n00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.080\nSo you have to go out and\n\n262\n00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.860\nreally learn how to be a hacker from\nthe ground up is my point, right?\n\n263\n00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.700\nBecause if you learn how to do this stuff.\n\n264\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.680\nAnd you forget a lot of\nthe stuff you know, years and\n\n265\n00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.860\nyears after doing this stuff.\n\n266\n00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.260\nBut if you for instance,\nI've been doing this for probably\n\n267\n00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.500\nabout 30 some odd years now, I came up in\na world where all this stuff was the norm.\n\n268\n00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.720\nThe stuff I'm talking about\nwith you that's old school,\n\n269\n00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.770\nthat I said we use to do way back when?\n\n270\n00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.360\nI learned how to do when it was\nactually fashionable to do.\n\n271\n00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.820\nSo I was doing it when it was new,\nnot just now when its old.\n\n272\n00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.650\nBut if you know how to do this\nkind of stuff, as a CISSP,\n\n273\n00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:02.040\nyou're gonna be a heck of a lot better at\ndefending your networks than CISSPs that\n\n274\n00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.790\ncome up in the modern day and are only\ngonna be familiar with new technology.\n\n275\n00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.995\nI'm not suggesting that you're any less\neffective if you're a brand new CISSP,\n\n276\n00:13:08.995 --> 00:13:11.350\nthat's just learning how\nto start doing this stuff.\n\n277\n00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:13.260\nYou're going to be highly\neffective either way.\n\n278\n00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.840\nI'm just pointing out to you\nthat with age comes wisdom and\n\n279\n00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.040\nyou have to understand that\nthat wisdom is hard won.\n\n280\n00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.760\nAnd the wisdom and knowledge we have\nif you've been doing this a long time\n\n281\n00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.920\nmay just be the difference between being\nable to attack you successfully and\n\n282\n00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.610\nnot if you're not paying attention\nto old school technology, and\n\n283\n00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.710\njust focused on the new\nways of doing things.\n\n284\n00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:34.240\nJust keep that in mind, remember you\nheard it here first if somebody comes and\n\n285\n00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.300\ntakes your network away from you.\n\n286\n00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:39.000\nIt's probably going to be an old guy or\nan old woman with grey hair.\n\n287\n00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:39.970\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n288\n00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.560\nPort scanning is going to be something\nobviously very important to consider.\n\n289\n00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.860\nWhat kind of scans can we do?\n\n290\n00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.460\nNot just port scans looking for open ports\nbut what other kinds of scans can we use?\n\n291\n00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.860\nRight, we talk about cool scans like\nfin,and nul, and xmas, cool names.\n\n292\n00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.450\nRight?\n\n293\n00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.550\nEven cooler to talk about,\neven funner and more cool to examine.\n\n294\n00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:58.620\nLet's talk quickly about\nwhat a fin scan is.\n\n295\n00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.490\nWe have these things called TCP flags,\nwe didn't show you these\n\n296\n00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.160\neither in the packet capture that we have,\nbut they were there.\n\n297\n00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.680\nWe just didn't bother with examining them\nand actually interact with them directly.\n\n298\n00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.200\nBut they were there.\n\n299\n00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.430\nThe TCP flags are actually something\nwe've kind of hinted at and\n\n300\n00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:13.470\ntalked about already.\n\n301\n00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.620\nWe showed you two of them when we\nshowed you the tcp three way handshake.\n\n302\n00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:17.840\nThe sin and the ack.\n\n303\n00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.560\nThose are two flags that are set up and\n\n304\n00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.060\nare gonna be selected in\nthe header of a data packet\n\n305\n00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.860\nwhen we are setting up initially and\nsynchronizing a tcp connection.\n\n306\n00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.820\nWe're effectively checking them off and\nusing them.\n\n307\n00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.690\nThere's also, aside from sin and\nack, there's an urg for\n\n308\n00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:37.130\nurgent, there is an rst for reset, and\nthere's a fin for finish or finalize.\n\n309\n00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.860\nThere's a psh for push, and\nI think I got all of them.\n\n310\n00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.070\nThere's actually like one more\nthat's undefined I think.\n\n311\n00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.800\nSo we've got at least six flags\nthat I just went through with you.\n\n312\n00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.050\nAll those flags perform\nsome sort of a function.\n\n313\n00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.860\nThey are specifically turning\non when we need them and\n\n314\n00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.270\nthey are being turned off\nwhen we are not using them.\n\n315\n00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.460\nSo we're going to go ahead and\nshow them to you in just a second.\n\n316\n00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:01.050\nBut before we do that,\nwhat I want to make sure we are clear on,\n\n317\n00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:05.920\nis that a fin scan allows us to specify\nthat we're going to enable FIN or\n\n318\n00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.880\nthe finish or finalized packet, or\nrather the flag int he packet, so\n\n319\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.390\nwe're going to effectively send\na FIN request into a system.\n\n320\n00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:16.130\nWe're going to scan and\nsee what that system's behavior is.\n\n321\n00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:18.560\nIf the system then tries\nto kill a connection and\n\n322\n00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.290\nreset it, we know it's running a certain\nway, configured to do certain things.\n\n323\n00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.550\nIf it doesn't do that,\nwe know it's not a certain type of system.\n\n324\n00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.680\nWhen we do null scanning we're\nsending a package request in or\n\n325\n00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.040\na scan in with no flags specified.\n\n326\n00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.720\nSee what happens there.\n\n327\n00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.960\nWhen we use Xmas scanning,\nwe're light up like a Christmas tree.\n\n328\n00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.700\nWe're turning on all the flags trying\nto find out what the system does.\n\n329\n00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.650\nSo what we're doing is effectively\nhost header flag manipulation.\n\n330\n00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:44.882\nSay that three times quickly.\n\n331\n00:15:44.882 --> 00:15:45.530\n>> [LAUGH] No.\n\n332\n00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:47.615\n>> Host header flag manipulation, right?\n\n333\n00:15:47.615 --> 00:15:51.730\nWe're effectively changing the settings\non the flag, since we're scanning and\n\n334\n00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:55.560\nprobing with packets, to see what does and\ndoesn't happen when we do this.\n\n335\n00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.408\nThis is how we do this kind of scanning.\n\n336\n00:15:57.408 --> 00:16:00.258\nIt's actually pretty cool stuff,\nI think we're set up,\n\n337\n00:16:00.258 --> 00:16:03.482\nlet's go take a look real quick at\nthe data capture we did before.\n\n338\n00:16:03.482 --> 00:16:06.732\n>> I know it's a little small\non you there Adam, so I've got,\n\n339\n00:16:06.732 --> 00:16:09.016\nI've selected one of the synac packets.\n\n340\n00:16:09.016 --> 00:16:09.629\n>> Okay.\n>> So\n\n341\n00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:14.422\nwe can see the different flags here and\nyou can see the acknowledgement flag,\n\n342\n00:16:14.422 --> 00:16:17.740\nthe ack, is set to a one and\nthe sin is set to a one.\n\n343\n00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.082\n>> So one means on, right?\n\n344\n00:16:19.082 --> 00:16:19.940\n>> One means on, yep.\n\n345\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.990\n>> Zero means off if we're seeing some\nzeroes here I'm probably thinking as well.\n\n346\n00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:24.650\n>> Yep.\n>> Although I can't see them from here but\n\n347\n00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:25.290\nI'm sure they're there.\n\n348\n00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:26.990\n>> The rest of the ones\nthat Adam mentioned there.\n\n349\n00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.980\nThe push, the rest, the Fin.\n\n350\n00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.220\nThose are all set to zero\nin this particular packet.\n\n351\n00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:35.990\n>> So the idea with a FIN scan would be,\nwe set that FIN flag to a status of\n\n352\n00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.550\none to turn it on, and then see what\nactually happens when we send it in.\n\n353\n00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.830\nBecause remember, the only time\nthe FIN packet, or FIN flag rather,\n\n354\n00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.580\nwould be set is when we're trying\nto finalize a connection ended, and\n\n355\n00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.810\nthen ultimately finish it off.\n\n356\n00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.370\nSo if we enable that functionality,\n\n357\n00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:54.780\nbut there's no connection to establish\nin there, let me try that again.\n\n358\n00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.692\nThere's no connection that has\nbeen established, and therefore\n\n359\n00:16:57.692 --> 00:17:01.441\nas a result nothing to finalize and reset,\nthe system's gonna behave a certain way.\n\n360\n00:17:01.441 --> 00:17:03.384\nIt's either gonna say,\nhey what's going on here,\n\n361\n00:17:03.384 --> 00:17:05.724\nI don't have anything to finish\nwith you in the first place, or\n\n362\n00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:08.375\nit's gonna to attempt to break\nthe connection and reset it.\n\n363\n00:17:08.375 --> 00:17:09.630\nDepending on how it works,\n\n364\n00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.510\nwe can tell a lot about the operating\nsystem behind the scenes.\n\n365\n00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:14.751\nRight so this is how this kind\nof scanning takes place, so.\n\n366\n00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:16.782\nKinda interesting when you take a look and\n\n367\n00:17:16.782 --> 00:17:19.857\ndelve into all this stuff that's\ngoing on behind the scenes and\n\n368\n00:17:19.857 --> 00:17:23.010\nunder the hood of the data that\nflows through all of our systems.\n\n369\n00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.690\nHundreds of billions of times a day these\npackets are moving around the world.\n\n370\n00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.060\nAll this is going on whether\nwe realize it or not.\n\n371\n00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.290\nYou pick up your cell phone and\nhave a conversation.\n\n372\n00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:34.407\nYou browse the Internet and\nlook for the latest, I don't know,\n\n373\n00:17:34.407 --> 00:17:36.440\na thing you want to buy on Amazon, right?\n\n374\n00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:40.030\nDownload a video, whatever it is,\nall this is happening.\n\n375\n00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.980\nIt's happening all the time, it's been\nhappening ever since we first connected\n\n376\n00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.860\ntwo machines together and said TCP and\n\n377\n00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:48.000\nIP are the protocols we wanna use to\ncommunicate, back in the early 1970s.\n\n378\n00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.520\nSo, it's been happening for\na significant amount of time, now.\n\n379\n00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:53.130\nSo, this is what goes on under the hood.\n\n380\n00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.230\nThese are the things that a CISSP.\n\n381\n00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.485\nAgain so we have to be knowledgeable\nabout it at a certain level.\n\n382\n00:17:57.485 --> 00:18:00.670\nDo you have to be able to drill in,\ngo to the level we just took you down to,\n\n383\n00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.580\nto be able to understand those flags?\n\n384\n00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.460\nIt'd be a good idea for\nyou to know all the flags.\n\n385\n00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.370\nBe a good idea for you to know\nthat a 1 means on, a 0 means off.\n\n386\n00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.900\nBut even if you don't know that,\n\n387\n00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:13.840\nknowing what the flags represent,\nthat RST is a reset, that FIN is finalize,\n\n388\n00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.550\nthat ACK and SYN are synchronize or\nsetup and acknowledge.\n\n389\n00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.230\nRight?\nKnowing that, that would be helpful,\n\n390\n00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.980\nthat would be good.\n\n391\n00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.860\nThat is definitely my wide inch\ndeep knowledge right there.\n\n392\n00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.370\nWe want to make sure you\nhave the right level, and\n\n393\n00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.010\nthe right expectation of knowledge\nas we're talking about this.\n\n394\n00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.190\nWe're talking about all\nthe different ways we can scan.\n\n395\n00:18:30.190 --> 00:18:32.720\nWhat about going out and\njust out right attacking somebody.\n\n396\n00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.200\nLet's say we just want to go out and\nwe're just looking for trouble.\n\n397\n00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.890\nRight?\n\n398\n00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.985\nIt's Thursday night,\nwe got nothing better to do.\n\n399\n00:18:37.985 --> 00:18:39.660\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's not like Star Wars is launching\n\n400\n00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.480\ntonight or anything, and\nwe wanna go ahead and\n\n401\n00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.440\nwe wanna attack something,\ncuz that's just how we are.\n\n402\n00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.880\nSo are there phases that we go\nthrough to attack a system?\n\n403\n00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.460\nAbsolutely, we should definitely\nknow what the phases are.\n\n404\n00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.490\nSo let's make sure you're\npaying attention to this.\n\n405\n00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.270\nGet out your pen and pencil,\nget out a piece of paper, again,\n\n406\n00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.600\nold school analog technology, right?\n\n407\n00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.170\nOr you make it out to your smart device\nbecause you'll have an app to make\n\n408\n00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:00.875\nnotes, I'm sure.\n\n409\n00:19:00.875 --> 00:19:02.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And you can make notes on your device.\n\n410\n00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.230\nBut let's, however you do it,\nlet's make sure we note, let's make sure\n\n411\n00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.780\nwe pay attention to it, let's make\nsure we're aware of the four phases\n\n412\n00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.670\nthat attacks are going to effectively\ngo through in order to be successful.\n\n413\n00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.010\nPhase one, acquisition,\nwe often call that discovery.\n\n414\n00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.810\nSo a lot of times you'll hear it said,\nor hear it displayed, or\n\n415\n00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:22.580\ntalked about as either acquisition or\ndiscovery.\n\n416\n00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.630\nSo it's phase one of the attack.\n\n417\n00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.970\nPhase two is analysis or enumeration,\nso often again referred to either way.\n\n418\n00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.250\nPhase three, access or\nvulnerability mapping.\n\n419\n00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:39.290\nPhase four appropriation or\nwhat's often commonly called exploitation.\n\n420\n00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:44.340\nSo we have acquisition, analysis,\naccess, and then appropriation.\n\n421\n00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.110\nThese are the four stages of an attack.\n\n422\n00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:50.700\nThey may also be referred\nto sometimes as discovery,\n\n423\n00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.550\nenumeration, vulnerability mapping and\nexploitation.\n\n424\n00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.020\nAgain the same exact thing,\ndoesn't matter which set of terms you use.\n\n425\n00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.150\nBut you should whenever we talk\nabout a process, whenever we talk\n\n426\n00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:05.190\nabout a numerical flow, something that's\nsequenced in a very specific order and\n\n427\n00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.660\nwe go to the trouble of telling\nyou what that order is and\n\n428\n00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.730\ngo out of our way to make sure you know\nthere is importance to the prioritization\n\n429\n00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:16.620\nof that order, that is code language for\nhey, pay attention, study this.\n\n430\n00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.380\nYou should know that.\n\n431\n00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:18.995\nIt's gonna be important for you.\n\n432\n00:20:18.995 --> 00:20:21.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Have I been honest and forthright and\n\n433\n00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.940\njust in your face enough about that?\n\n434\n00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:23.710\nI don't know.\nWe'll see.\n\n435\n00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:26.440\nWhen you pass your exam,\nthe answer will be yes.\n\n436\n00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.770\nIf you didn't, the answer is wow,\n\n437\n00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.635\nshould have paid attention to\nthe obnoxious guy in the flannel shirt.\n\n438\n00:20:30.635 --> 00:20:32.020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He was telling you to pay attention to\n\n439\n00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.050\nthat, cuz he knew was he\nwhat talking about, right?\n\n440\n00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:35.950\nAll right.\nSo\n\n441\n00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.575\nwe've talked about how attacks take place.\n\n442\n00:20:38.575 --> 00:20:41.240\nTalked about why it's important to\nunderstand how flags are set and\n\n443\n00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.210\nwhat flags are important and\nall the other stuff.\n\n444\n00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.148\nWhat about IDSs, what about IPSs?\n\n445\n00:20:45.148 --> 00:20:48.833\nRounding out our conversation here about\ndifferent ways we secure, monitor,\n\n446\n00:20:48.833 --> 00:20:52.188\nmeasure and ultimately obviously\nmitigate concerns around traffic and\n\n447\n00:20:52.188 --> 00:20:54.120\ntraffic management and security.\n\n448\n00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.350\nAnd IDS, intrusion detection system.\n\n449\n00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:59.630\nA passive system that monitors and\nrecords and\n\n450\n00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.870\nalerts but cannot take any sort\nof action to stop attacks,\n\n451\n00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:07.210\nexcept to say hey Mike pay attention\nthere's something going on here!\n\n452\n00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:08.320\nAnd notify you.\n\n453\n00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.550\nBut that's passive.\n\n454\n00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.030\nIt doesn't take any action.\n\n455\n00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.540\nIPSes, intrusion prevention systems.\n\n456\n00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:14.920\nNext gen technology.\n\n457\n00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.470\nNext gen as in second gen from an IDS.\n\n458\n00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.220\nIDS is seen as older, right?\n\n459\n00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.930\nTechnology IPSs are newer.\n\n460\n00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:24.690\nActually, third gen is now IDS,\nIPS together, kinda combined.\n\n461\n00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.610\nBut an IPS is an active system.\n\n462\n00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:30.260\nIt does all the things an IDS does,\nbut it can also take action and\n\n463\n00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:35.650\neffectively change a route, block a port,\nturn off an inbound request for\n\n464\n00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.460\nservice, cut off a user, can set,\nreset a system, do all sorts of stuff.\n\n465\n00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.911\nSo it's an active response vehicle\nthat also monitors and alerts,\n\n466\n00:21:43.911 --> 00:21:45.670\nthat's what an IPS is.\n\n467\n00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:49.178\nWhat we wanna understand is that these can\nbe either network based or host based.\n\n468\n00:21:49.178 --> 00:21:53.990\nNetwork based IDSs or IPSs are gonna\nbe at key choke points in the network.\n\n469\n00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.380\nWe deploy them and\nwe monitor all traffic passing that point.\n\n470\n00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.200\nTypically a device of some kind\nthat's plugged into the network,\n\n471\n00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.500\nif you wanna think about it that way.\n\n472\n00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.450\nA network based IDS for\n\n473\n00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:09.295\nIPS in other words provides a key\nchoke point monitoring capability.\n\n474\n00:22:09.295 --> 00:22:10.280\nThink of it like a border.\n\n475\n00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.460\nYou have to pass through the device\nto get to the other side.\n\n476\n00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.450\nWe look at what's going\non as you go through and\n\n477\n00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:16.720\nthen we can tell what's\nhappening as a result.\n\n478\n00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.140\nThis can protect a very large area, a very\nlarge amount of infrastructure behind it\n\n479\n00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.200\nbecause it's monitoring all inbound and\noutbound traffic going in and\n\n480\n00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.460\nout of that area.\n\n481\n00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.015\nThat particular security\nperimeter in other words.\n\n482\n00:22:28.015 --> 00:22:29.970\nWhereas a host based IDS or\n\n483\n00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:34.950\nIPS is gonna be agent based software\nthat is installed on a single machine.\n\n484\n00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:36.437\nThese are servers we wanna\nmonitor typically, right?\n\n485\n00:22:36.437 --> 00:22:37.380\nWe're not talking about desktops.\n\n486\n00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:42.340\nWe don't care about your desktop, we care\nabout the web server you're connecting to.\n\n487\n00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:47.680\nSo we're gonna put the host based IDS or\nIPS software on that web server,\n\n488\n00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:51.260\nrun it there locally, whenever you and\neverybody else in the world that wants to\n\n489\n00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:54.090\nget web traffic in and\nout of that box, connect there,\n\n490\n00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:57.300\nthe agents going to record all of that\ntraffic coming into that one box.\n\n491\n00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.980\nIt's gonna then report out on that and\n\n492\n00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.130\nallow us to analyze that\ncentrally typically.\n\n493\n00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.000\nIt's usually centrally managed,\nthe information gathering and\n\n494\n00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.050\nanalysis of this particular information or\nstructure.\n\n495\n00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:10.730\nSo we'll stream it back to a central\ncommand server, and then we'll analyze it\n\n496\n00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:15.120\nand use big data analytics, business\nintelligence scorecards, dashboards.\n\n497\n00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.200\nAll that kinda stuff to\nlook at the information.\n\n498\n00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.650\nThis is what an IDS and/or an IPS is.\n\n499\n00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.860\nSo wanna know the definition of the two.\n\n500\n00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.790\nWanna know how they are defined and\ndeployed, network based or host based.\n\n501\n00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:27.930\nKnow the difference between\nthem in other words.\n\n502\n00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.240\nVery important to be aware of that.\n\n503\n00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:34.370\nWe also have some other kinds of\nattacks that may crop up on occasion.\n\n504\n00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.670\nWe have fragmentation attacks.\n\n505\n00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.610\nTalked a little bit\nabout this conceptually.\n\n506\n00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:41.462\nFragmentation attacks are where we\nchunk data into different fragments and\n\n507\n00:23:41.462 --> 00:23:43.809\nwe send scattered\nfragments into the system,\n\n508\n00:23:43.809 --> 00:23:47.313\nhoping that they all get through\nthe firewall or the gateway device.\n\n509\n00:23:47.313 --> 00:23:51.069\nAnd then on the other side are restitched\nor put back together again through\n\n510\n00:23:51.069 --> 00:23:53.943\nsequencing and\nthen the attack can actually take place.\n\n511\n00:23:53.943 --> 00:23:57.599\nSo, it's effectively breaking\nup the attack into small,\n\n512\n00:23:57.599 --> 00:24:01.750\nlittle micro bundles and\nnot propagating the attack directly.\n\n513\n00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:05.090\nBut stealthily trying to sneak\nthe attack system in, and\n\n514\n00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:07.070\nthen reconstruct it on the other side.\n\n515\n00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:10.810\nThat's what a fragmentation attack,\nor fragmentation attacks, will be.\n\n516\n00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:14.240\nWe also have the ability to use what\nare called smurf and fraggle attacks.\n\n517\n00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.129\nI love talking about these things.\n\n518\n00:24:15.129 --> 00:24:16.330\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> They're so cool, right?\n\n519\n00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:18.490\nSo, if you guys are not fans of Smurf,\n\n520\n00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:22.240\nand Papa Smurf in particular,\nlittle blue guys running around, right?\n\n521\n00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.765\nSmurf attacks are gonna focus\non the use of TCP protocol.\n\n522\n00:24:25.765 --> 00:24:30.175\nSpecifically, they're gonna use malform\nping request to be able to propagate out\n\n523\n00:24:30.175 --> 00:24:35.065\nof pink to everybody in let say a subnet\nor imagine this for just a minute.\n\n524\n00:24:35.065 --> 00:24:35.655\nRight?\n\n525\n00:24:35.655 --> 00:24:39.865\nSo, if I am going to send out\na ping request traditionally, and\n\n526\n00:24:39.865 --> 00:24:43.005\nI'm gonna ping off my system, and\nI'm gonna target another system.\n\n527\n00:24:43.005 --> 00:24:44.565\nSo I wanna ping let's say Mike.\n\n528\n00:24:44.565 --> 00:24:45.165\nRight?\nSo,\n\n529\n00:24:45.165 --> 00:24:48.340\nI'm gonna ping, Mike by going to\nthe command ling an typing in Ping and\n\n530\n00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.310\nthen whatever Mike's address is right?\n\n531\n00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:51.400\nSo I'm gonna ping Mike.\n\n532\n00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:54.570\nMike's gonna respond and three if\nhe's active and available four times.\n\n533\n00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.920\nYes Adam, yes Adam, yes Adam, yes Adam.\n\n534\n00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:58.650\nThat's how I get back the response.\n\n535\n00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.180\nIf we're on the same subnet\nthat happens very quickly.\n\n536\n00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.570\nBut only Mike and\nI are communicating when I ping.\n\n537\n00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:07.405\nIt's a unicast communication you remember\nunicast communication that directing\n\n538\n00:25:07.405 --> 00:25:09.580\none-way communications\nbetween two parties,\n\n539\n00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.970\neffectively two end points\nthat are identified, right?\n\n540\n00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.560\nSo, that's what the traditional\nping looks like.\n\n541\n00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.500\nWhat a smurf attack does is\nsomething a little bit different.\n\n542\n00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.090\nIt sends out a ping request,\nbut it propagates it.\n\n543\n00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:25.170\nIt broadcasts it out to hundreds,\nmaybe thousands of end points.\n\n544\n00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.390\nBut it changes the source.\n\n545\n00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.200\nIt's not coming from my machine, right?\n\n546\n00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:31.620\nIt's coming from the machine,\n\n547\n00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.520\nat least it looks like it's coming from\nthe machine, that I want to attack.\n\n548\n00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.410\nSo, if I'm the evil scientist, right?\n\n549\n00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:38.540\nLurking in my lair.\n\n550\n00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:40.010\nI can't do my evil laugh,\n\n551\n00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:44.150\nit's too late in the day, I'll just do\nthe evil hand-twirling, like this, right?\n\n552\n00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:44.955\nAnd kinda look evil.\n\n553\n00:25:44.955 --> 00:25:46.850\n[INAUDIBLE]\n>> Do this.\n\n554\n00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.700\n>> that was good.\n>> I can't actually do the evil laugh it\n\n555\n00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.210\nwill kill my throat right?\n\n556\n00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:53.870\nBut you know if I'm that evil person\nlurking out there in the dark and\n\n557\n00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:57.830\nI want to attack you and\ntake you offline I'm gonna send out\n\n558\n00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:02.530\nthousands of ping requests to\ninformation systems all around you.\n\n559\n00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:05.510\nAll over your subnet But\nhere is the thing.\n\n560\n00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:07.800\nI'm gonna make every ping packet\nlook like it didn't come from me,\n\n561\n00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.400\nI'll make it look like it came from you.\n\n562\n00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.370\nAnd what's gonna happen?\n\n563\n00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:16.050\nEverybody's gonna respond to you and\nsay hey, we're here four times.\n\n564\n00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:19.700\nSmurf attacks, in other words, are\nbasically ping attacks that are propagated\n\n565\n00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.130\nspecifically to carry out distributed\ndenial of service, right?\n\n566\n00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:26.170\nBecause they're gonna take thousands\nof machines, theoretically, and\n\n567\n00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:27.800\nhave them all attack you.\n\n568\n00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.740\nAnd take you offline.\n\n569\n00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:31.360\nIt's actually denial of service\nattacks that's against one machine.\n\n570\n00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:36.150\nBut the goal, ultimately, is to manipulate\nthe ping response by changing or spoofing\n\n571\n00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:40.340\nthe source header in the IP packet,\nand this is what a smurf attack does.\n\n572\n00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:42.320\nI don't know why we call it\na smurf attack ultimately,\n\n573\n00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.050\ncuz it has nothing to do with being small\nand blue, but It's what we call it.\n\n574\n00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:47.220\nIt's called a smurf attack.\n\n575\n00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.800\nSo, smurf attacks are malformed ping\nattacks that manipulate the source\n\n576\n00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.760\nheader using TCP.\n\n577\n00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.780\nThat's what smurf attacks are.\n\n578\n00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.520\nWhat about fraggle attacks.\n\n579\n00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.355\nRemember Fraggle Rock?\n\n580\n00:26:56.355 --> 00:26:56.970\n>> Mm-hm.\nYeah.\n\n581\n00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:58.730\nGrew up with that.\n>> Fraggle Rock was a cool show.\n\n582\n00:26:58.730 --> 00:27:00.240\nFraggle Rock was a cool show.\n\n583\n00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.260\nSo, fraggle attacks are basically\nthe same thing as smurf attacks, but\n\n584\n00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:06.880\npropagated on UDP instead of TCP.\n\n585\n00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.140\nNow, because it's UDP, we're not pinging.\n\n586\n00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:12.520\nWe do something a little bit different\nto actually carry out the attack, but\n\n587\n00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:14.200\nultimately the end result is the same.\n\n588\n00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.250\nWe get everybody to respond to you and\n\n589\n00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:18.790\nthrough denial of service,\neffectively take you offline.\n\n590\n00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:23.030\nBut we use UDP instead of TCP\nto carry out the fraggle attack.\n\n591\n00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:26.350\nAgain, pretty cool when you think about\nit and debunk it and break it down.\n\n592\n00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:31.330\nSo, denial of service attacks overall can\ncome in many forms across many protocols.\n\n593\n00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.110\nAnd this also something, excuse me,\nwe wanna make sure you're aware of.\n\n594\n00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:38.200\nThe distributed denial of service attack\nwhich is a slightly different animal,\n\n595\n00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:45.160\nis gonna be many systems attacking and\nbeing used to attack one or more systems.\n\n596\n00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:49.330\nSo, the idea is that, a denial of service\nattacks one system against one system.\n\n597\n00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:50.570\nI try to take mike offline.\n\n598\n00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.030\nThat's a denial of service attack.\n\n599\n00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:55.140\nDistributed denial of services,\nall these systems attacking one or\n\n600\n00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:58.150\nmore systems,\nto take them offline at the same time.\n\n601\n00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.280\nWe often talk about botnets or\nzombie armies being used\n\n602\n00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.690\nto execute the distributed denial of\nservice attacks and taking systems down.\n\n603\n00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:05.490\nAs a result of that.\n\n604\n00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.020\nSo, we just want to know\nit's a scalability question\n\n605\n00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.500\nwith distributed denial\nof service attacks.\n\n606\n00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.860\nJust be thinking about that.\n\n607\n00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:15.170\nWe may execute SIN flood attacks which\neffectively is gonna manipulate the TCP\n\n608\n00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:16.630\nthree way handshake.\n\n609\n00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.110\nAnd set up a whole bunch of SIN requests,\nright?\n\n610\n00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.510\nFrom a lot of different machines in\nbound and then never acknowledge them.\n\n611\n00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.920\nAnd eventually over time we tie up so\n\n612\n00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.890\nmany resources on the target that it\njust rolls over and stops working.\n\n613\n00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:31.010\nThis is called a sinflux,\nanother form of denial of service or\n\n614\n00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.950\ndistributed denial of service attacks,\ndepending on what we're thinking about.\n\n615\n00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:36.540\nSo, wanna be thinking about\nthese kinds of attacks.\n\n616\n00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.410\nHow they work and\nwhat we're doing with them.\n\n617\n00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:41.380\nThese are all different ways so\nwe can take on and manipulate\n\n618\n00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.300\nthe network protocols and the knowledge we\nhave of them to ultimately attack systems.\n\n619\n00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:49.130\nRemember, we've been talking about\ndifferent ways that ultimately\n\n620\n00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:51.660\nwe can see attacks happening\nin order to mitigate them.\n\n621\n00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.670\nAnd ultimately through mitigation right?\n\n622\n00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:58.460\nUltimately take some sort of steps in\norder to be able to clearly and hopefully\n\n623\n00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:04.000\nright with success prevent the attackers\nfrom doing to us what we know they can do.\n\n624\n00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000\nThe knowledge of that helps us\nto be better at defending and\n\n625\n00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.360\nthis is what we've been trying to\nput across to you in this episode.\n\n626\n00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.220\nAnd so are the other ones as well.\n\n627\n00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.670\n>> Very good, so if Adam loved it,\n\n628\n00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:16.100\nwe've got a lot of information there\nabout some of the new types or\n\n629\n00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.690\nsome of the attacks we haven't talked\nabout yet in ways we can mitigate those.\n\n630\n00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.669\nDifferent devices we\ncan put on our network,\n\n631\n00:29:21.669 --> 00:29:24.700\nwhere we can put them on our\nnetwork to help us keep us safe or\n\n632\n00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.780\nat least reduce the likelihood of success\nof some of those types of attacks.\n\n633\n00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:29.950\nWe thank you for that.\n\n634\n00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.890\nRemember, if you guys wanna attend one of\nAdam's classes live send us an email here\n\n635\n00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:35.600\nat SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n636\n00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:40.330\nThat's going to do it for this episode,\nsigning off for now I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n637\n00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:41.210\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n638\n00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:42.470\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n639\n00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:43.729\n>> Take care,

--> 00:00:20.422\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\ntoday we're doing our CISSP content.\n\n4\n00:00:20.422 --> 00:00:23.905\nAnd specifically we're gonna be\ndiving into managing identity and\n\n5\n00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:25.505\ncontrolling access, right?\n\n6\n00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:29.040\nIt's been an underlying theme\nthroughout our entire course here.\n\n7\n00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.008\nControlling the access of those subjects\nto the objects can be a little bit\n\n8\n00:00:33.008 --> 00:00:33.713\nconfusing.\n\n9\n00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:37.920\nThere's a lot to it, it's obviously\na very important part of being a CISSP.\n\n10\n00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.490\nSo here to help us with all of that,\nis the one and only Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.460\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.990\n>> Good, good.\n\n13\n00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.000\nI don't know if you guys can see,\nbut purple with purple, blue, and\n\n14\n00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.550\nwhite polka-dots.\n\n15\n00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.260\n>> Nice, you're going all out.\n\n16\n00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.911\n>> You can see the bottom there,\nit's probably a good shot.\n\n17\n00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:52.255\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, there you go.\n\n18\n00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:52.756\nSo-\n>> All out-\n\n19\n00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:53.876\n>> All out today on a Friday.\n\n20\n00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:54.393\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n21\n00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:55.892\n>> It's Friday, it's sock day.\n\n22\n00:00:55.892 --> 00:00:58.036\nCool sock day here at IT Pro TV,\n\n23\n00:00:58.036 --> 00:00:58.952\nall right.\nSo\n\n24\n00:00:58.952 --> 00:01:00.513\nwe're gonna talk a bit about identity and\n\n25\n00:01:00.513 --> 00:01:01.413\naccess management.\nAnd\n\n26\n00:01:01.413 --> 00:01:03.823\nwhat we wanna do to start off\nthe conversation is two things,\n\n27\n00:01:03.823 --> 00:01:06.770\nreally important.\nFirst, make sure we know that IAM,\n\n28\n00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.710\nthe acronym IAM is what we call and\nwhat we refer to when we talk about it,\n\n29\n00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.010\nis identity and access management.\n\n30\n00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.750\nIt's often referred to that\nway in our industry and\n\n31\n00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.200\nyou'll hear people talk\nabout IAM activities and\n\n32\n00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.280\nwhat they're really focusing on is\nidentity and access management.\n\n33\n00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.286\nSo just making sure you're comfortable\nwith the idea of what that acronym is,\n\n34\n00:01:24.286 --> 00:01:27.440\nI've told you before, and\nwe'll continue to remind you as we\n\n35\n00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.748\nhave conversations through the remaining\nepisodes in the CISSP body of knowledge as\n\n36\n00:01:31.748 --> 00:01:35.104\nwe go through everything,\nthat on the exam we will use acronyms.\n\n37\n00:01:35.104 --> 00:01:38.770\nI want you to be comfortable with that,\nour industry is replete with acronyms.\n\n38\n00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.550\nWe have an entire subculture and\nlanguage related to nothing but acronyms.\n\n39\n00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.110\nYou can talk in short\nthree letter bursts for\n\n40\n00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.250\ndays and\nnever repeat yourself in our industry.\n\n41\n00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.770\nSo it's kind of interesting but\n\n42\n00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.970\nthe reality is,\nwe always spell them out, right?\n\n43\n00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.879\nSo we don't want you to spend a lot\nof time focusing on remembering and\n\n44\n00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:56.986\nmemorizing what the definition\nof an acronym is,\n\n45\n00:01:56.986 --> 00:01:58.960\nbecause that's really counter productive.\n\n46\n00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.677\nIt doesn't help you, what we want you to\ndo is focus on what the knowledge that is\n\n47\n00:02:02.677 --> 00:02:05.960\nimportant about the acronym,\nin order to really master the topic is.\n\n48\n00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.320\nAnd that's gonna then help\nyou to understand everything.\n\n49\n00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.830\nSo IAM, Identity and Access Management,\nwhen we talk about Identity and\n\n50\n00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.620\nAccess Management we really have to think\nabout subject and object interaction.\n\n51\n00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.140\nAnd Mike did a good job\nkinda setting the stage for\n\n52\n00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.400\nus in the beginning of the conversation\nhere, just introduction the idea.\n\n53\n00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.900\nAnd he said we're gonna talk\nabout these interactions,\n\n54\n00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.340\nwe've focused on them before,\nwe're gonna continue to focus on them now.\n\n55\n00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.860\nReminding you that the subject\nis the user in our conversation.\n\n56\n00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.230\nThe object is the data that\nthe user wants to gain access to.\n\n57\n00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.755\nRemember that a subject is not just a\nuser, it could be what's known as an NPE,\n\n58\n00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:41.490\nand another acronym for you.\n\n59\n00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.960\nA non-person entity and what we really\nmean by that in Geek speak is very simple.\n\n60\n00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.180\nIt's a service or a system that may\nrepresent the user effectively as I,\n\n61\n00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.500\noften refer to it proxying on behalf\nof the user to make the request and\n\n62\n00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.830\ngo out and get the data.\n\n63\n00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.870\nSo the subject is really the user or\nthe thing on behalf of\n\n64\n00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.430\nthe user that goes out to make\nthe request, sometimes it's a service,\n\n65\n00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.100\nso we use service accounts all\nthe time to do a variety of things.\n\n66\n00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.690\nSo we just wanna make sure\nwe know subjects are users,\n\n67\n00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.962\nobjects are the data users\nare looking to access.\n\n68\n00:03:10.962 --> 00:03:13.800\nThat's gonna be the starting point for\nour conversations.\n\n69\n00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.390\nWhen we think about this whole\nprocess of identity access management,\n\n70\n00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.930\nwe really have to think\nabout a life cycle.\n\n71\n00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.950\nWe cal it the identity life cycle,\nlike any good life cycle, it has stages.\n\n72\n00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.830\nAnd this one is gonna have\nthe following stages.\n\n73\n00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.810\nI just wanna lay them out there for you,\nmake sure you are comfortable with them.\n\n74\n00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.980\nYou really already have a good\nsense of them, you know them, but\n\n75\n00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.950\nwe don't often stop and\nthink about breaking down the process of\n\n76\n00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.600\nlogging on to a system if the individual\ncomponents are life cycle parts.\n\n77\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.720\nWe just sit down and do it, it's so\nobvious, it's so, from our perspective,\n\n78\n00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.030\nstandard, in the sense that this is\nsomething we do probably 10, 15,\n\n79\n00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.440\n20 times a day at work.\n\n80\n00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.560\nWe don't really stop and\nthink about what does it take, right?\n\n81\n00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.360\nIt's like getting out of your chair,\nwalking across the room and\n\n82\n00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.680\nleaving the room through a door.\n\n83\n00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.360\nYou just get up and do it,\nyou don't often think about it, right?\n\n84\n00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.200\nAt least not most of us anyway, right?\n\n85\n00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.266\nBut the reality is that we do have a very\nspecific set of steps we wanna make sure\n\n86\n00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:04.467\nyou're comfortable with what they are.\n\n87\n00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:09.173\nRemember, as we also talked about before\nwhenever we talk about a set of steps ie\n\n88\n00:04:09.173 --> 00:04:13.105\na life cycle or a process and\nwe go to the trouble of detailing them,\n\n89\n00:04:13.105 --> 00:04:16.967\nin order that we should have like\na little hit light that comes on or\n\n90\n00:04:16.967 --> 00:04:19.318\nlike the cartoon bubble hint, right?\n\n91\n00:04:19.318 --> 00:04:22.694\nWe should have something like that,\nso whenever that happens, right?\n\n92\n00:04:22.694 --> 00:04:26.221\nEven if we don't have the cool animation\nto say you should pay attention.\n\n93\n00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:29.300\nWhat we are talking about is\nsomething that you need to know.\n\n94\n00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.845\nAnd when I say you need to know,\nwhat I'm suggesting is it would be\n\n95\n00:04:32.845 --> 00:04:37.228\nreally beneficial for you to understand\nthe steps that we're about to talk about\n\n96\n00:04:37.228 --> 00:04:41.380\nwith regards to identity access\nmanagement, and the identity life cycle.\n\n97\n00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.900\nSo when we're thinking about\nfiguring out who somebody is,\n\n98\n00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.870\nwe often start with the thought\nprocess of identification.\n\n99\n00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.230\nSo somebody shows up, says I'm so\nand so, I wanna get in.\n\n100\n00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.060\nIdentification is the idea of them giving\nyou those credentials, whatever they are.\n\n101\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.770\nUsername and password, maybe it's\na PIN that they have with a card or\n\n102\n00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.260\na key of some kind, like a key fob\nwith a challenge-response solution.\n\n103\n00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.960\nIt may be something that they are,\nit could be a biometric scanner.\n\n104\n00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.449\nWe'll talk about these things and\nhow they work, but\n\n105\n00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.953\nthe idea is we call these\nfactors of authentication.\n\n106\n00:05:11.953 --> 00:05:16.633\nSo identification is about presenting one\nor more of the factors of authentication,\n\n107\n00:05:16.633 --> 00:05:20.728\nso that the system, whatever that\nsystem is, can ultimately take them and\n\n108\n00:05:20.728 --> 00:05:24.500\nprocess them and decide whether you are or\nare not a legitimate user.\n\n109\n00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.735\nAnd if you are what level of access\nyou will be granted and if you're not,\n\n110\n00:05:27.735 --> 00:05:30.240\nthen effectively we tell you,\nsorry you can't get in.\n\n111\n00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.270\nAnd you have to come back later, and\n\n112\n00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.990\ncome back with somebody who is authorized,\nright?\n\n113\n00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.320\nWho does have the proper\ncredentials to be here.\n\n114\n00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.650\nSo identification comes first.\n\n115\n00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.760\nWe then go to authentication, right?\n\n116\n00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.850\nWe have to make sure that we understand\nwho the person is that's presenting\n\n117\n00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.010\nthe credentials, and so\nwe have to authenticate them.\n\n118\n00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.240\nWe take them it's usually and\nautomated process,\n\n119\n00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.000\na system that does this, and they're\ngonna be processed, examined, compared.\n\n120\n00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.900\nMaking sure that what you are and\nwho you are and\n\n121\n00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.470\nwhat you represent yourself as, is what we\nalready have on file, it's what we know,\n\n122\n00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.070\nit's the known quantity or\nquantities about you.\n\n123\n00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.390\nSo the factor or\nfactors of authentication are compared.\n\n124\n00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.555\nObviously, we're looking for\na match, we're not looking for\n\n125\n00:06:10.555 --> 00:06:13.425\na difference of any kind and\nassuming that that works out,\n\n126\n00:06:13.425 --> 00:06:16.252\nthen we move to the third step,\nwhich is authorization.\n\n127\n00:06:16.252 --> 00:06:21.170\nAuthorization, is the idea of being able\nto say, okay, we've been given identity.\n\n128\n00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:24.590\nWe've authenticated it, so\nwe now say yes, everything is good.\n\n129\n00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.150\nWe now have to figure out what writes\nour level of access we're gonna give you\n\n130\n00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:29.170\nas a user, right?\n\n131\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.570\nIn a system, that's effectively\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n132\n00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.070\nWe're gonna authenticate you, and\nthen we're going to authorize you, right?\n\n133\n00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.940\nWe're gonna say, okay,\nyou're gonna get this level of permission.\n\n134\n00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.800\nWe're gonna give you full control.\n\n135\n00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.250\nWe're gonna give you read only.\n\n136\n00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.850\nWe're gonna let you go over here.\n\n137\n00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.520\nDo this, but not do that.\n\n138\n00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.658\nWhatever that is, it varies.\n\n139\n00:06:45.658 --> 00:06:48.285\nWe're not really worried, per se,\nright now about what that is.\n\n140\n00:06:48.285 --> 00:06:50.760\nWe're just worried about\nthe idea of the process step.\n\n141\n00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.360\nSo authentication, then authorization and\nthen ultimately after authorization,\n\n142\n00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.740\nwhat we traditionally would wanna do,\nis keep track of what you're doing, right.\n\n143\n00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.820\nSo we probably have some auditing,\nlogging,\n\n144\n00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.370\nthings like that going on to keep track of\nyou, to make sure that you're really not\n\n145\n00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.750\ngetting into places that\nyou're not suppose to go.\n\n146\n00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.610\nNot using permissions and\nrights you're not suppose have and\n\n147\n00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.710\nso we wanna watch, we wanna monitor.\n\n148\n00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.870\nSo it's usually just\ncall that auditing and\n\n149\n00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.380\nso we're gonna have the idea\nof identification, right?\n\n150\n00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.590\nWe're then gonna have, [COUGH] pardon me.\n\n151\n00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:21.930\nWe're gonna have identification.\n\n152\n00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.442\nWe're gonna have authentication.\n\n153\n00:07:23.442 --> 00:07:26.620\nWe're gonna have authorization and\nthen we traditionally have auditing.\n\n154\n00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.690\nThat's gonna just be a kind of\ncontinuous monitoring function.\n\n155\n00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.760\nThink of it as the big brother concept,\nright?\n\n156\n00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.280\nWe're watching you we have to do this with\nMike a lot, cuz he tends to wonder off and\n\n157\n00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.950\nget into trouble if we don't pay\nattention to what he's doing.\n\n158\n00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.760\nSo this is the whole idea, right?\n\n159\n00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.539\nThe though process behind this so, access\ncontrol systems are designed to be able to\n\n160\n00:07:44.539 --> 00:07:48.982\neffectively take this entire process I\njust laid out for you and to package it,\n\n161\n00:07:48.982 --> 00:07:52.042\nin effect, and\nthen automate it as much as possible.\n\n162\n00:07:52.042 --> 00:07:56.125\nSo that when you sit down at a computer,\nyou provide your username and password,\n\n163\n00:07:56.125 --> 00:08:00.161\nyou identify, you provide a factor or\nmore than one factor Of authentication.\n\n164\n00:08:00.161 --> 00:08:02.113\nWe can then run it through a system,\nright?\n\n165\n00:08:02.113 --> 00:08:03.229\nWe could take a look at it.\n\n166\n00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:04.300\nWe can authorize it.\n\n167\n00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.970\nWe can authenticate you,\nand then we can track you.\n\n168\n00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.710\nSo access control systems are doing this,\nright?\n\n169\n00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.730\nAnd we may have physical\naccess control systems.\n\n170\n00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.590\nWe may have a guard sitting at a desk\nthat's gonna go effectively say hey\n\n171\n00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.360\nMike or Adam when you walk through\nthe lobby come on over here for a second.\n\n172\n00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.730\nI need you to sign the book and\ntell me who you're here to see.\n\n173\n00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.150\nI have to call ahead and\nmake sure they know you're here.\n\n174\n00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.520\nThat is an access control\nsystem of a type, but\n\n175\n00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.280\nit's a physical access control system.\n\n176\n00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.900\nWe've got a guard and the guard is\nasking us to provide some identity,\n\n177\n00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.530\nhe's checking that identification, and\nvalidating our reason for being there.\n\n178\n00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.760\nEffectively the same steps in the process.\n\n179\n00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.700\nWe may have one that's not\ngonna require a guard, but\n\n180\n00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.740\nsimply maybe something like a card scan or\nsome sort of card swipe system on a door\n\n181\n00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.540\nwhere you walk up, you have a smart card,\nor some sort of card you can swipe,\n\n182\n00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.240\nyou probably have to put\nin a pin along with that.\n\n183\n00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.150\nSo whether you swipe and just enter, or\nswipe and provide a pin is a matter of how\n\n184\n00:08:55.150 --> 00:09:00.690\nthe system is set up, but ultimately you\ncan walk up to an unmonitored interface\n\n185\n00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.830\nyou can swipe, and then assuming that\nthat swipe is actually authorized.\n\n186\n00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:06.950\nIn other words it's authenticated.\n\n187\n00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:07.610\nIt's authorized.\n\n188\n00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:11.990\nYes this card belongs to you and\nyou should be granted access to that door.\n\n189\n00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.060\nWe're going to let you in.\n\n190\n00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.040\nIf it's not we're gonna deny you access.\n\n191\n00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.220\nAgain all the steps are there.\n\n192\n00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.660\nYou've identified, we've authenticated,\nyou've been authorized.\n\n193\n00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.710\nSo it doesn't have to be a system that\nis gonna be something like a guard.\n\n194\n00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.010\nIt doesn't have to be in other words\nan interactive system where you have\n\n195\n00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:27.570\na human being.\n\n196\n00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.540\nIt could be an automated system\nwithout any interaction at all.\n\n197\n00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:33.180\nWhatever it is an access\ncontrol system overall\n\n198\n00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.510\nis the idea of being able to monitor and\ncontrol access to one or more points and\n\n199\n00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.570\nusing the steps we talked\nabout in order to do so.\n\n200\n00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.620\nRemember we can have facility access\ncontrol like we were just talking about.\n\n201\n00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.350\nWe may have logical access\ncontrol solutions which\n\n202\n00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.070\nreally control access to data.\n\n203\n00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:50.980\nThis is what we often interact\nwith when we go to a file server.\n\n204\n00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.030\nSo if you go to a file server, some sign\nof Enterprise, some sort of Enterprise\n\n205\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:10:00.090\ncontent management system, and\nyou try to open up a file from a share and\n\n206\n00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.580\nyou are given rights to a file and you see\nit it's because the logical access control\n\n207\n00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.670\nsystem that's linked to what we would\ntalk about as being single sign on SSO.\n\n208\n00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:14.520\nThe idea that in most organizations today\nwe do challenge you up front right?\n\n209\n00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.560\nWe do go through the steps of identifying\nyou, of making sure we can authenticate\n\n210\n00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.780\nyour factors of authentication, we will\nauthenticate the authentication, right?\n\n211\n00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.810\nSo we have factors of authentication.\n\n212\n00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.850\nSo then we will authorize you and\nwe'll keep track of you.\n\n213\n00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.410\nWe go through these steps, but\n\n214\n00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:33.710\nwe do it one time upfront traditionally\nin most modern systems today.\n\n215\n00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.400\nWe call this single sign on.\n\n216\n00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.950\nGenerically single sign on is\nlog on once access many, right?\n\n217\n00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.290\nOr access most.\n\n218\n00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.280\nWhat we mean by that is when you login\none time and you authenticate and\n\n219\n00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.800\nyou're authorized we're going\nto grant you all the rights and\n\n220\n00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.450\nprivileges you're entitled to\nacross the entire organization.\n\n221\n00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.280\nAnd so the token that represents\nyou typically the user token and\n\n222\n00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.140\nif you can hand me the remote\ncontrol there for just a second.\n\n223\n00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:01.170\nWe're gonna do a little live demo, right?\n\n224\n00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.220\nSo I love props, right?\n\n225\n00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.780\nEspecially ones that are labeled do\nnot use on pain of death on the back.\n\n226\n00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.500\nI don't know why it says that on the back.\n\n227\n00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.200\nIt says bad things will happen to\nMike if you take this off the table.\n\n228\n00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.590\n>> Don't push the red button.\n\n229\n00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:16.260\n>> Whatever you do don't push\nthe red button, the button of doom.\n\n230\n00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.170\nAll right, so what we have\nhere is just a representation.\n\n231\n00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.470\nThis is just a little remote control\nwe use for some of the stuff here, but\n\n232\n00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.170\nthe idea is very straight forward.\n\n233\n00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:27.190\nLet's assume for just a minute that\nthis is gonna represent our user token.\n\n234\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.970\nAll right, and the idea of a token\nis pretty straight forward, but it's\n\n235\n00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:34.380\nalso important to understand, because it's\nso simple that people often get it wrong.\n\n236\n00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.840\nSo, what we wanna make sure you\nunderstand is the following, right?\n\n237\n00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.345\nAnd Mike's gonna help me out with this,\nso I'm gonna give Mike\n\n238\n00:11:39.345 --> 00:11:43.130\nthe token here in just a second, but\nI wanna explain what the token is first.\n\n239\n00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.710\nSo if I am the authentication server.\n\n240\n00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.570\nIn Windows we would generically\ncall this the domain controller,\n\n241\n00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.530\nwhich I'm sure most of you\nare very familiar with, right?\n\n242\n00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:55.250\nSo if I am the domain controller and\nthe domain controller is going to\n\n243\n00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.820\nrepresent the ability to authenticate\nas well as authorize users, right?\n\n244\n00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.230\nThis is where all that\nactivity takes place.\n\n245\n00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:07.020\nSo if I am the domain controller, and\nI am going to get a request from a user.\n\n246\n00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.790\nMike is gonna be the user, right?\n\n247\n00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.630\nThat is gonna ultimately\nidentify himself and\n\n248\n00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.600\nthen I'm gonna have to authenticate and\nauthorize Mike.\n\n249\n00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.820\nSo Mike's gonna provide his credentials.\n\n250\n00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:18.650\nHe's gonna send them over to me.\n\n251\n00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:19.940\nSo we'll have a conversation.\n\n252\n00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.420\nAnd Mike says, what does Mike say?\n\n253\n00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.060\nMike says-\n>> My name is Mike R.\n\n254\n00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.226\nAnd my password is capital P little\na dollar, dollar w zero r d.\n\n255\n00:12:27.226 --> 00:12:29.220\nOh, did I just say that on TV?\n\n256\n00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.200\n>> Thank you very much, Mike.\n\n257\n00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:30.883\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n258\n00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:32.610\n>> We appreciate that enthusiastic and\n\n259\n00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:36.170\ntotally unsecure way of\nproviding your credentials.\n\n260\n00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.970\nHey, we're not going to use\nMike as a prop any longer.\n\n261\n00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.190\nYou'll find there's Mike 2.0 here\nthe next time we show the shot.\n\n262\n00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.940\nHe will be a lot more secure and\n\n263\n00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.170\nhave brevity programmed into\nhis conversation matrix.\n\n264\n00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.260\nAll right so, Mike gave me\nthe username and the password.\n\n265\n00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.270\nSo what we do with that now is I run\nthat through a whole bunch of steps.\n\n266\n00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.320\nWe're not so worried about what that looks\nlike cuz that's not really critical.\n\n267\n00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.280\nWhat the output of that\nconversation ultimately becomes\n\n268\n00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.650\nonce we authenticate Mike and\nwe say yep it's definitely Mike and\n\n269\n00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.145\nthere's no way I'm reproducing\nthat password so whatever it was.\n\n270\n00:13:05.145 --> 00:13:07.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And we authorize Mike and\n\n271\n00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.510\nthis is what we want to\ntalk about at the token.\n\n272\n00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:12.110\nThe authorization part because when I\nauthorize this the domain controller\n\n273\n00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:17.410\nWhen I authorize Mike what I'm doing\neffectively is I'm taking a token,\n\n274\n00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.720\nso imagine I have a pad of tokens, right.\n\n275\n00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.560\nI'm gonna pull that token off the top,\nand I'm gonna program it.\n\n276\n00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:28.290\nAnd what the user token represents is a\nlogical representation of Mike as a user,\n\n277\n00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:33.990\nand all of the authentication, all of the\npermissions, and rights, and privileges\n\n278\n00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:38.560\nthat Mike is granted in the system for the\nduration of what we call the user session.\n\n279\n00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.430\nThe log on session is what\nit's often referred to, and so\n\n280\n00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:45.490\nthe token is gonna be given\nto Mike's user account.\n\n281\n00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:47.020\nYou can think of it as\nbeing given to Mike.\n\n282\n00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.410\nSo I'm gonna hand the token to Mike, and\n\n283\n00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:54.090\nwhen Mike has the token now wherever\nMike goes, and whatever Mike wants to do\n\n284\n00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:58.190\nMike has to present that token and\nsay well this is who I am, right?\n\n285\n00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:03.740\nThis is effectively me because the token\nlogically represents the user, but it also\n\n286\n00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.610\nrepresents all the permissions and the\nprivileges and the rights the user has.\n\n287\n00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.720\nSo the token is made up\nof the user's unique ID.\n\n288\n00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.160\nWe call that a GUID in\nWindows the Global Unique ID.\n\n289\n00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.900\nIt's also made up of all the permissions\nand effectively the manifest of what\n\n290\n00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.090\nthey can do, and so the token is distilled\ndown to the representation of the user.\n\n291\n00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:26.400\nIn the SSO solution we were talking about\nin single sign on we do this whole process\n\n292\n00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:30.620\nthankfully, because it takes so long to\nget everything organized and make it work.\n\n293\n00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.440\nWe only do this one time.\n\n294\n00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.280\nWe do this when the user logs on.\n\n295\n00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.830\nWe do it every time the user logs on.\n\n296\n00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:36.800\nI shouldn't say only one time.\n\n297\n00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.070\nWe do it whenever the user logs on,\nbut once the user is logged on\n\n298\n00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:45.620\nwe don't have to engage in this process\nagain until the user logs off and\n\n299\n00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.200\nlogs back in or\nuntil the user's token expires.\n\n300\n00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.350\nBecause if the user stays on long enough,\n\n301\n00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.330\nwhich is traditionally about seven days,\nso if the user stays logged in that\n\n302\n00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:58.010\nlong even though the user may not be\nphysically in front of the keyboard.\n\n303\n00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.810\nBut if they stay logged in that long,\nthen effectively that token can expire.\n\n304\n00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:04.210\nThe token does have a shelf\nlife in other words, and\n\n305\n00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.210\nif that does happen we have\nto regenerate a new one.\n\n306\n00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:09.650\nBut assuming that that doesn't happen,\nbecause most of us aren't in the habit of\n\n307\n00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.160\nlogging on for a week and\nthen walking away from our systems, right?\n\n308\n00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.750\nAnd if we are as CISSPs,\nshame on you, right?\n\n309\n00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.220\nCuz we should not let that happen.\n\n310\n00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.760\nWe should have session timeouts.\n\n311\n00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:21.220\nWe should have policies that govern that.\n\n312\n00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.630\nWe should have smarter users.\n\n313\n00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.670\nYou should trade those users in and\nget better ones if those are yours.\n\n314\n00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:28.150\nIt is a holiday season.\n\n315\n00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.340\nYou can get a two for one on users,\nso keep that in mind.\n\n316\n00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.140\nSo the point is we should\nnever let that happen, but\n\n317\n00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.200\nthe reality is that we know it may.\n\n318\n00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.330\nSo we do have a life cycle and\na whole life time on the token, but\n\n319\n00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:42.884\nthe point with the token is that\nthe token is going to effectively act as\n\n320\n00:15:42.884 --> 00:15:44.289\na representation of Mike.\n\n321\n00:15:44.289 --> 00:15:48.731\nSo when Mike wants to access a file share\nMike doesn't need to ultimately say hey\n\n322\n00:15:48.731 --> 00:15:52.063\nthis is who I am and\nprovide a user name and a password again.\n\n323\n00:15:52.063 --> 00:15:56.053\nThat was the old way of doing things back\nin Windows 95, Windows 98 Where you had\n\n324\n00:15:56.053 --> 00:15:59.416\nto authenticate every time you\naccessed the share resource, right?\n\n325\n00:15:59.416 --> 00:16:03.212\nThose were the good old days, remember\nlike five, ten, 20 different passwords and\n\n326\n00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:04.010\nusernames.\n\n327\n00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.020\nEach one stored on a different system,\nnone of them the same,\n\n328\n00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.650\ncuz we weren't that smart.\n\n329\n00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:12.164\nAnd so as a result, every time you went\nto access anything other than the system\n\n330\n00:16:12.164 --> 00:16:16.120\nyou'd already authenticated against,\nyou were providing additional credentials.\n\n331\n00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.037\nYou had to do this over and\nover and over again.\n\n332\n00:16:18.037 --> 00:16:21.685\nSingle sign on, LDAP directory,\neverything's centrally managed,\n\n333\n00:16:21.685 --> 00:16:22.787\ntakes all that away.\n\n334\n00:16:22.787 --> 00:16:25.504\nAnd so we just want to make sure we\nunderstand the concepts about this and\n\n335\n00:16:25.504 --> 00:16:26.750\nhow this comes together.\n\n336\n00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:30.170\nBecause logical access control is\nexactly what we were just describing,\n\n337\n00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:31.178\nthis whole thing, right?\n\n338\n00:16:31.178 --> 00:16:34.210\nSo we could have different access modes,\nwe can have\n\n339\n00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:37.400\nour access modes effectively permissions\nwe want to think of on that way.\n\n340\n00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.340\nWe could have read only,\nwe talked about this and\n\n341\n00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.310\nthe general idea of being\nable to see something.\n\n342\n00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:42.150\nWe can read and\n\n343\n00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.810\nwrite, we can execute, with different\nlevels of permissions in a system.\n\n344\n00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:49.810\nPermission levels are really not so\nimportant, because they vary by system.\n\n345\n00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:54.990\nWhat is important is to understand\nthat the generic idea of authorization\n\n346\n00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:59.680\ninvolves granting of privileges and or\npermissions of some kind based on whatever\n\n347\n00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:04.000\nthe structure of the system is in order to\nbe able to effectively give users access.\n\n348\n00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.620\nWhen we think about this whole system,\nright,\n\n349\n00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:06.910\nwe have to administer this whole thing.\n\n350\n00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.090\nWe've been talking about\nhow tokens are generated,\n\n351\n00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:13.110\ntalked about the idea of Mike providing\none or more factors of authentication.\n\n352\n00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:16.780\nWe have to authenticate them, we have to\nfigure out what permissions Mike's given.\n\n353\n00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.840\nGotta generate this thing called\nthe token, this is a lot of work.\n\n354\n00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:21.260\nSo we have to have an administration,\n\n355\n00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.250\na central oversight function\nthat takes care of all this.\n\n356\n00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.050\nSomebody's gotta set up\nthe domain controller.\n\n357\n00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.920\nSomebody's gotta create Mike as a user.\n\n358\n00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.480\nSomebody's gotta give Mike's user\naccount rights and permissions.\n\n359\n00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.000\nAll of this is\n\n360\n00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.890\nhappening as part of the administration\nof the access control system.\n\n361\n00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:36.190\nThis could be an administrator,\n\n362\n00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.160\nit could be somebody who's delegated\njust to do user management.\n\n363\n00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.930\nThere's different way to view and\nsee this, but ultimately we\n\n364\n00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:45.300\nneed an administrative function, right\nwe wanna make sure we understand that.\n\n365\n00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:49.190\nWe could have centralized administration,\ndecentralized administration,\n\n366\n00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.579\nreally different approaches\ndifferent types.\n\n367\n00:17:51.579 --> 00:17:52.834\nIn WIndows systems today,\n\n368\n00:17:52.834 --> 00:17:56.542\nwe typically think of this in the active\ndirectory as being a centralized model,\n\n369\n00:17:56.542 --> 00:17:59.590\neverything is centralized\nagainst the domain controllers.\n\n370\n00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.450\nWe may have work groups, they tend to\nbe decentralized managing individual\n\n371\n00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.390\nmachines, no central authority to do that.\n\n372\n00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.252\nReally just depends on how you choose to\napproach that particular conversation.\n\n373\n00:18:10.252 --> 00:18:13.510\nWe wanna also keep in mind as we talk\nabout the distinction between physical and\n\n374\n00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.220\nlogical access control.\n\n375\n00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.360\nThat physical access control systems,\n\n376\n00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.650\njust like logical access control systems,\ncan be automated.\n\n377\n00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.580\nAnd we wanna think about the fact that\nautomation, brought to the table, brought\n\n378\n00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:28.870\nto the discussion around access control,\nis really pretty critical today, right?\n\n379\n00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.460\nBecause when we're talking about five or\nten users, right,\n\n380\n00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:33.570\neverybody knows everybody,\nit's not a big deal.\n\n381\n00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:37.410\nYou could probably manage that as\na one off without a lot of automation.\n\n382\n00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.080\nBut most businesses, at least many of the\nbig ones that I deal with as my customers\n\n383\n00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.530\nand my clients, have hundreds,\nprobably thousands in some cases, tens or\n\n384\n00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.650\nhundreds of thousands of users.\n\n385\n00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:52.545\nAnd as a result of that, this is at the\nlevel where you just don't know everybody,\n\n386\n00:18:52.545 --> 00:18:55.380\nright, and there's no way you would,\neven if you tried to.\n\n387\n00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:59.133\nAnd you can't manage this yourself\nas a individual administrator trying\n\n388\n00:18:59.133 --> 00:18:59.746\nto do this.\n\n389\n00:18:59.746 --> 00:19:02.555\nYou actually have to use an automation\nsolution to effectively be\n\n390\n00:19:02.555 --> 00:19:03.990\nable to achieve this end result.\n\n391\n00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.150\nSo a lot of these systems are automated\nand we just wanna think about that and\n\n392\n00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.310\nmake sure we're aware of that as well.\n\n393\n00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.230\nWhen we think about access control we also\nneed to think about the idea of what we\n\n394\n00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.740\ncall dual custody.\n\n395\n00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:19.477\nAnd dual custody is the idea that we\nare gonna have the ability to effectively\n\n396\n00:19:19.477 --> 00:19:23.030\nsplit up identification,\nif you think of it this way, or\n\n397\n00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:27.121\nthe outcome of identification\nwhich is essentially that token.\n\n398\n00:19:27.121 --> 00:19:30.220\nAnd we refer to it as keys,\nwe've talked about keys before.\n\n399\n00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.070\nPrivate keys, if you remember, and\n\n400\n00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.540\nprivate keys are associated\nwith quick knowledge item.\n\n401\n00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.960\nAgain, we need that overhead, right?\n\n402\n00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.160\nA little blinking test sign would be cool.\n\n403\n00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:40.680\nSo quick quiz for you, right?\n\n404\n00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.880\nPrivate keys,\nwhen we think about cryptography,\n\n405\n00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.020\nwhat kind of encryption solution\nare private keys associated with?\n\n406\n00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.020\nIs it gonna be symmetric encryption,\n\n407\n00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.650\nis it gonna be asymmetric encryption,\nis it gonna be private encryption?\n\n408\n00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.566\nIs it going to be, I don't know, let me\nmake up a good one that sounds obvious and\n\n409\n00:19:57.566 --> 00:19:59.330\nplausible, but it's really not.\n\n410\n00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.730\nIs it Yogi Bear encryption, right?\n\n411\n00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:02.580\n>> I like that one.\n\n412\n00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.470\n>> That's a good one, right?\n\n413\n00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:04.980\nSo, Yogi Bear encryption.\n\n414\n00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.912\nIt's clearly not gonna\nbe Yogi Bear encryption.\n\n415\n00:20:06.912 --> 00:20:07.540\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n416\n00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.085\n>> Right, it is symmetric encryption,\n\n417\n00:20:09.085 --> 00:20:11.122\nright, it's gonna be private key or\nsingle key.\n\n418\n00:20:11.122 --> 00:20:13.590\nSo if we're thinking about private keys,\nwe're single about a single key.\n\n419\n00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:15.850\nIf we're thinking about\npublic private key pairs,\n\n420\n00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:19.548\nasymmetric encryption solutions use those,\nwe're thinking about keys.\n\n421\n00:20:19.548 --> 00:20:23.080\nAnd with dual custody, what we're thinking\nabout is having more than one key,\n\n422\n00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.420\nprobably two valid keys.\n\n423\n00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.980\nAnd they're gonna be presented to\nthe reader within a certain amount of time\n\n424\n00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.850\nto grant access.\n\n425\n00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:30.590\nSo when we think about dual custody,\n\n426\n00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.320\nwe often refer to this as\nthe two person rule, right.\n\n427\n00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.560\nThe idea that you must insert two keys\ninto a system, both have to be valid.\n\n428\n00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.880\nAnd they have to then be presented, they\nhave to be authenticated and authorized.\n\n429\n00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.520\nUsually there's a time window,\nyou can access the system and\n\n430\n00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.590\nthen you maybe have 20 seconds to provide\nthe second key or something like that.\n\n431\n00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:53.800\nSo that way if there's one reader or\none place where they keys are inserted and\n\n432\n00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.790\nthere's two people that\nare expected to operate,\n\n433\n00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:58.210\nyou have to give enough\nof a window of time so\n\n434\n00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.660\nthat both people can effectively\nget up to the system and do it.\n\n435\n00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.724\nIf it's two separate consoles, you may not\nhave a window, you may just have to do it\n\n436\n00:21:04.724 --> 00:21:07.996\nat the same time, within maybe two or\nthree seconds of each other.\n\n437\n00:21:07.996 --> 00:21:10.283\nCuz the assumption is you'll\nboth insert your keys and\n\n438\n00:21:10.283 --> 00:21:12.600\nauthenticate them roughly\nat the same time.\n\n439\n00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.150\nSo it really just depends\non how we do this, but\n\n440\n00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:18.720\nthe idea of dual custody is really nothing\nmore than representing formally in access\n\n441\n00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.050\ncontrol language the two person rule\nconcept that we've spoken about before.\n\n442\n00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.610\nAccess control can be generated and\n\n443\n00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:27.610\ncan be managed with a variety of\nmechanisms as we've talked about.\n\n444\n00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.950\nWe may use access control tokens, right?\n\n445\n00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:34.710\nA token is really nothing more\neffectively than a device that's going to\n\n446\n00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:39.350\neffectively allow us when we present\nthe information stored on the token to\n\n447\n00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.010\neffectively provide that.\n\n448\n00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:42.760\nIt goes into a reader or\n\n449\n00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:46.380\nis going to be somehow provided to\nthe reader and we do a comparison.\n\n450\n00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.350\nSo typically we talk about challenge\nresponse systems with tokens right?\n\n451\n00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.660\nAnd there may be synchronous tokens,\nthere may be asynchronous tokens.\n\n452\n00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.620\nA synchronous token is one\nthat's synchronized for time, so\n\n453\n00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.400\nit synchronizes back\nto a server somewhere.\n\n454\n00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.290\nAnd that challenge that\nis issued by the server\n\n455\n00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:05.930\ncomes out to the token every 30 seconds,\nevery minute, whatever the timing is.\n\n456\n00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:10.370\nYou set this all up when you\neffectively install and instantiate or\n\n457\n00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:11.560\nset up the system.\n\n458\n00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.860\nAnd once you've done that,\nthen effectively,\n\n459\n00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:18.790\nevery time cycle that server issues\na challenge out to every token.\n\n460\n00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:22.920\nThe token generates a response to that\nchallenge, and that response is what you\n\n461\n00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.550\nprovide if you're gonna authenticate\nwith the token during that time window.\n\n462\n00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:29.110\nThat one minute or\ntwo minute cycle, or whatever it is,\n\n463\n00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.340\nwhere that response is gonna be accurate.\n\n464\n00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.540\nThe next time the cycle runs, there's\na new response, and That's what shows up\n\n465\n00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.470\non the little screen of the token and\nthat's what you generate or\n\n466\n00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:40.030\nrather ultimately what's generated and\ntherefore what you provide.\n\n467\n00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.440\nSo we just wanna make sure that you\nthink about access control systems\n\n468\n00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:45.170\nwith regards to access control tokens.\n\n469\n00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.610\nThis is a pretty popular way that we\noften engage in this behavior and\n\n470\n00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:49.600\nthis activity today.\n\n471\n00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:54.930\nYou may have seen these, RSA is pretty\npopular so a lot of people use RSA tokens.\n\n472\n00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.790\nThey're little ones that people typically\nwalk around with on their key chain.\n\n473\n00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.930\nLooks like a little, probably, oh,\nI don't know, oh, there we go,\n\n474\n00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:02.230\nthank you very much.\n\n475\n00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:03.910\nLooks something like this,\n\n476\n00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.680\nalthough this is not an RSA token, but\na little key fob of some type, right?\n\n477\n00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:11.100\nThis one is just a static one, it's not\ngonna have anything special going on,\n\n478\n00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:12.120\nno screen on it.\n\n479\n00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.403\nIt's just gonna effectively be put up\nagainst the reader and allow you to read\n\n480\n00:23:15.403 --> 00:23:18.496\nthe information that's stored in\nthe memory chip or in the card in here.\n\n481\n00:23:18.496 --> 00:23:22.356\nAnd then effectively proxyies that allows\nyou to be authenticated through the access\n\n482\n00:23:22.356 --> 00:23:25.560\ncontrol system that monitors\nthe pad where you put the token on.\n\n483\n00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.960\nSo this is one form, but\n\n484\n00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:29.490\nthere could be those that have\na little LCD display on them.\n\n485\n00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:32.226\nThey're probably about so\nbig and you see them, as I said,\n\n486\n00:23:32.226 --> 00:23:35.511\nthey're kinda narrow on one side,\nthey've a little bulb on one side,\n\n487\n00:23:35.511 --> 00:23:37.955\nit looks like an upside\ndown thermometer in effect.\n\n488\n00:23:37.955 --> 00:23:41.829\nAnd that's where you actually see the LCD\ndisplay on the long narrow part that\n\n489\n00:23:41.829 --> 00:23:43.806\nactually generates the information.\n\n490\n00:23:43.806 --> 00:23:46.806\nThe little circular part on the end\ntraditionally is where the electronics\n\n491\n00:23:46.806 --> 00:23:49.030\nare stored and\nthere's some stuff going on there.\n\n492\n00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.981\nBut also, it looks cool cuz you\nhave a little thing on the bottom.\n\n493\n00:23:50.981 --> 00:23:52.283\nIt looks like a can opener, right?\n\n494\n00:23:52.283 --> 00:23:53.396\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You can do that or Coaster for\n\n495\n00:23:53.396 --> 00:23:56.420\na small drink, a little thimble about so\nbig, right, something like that.\n\n496\n00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.935\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right we also have\n\n497\n00:23:57.935 --> 00:23:59.060\nbiometric systems.\n\n498\n00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.410\nWe talked a bit about biometrics being\none of the factors of authentication.\n\n499\n00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.250\nSomething you are is what\nbiometrics represents.\n\n500\n00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.580\nYeah we often use biometrics but\nwe don't think about it.\n\n501\n00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:10.640\nIt kind of happens quite often these days.\n\n502\n00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.510\nYou may have a fingerprint reader.\n\n503\n00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:16.750\nSo I mentioned a couple of times in some\nof our prior episodes that some of the new\n\n504\n00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:20.510\nsmartphone technology may incorporate\nbiometric scanning for fingerprints.\n\n505\n00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.700\nI have a fingerprint reader on my laptop.\n\n506\n00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.810\nLot of devices are gonna\nintegrate that today.\n\n507\n00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.820\nIt's pretty standard way of doing this.\n\n508\n00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.730\nIt's not as accurate as\nsome biometric systems are.\n\n509\n00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.690\nBut it is certainly one way we do this.\n\n510\n00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.306\nMost of the major theme parks in the\nUnited States and even around the world\n\n511\n00:24:35.306 --> 00:24:39.210\nhave gone to biometric solutions, probably\nin the last four or five years, and\n\n512\n00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.966\nyou now are effectively given an option,\nreally you don't have an option.\n\n513\n00:24:42.966 --> 00:24:43.631\n>> Yeah.\n>> You have to do it.\n\n514\n00:24:43.631 --> 00:24:47.159\nIt's great that you pay all this money and\nyou're not given any choice, you're just\n\n515\n00:24:47.159 --> 00:24:50.780\ntold stick your finger in the reader\nbecause we need to scan your fingerprint.\n\n516\n00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.380\nBut the idea is that they\nbasically use a biometric system.\n\n517\n00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.810\nThey link your card or your band now or\nwhatever it is, but basically your access\n\n518\n00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:01.770\nto the park is linked to a biometric\nscan of one or more of your fingers.\n\n519\n00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.310\nRight?\nSo the idea is that they can\n\n520\n00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:07.880\nuniquely identify you, because that way\nif you lose the pass or lose the band or\n\n521\n00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.110\nwhatever, then it's obviously not you.\n\n522\n00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.865\nAnd we can then say, hey Mike,\nwhy are you trying to be Adam, right.\n\n523\n00:25:12.865 --> 00:25:15.090\nAnd we can figure out why\nMike is trying to do that.\n\n524\n00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.070\nSo we have lots of\ndifferent ways to do this.\n\n525\n00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:19.220\nWe may do an iris or a retina scan.\n\n526\n00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.530\nSo you'd sit in front of a scanning\ndevice that will shoot a beam of light\n\n527\n00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.060\ninto the eye, returns back the pattern\nthat it sees for the iris or\n\n528\n00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.320\nthe retina at the back of the eye,\nif it's the retina scan.\n\n529\n00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.324\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n530\n00:25:31.324 --> 00:25:34.670\nwe can then have a unique fingerprinting\nconcept that matches you.\n\n531\n00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:36.410\nWe can do voice print recognition.\n\n532\n00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:40.310\nWe can do signature dynamics, where you\nsign and looking at how you sign and\n\n533\n00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:42.500\nthe pressure you use and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n534\n00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.270\nWe can scan the entire hand,\nnot just one finger.\n\n535\n00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:46.560\nSo there's different things we can do.\n\n536\n00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.400\nDo you know, by the way, a little deep\ntrivia for ya, did you know that earlobes\n\n537\n00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.670\nare actually also considered\nto be a unique characteristic?\n\n538\n00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.680\nSo unique, that they are actually\nunique for everybody in the world.\n\n539\n00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:57.420\n>> I did not know that.\n\n540\n00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.453\n>> The pattern of how your\near is formed in utero.\n\n541\n00:25:59.453 --> 00:25:59.954\n>> Really.\n>> Yeah.\n\n542\n00:25:59.954 --> 00:26:01.395\nIt's also considered to be a unique\n\n543\n00:26:01.395 --> 00:26:02.404\nsolution they can use for\n\n544\n00:26:02.404 --> 00:26:03.587\nidentification today.\n>> Huh.\n\n545\n00:26:03.587 --> 00:26:04.510\nInteresting.\n\n546\n00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:07.260\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now how do they, just a picture of it?\n\n547\n00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.350\n>> I'm not sure.\n\n548\n00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.220\nThey have to register and\n\n549\n00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.920\nscan it, but the overall solution is I\nthink still kind of being worked out.\n\n550\n00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.542\nIt involves something about coming along\nand taking a small skin snip from your ear\n\n551\n00:26:18.542 --> 00:26:19.056\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n552\n00:26:19.056 --> 00:26:20.315\n>> And then comparing that to\n\n553\n00:26:20.315 --> 00:26:21.360\nsomething on file.\n\n554\n00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:21.900\nIt doesn't.\n\n555\n00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:22.720\nI'm only kidding.\n\n556\n00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.055\nNot even close, doesn't do that.\n\n557\n00:26:24.055 --> 00:26:26.830\nBut all kidding aside,\nthey are considered to be unique enough.\n\n558\n00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:30.540\nStudies have shown scientifically recently\nthat they actually can use them for\n\n559\n00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.990\nbiometric identification as well.\n\n560\n00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.890\nWhich is kind of interesting.\n\n561\n00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:33.930\nIt is a scanning process.\n\n562\n00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.860\nYes.\nThey do have to scan the pattern of\n\n563\n00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:40.520\nthe whole ear, earlobe and everything\nto figure out that those belong to you.\n\n564\n00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:42.320\nAnd then they can basically\nput that in a database,\n\n565\n00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.120\nmuch like they do with everything else,\nand then do a comparison, right?\n\n566\n00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.010\nBut it's actually one of those things\nwhich is kind of neat when you\n\n567\n00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:47.732\nthink about it, right?\n\n568\n00:26:47.732 --> 00:26:48.551\n>> Fascinating, yeah.\n\n569\n00:26:48.551 --> 00:26:51.179\n>> So anyway, so when we think\nabout axis control systems we\n\n570\n00:26:51.179 --> 00:26:54.670\nhave a lot of technology, a lot of\nthings we can bring into the mix here.\n\n571\n00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.894\nWe also have some considerations\nwe have to be thinking about and\n\n572\n00:26:57.894 --> 00:27:00.950\ninteracting around is CISSPs\nto manage this process.\n\n573\n00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.770\nWhat are the policies\ninvolved with access control?\n\n574\n00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:07.060\nSet policies up that will stipulate and\ncontrol and direct for\n\n575\n00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.190\nus how this should all come together.\n\n576\n00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:10.300\nWho's gonna say, in other words,\n\n577\n00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:14.210\nthat the policy is we're gonna have\na guard in the lobby versus a biometric\n\n578\n00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:18.280\nsystem that's not monitored as some sort\nof just some fingerprint reader on a door,\n\n579\n00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.970\nthat you can just use and automatically\ngain entry, if that's who you are.\n\n580\n00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:23.540\nSo what are the mechanisms we use?\n\n581\n00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:24.670\nWhat are the policies, right?\n\n582\n00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.170\nWhat are the different models?\n\n583\n00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:29.820\nI've mentioned a few of them in\nsome of our prior conversations.\n\n584\n00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:33.070\nGonna have a pretty detailed discussion\nof them towards the end of this domain on\n\n585\n00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:34.500\none of our upcoming episodes.\n\n586\n00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:39.022\nBut things like role based access control,\nattribute based access control,\n\n587\n00:27:39.022 --> 00:27:43.770\nmandatory or discretionary access control,\ntemporal based access control, time based.\n\n588\n00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.560\nThese are all different\naccess control models or\n\n589\n00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.500\nmechanisms that we have to think about and\nunderstand and use.\n\n590\n00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.310\nAnd we have to decide which one of them or\nwhich groups of them,\n\n591\n00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:54.140\nif we're combing them together,\nare gonna be the most appropriate.\n\n592\n00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.272\nBecause if we don't have a good\nsense of that, then obviously,\n\n593\n00:27:57.272 --> 00:27:58.620\nwe're potentially gonna run into an issue.\n\n594\n00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:01.200\nAnd you know this is something\nwe have to be concerned with.\n\n595\n00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.540\nSo physical access control systems,\nlogical access control systems,\n\n596\n00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:08.950\ndifferent factors of authentication,\npolicies to drive all that.\n\n597\n00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:11.510\nYou know, these are all things that\nwe've got to be thinking about.\n\n598\n00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:15.140\nWe've got to have not just\na thought process around,\n\n599\n00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.310\nnot just a solution for, but\nreally we have to have an architecture,\n\n600\n00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.290\nif you wanna think about the logic of\nthis, and raise it to the level of\n\n601\n00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:25.560\nan all encompassing solution with regards\nto how we approach this in the enterprise.\n\n602\n00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.730\nVery important thought process for\n\n603\n00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:30.480\nus as CISSPs cuz we have to be\ninvolved in that whole cycle.\n\n604\n00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.800\nWe have to be involved in that\nconversation and thinking through that and\n\n605\n00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.160\nguiding the business towards\nthe activities and the decision points\n\n606\n00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.280\nthat are gonna allow this to\nultimately be implemented properly.\n\n607\n00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:40.870\n>> Very good Adam!\n\n608\n00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:43.780\nThat's a great first look at our,\nwell I don't wanna say first look, but\n\n609\n00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.740\na really good look at identity and\naccess management or the IM process.\n\n610\n00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.250\nAnd I know we've got more to go over.\n\n611\n00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:52.446\nUnfortunately we're out of time\non this particular episode.\n\n612\n00:28:52.446 --> 00:28:56.082\nSo we're gonna call it here, but\ndon't worry we're coming back\n\n613\n00:28:56.082 --> 00:29:00.470\nwith more IM processes and continue to\nlook at controlling access subjects.\n\n614\n00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.820\nTwo objects, so\nmake sure you come back for that.\n\n615\n00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.290\nRemember if you guys want to see Adam or\n\n616\n00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.058\na ten-one of Adam's classes live,\nshoot us an email.\n\n617\n00:29:07.058 --> 00:29:09.521\nSeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n618\n00:29:09.521 --> 00:29:10.543\nThat's gonna do it for now.\n\n619\n00:29:10.543 --> 00:29:12.540\nSigning off, I'm Mike

00:00:20.270\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick, and\ntoday we're doing our CISSP content.\n\n00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.700\nAnd specifically, we're gonna be\ndiving into managing authentication.\n\n00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.700\nWe've already taken a look at some of\nthat process, right, with the IAA, IAM,\n\n00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.800\nI should say the Identity and\nAccess Management.\n\n00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.610\nAnd we saw that there's a lot\nof moving parts to it as well.\n\n00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.770\nAs Adam said, it's one of those things\nthat we might take for granted sometimes,\n\n00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.290\ncuz a lot of it can be automated and\nwe don't really see it happening.\n\n00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.800\nThere's a lot to is so luckily for\nuse we've got the one and only Adam Gordon\n\n00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.890\nhere to help us figure out what\nthe heck's going on in the background.\n\n00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.850\nHow are you doing, Adam?\n\n00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.620\n>> I\"m good, I'm goo.\n\n00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.790\nYou know, I almost didn't make it in for\nthis episode because the door access\n\n00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.500\ncontrol mechanism wouldn't work and\nwouldn't let me in.\n\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.935\nThat stupid key fob that\nMike gave me wasn't working.\n\n00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:00.810\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Must have been a fake token as opposed\n\n00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.870\nto a real token.\n\n00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.435\n>> We modified the authorization for\nhis authentication there.\n\n00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:05.400\n[LAUGH]\n>> Don't let the long\n\n00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.130\nhaired guy with the grey hair\ncome back in the studio.\n\n00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.880\nAll right, so\nlet's continue our conversations right?\n\n00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.430\nYou know we've talked a lot up\nuntil now with regards to IM\n\n00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.330\nabout the moving parts as Mike was saying.\n\n00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.510\nIt's a great way of thinking about it.\n\n00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.860\nWe've talked about the idea behind\nidentity and access management, the users\n\n00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.750\nor subjects and the objects, the data,\nright,so, subject-object interaction.\n\n00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.260\nWe talked a lot about the fact\nthat we have both physical and\n\n00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.400\nlogical approaches to this system.\n\n00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.940\nTalked about some of the examples\nof what those may look like.\n\n00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.130\nWe've talked about the authentication\nprocess and authorization process and\n\n00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.300\nhow tokens are generated, the user tokens,\nthe virtual tokens, as we call them, and\n\n00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.800\nare given to user accounts\nin a directory service.\n\n00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.400\nAnd we've talked about the different\nfactors of authentication.\n\n00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.660\nWe talked about something you have,\nsomething you know, and something you are.\n\n00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.170\nThese are the three factors of\nauthentication we traditionally discuss.\n\n00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.000\nNow we're giving you some examples\nof each of those and how they work.\n\n00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.270\nThere are other ways in which we\ncan identify ourselves aligned\n\n00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.140\nwith those three factors but things that\nwe don't always, and maybe not always in\n\n00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.420\nthe top of our mind, thinking about and\nMike alluded to this when he said there is\n\n00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.350\na lot of things going on, lot of it's\nautomated, stuff we may not even see.\n\n00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.690\nSo for instance, we can use a Mac\naddress as a unique identifier.\n\n00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.240\nWe often do that and do that all the time,\nwhen we think about systems,\n\n00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.780\nright, because when we think\nabout a individual endpoint,\n\n00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.580\na computer, not a person now, because I'm\nnot walking around with a MAC address.\n\n00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It would be great if I\n\n00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.300\ncould put one on my back and\nturn around show you what that look like.\n\n00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.430\n>> Scan when we need to.\n\n00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.950\n>> Scan it, you know in like,\nyou ever see 12 Monkeys, the movie?\n\n00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.550\nSo they have, the Bruce Willis character\nhas the bar code tattoo, right,\n\n00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.995\nthe expiration tattoo.\n\n00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:41.180\nSo that kind of thing, right.\n\n00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.990\nWe don't have that.\n\n00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.240\nAlthough I've seen a few\nof those on people but\n\n00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.670\nwe don't have that commonly, right.\n\n00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.320\nSo, but we do have media access control\naddresses, in other words MAC addresses.\n\n00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.410\nMAC addresses are going to be\nuniquely assigned in theory anyway.\n\n00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.164\nIf you don't violate the tenants of\nthe system, you're not up to no good and\n\n00:02:58.164 --> 00:02:59.704\ntrying to spoof a MAC address.\n\n00:02:59.704 --> 00:03:01.634\nBut if you're doing the right thing,\n\n00:03:01.634 --> 00:03:05.442\na MAC address should be uniquely\nidentifying the individual IP endpoint.\n\n00:03:05.442 --> 00:03:07.204\nIn other words, the network card or\n\n00:03:07.204 --> 00:03:11.305\nthe network capable device that you're\nusing is gonna have a unique identifier.\n\n00:03:11.305 --> 00:03:13.335\nIt has two, potentially, right?\n\n00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:15.500\nIt has a MAC address, certainly.\n\n00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.305\nIt may or\nmay not have an IP address that is unique.\n\n00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:21.648\nIt should be unique, but the reality is,\nwe know we often reuse private internal IP\n\n00:03:21.648 --> 00:03:24.999\naddresses, so they're unique\nwithin that address space, but\n\n00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:29.344\nthey're not unique globally, because\nthere's lots and lots and lots of machines\n\n00:03:29.344 --> 00:03:34.522\nout there that have a 10.005 address or\n192.168.0.20 or whatever that may be.\n\n00:03:34.522 --> 00:03:35.120\nRight?\nBut\n\n00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.140\nthe point is it is unique within\nthe system it's being used in.\n\n00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.420\nSo we can use IP addresses.\n\n00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.260\nWe can use MAC addresses as unique\nidentifiers for access control.\n\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.440\nFor instance when we talked about\nwireless systems one of the security\n\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.570\nthings that we told you would be\na good idea for you to consider and\n\n00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.165\nit is a thing by the way that\nis a formal technical term.\n\n00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.310\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Security thing.\n\n00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.160\nI didn't call it a thingy.\n\n00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.500\nThat would be the next technical term\nyou graduate to when you become a CISSP.\n\n00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.900\nBut a technical thing,\none of the approaches right?\n\n00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.240\nIt's part of the wireless architecture we\nsaid would be good for you to implement\n\n00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.870\nwould be to create a MAC address allow or\ndeny list effectively a block or\n\n00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.510\nallow list that you could use\nwith what's called MAC filtering,\n\n00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.300\nwhich is actual the formal name for\nthe approach to prevent certain systems\n\n00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.420\nfrom authenticating against\nyour wireless access point.\n\n00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.590\nSo we can use addresses all\nthe time as mechanisms for\n\n00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.570\neffectively providing access control.\n\n00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.220\nWe also have the ability to use\nsomething like a radio frequency ID tag,\n\n00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.830\nan RFID tag.\n\n00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.810\nIf you think about the fact that, although\nwe don't tend to see them in modern,\n\n00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.610\neveryday interactions in\nthe normal enterprise,\n\n00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.540\ncuz we don't tend to use RFID tags for\npeople, but we do use them for goods.\n\n00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.270\nSo, for instance, we can tag\na pallet of servers that are being\n\n00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.370\nshipped from point A to point B or\nbeing moved around a warehouse and\n\n00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.410\nwe could track where they are and\nwe can not only know where they are but\n\n00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.900\nalso know what they are in the sense that\nwe've programmed information into the chip\n\n00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.280\nthat effectively tells us what's on\nthat pallet and that kind of stuff.\n\n00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.950\nSo, we could tag people if we really\nwanted to, we don't but we could.\n\n00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.500\nWe could tag vehicles,\nwe could tag anything.\n\n00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.110\nSo Costco for instance, right, uses RFID\ntags in their warehouses to keep track\n\n00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.610\nof all the palleted stuff they have up on\nthe shelves, and when they do inventory\n\n00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.140\nthey can just scan the tag and it tells\nthem, oh, you've got paper towels on that\n\n00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.760\npallet, you're supposed to have so\nmuch, that kind of thing.\n\n00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.380\nSo we use our FIN tags as well.\n\n00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.970\nThere's lots of different ways for\nus to approach identity.\n\n00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.420\nIt's not just the standard,\nhey, who are you?\n\n00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.460\nI'm user X with password Y.\n\n00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.130\nThere's a lot more too\nit these days than that.\n\n00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.280\nWe just want to be thinking about this and\nunderstand the different solutions and\n\n00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.930\napproaches that we may be able to bring to\nthe party, because it really does today\n\n00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.420\nbecome a question of what\ntechnology are we going to use and\n\n00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.860\nwhat approach does that technology allow\nfor with regards to authentication and\n\n00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.250\nauthorization as well as identification?\n\n00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.650\nSo we may be able to do\nthe standard stuff, right?\n\n00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.900\nBut ultimately we can also get\ncreative and give people smart cards,\n\n00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.590\nwe can give them chips, we can give\nthem embedded in the smart card.\n\n00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.200\nWe can give them some sort\nof a PIN to go with it.\n\n00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.890\nThese are not new concepts, but\nespecially in roughly about the last year,\n\n00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.410\nyeah, probably about the last year or\nso, in the United States in particular,\n\n00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:07.190\nwe're moving to a chip and\nPIN solution with credit cards,\n\n00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.950\nbecause of compliance with PCIDSS\nregulations or requirements I should say.\n\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.800\nAnd so all the major banking vendors,\n\n00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.400\nall the major financial services vendors\nand all the retailers are having to retool\n\n00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.620\nall of the systems they use\nto do processing of payments.\n\n00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.670\nSo if you've gotten one of these credit\ncards recently or your bank has reissued\n\n00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.470\nit or said hey, we're not going to meet\nthe October deadline, instead we're\n\n00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.920\ngonna get an extension so we're not\ngonna do it, which is what my bank did.\n\n00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.700\nNo, it's not a big deal.\n\n00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.280\nWe don't really need to comply.\n\n00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.520\nWe'll just get around to it\nin the next year and half.\n\n00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It's effectively what they told me.\n\n00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.340\nI said wow that's really interesting\nconsidering that everybody else is\n\n00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.230\ndoing it, but you go do your own thing.\n\n00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.760\nYou be you, right, do you,\nthat's what's important.\n\n00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.150\nSo my bank has not done that yet.\n\n00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.620\nI should say that it was my bank because\nI'm switching banks because they clearly\n\n00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.150\naren't all that interested\nin getting that done.\n\n00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.652\nBut whether they've done it yet or\nnot, really not all that important.\n\n00:06:54.652 --> 00:06:56.930\nWhat is important is the idea\nthey're going to reissue a card,\n\n00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.780\ngoing to have a little chip.\n\n00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:02.141\nIt's probably a one by one square\non the front of the card or\n\n00:07:02.141 --> 00:07:04.700\nembedded somewhere in the card.\n\n00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.160\nAnd now if you start using those cards,\nyou're gonna walk up and\n\n00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.661\nuse the traditional readers.\n\n00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:12.411\nSo you have to swipe it but if its a chip\nand pin card you can't swipe it anymore\n\n00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:15.987\nthe way you did before, you have to\nstick it in the bottom of the reader and\n\n00:07:15.987 --> 00:07:18.660\nit has to sit in there\nwhile their processing it.\n\n00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.789\nNow this has actually been going on for\nyears in Europe.\n\n00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:22.507\nWe're really just behind the times.\n\n00:07:22.507 --> 00:07:25.940\nSo whenever I travel over\nto Europe on business,\n\n00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.200\nI've been there Probably three\ntimes this year on business alone.\n\n00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:29.870\nI know, it's a rough life.\n\n00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.500\nI do, I get it.\n\n00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.102\nI understand, right?\n\n00:07:31.102 --> 00:07:32.729\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But I've been there a lot recently,\n\n00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:34.200\nlet's put it that way.\n\n00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.240\nBut when I was there the last couple of\ntimes actually, one of my cards happens to\n\n00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.940\nalready have the chip on it, and\nhas had it for the better part of a year.\n\n00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.703\nAnd when you're over there, they're kind\nenough, they walk up, cuz they know,\n\n00:07:44.703 --> 00:07:47.189\nespecially if you're an American or\na tourist, you're not from Europe,\n\n00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:48.418\nthat you may not be familiar with it.\n\n00:07:48.418 --> 00:07:51.810\nSo whenever you're out somewhere,\nwhich is like the most hilarious thing in\n\n00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:55.198\nthe world, so we're out at a bar after\nhours, like going out and drinking and\n\n00:07:55.198 --> 00:07:57.680\nhaving fun, and so\neverybody's had a bunch of drinks.\n\n00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.260\nWe're all sitting there, okay,\nwho's gonna pay the check?\n\n00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.100\nFine, I'll pay the check, so\nthe bar person comes over.\n\n00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.520\nSo here's the deal,\nthey bring you the reader,\n\n00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.400\nand it's literally like\na hand held reader.\n\n00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:09.679\nIt's bigger than this, but\nbasically they give this thing to you,\n\n00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:12.550\nit's got the paper roll at the top,\nit's got the big slot in the bottom for\n\n00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:14.568\nyou to stick the card in and\nthey just hand it to you.\n\n00:08:14.568 --> 00:08:15.595\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They're like, okay,\n\n00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:16.585\nwell you should know what to do with it.\n\n00:08:16.585 --> 00:08:18.550\nWell no, I'm not sure what to do with it.\n\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:19.855\nSo they explain it to you,\ngreat, so you take the card,\n\n00:08:19.855 --> 00:08:22.815\nyou put it in the bottom, leave it in\nthere, does its thing, prints it out.\n\n00:08:22.815 --> 00:08:25.955\nIt's like a little adding machine, paper\nroll on the top, so that's kinda cool.\n\n00:08:25.955 --> 00:08:28.454\nIt works a lot better, it's a lot\nfunnier when you've all been drinking.\n\n00:08:28.454 --> 00:08:29.133\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:31.625\nnobody really understands the concept,\nright?\n\n00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:32.940\nIt's a lot of fun.\n\n00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.590\nSo idea is that you simply stick\nthe card in the bottom of the reader,\n\n00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.930\nit does its stuff,\nit authenticates, it processes.\n\n00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:40.600\nThe trick is you can't pull the card\nout until it says it's done.\n\n00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.200\nI know this because I did that and I got\nin trouble, cuz you have to do it again.\n\n00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.930\nSo you have to make sure that you\nleave the chip in place, the card and\n\n00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:47.480\nchip in place.\n\n00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.240\nBut this is the kind of thing that\nwe can do with these systems today.\n\n00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.900\nThe idea behind all of this, remember,\n\n00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.890\nis to ensure that identity is\ngoing to be validated, right?\n\n00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:00.160\nWe wanna make sure we're not allowing\nstrangers to get access to our systems.\n\n00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.280\nThis is really what the important\nthought process is here behind this.\n\n00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.540\nNow, we also have to think about\nthe fact that when data is being used\n\n00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.500\nwe may not be able to authenticate.\n\n00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.380\nWe may not be able to authorize, we may\nnot be able to provide identification\n\n00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.590\nat every step in\nthe transactional process.\n\n00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.500\nWe talked about SSO,\nwe talked about single sign on and\n\n00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.120\nthe idea that you basically\nauthenticate once and you access many.\n\n00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.590\nSo that happens in directory systems,\nthat's okay.\n\n00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.200\nBut what about data that's being sent or\ntransmitted across the wire?\n\n00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.236\nSo, data that's effectively in transit,\n\n00:09:28.236 --> 00:09:31.977\nhow are we authenticating the fact that\nfrom the place that we're sending it from\n\n00:09:31.977 --> 00:09:35.662\nto the place that we're ultimately\nwinding up, that somewhere along the way,\n\n00:09:35.662 --> 00:09:38.707\nanywhere along the way,\nincluding that endpoint at the far end?\n\n00:09:38.707 --> 00:09:41.204\nHow do we know that the data\nhasn't been intercepted?\n\n00:09:41.204 --> 00:09:44.296\nHow do we know that somebody that sees\nthe data has rights to see it and\n\n00:09:44.296 --> 00:09:47.480\nsomebody that does see the data\nis not actually a bad actor?\n\n00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.710\nThis becomes complicated, because we\ncan't stop everybody that sees the data\n\n00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:53.820\non the path and say, hey, who are you?\n\n00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.690\nRight?\nOr turn around and close your eyes,\n\n00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.910\nput on this blindfold, you're not supposed\nto see this data, that just doesn't work.\n\n00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.970\nNow, we've talked about a mechanism,\nright?\n\n00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.670\nA control, that we can implement\nthat will offset that,\n\n00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.130\nthat will effectively compensate for the\nfact that we can't provide identification.\n\n00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.260\nAll the way through an authentication and\nauthorization, all the way through.\n\n00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.900\nWe've talked about the fact\nthat we can implement,\n\n00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.880\nthrowing it over to my partner here.\n\n00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.405\nWe can implement.\n\n00:10:19.405 --> 00:10:21.240\n>> [LAUGH] I completely lost you there.\n\n00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.100\n>> Come on, we can implement.\n\n00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.930\nThink about what we're talking about here.\n\n00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:24.510\n>> Take it back.\n\n00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.320\n>> So let's start all over,\nlet's think about this, right.\n\n00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.530\nSo let's think about the fact that\nif we're transiting data, right,\n\n00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.140\nso we're sending data across the wire,\nright?\n\n00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.650\nAnd I wanna make sure nobody can eavesdrop\nor skim that data, can see it in some way,\n\n00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.850\nmake sure that only the authorized\nindividuals can see it,\n\n00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.760\nprovide confidentiality.\n\n00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.420\nWhat are we gonna do?\n\n00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.230\n>> We're gonna encrypt it.\n\n00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.840\n>> We're gonna encrypt the data,\nabsolutely.\n\n00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.650\nThis is why, boys and girls,\nyou have to pay attention during class and\n\n00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.330\nnot read the Internet news\nwhile people are talking.\n\n00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.690\n>> I get hung up on our viewers that\n\n00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:54.850\nare posting pictures of\ntheir socks on Twitter.\n\n00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.330\n>> Okay.\nAll right, all right.\n\n00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:01.420\nSo that's cool, I'll buy that, I'll buy\nthat because I have the coolest socks.\n\n00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.600\n>> He started a trend around here.\n\n00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.390\n>> Coolest, coolest socks.\n\n00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.583\nYou can see the bottom of them there,\nthe top are even cooler.\n\n00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:08.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The coolest socks on cool sock day\n\n00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:08.903\nFriday.\n\n00:11:08.903 --> 00:11:11.373\nAll right, so if you have a better\nlooking pair of socks by the way,\n\n00:11:11.373 --> 00:11:14.242\nI personally would love to see a picture\nof that, so if you're posting them,\n\n00:11:14.242 --> 00:11:15.631\nMike's gonna show them to me later.\n\n00:11:15.631 --> 00:11:17.593\nBut we're gonna have a sock off, okay?\n\n00:11:17.593 --> 00:11:19.837\nAll right, so for\neavesdropping or skimming,\n\n00:11:19.837 --> 00:11:23.328\nif we're doing that think about\nthe fact that ultimately, as Mike said.\n\n00:11:23.328 --> 00:11:26.836\nEncryption is gonna be that protection\nmechanism, that control we're gonna\n\n00:11:26.836 --> 00:11:30.342\nimplement to prevent this because what\nwe don't wanna have happen is somebody\n\n00:11:30.342 --> 00:11:34.500\neavesdropping or skimming the data,\neffectively reading it in transit.\n\n00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.590\nWe did discuss with you and showed you a\ncouple of times actually in prior episodes\n\n00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:42.880\nusing a capture program what kind of data,\nthe frames that we could capture and\n\n00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.930\nthe information in them.\n\n00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.430\nWe never really delved\ninto into the frame and\n\n00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.490\nsaid hey look, here's a user name,\nhere's a password.\n\n00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:51.300\nWe didn't go to that depth,\nbut we did indicate to you and\n\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:54.710\nyou should be able to understand\nthe logic of that leap of faith,\n\n00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.900\nif you will, that that data is there,\nin those data packets.\n\n00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.880\nWe just didn't bother to show it to you.\n\n00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.680\nBut the point is that you could\neasily get that data off the wire\n\n00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.520\nif we're not encrypting.\n\n00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.350\nSo eavesdropping or\nskimming, traffic analysis,\n\n00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.100\nlooking at this information is pretty\ncritical in this particular domain and\n\n00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.330\nin this conversation,\nbecause what we'd have to understand.\n\n00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.620\nThat if we take the controls that we've\ntalked about in another areas and\n\n00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.970\nwe apply them properly to our systems,\n\n00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.490\nthen access control becomes something\nthat's a lot easier to manage.\n\n00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.466\nBecause we're preventing the bad people\nfrom getting our data when it's out beyond\n\n00:12:26.466 --> 00:12:28.209\nthe border of our control directly.\n\n00:12:28.209 --> 00:12:31.237\nWe're effectively applying the sticky,\ncontrol to it,\n\n00:12:31.237 --> 00:12:35.522\nsome sort of a sticky solution, in this\ncase encryption that stays with the data.\n\n00:12:35.522 --> 00:12:39.274\nAnd it's much more difficult for a bad\nactor to get around, interact with, and\n\n00:12:39.274 --> 00:12:41.742\nultimately to break\nthe encryption to get the data.\n\n00:12:41.742 --> 00:12:45.345\nSo this is really important, we also\nare worried about things like spoofing and\n\n00:12:45.345 --> 00:12:46.113\nmasquerading.\n\n00:12:46.113 --> 00:12:49.383\nWhen we think about access control we're\nthinking about making sure people are who\n\n00:12:49.383 --> 00:12:50.610\nthey say they are.\n\n00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.460\nWhen they are spoofing and\nmasquerading they're actually showing\n\n00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.560\nup as somebody else, so\nwhy I told you we need the masks.\n\n00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:59.200\nIf we had the masks I could go to you now,\nyou'd have the mask on,\n\n00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.847\nI could say look Mike is masquerading.\n\n00:13:00.847 --> 00:13:04.660\nIt's been awesome, but nobody listens to\nme, they just don't pay attention to me.\n\n00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.780\nSo spoofing or masquerading is the idea of\npretending to be somebody that you're not,\n\n00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.980\nand so if you are a user that\nis legitimately identifying\n\n00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:15.860\nauthorizing authenticating into a system,\nthat's good.\n\n00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.680\nBut if you're not that user, but you\nwanna be, then you're gonna try to spoof,\n\n00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.302\nor masquerade.\n\n00:13:20.302 --> 00:13:24.170\nYou're gonna effectively bluff your way\nin and so this happens all the time.\n\n00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:29.130\nIf you're running a network scanner for\nbad log on attempts on the front end,\n\n00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.470\non your gateway at the entry\npoint to your network.\n\n00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.420\nIf you have an IDS or an IPS,\n\n00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.300\nan intrusion prevention system monitoring\nfailed log on attempts, you're gonna\n\n00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.770\nsee depending on the kind of network you\nhave, especially if you're a high profile\n\n00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:45.540\ntarget you're going to see probably\nthousands of failed logon attempts a day.\n\n00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.400\nSo people are trying to\ndo this all the time.\n\n00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:48.840\nThe reality is,\n\n00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:51.995\nmost of them are unsuccessful,\nbecause it's hard to do this.\n\n00:13:51.995 --> 00:13:56.100\nWe don't wanna make lie of the fact that\nthis happens, we also don't wanna make\n\n00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.990\nlie of the fact that if you're smart\nabout how you implement your systems\n\n00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.100\nit's hard to do this successfully.\n\n00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:02.700\nIt's very, very difficult, but\n\n00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.840\nthe point is if you are successful\nthen the bad actors are kept out.\n\n00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.620\nBut unfortunately, not always due to\nthe fact that you're not successful\n\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.270\nas an architect, as an implementor.\n\n00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.250\nBut if users,\n\n00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:16.540\nthe people that are using the systems,\nare not following the policies.\n\n00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.500\nSo there's passwords that are not strong.\n\n00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.390\nThey're not being reset when they\nshould be within the time windows.\n\n00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.400\nThey're using the same passwords or\nvery similar derivatives of them\n\n00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.500\nas opposed to changing those passwords and\nreally changing them up.\n\n00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.450\nIf they're not using complexity,\nat least not at the level they should be.\n\n00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:35.120\nThese are things that can implement or\npotentially impact our ability to\n\n00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.650\nimplement successfully and\nwe have to think about that.\n\n00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.765\nBecause ultimately, if a user\nchooses a non complex password or\n\n00:14:41.765 --> 00:14:44.345\none that may be complex\nin theory on the surface.\n\n00:14:44.345 --> 00:14:48.374\nYes, it's nine characters but it's\nthe word password with the letters one or\n\n00:14:48.374 --> 00:14:50.805\nthe numbers one, two, three, after it.\n\n00:14:50.805 --> 00:14:53.975\nThat's not an incredibly complex and\nincredibly secure password and\n\n00:14:53.975 --> 00:14:56.695\nif they do that kind of stuff,\nthat's gonna be a problem.\n\n00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:57.976\nThat's Mike's password.\n\n00:14:57.976 --> 00:14:59.210\n>> I'm getting ready to change mine now.\n\n00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.396\n>> Yes, he's gonna change\nhis now because I obviously,\n\n00:15:01.396 --> 00:15:04.700\nbeing telepathic I guessed that\nimmediately and understood that.\n\n00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.990\nBecause I'm the only person on the planet\nthat would say wow password123 that's not\n\n00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:08.985\na good password, right?\n\n00:15:08.985 --> 00:15:11.520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sometimes it's just that easy and\n\n00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.330\nthat obvious, right?\n\n00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.898\nSo just be aware of the fact that\nthese kind of things are problems, but\n\n00:15:14.898 --> 00:15:17.290\nwe wanna make sure we're\nthinking about all of this.\n\n00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.166\nRemember we do also have to keep in mind,\n\n00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:21.987\nthat access control is also\nabout privacy control, right?\n\n00:15:21.987 --> 00:15:26.243\nThe idea that when we're keeping bad\npeople out we're safeguarding data,\n\n00:15:26.243 --> 00:15:29.704\nproviding confidentiality,\nsafeguarding system access,\n\n00:15:29.704 --> 00:15:34.381\nproviding confidentiality for those\nsystems we're also focusing on integrity.\n\n00:15:34.381 --> 00:15:37.792\nWe're providing safeguarding of the actual\nmeaning and the value of the data but\n\n00:15:37.792 --> 00:15:41.305\nwe're also protecting availability,\nwe're making sure the data and the systems\n\n00:15:41.305 --> 00:15:44.615\nare gonna be there for the authorized\npeople, but also preventing people that\n\n00:15:44.615 --> 00:15:47.858\nare not authorized from gaining entry and\ngetting access to those systems.\n\n00:15:47.858 --> 00:15:52.696\nAll of this is important, we have to\nsafeguard individual's data what we call\n\n00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.000\nPII, personally identifiable information.\n\n00:15:54.986 --> 00:15:56.298\nWe have to safeguard's systems data.\n\n00:15:56.298 --> 00:15:59.541\nWe have to safeguard all sorts\nof data that may be in one or\n\n00:15:59.541 --> 00:16:01.619\nmore of our systems and only allow.\n\n00:16:01.619 --> 00:16:06.212\nNot only authorized users, but only allow\nauthorized users that have a specific\n\n00:16:06.212 --> 00:16:08.452\nreason for accessing the data to do so.\n\n00:16:08.452 --> 00:16:10.210\nI may be authorized to see the data,\n\n00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:12.740\nthat doesn't mean I have\nto access it all the time.\n\n00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:15.784\nAnd these are the kind of subtleties\nwe have to start thinking about with\n\n00:16:15.784 --> 00:16:16.554\naccess control.\n\n00:16:16.554 --> 00:16:19.923\nWe may implement an access control\nmechanism that is time based,\n\n00:16:19.923 --> 00:16:23.400\nI've talked about temporal\naccess control before.\n\n00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:27.950\nTemporal access control says,\nwe have normal business hours,\n\n00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:30.520\ntheoretically, we're not a 24 by 7,\n365 company.\n\n00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.650\nSo normally, people are working from,\n\n00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:36.770\nlet's say 7:30 in the morning if they get\nin a little early and maybe they work\n\n00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.510\nuntil 7 o'clock at night and\nthrough if they stay a little late, right?\n\n00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.570\nNormal nine to five kind of business 8:30\nto 4:30 but we give a little window on\n\n00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.500\neither side because we know people\nsometimes do show up early,\n\n00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.290\nwe know sometimes people work late, and so\n\n00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.900\nwe give them a window we\nsay seven to seven, right?\n\n00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.750\nA 12 hour window, we're gonna implement\nan access control system that effectively\n\n00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:59.260\nallows access to the file and\nprint systems and all the internal data\n\n00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.990\nsystems starting at 7 AM but\nthen cuts off at 7 PM every night.\n\n00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:06.430\nAnd as a result of that,\nif you're working after 7 PM,\n\n00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.290\nyou're not gonna be able to\ngain access to the system.\n\n00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:10.250\nIf you are remote and\n\n00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:13.750\ntrying to get in after 7 pm,\nyou're not gonna be able to gain access.\n\n00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.780\nTemporal systems allow us to do this, but\n\n00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:18.810\nthey also allow us to create\nexceptions because somebody may say,\n\n00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:23.460\nI need to work later than 7, I've got\na presentation or whatever I have to do or\n\n00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.170\nit's a month end and I've got to\nclose the books or whatever it is.\n\n00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.190\nAnd I've got to work 'til,\nI don't know, 10 o'clock or\n\n00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.960\nwhatever it is, those two days.\n\n00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.820\nSo the administrator of the system\ncan go in an override that and\n\n00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.750\ncreate an exception rule and\nsay, all right, so, for Mike,\n\n00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:38.200\nsince Mike's gotten here to\nwork late the next two nights.\n\n00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.900\nWe're gonna create an exception for\nhis user account and for\n\n00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.370\nhim, he can stay logged\nin until 10 o'clock.\n\n00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.670\nBut everybody else gets kicked off\nat 7:00 PM that kind of thing.\n\n00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.580\nSo we wanna make sure we do this,\nwe wanna make sure we know how to do this\n\n00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.200\nwith systems like this and\nthat's gonna be important.\n\n00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.150\nSo something like a temporal\naccess control system will give us\n\n00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:55.976\nthat flexibility,\n\n00:17:55.976 --> 00:17:59.834\nwe'll talk more about different access\ncontrol mechanisms a little bit later.\n\n00:17:59.834 --> 00:18:03.460\nWe wanna have a sense of the reasons why\nthese kinds of systems may be important,\n\n00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.126\nthe same idea with the mandatory\naccess control, right?\n\n00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:10.297\nIf we use a max system, it's because\nwe wanna be able to label and classify\n\n00:18:10.297 --> 00:18:14.821\ndata and label and classify users and\nthen the two have to effectively match up.\n\n00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:19.128\nIf a user is not cleared to see top secret\ndata, it shouldn't be able to see it.\n\n00:18:19.128 --> 00:18:23.215\nAnd the mandatory access control system\nallows us to figure that out and automate\n\n00:18:23.215 --> 00:18:27.610\nthat process by classifying and labeling\nboth data and users or subjects and\n\n00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.990\nobjects and then controlling and\nmonitoring the interaction between them.\n\n00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.500\nAnd enforcing that interaction through\nthe labeling or classification system,\n\n00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.600\nthat's what a mandatory\naccess control system does.\n\n00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.211\nSo when we think about identifying users,\nright,\n\n00:18:40.211 --> 00:18:42.124\nwe really have to think\nabout who the user is.\n\n00:18:42.124 --> 00:18:46.310\nWe talked about uniqueness\nwith the idea of the,\n\n00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.924\n[COUGH]\n>> Token.\n\n00:18:46.924 --> 00:18:48.600\n>> Thank you.\n\n00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.641\nThe idea of the token and we talked about\nthe fact that a user when they are unique,\n\n00:18:51.641 --> 00:18:55.594\nwill have attributes associated with them,\nthey're permissions, they're rights,\n\n00:18:55.594 --> 00:18:58.590\nthey're privileges,\nas well as their user identity.\n\n00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.510\nSo users have to be identified, we have\nto be able to figure out a way to be able\n\n00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:05.720\nto do that and then we have to secure\nthe issue that credential to the user.\n\n00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.850\nSecure the issue could mean simply\nstoring the user credential\n\n00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:12.710\ninside of the LDAP directory, it could\nmean issuing them one or more certificates\n\n00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:16.994\nthat validate their identity, it could be\ngiving them a private key is part of that\n\n00:19:16.994 --> 00:19:20.780\ntypically again, issued through some sort\nof a certificate or bound of the user.\n\n00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:23.360\nWe often talk about assigning the key or\n\n00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.320\nbinding the key to the user by\nmapping it within the directory.\n\n00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.630\nSo there's different ways\nof doing those things,\n\n00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:30.540\nwe have to have some sort of\nsecure provisioning process.\n\n00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.670\nThis is also gonna be very important.\n\n00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.300\nSo when we think about identity management\nwe think about all these things\n\n00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.190\ncoming together.\n\n00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.700\nWe're thinking about\nmanaging user identity.\n\n00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.970\nWe're thinking about managing user\nauthentication, user authorization.\n\n00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.930\nWe have to have things\nlike password management.\n\n00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.600\nWe have to have account management.\n\n00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.600\nWe have to have profile management.\n\n00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.720\nWe have to have directory management,\nas we said.\n\n00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.370\nWe have to figure out single sign on and\nimplement that.\n\n00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.803\nAll these moving parts, in other words,\nhave to be brought together.\n\n00:19:53.803 --> 00:19:57.378\nWe wanna be thinking about all these\nthings because password management, so\n\n00:19:57.378 --> 00:19:58.918\nI was talking about a minute ago,\n\n00:19:58.918 --> 00:20:01.948\nwhere a user may not follow all of\nthe requirements of a password.\n\n00:20:01.948 --> 00:20:05.721\nIt has to be complex,\nit should be changed every 30 days or\n\n00:20:05.721 --> 00:20:10.230\nwhatever you decide, it should not\nbe able to be used or reused for so\n\n00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.530\nmany cycles, maybe 15 times before\nyou can reuse the password.\n\n00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:15.800\nI love doing that to users, by the way,\n\n00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.760\nto my users because most\npeople are just lazy.\n\n00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.290\nI mean, that's just how people are.\n\n00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:23.250\nSo they're gonna want to reuse that same\npassword cuz it's the one thing they've\n\n00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:27.120\nmanaged to remember, and it's hard to\nremember more than one thing, I get that.\n\n00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.870\nSo reality is,\nthey're just gonna want to reuse it.\n\n00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:35.500\nSo I'd set that bar at like\n99 reuse attempts, so that,\n\n00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:40.750\nwhat people'll do, they'll sit there and\nthey say okay, password, hit it, no good.\n\n00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.575\nPassword again, so\nthey'll figure it's like four or five so\n\n00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:43.475\nI'll just keep trying and\n\n00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:48.220\neventually, okay, now I've gone through\nthe cycle, I'll get my password back.\n\n00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:48.842\nWrong, right?\n\n00:20:48.842 --> 00:20:53.562\nYou never wanna have me, as your\nsecurity admin or, overlord of security,\n\n00:20:53.562 --> 00:20:55.272\nas I tend to call myself, right?\n\n00:20:55.272 --> 00:20:58.520\nBecause if that's the case,\nI'm gonna set that bar so high,\n\n00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.210\nyou're gonna sit there for two hours.\n\n00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:05.200\nNow granted, if you're that dedicated,\nI'm gonna let you reuse that password, but\n\n00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.210\nI'm gonna now make you make it so\ncomplex that you're gonna have to type\n\n00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:12.320\nout 255 characters to get your password,\ncuz I don't mess around.\n\n00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.140\nI mean,\nmy job as the CISSP is to make sure you,\n\n00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.730\nas individual users in my system,\ndon't make me look bad, right?\n\n00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:21.530\nI mean, let's think about it.\n\n00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:24.700\nIf you get up to no good,\nif you violate the policies,\n\n00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.260\nif you do stupid things, then I'm\nthe one who's in trouble, I'm at fault.\n\n00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.990\nWe're not gonna blame you, we're gonna\nblame the person who should have known\n\n00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:33.200\nbetter and\nimplemented a policy to stop you.\n\n00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.458\nSo the reality is that as a CISSP,\nit's your job to make sure that you\n\n00:21:37.458 --> 00:21:41.815\ndefend users from themselves as\nmuch as defending everything else.\n\n00:21:41.815 --> 00:21:44.495\nThat's outside of\nthe security perimeter and\n\n00:21:44.495 --> 00:21:46.975\nnot allowing any of that to get in, right?\n\n00:21:46.975 --> 00:21:50.950\nBecause the ultimate goal, is not just to\nmake sure bad actors don't get in, but\n\n00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.107\nthat the people inside the perimeter\ndon't do stupid things and\n\n00:21:54.107 --> 00:21:57.556\nas a result of that make problems that\nthen allow the bad actors to get in\n\n00:21:57.556 --> 00:21:59.150\nbecause something goes wrong.\n\n00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:02.799\nSo it's as much about internal maintenance\nas it is about external vigilance,\n\n00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:04.167\nwhen we talk about security.\n\n00:22:04.167 --> 00:22:06.700\nIt's very,\nvery important to think about both.\n\n00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:09.690\nSo password management is one of those\nareas where we can have a very big impact,\n\n00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:12.570\nbecause you can create\npolicies that mandate, right?\n\n00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.300\nThat users have to create\ncomplex passwords,\n\n00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.940\nthey have to change them every 30 days.\n\n00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.940\nThey can't reuse them except if\nthey've already used other passwords\n\n00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.240\n15 or 20 times.\n\n00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:26.170\nThose kinda things are important,\npassword management deals with all this.\n\n00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:27.520\nWe have password management systems,\n\n00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.640\nwe can automate this whole process,\nwanna be thinking about that.\n\n00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:34.700\nAccount management, allows us to provision\nusers, create them automatically,\n\n00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.320\nyou maybe even use a template\nthat pre-populates certain\n\n00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.160\ninformation for them.\n\n00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:42.130\nAnd then can assign permissions\nto them based on role delegation,\n\n00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.470\nbased on group membership generically,\nis more often than not what we do.\n\n00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.650\nAgain, automation can be a good thing,\nright?\n\n00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.340\nWe don't have to manually handcraft every\nuser account that's created in the system.\n\n00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:55.150\nBut we do have to have a record of what\nusers are doing, where they were created,\n\n00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:55.770\nwhen, and why.\n\n00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.320\nAnd what permissions they\nare gonna be granted as a result,\n\n00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.310\nthis is gonna be important.\n\n00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.000\nSo account management typically\nis gonna have some sort of\n\n00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.470\nworkflow associated with it.\n\n00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:07.320\nIt's gonna be an automated system, it's\ngonna have provisioning capabilities so\n\n00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.760\nyou can create templates and\nthings like that.\n\n00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.990\nAnd so you may have a standard\ntemplate for normal user,\n\n00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.820\nyou may have a template for a management\nlevel user, you may have a template for\n\n00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.990\na remote user that needs special\npermissions assigned to them,\n\n00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:21.910\nthat can come in remotely cuz\nthey're not gonna be in the office.\n\n00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.940\nThese are different things you can\nthink about and ultimately you can do.\n\n00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:27.520\nWe need to have a central repository,\nwe've talked about this, the directory\n\n00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.330\nservice, the LDAP directory where\nwe're gonna store these user accounts.\n\n00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.550\nSo we have some sort of central\nrepository where everything will be and\n\n00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:35.610\nwe have user profiles.\n\n00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.700\nWe have to think about\nthe profile that's created.\n\n00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.570\nThe token represents the sum\ntotal of user access, but\n\n00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.495\nit doesn't represent\nthe whole user profile.\n\n00:23:42.495 --> 00:23:46.725\nThe profile is more than that, it's the\npermissions but it's also the settings.\n\n00:23:46.725 --> 00:23:47.930\nIt's all the data\nassociated with the user.\n\n00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:51.350\nIt's all that stuff,\nthe email address, the home address,\n\n00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.655\nthe date of birth potentially.\n\n00:23:52.655 --> 00:23:56.503\nThese all may be unique identifier\nfields in the user Profile\n\n00:23:56.503 --> 00:23:58.998\nthat is created inside the directory.\n\n00:23:58.998 --> 00:24:02.430\nA lot of times we'll have\nenlarged organizations.\n\n00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:05.720\nYou will have a level or\nan area there where you can say,\n\n00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.150\nokay the management person or the person\nwho reports on this team is this and\n\n00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:11.860\nyou can actually set up\nsome of that hierarchy.\n\n00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.960\nYou'll have room for the address so where\nthey work, what division, what department,\n\n00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.890\nthings like that because then we\ncan use what we call attributes.\n\n00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.180\nThese are all attributes.\n\n00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.530\nWe can use attributes like these to\ndo attribute based authentication or\n\n00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:28.560\nattribute based access control, where we\ncan say a user logs in, they authenticate.\n\n00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.420\nThey don't just provide a user name and\na password, they may have to\n\n00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:35.710\nprovide several additional attributes that\nare known only to the user in theory.\n\n00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:36.800\nSo who their boss is.\n\n00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.483\nTheir direct report, who or\nwhat division they work in and\n\n00:24:40.483 --> 00:24:45.159\nperhaps what uniques employee\nidentification, employee ID they have.\n\n00:24:45.159 --> 00:24:48.394\nSo on a log on stream that uses\napps based authentication and\n\n00:24:48.394 --> 00:24:50.929\nattribute based access control mechanisms.\n\n00:24:50.929 --> 00:24:54.971\nYou have a log on four, right, not just\nusername and password, but you're gonna\n\n00:24:54.971 --> 00:24:58.779\nhave three or four fields that ask for\na variety of different attributes, and\n\n00:24:58.779 --> 00:25:02.880\nas a result to that, by providing that\nwhole effectively profile of information,\n\n00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.515\nwe're then gonna be able to\nauthenticate the user based on that.\n\n00:25:06.515 --> 00:25:09.130\nYou may have seen this in\na slightly different form,\n\n00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.410\nwhere you have security questions, right,\nif you have to reset your password or\n\n00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:15.800\nsomething like that, or\nyou call up a vendor or call up a company,\n\n00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.180\ncredit card companies for\ninstance will do this.\n\n00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.890\nIf you need to get into the account but\nyou don't know your PIN or\n\n00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:24.170\nyour password, they'll ask you\nsecurity questions to reset it.\n\n00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:26.400\nSo, where'd you go to school,\n\n00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.150\nwhat was your favorite color, what comic\nbook did you read in the fourth grade.\n\n00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:31.566\nAll that stupid stuff you have to answer,\nright.\n\n00:25:31.566 --> 00:25:33.780\nAnd I struggle with this myself, right.\n\n00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.150\nSo I put that stuff in,\nthinking all right, I'm smart.\n\n00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.260\nI'm gonna remember, right?\n\n00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:38.150\nWhere did I go to school?\n\n00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:39.270\nWell, how could I forget that?\n\n00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:40.590\nI don't know what happens.\n\n00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:43.270\nIt's like somebody comes along,\nwipes my memory when I'm on the phone with\n\n00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:47.000\nthese people, because I sit there, or\nI'm on the website trying to do it.\n\n00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.550\nAnd no matter what I put in,\nit's just never right.\n\n00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:50.570\nAnd I've got news for you.\n\n00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.422\nI know when my favorite in the world.\n\n00:25:52.422 --> 00:25:54.381\nIt doesn't change, right?\n\n00:25:54.381 --> 00:25:55.110\nSo I'm right.\n\n00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.100\nI know I'm right.\n\n00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.340\nThe stupid system is wrong, right.\n\n00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:02.170\nHow many ways can you possibly tell me\nit's not the answer that I'm giving you\n\n00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:03.100\nand it can't be right?\n\n00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:08.190\nThe only thing I'm thinking of honestly\nand I think this is why it happens is, and\n\n00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.480\nthis is bad design on the part of\nthe vendor and the implementation,\n\n00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.250\nbecause I know for a fact all kidding\naside, I've done this recently and\n\n00:26:15.250 --> 00:26:19.350\ntwo of the answers I gave specifically\nto these questions were 100% accurate.\n\n00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.670\nBecause I actually went through this with\nthem when I got on the phone because\n\n00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:22.200\nI was so enraged.\n\n00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.900\nAnd I said you got to be kidding me.\n\n00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.110\nHow can I not know the answer\nto these two questions?\n\n00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:26.970\nIt's this.\n\n00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:29.350\nAnd the woman said let me check and\nabsolutely it is but\n\n00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:30.440\nyour system wouldn't take it.\n\n00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.640\nSo what's the problem?\n\n00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.590\nThe only thing I can think of is that\nactually they are case sensitive.\n\n00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.900\n>> Right.\n>> But they're not telling you\n\n00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:37.310\nthat they're case sensitive.\n\n00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.950\nSo you know if you don't realize that\nyou type it in a certain way and\n\n00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:45.500\nthen all of a sudden they're like,\nwell, yeah, but the P in the middle of\n\n00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.670\nthat wasn't in Cyrillic, and you didn't\ntype it in uppercase, or in kenji or\n\n00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.680\nsomething, so no, we can't let you in.\n\n00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.750\nThat's just dumb.\n\n00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:53.990\nIt's bad implementation.\n\n00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:55.650\nBad architecture, bad design.\n\n00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.850\nWhat you should do in that system is\nput a big sign on the front that tells\n\n00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:03.710\nusers hey, by the way, your information\nthat you provided Is case sensitive.\n\n00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.440\nSo hey, pay attention.\n\n00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.300\nPut it in the right way.\n\n00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.290\nBecause I'm sitting there\nhacking away at the keyboard.\n\n00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:09.800\nIt's got to be this.\n\n00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:09.590\nIt's got to be this.\n\n00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.440\nIt's got to be this.\n\n00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.620\nIt's not this.\n\n00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:15.370\nSo there is potentially liability for\nyou to implement a system and\n\n00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.930\nnot get it right,\neven though the intention is there.\n\n00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.620\nSo, really, real world scenario,\nreal important thing for\n\n00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.850\nyou to think about as CISSPs.\n\n00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:26.140\nWe often talk a lot about design and\nhow important design is.\n\n00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.640\nWe don't spend a lot of time really\nharping on the idea that good design\n\n00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.310\nequals good security, right.\n\n00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:35.100\nBecause the system itself is secure,\nthe problem is it's so frustrating for\n\n00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:38.880\nusers to use that they are gonna\ntry to find a way around it.\n\n00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.400\nI'm so frustrated with that system,\nwith that vendor, that I really,\n\n00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.460\nlegitimately, am thinking about not\ndoing business with them anymore,\n\n00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:49.100\nnot because they did anything wrong,\nbut because their system is so\n\n00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.380\nscrewed up that I can't\nuse it the right way.\n\n00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.110\nIt's not convenient for me.\n\n00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:55.110\nThat is a significant challenge.\n\n00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.994\nAnd that is something that\nus security professionals,\n\n00:27:56.994 --> 00:27:59.490\nwe really have to think about as\npart of this whole discussion.\n\n00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:03.910\nIf access control becomes so tedious for\nour end users, that they can't use it\n\n00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:08.370\nwell, they're going to go out of there way\nto break the system and make it not work.\n\n00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.970\nAnd if they do that then the problem\nbecomes, we've effectively\n\n00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.190\nwound up at the same place we were\ntrying to avoid being by generating and\n\n00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:16.760\ncreating the system in the first place.\n\n00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:20.670\nThey're gonna expose information because\nthey're not doing the right things.\n\n00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:21.700\nNegative outcome, right.\n\n00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.480\nSo want to make sure we're aware of that,\nwe're thinking about that,\n\n00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.690\nwe understand that.\n\n00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:28.860\nI know I mentioned a couple of times in\nprevious episodes that the LDAP directory\n\n00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.590\nstandard is the x.500 standard, but I want\nto make sure you make that connection\n\n00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:36.210\nagain here, obviously specifically\nin this domain, very relevant,\n\n00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.230\nvery important information\nto deliver to you.\n\n00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:42.500\nHere, we talk about x.500 being\nthe international standard for\n\n00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.565\ndirectory services.\n\n00:28:43.565 --> 00:28:47.435\nX.400 is the international standard for\nelectronic messaging.\n\n00:28:47.435 --> 00:28:51.575\nSo email systems use x.400\nstandard conventions.\n\n00:28:51.575 --> 00:28:55.314\nDirectory service systems use\nx.500 directory service standards,\n\n00:28:55.314 --> 00:28:56.585\nplease be aware of that.\n\n00:28:56.585 --> 00:29:00.872\nThere actually is an ISO standard for\nx.500,\n\n00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:07.819\n9594-1: 2014 meaning it's 2014\nyear update for the standard.\n\n00:29:07.819 --> 00:29:11.694\nBut ISO 9594-1 is actually the update for\nthe x.500 standard for\n\n00:29:11.694 --> 00:29:14.320\ndirectory services in\ncase you're interested.\n\n00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.200\nDon't need to know that,\n\n00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.920\nby the way, just to be clear,\nnot exam critical information.\n\n00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.660\nReally just more for your own benefit.\n\n00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.535\nAnd then we talked a lot about LDAP\ngenerically it's the protocol.\n\n00:29:23.535 --> 00:29:26.770\nLightweight Directory Access Protocol that\nis used to derive directory services,\n\n00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:29.720\nso just keep that in mind be aware\nof that obviously important for\n\n00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.580\nyou to think about.\n\n00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.980\nWhen we think about LDAPs specifically and\nI'm gonna put Mike on the spot again but\n\n00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.530\nI'm gonna give him a chance this time\nI'm gonna ask him to pay attention to me\n\n00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:41.790\nI'm also gonna give him a preview\nof what I'm about to ask him.\n\n00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:45.640\nMike's ears just perked up and\nhis eyes just lit up when I said that.\n\n00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:48.800\nSo LDAP, let's talk about LDAP for\njust a second, right.\n\n00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.300\nSo we know LDAP is a protocol that's\nused for directory services, and\n\n00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.270\nwe know that when we implement it in\nthe active directory, for instance,\n\n00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.770\nin Windows,\nthat it gives us certain capabilities.\n\n00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:00.200\nDo you know what the actual common\nattributes that we often talk about for\n\n00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.320\nLDAP are?\n\n00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.540\n>> The common attributes?\n\n00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.300\n>> Common attributes.\n\n00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.580\nNow, that's probably not the best way,\nit may not be the best and\n\n00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.410\neasiest way to ask that question,\ncuz that's not real clear.\n\n00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.270\nRight, what we're really talking about\nthough and if I explain it this way,\n\n00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.300\nI think Mike will definitely\nmake the connection and get it.\n\n00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:18.530\nWhat we're really talking about is\nwhat are the components that make up\n\n00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:22.890\nnaming convention for an object within\nLDAP, within the active directory.\n\n00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.470\n>> Our distinguished name.\n\n00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:27.750\n>> Right so we have distinguished name,\nwe have a common name right, so\n\n00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.310\ndistinguished name and common name right?\n\n00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:32.630\nWe have the domain component, so we have\nthe distinguished name, common name, and\n\n00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:33.660\ndomain component.\n\n00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:38.480\nAnd we have the container, which is\nthe O.U. Organizational Unit, right.\n\n00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:43.900\nSo in LDAP, we have a very specific,\nvery prescribed way of creating an object.\n\n00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:47.425\nAn object is going to be the user\nobject or the computer object.\n\n00:30:47.425 --> 00:30:49.855\nI know we say objects are data here,\nI get that.\n\n00:30:49.855 --> 00:30:54.285\nBut in the language of LDAPs specifically,\nwe talk about it being a user object,\n\n00:30:54.285 --> 00:30:56.235\neven though it really is the subject,\njust so\n\n00:30:56.235 --> 00:30:58.420\nyou understand that and\nwe confuse you totally.\n\n00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.995\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Notice we spend all this time building\n\n00:30:59.995 --> 00:31:03.570\nthat knowledge the right way Throw\nthat out, and we'll reset everything.\n\n00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:07.640\nSo when we create the user object in LDAP,\nwe actually have four distinct component\n\n00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:12.370\nparts that have to be provided or somehow\nprogrammed in to the creation strength.\n\n00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:15.900\nWe need the distinguished name,\nthe common name, the domain component,\n\n00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.870\nwhich is effectively the domain name,\nthe name space, and\n\n00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:21.770\nthe O.U., which is the container\nwithin the directory service\n\n00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:24.700\nthat that object is\nactually gonna exist in.\n\n00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.620\nSo I want to make sure we understand.\n\n00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:26.940\n>> Always love typing those out.\n\n00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.800\n>> Yeah those are just ever so much fun.\n\n00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.970\nThat's why you need ultimately,\nneed insurance.\n\n00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:31.648\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Alright.\n\n00:31:31.648 --> 00:31:32.441\nI keep talking about this with Mike.\n\n00:31:32.441 --> 00:31:36.225\nWe need some minions right, or\ninterns, because that's what they do.\n\n00:31:36.225 --> 00:31:37.670\nThat's exactly what you do.\n\n00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:40.140\nIf you do something\nrepetitively 10,000 times,\n\n00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.900\nyou deserve to be able to\nput that on your resume.\n\n00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.790\nThat's my particular take on things.\n\n00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.520\nSo that's why we need those kind\nof people floating around and\n\n00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.480\ndoing that kind of stuff.\n\n00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.850\nIt's very, very important.\n\n00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:52.140\nAll right, so we talked about a whole\nbunch of stuff that's obviously gonna\n\n00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:55.850\ncontinue furthering our understanding\nour ability to understand\n\n00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:57.450\nall the information about IM.\n\n00:31:57.450 --> 00:31:58.680\nWe do have some more to come so\n\n00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:01.330\nwe are gonna come back and\ncontinue our conversations.\n\n00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:04.150\nBut until we do that just keep in mind and\njust remember,\n\n00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:07.220\nas we've already talked about, the\nimportance of this domain overall, right.\n\n00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.640\nThe importance of the ability to manage\nidentity, to understand access and\n\n00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.650\nreally control it.\n\n00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:15.460\nIt's the ability to understand how to\nprovide both confidentiality integrity,\n\n00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.510\nas well as availability of protection.\n\n00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:21.290\nReally focuses on all three pillars\nof the information security model.\n\n00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:24.500\n>> Very good Adam, and then again a lot\nof great information about managing\n\n00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.780\nidentities and as you said,\nwe've got more to come.\n\n00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:30.450\nSo don't go far, cuz we're gonna get\nback to that in just a few minutes.\n\n00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:34.420\nBut for now, remember if you guys wanna\nattend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:38.400\nshoot us an email here\nat SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.960\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.515\n>> I'm Ed Curbrose, base password ticket.\n\n00:32:42.515 --> 00:32:44.245\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n00:32:44.245 --> 00:32:45.780\n>> Take care.\n\nNOTE end of file",

--> 00:00:17.490\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.870\nToday we're doing our CISSP content and\nspecifically we're going to be\n\n5\n00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.470\ncontinuing our conversation in\nmanaging authentication, right?\n\n6\n00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.850\nWe've said it a couple times.\n\n7\n00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.610\nA lot of moving parts and\na lot of different options and\n\n8\n00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.140\na lot of different places authentication\noccurs, unless they take place, occurs.\n\n9\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.100\nYou know, some of the ones that,\n\n10\n00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.860\nthat we don't think about because\nit could be automated might\n\n11\n00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.540\nbe something that we really don't see or,\nor interact with directly.\n\n12\n00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.708\nSo, lot of things to consider and\nhere to help us with all of that is Mr.\n\n13\n00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:46.480\nAdam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.777\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n15\n00:00:47.777 --> 00:00:48.740\n>> Im good, Im good.\n\n16\n00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.380\nFeeling very Kerberized today.\n\n17\n00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.400\nHopefully, we'll be able to decipher\nwhat that means here in just a moment.\n\n18\n00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.020\nSo we're going to jump into\nmy talking about Kerberos and\n\n19\n00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.710\nthe idea of Kerberos specifically through\ngross identity and access management.\n\n20\n00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.490\nIt's the idea of using the system and\n\n21\n00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.440\nKerberos is actually often\nmisunderstood and misrepresented.\n\n22\n00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.910\nPeople think it's a Windows thing.\n\n23\n00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.080\nAnd it is a Windows thing.\n\n24\n00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.250\nBut it's not just a Windows' thing.\n\n25\n00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.910\nKerberos actually comes to us from outside\nof the wonderful world of Microsoft.\n\n26\n00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.880\nMicrosoft adopted the concept of\nKerberos and implemented a customized,\n\n27\n00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.350\nproprietary version of it for\ntheir particular solution.\n\n28\n00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.974\nBut it actually originally comes to us\nout of MIT under the project code name or\n\n29\n00:01:24.974 --> 00:01:28.991\nproject code name of Project Athena, which\nis where MIT was originally conceived and\n\n30\n00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:29.890\ninvented.\n\n31\n00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.700\nSo it's a generic idea of authentication\nand access control management.\n\n32\n00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.530\nWe're gonna take that and actually\nuse it in our discussion to explain\n\n33\n00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.580\ngenerically how Kerberos is gonna work or\nhow it is applied.\n\n34\n00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.740\nThe idea is that it's basically based on\nthe interaction between three systems.\n\n35\n00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.100\nIt provides for authentication, for\nauthorization, and for auditing.\n\n36\n00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.030\nWe've talked about all those elements\nof the access control solution, and\n\n37\n00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.690\nwe have a requesting system\nthat's typically gonna be\n\n38\n00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.280\na client on an endpoint system\nsomewhere requesting something.\n\n39\n00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.040\nWe're gonna show you a diagram in\njust a minute to take a look at this.\n\n40\n00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.080\nWe have an endpoint destination server.\n\n41\n00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.660\nThat's gonna be ultimately where we\nwanna be able to go and use a service or\n\n42\n00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.873\nconsume a service from,\n\n43\n00:02:08.873 --> 00:02:12.710\nand Kerber is gonna help us figure out\nthat whole interaction, how we do that.\n\n44\n00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.855\nAnd we have what's known as Kerberos or\n\n45\n00:02:14.855 --> 00:02:18.960\nKey Distribution Center commonly\ncalled KDCs, generically in Windows.\n\n46\n00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.390\nIn Microsoft we refer to\nthem as domain controllers.\n\n47\n00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.360\nThe domain controller has the role\nof the KDC in other words.\n\n48\n00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.240\nBut these are the three moving parts\nof components that we're gonna\n\n49\n00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.190\nuse to talk about.\n\n50\n00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.665\nSo let's take a look at that\npretty Kerberos footage shall we?\n\n51\n00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:32.540\n>> [LAUGH] Nice.\n\n52\n00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.930\n>> All right, so you can see up\nthere that we have a diagram.\n\n53\n00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.540\nMike was kind enough to help me put this\ntogether, and remember, all our credits,\n\n54\n00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.740\ngood, bad, or indifferent, go to Mr. Mike.\n\n55\n00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.890\nSo, he put together a little diagram for\nus, and it's very basic.\n\n56\n00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.150\nIt's gonna just help us to have\na sense of the interaction.\n\n57\n00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.500\nMike's just gonna kinda point\nto some things as we're talking,\n\n58\n00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.140\nand show us the flow of\nthe path between one system and\n\n59\n00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.830\nanother to indicate we're doing something.\n\n60\n00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.820\nSo it's very, very basic.\n\n61\n00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.800\nSo we start with a client at\nthe upper right-hand corner.\n\n62\n00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.950\nThat's gonna be the end point that\nobviously is going to initialize\n\n63\n00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.480\na request for a service or\na solution that a user may need.\n\n64\n00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.600\nSo when we're looking at the client up\nthere, the client is gonna go ahead and\n\n65\n00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.150\nrequest authentication.\n\n66\n00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.540\nAnd so the client's gonna effectively\nsend over some information\n\n67\n00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.250\nto the authentication server,\n\n68\n00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.760\nwe see that at the upper left hand\ncorner of our little diagram there.\n\n69\n00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.270\nThe authentication server is gonna\nbe the domain controller to Windows,\n\n70\n00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.490\nit is the KDC functionality\nthat we talked about.\n\n71\n00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.720\nThat authentication server, and\nthe ticket granting server down below it,\n\n72\n00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.860\nare actually gonna be one in\nthe same machine traditionally.\n\n73\n00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.810\nIn other words, those systems\noften are just gonna be inhabiting\n\n74\n00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.480\na generic role known as the KDC and\n\n75\n00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.260\neach domain controller in a Windows\nimplementation is a KDC, and\n\n76\n00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.200\nhas the ability to issue and to deal with\nboth authentication related server items,\n\n77\n00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.810\nbut then also to effectively give out\ntickets to do ticket granting services.\n\n78\n00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.350\nAnd so we often will see\nthose collapsed together.\n\n79\n00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.220\nWe broke them out for you just to\nbe able to differentiate between\n\n80\n00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.790\nthe specific steps that we're gonna\ngo through but the reality is\n\n81\n00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.860\nthat it's probably just one machine\nthat's taking on both activities and\n\n82\n00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.230\ntypically inhabits both roles just so\nyou know.\n\n83\n00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.230\nSo when we're talking about the client\nrequesting authentication, the client's\n\n84\n00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.870\ngonna send some information over and\nit's gonna present its credentials, right?\n\n85\n00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.670\nThe authentication server is gonna take\na look at those, sends back a ticket and\n\n86\n00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:19.705\na session key.\n\n87\n00:04:19.705 --> 00:04:21.140\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n88\n00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.830\nIt sends back a ticket and\na session key to the client.\n\n89\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.580\nLet's talk about that ticket, let's talk\nabout that session key for just a second.\n\n90\n00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.580\nSo, a session key is gonna be a single use\nkey that is effectively going to allow\n\n91\n00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.310\nthe client and the server to communicate\nsecurely for the duration of the exchange\n\n92\n00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.250\nof the information required to complete\nthe ticketing process, if you will.\n\n93\n00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.490\nKerberos is a technology\nthat's based on tickets.\n\n94\n00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.480\nSo we're going to have a couple\nof different kinds of tickets.\n\n95\n00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.210\nWe're going to have\na Ticket Granting Ticket,\n\n96\n00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.420\nwhat's called TGT,\nwhich is like a master ticket.\n\n97\n00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.270\nIt's like a ticket that is\ngonna be reused over and\n\n98\n00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.150\nover again if you think of it that way.\n\n99\n00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.760\nAnd it's gonna allow us to effectively\nrequest what are known as session tickets,\n\n100\n00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.460\nor STs generically.\n\n101\n00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.550\nAnd session tickets or service tickets,\nyou hear them referred to differently\n\n102\n00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.030\ndepending on whose documentation you read,\nbut generically an ST is gonna be a ticket\n\n103\n00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.360\nthat allows a user, an end user on\na client, to effectively request and\n\n104\n00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.970\nthen ultimately access and\nconsume one or more services.\n\n105\n00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.490\nAnd so the ideas that the master ticket\nthe TGT the Ticket Granting Ticket\n\n106\n00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.180\nis gonna be used to be able to\nrequest additional single use tickets.\n\n107\n00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.440\nAnd those single use tickets are gonna\nbe traded in and effectively used to\n\n108\n00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.730\nauthenticate and validate access for\none or more services or\n\n109\n00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.425\nto establish a communication session,\nor things like that.\n\n110\n00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:44.340\nSo, I don't know if any of you have\na point of reference for this,\n\n111\n00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.730\nbut if you are of a certain age,\n\n112\n00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.450\nright, in the world today,\nyou will remember that in Disneyworld and\n\n113\n00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.070\nDisneyland, back when I was growing up,\nas a kid, we had this.\n\n114\n00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.140\nI'm old enough to remember that\nwhen you went to Disneyworld,\n\n115\n00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.940\nalthough it still cost a ridiculously\nlarge amount of money,\n\n116\n00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.740\neven back then, it was not the same place,\nand it didn't operate the same way.\n\n117\n00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.890\nYou didn't have, as we talked about\nearlier, biometric thumbprint,\n\n118\n00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.060\nmagic bands, crazy access stuff.\n\n119\n00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.760\nThis was old school, right?\n\n120\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.845\nSo what we had,\nthey had things called human beings.\n\n121\n00:06:19.845 --> 00:06:22.308\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Mythical creatures that you find in\n\n122\n00:06:22.308 --> 00:06:25.370\nDisneyworld and Disneyland,\nand they actually stood at\n\n123\n00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.740\nthings called turn stiles, which are also\nmythical creatures that no longer exist.\n\n124\n00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.160\nCuz they've taken all those out,\nyou now walk through but they have\n\n125\n00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.100\nthe biometrics stuff and they have the\nlittle guards there that scan everything.\n\n126\n00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.330\nThey're actually, by the way they're\ntalking about putting in metal detectors\n\n127\n00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.680\nnow, believe it or not, because of all\nthe things that have been going on.\n\n128\n00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.180\nThey've made a big announcement\nlast couple of days.\n\n129\n00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.840\nThey're gonna put metal detectors in,\nboth there and at Universal Studios and\n\n130\n00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.460\nall the big parks.\n\n131\n00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.630\nThey're gonna be doing that.\n\n132\n00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.720\nAnd they're gonna be changing,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n133\n00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.010\nsome of the things that you\nactually can do in the park.\n\n134\n00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.190\nThey're not gonna let people in with\ncostumes, depending on what's going on,\n\n135\n00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.230\ncertain days, things like that.\n\n136\n00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.330\nYou may not be able to walk around\ndressed up and they're gonna, I believe,\n\n137\n00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.300\nfrom what I understood as well,\nthey're gonna stop selling toy guys.\n\n138\n00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.030\n>> Really? Wow. >> Which when you think\nabout is like the whole reason to go on\n\n139\n00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.350\nPirates of the Caribbean\nin the first place.\n\n140\n00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.000\n>> Absolutely.\nI want my rubber band gun.\n\n141\n00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.730\n>> Exactly, right?\n\n142\n00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.210\n>> Can't have that.\n>> And Swiss Family Robinson,\n\n143\n00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.935\nI mean like what's going on right?\n\n144\n00:07:13.935 --> 00:07:15.500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So anyway,\n\n145\n00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.860\nmy point with Disneyworld is not that.\n\n146\n00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.980\nMy point with the story is the following,\ncame back to why we're here.\n\n147\n00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:20.810\nTalking about Kerberos.\n\n148\n00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.230\nSo tickets, right, so\nyears ago when you went to Disneyworld or\n\n149\n00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.020\nDisneyland, you actually had to buy\nbooks of tickets to ride on rides.\n\n150\n00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.370\nYou didn't just go on and\nstand in line the way you do today,\n\n151\n00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.310\nyou paid an entrance fee, but then you\nalso had to buy additional tickets.\n\n152\n00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.480\nWalt was a smart guy, I'm telling you.\n\n153\n00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.370\nRight?\n\n154\n00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.730\nSo you had to go to these little kiosks,\nthey were in the middle of the park,\n\n155\n00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.300\nthey were scattered all over.\n\n156\n00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.970\nAnd you would actually go up and\nyou would buy ticket books.\n\n157\n00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:46.220\nAnd you would get a book of tickets.\n\n158\n00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.105\nYou'd rip out the tickets, and\nyou'd hand them a certain ticket or\n\n159\n00:07:50.105 --> 00:07:54.058\na certain kind of ticket to ride on\nSpace Mountain, or to ride on the,\n\n160\n00:07:54.058 --> 00:07:58.287\nremember they had people who were back\nthen Remember they have the skyways\n\n161\n00:07:58.287 --> 00:08:02.242\ntram in Disney World in Orlando that\nwent from the Swiss chalet over in\n\n162\n00:08:02.242 --> 00:08:05.820\nwherever It's a Small World is,\nwent over to Tomorrowland.\n\n163\n00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.410\nSo you can actually jump on it,\nget from one end of the park to the other.\n\n164\n00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:10.840\nIt was like the skyway,\nwith the cars hanging off it.\n\n165\n00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.340\nThe whole thing,\nwhatever they called that.\n\n166\n00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:13.380\nWas really cool.\n\n167\n00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.500\nSo it was different, but\n\n168\n00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:18.410\nyou had to use tickets in order to\nbasically get access to a ride.\n\n169\n00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:19.670\nNo ticket, no ride, right?\n\n170\n00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.310\nThat kind of thing.\n\n171\n00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.700\nSo Kerberos is really a similar concept,\nright?\n\n172\n00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.310\nIn order to be able to access services,\nwe have to have tickets,\n\n173\n00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:27.950\nit's really the whole idea behind them.\n\n174\n00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:31.390\nSo we've authenticated to\nthe authentication server.\n\n175\n00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:35.380\nThe authentication server sent us back\nthat single use key, that session key, and\n\n176\n00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.820\na ticket that is issued from\nthe authentication server.\n\n177\n00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.770\nNow the client is going to go down\nto the ticket granting server.\n\n178\n00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.280\nWhich is going to be the bottom\nlower left-hand corner.\n\n179\n00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.110\nRemember this is effectively\nthe same system in Windows,\n\n180\n00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.570\nwe're just talking to\nthe domain controller.\n\n181\n00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.690\nWe're just having conversations with them.\n\n182\n00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:55.500\nWe've broken out these distinct roles\njust to show you the process steps,\n\n183\n00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.450\nbut it's really just all happening\nin the domain controller.\n\n184\n00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:03.470\nSo the client's going to send that request\nover to the ticket granting server\n\n185\n00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:06.470\nalong with its application ticket,\nthe ticket it got\n\n186\n00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:11.090\nfrom the authentication server saying\nhey effectively I'm an authorized user.\n\n187\n00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.130\nI need you to take a look at this and\nI need a ticket for\n\n188\n00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:15.820\nsomething specific, right?\n\n189\n00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.310\nSo it's presented its ticket.\n\n190\n00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:22.570\nIt's gonna then get back, from the ticket\ngranting server, a ticket specific\n\n191\n00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.340\nwith the information on it that will\nallow it to access whatever service or\n\n192\n00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:28.600\napplication it needs to use.\n\n193\n00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.150\nSo we've had now two\ncomplete conversations.\n\n194\n00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:35.480\nAuthentication up above, ticket granting\nacross the diagonal in the middle,\n\n195\n00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.165\nthe client is now in possession\nof an application or\n\n196\n00:09:38.165 --> 00:09:40.470\nservice-specific ticket\nthat it can use and\n\n197\n00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:45.075\nredeem on the down discussion here\nbetween Client and Application Server.\n\n198\n00:09:45.075 --> 00:09:48.735\nAnd so in the Application Server\nthe Client is gonna send its\n\n199\n00:09:48.735 --> 00:09:52.115\nauthentication ticket that says hey,\nI'm an authorized user.\n\n200\n00:09:52.115 --> 00:09:54.195\nI have rights to be able\nto use this service.\n\n201\n00:09:54.195 --> 00:09:55.732\nCan you please please hook me up.\n\n202\n00:09:55.732 --> 00:09:58.692\nAnd as a result of that\nthe Client presents that ticket.\n\n203\n00:09:58.692 --> 00:10:02.052\nThe application server is then\ngonna go ahead and say okay,\n\n204\n00:10:02.052 --> 00:10:05.752\nlet me just examine it real quick, looks\nlike it's in order, and grant access.\n\n205\n00:10:05.752 --> 00:10:08.192\nAnd then the client's able\nto consume the service.\n\n206\n00:10:08.192 --> 00:10:10.452\nSo this is how Kerberos generically,\n\n207\n00:10:10.452 --> 00:10:13.732\nat a general thought process is actually\ngonna be structured and working.\n\n208\n00:10:13.732 --> 00:10:14.692\nThis is the steps or\n\n209\n00:10:14.692 --> 00:10:18.150\nthe steps involved in how Kerberos\nis actually gonna be carried out.\n\n210\n00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.637\n>> Yeah, pretty cool and so the advantage\nthen is that is that we're authenticating\n\n211\n00:10:22.637 --> 00:10:27.058\nonce with that domain controller and then\nwe've got a ticket that we can use to get\n\n212\n00:10:27.058 --> 00:10:30.265\na session ticket any time we\nneed to access a application.\n\n213\n00:10:30.265 --> 00:10:30.765\n>> Correct.\n\n214\n00:10:30.765 --> 00:10:32.122\n>> We don't have to\nauthenticate all over again.\n\n215\n00:10:32.122 --> 00:10:32.645\n>> Correct.\n\n216\n00:10:32.645 --> 00:10:34.270\nBut here's the interesting\nthing about Kerberos.\n\n217\n00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.860\nSo actually,\neverything Mike just said is correct but\n\n218\n00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.250\nin addition to all that we have to\nunderstand that tickets have a life cycle\n\n219\n00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.470\nassociated with them like everything else.\n\n220\n00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:43.630\nSo they have a lifetime.\n\n221\n00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.210\nTickets are stamped for a certain\nperiod of time, a validity period, and\n\n222\n00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.980\nthat ticket will expire, all tickets do.\n\n223\n00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.110\nSo eventually that ticket goes away and\neven if we don't use it\n\n224\n00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:58.560\nduring that period it is still valid until\nthe TTL, the time to live value hits zero.\n\n225\n00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.560\nAt that point that ticket\nis no longer valid,\n\n226\n00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.630\nand we would have to then reauthenticate,\nand get a new ticket or\n\n227\n00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.500\na new process kicks off, and\nwe issue new stuff, so absolutely.\n\n228\n00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:11.440\nAnd also an interesting little fact,\nabout Kerberos as well,\n\n229\n00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:14.630\nsorry I have a little itchy nose,\nthat I had to take care of there.\n\n230\n00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.030\nSo another interesting\nfact about Kerberos.\n\n231\n00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.545\nIt's actually gonna be critical for\nKerberos systems to have\n\n232\n00:11:20.545 --> 00:11:24.770\ntime-synchronization because Kerberos\ntickets are time stamped, and\n\n233\n00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.050\nthey are synchronized to\na certain time window.\n\n234\n00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.060\nIn other words, they have a slight\nvariation, a slight variance.\n\n235\n00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.140\nThey have a certain tolerance for\ntiming being off, but if you get\n\n236\n00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.290\nbeyond that window, and it's traditionally\nfive minutes in Windows by default.\n\n237\n00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.560\nWe can modify that, there are tools\nthat can be used to change that value.\n\n238\n00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.730\nBut we usually give you\nabout a five minute window.\n\n239\n00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.630\nSo as long as you're within five minutes\nof time sync between the client and\n\n240\n00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.540\nthe server that's issuing the ticket, or\n\n241\n00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.760\nthe client and the server that's accepting\nthe ticket, anywhere in the system.\n\n242\n00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.830\nIn other words,\nall systems have to be time synchronized.\n\n243\n00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.120\nDo we know what the protocol is or\ntime synchronization boys and girls?\n\n244\n00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.440\nI know what it is.\n\n245\n00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.935\n>> Let's see I know we're\ngonna be talking [CROSSTALK]\n\n246\n00:12:01.935 --> 00:12:03.532\n>> I'm not taking the exam though but\n\n247\n00:12:03.532 --> 00:12:06.410\nI already know I'm thinking\nit's important for you to know.\n\n248\n00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.040\n>> Right.\n\n249\n00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.900\n>> I'm thinking Mike may\nnot know cuz he's hedging.\n\n250\n00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.329\n>> I don't know.\n>> and hasn't said anything.\n\n251\n00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.590\nNetwork time protocol, NTP.\n\n252\n00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.170\n>> NTP.\n>> NTP, very important.\n\n253\n00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:18.910\nNTP runs on, what protocol TCP or UDP?\n\n254\n00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.410\n>> Let's say UDP.\n\n255\n00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.145\n>> Runs on UDP and Mike's real excited,\nyou see the smile on his face?\n\n256\n00:12:24.145 --> 00:12:25.880\n>> [LAUGH] I finally got one right.\n\n257\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.590\nYay.\n\n258\n00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:28.060\n>> I finally go one right.\n\n259\n00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.450\n>> And what port does it run on?\n\n260\n00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.910\n>> Ooh, that's a good one, I do not\nknow the port number to time sync.\n\n261\n00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.580\n>> It is a good one.\n\n262\n00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:36.790\n>> Port 123.\n>> So I feel like Dr.\n\n263\n00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.200\nSeuss and NTP on UDP using port 123.\n\n264\n00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.732\nGreen eggs and ham, everybody.\n\n265\n00:12:41.732 --> 00:12:45.810\nAll right so when we're talking about\nKerberos ,right, time synchronization is\n\n266\n00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.830\nincredibly important because if\nwe get out beyond that window,\n\n267\n00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.170\nwhatever that variable is,\nwhatever we said everything stops.\n\n268\n00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:56.180\nI don't mean just stops like okay we're\ndone no more e-tickets being issued, you\n\n269\n00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:00.470\ncan't authenticate, you can't validate,\nyou can't use and consume services\n\n270\n00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:04.050\nbecause nothing can be time synchronized\nand therefore stamped and validated.\n\n271\n00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.000\nSo the easiest way to create\na denial of service event\n\n272\n00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.990\nagainst systems that use Kerberos is\nto decouple and desynchronize time.\n\n273\n00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:16.310\nThe easiest way to fix that problem is\nto simply resynchronize all the systems.\n\n274\n00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:20.460\nSo in Kerberos based systems, one of\nthe things CIS's piece have to be aware of\n\n275\n00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.290\nis that we have to make sure\nwe're using time synchronization.\n\n276\n00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:27.740\nWe're using NTP and we make sure that\nwe defend our NTP infrastructure so\n\n277\n00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:32.190\nthat nobody can violate the laws or\nrules of time synchronization.\n\n278\n00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.300\nAnd effectively,\nwe scatter the systems and\n\n279\n00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.140\nmake them effectively fall\nout of time synchronization.\n\n280\n00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.110\nWe call this time drift,\ngenerically is what we refer to it as.\n\n281\n00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.390\nWe don't want to have a time drift event.\n\n282\n00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:42.280\nThat can be a bad thing.\n\n283\n00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.430\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n284\n00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.410\nSome of the little lore and\n\n285\n00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:49.290\nlittle known information that sits behind\nthe scenes with regards to Kerberos.\n\n286\n00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.150\nSo obviously very careful\nimplementation here,\n\n287\n00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.510\nvery important to think about,\nlots of moving parts.\n\n288\n00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:55.990\nGot to know how to set this up.\n\n289\n00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.640\nGot to know how to do it the right way.\n\n290\n00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.970\nThe KVC can be a single point of failure.\n\n291\n00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.270\nSo, you know, normally, in most systems,\nwe have more than one domain controller.\n\n292\n00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:08.220\nBut like anything else, if we are a small\nsystem, small shop, may not have lots and\n\n293\n00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:08.880\nlots of resource.\n\n294\n00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.470\nMay have only one domain controller.\n\n295\n00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.720\nSo we do want to think about that,\nbe aware of that.\n\n296\n00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:15.530\nIf we have more than one,\nthen obviously we're creating redundancy,\n\n297\n00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:19.110\nwe're spreading that role out, and if one\nis unavailable we'll have more than one,\n\n298\n00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.070\nand that will be a good thing.\n\n299\n00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.440\nSo just keep that in mind and\nbe aware of that.\n\n300\n00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.430\nKerberos is obviously gonna be\na very important thought process,\n\n301\n00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.210\na very important part of\naccess control over all, and\n\n302\n00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:29.600\nremember it's not just a Windows thing.\n\n303\n00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.030\nWe often hear it referred\nto with regards to Windows,\n\n304\n00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.660\nwe often hear people explain it as\nif it is just a Windows phenomenon.\n\n305\n00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.830\nKerberos is not just\na Windows only technology.\n\n306\n00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.340\nSo you wanna make sure you're\naware of that as well.\n\n307\n00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.810\nSo we think about SSO, Single Sign-On,\n\n308\n00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.730\nwe think about it being implemented\nthrough Kerberos traditionally in Windows.\n\n309\n00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:48.730\nWe wanna think about how that comes\ntogether, what that means for\n\n310\n00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.120\nus, all the things we've\ndiscussed in terms of policy,\n\n311\n00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.530\nin terms of understanding the flow,\nthe steps involved with Kerberos,\n\n312\n00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:56.020\nwould be good for you to know those.\n\n313\n00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.910\nWe've talked about different factors of\nauthentication you've heard me refer to\n\n314\n00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.120\nthem many times.\n\n315\n00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.360\nSingle factor authentication is just using\none of the three accepted common factors.\n\n316\n00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.500\nWe've talked about something you have,\nsomething you know and or\n\n317\n00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:08.340\nsomething you are.\n\n318\n00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.250\nSo we want to make sure we understand\nwhat those three things are and\n\n319\n00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.350\nwe can have a single one of those applied.\n\n320\n00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.260\nThat's single factor authentication.\n\n321\n00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.340\nDual factor is two factors.\n\n322\n00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.070\nPeople often just simply jump\nright to multi-factor and\n\n323\n00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.920\nsay oh we multi-factor authentication\nwhen they're using two factors.\n\n324\n00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.530\nNow that is technically theoretically\ncorrect, multi-factor is more than one.\n\n325\n00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.440\nBut we actually usually say dual factor,\n\n326\n00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.920\nand then we say multi-factor for\nall three factors being used.\n\n327\n00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.450\nBut it depends on whose\ndocumentation you're reading and\n\n328\n00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.980\nit depends on whether or\nnot somebody really makes a distinction.\n\n329\n00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.011\nIt's not wrong to say multi-factor for\ntwo factor, but\n\n330\n00:15:42.011 --> 00:15:45.503\nit is technically correct to refer\nto two factors as dual factor.\n\n331\n00:15:45.503 --> 00:15:47.076\nJust so you know, but either way,\n\n332\n00:15:47.076 --> 00:15:50.181\nI'm not trying to make your life\nmore difficult than it already is.\n\n333\n00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:54.223\nI'm just simply pointing out that you\nmay hear it referred to different ways.\n\n334\n00:15:54.223 --> 00:15:57.130\nSo, something you have,\nsomething you know, something you are,\n\n335\n00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.840\ncombine them in any order,\nany kind of style that you'd like.\n\n336\n00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.310\nAs long as you use more than one,\n\n337\n00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:05.280\nyou've got a stronger authentication\nprocess that if you're using only one.\n\n338\n00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.150\nSingle factor authentication in\nother words is good, but dual or\n\n339\n00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.990\nmulti factor authentication is\nbetter is what we would often say.\n\n340\n00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.000\nSo just be aware of that,\nobviously thinking about that makes sense.\n\n341\n00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.170\nWe've talked about tokens as well, just\nreminding you about some of the things\n\n342\n00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.200\nwe've hit on in some of\nour prior discussions.\n\n343\n00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.240\nWe actually showed you what a token could\nlook like, talked about the general\n\n344\n00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.440\nconcepts of what a token represents,\nthese are used by what we call claimants.\n\n345\n00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.700\nClaimants are just the people\nthat are claiming or\n\n346\n00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:30.450\nusing the token to authenticate.\n\n347\n00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.330\nThat's just the technical term we use.\n\n348\n00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:36.488\nAnd it is used to prove their identity,\nto a central authentication system and\n\n349\n00:16:36.488 --> 00:16:38.573\nthen allow users in as a result of that.\n\n350\n00:16:38.573 --> 00:16:41.643\nWe can talk about soft or\nhard token implementations,\n\n351\n00:16:41.643 --> 00:16:44.723\nsoft token implementations\nare stored in a computer.\n\n352\n00:16:44.723 --> 00:16:49.030\nThey are software generated traditionally,\nthat's why we call them soft tokens.\n\n353\n00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.735\nAnd compared to hard tokens,\nthey're very cheap to implement,\n\n354\n00:16:51.735 --> 00:16:53.997\nyou're talking about a software\nprogram that runs and\n\n355\n00:16:53.997 --> 00:16:57.107\ngenerates a token value of some kind\nthat is then used to authenticate you.\n\n356\n00:16:57.107 --> 00:16:58.485\nIt's very straightforward,\n\n357\n00:16:58.485 --> 00:17:01.983\nyou don't have to worry about managing\nthem as much because chances are good,\n\n358\n00:17:01.983 --> 00:17:04.589\nalthough somebody certainly\ncould lose their computer.\n\n359\n00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.258\nRemind me and I'll tell you a funny\nstory about losing your computer in\n\n360\n00:17:07.258 --> 00:17:08.125\njust a moment.\n\n361\n00:17:08.125 --> 00:17:12.895\nYou may lose your computer or misplace it,\nreality is, if the token's on the computer\n\n362\n00:17:12.895 --> 00:17:16.187\nand you're managing the computer, it's\nvery unlikely you're gonna lose the token.\n\n363\n00:17:16.187 --> 00:17:18.687\nBecause the token itself as\nyou saw is pretty small and\n\n364\n00:17:18.687 --> 00:17:20.767\npeople lose them all the time.\n\n365\n00:17:20.767 --> 00:17:23.997\nI'm always finding tokens randomly\nin strange places when I travel\n\n366\n00:17:23.997 --> 00:17:25.157\nbecause people leave them behind.\n\n367\n00:17:25.157 --> 00:17:27.017\nThey just do.\nThey're small and they don't realize it.\n\n368\n00:17:27.017 --> 00:17:30.587\nBut it's very rare that you find a\ncomputer laying around with a token on it.\n\n369\n00:17:30.587 --> 00:17:33.657\nAnd if you do,\nyou probably should be very wary of that.\n\n370\n00:17:33.657 --> 00:17:35.377\nThat may not be what it appears to be.\n\n371\n00:17:35.377 --> 00:17:37.737\nSo funny story before we\ntalk about hard tokens.\n\n372\n00:17:37.737 --> 00:17:43.160\nSo many, many moons ago, many, many years\nago, I took a bit of a sabbatical from\n\n373\n00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.410\nmy normal day job, from what I've been\ndoing for probably close to 20 years now.\n\n374\n00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:51.532\nAnd I went to work for\na very large software company, right?\n\n375\n00:17:51.532 --> 00:17:57.070\nAnd spent the better part of a year doing\nlearning consulting for them, and managing\n\n376\n00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:02.297\nthe learning delivery for them, for\nthe Global Alliance Partners world wide.\n\n377\n00:18:02.297 --> 00:18:04.946\nAnd I spent a lot of time traveling,\ndoing that and\n\n378\n00:18:04.946 --> 00:18:09.110\nI was working all over in different places\nand I spent about ten days in India.\n\n379\n00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:13.060\nI had a series of meetings with all the\nIndian SIs, the system integrators, doing\n\n380\n00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:18.090\na bunch of stuff, really cool trip and a\nlot of fun, beautiful country, by the way.\n\n381\n00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:19.375\nReally, really interesting place.\n\n382\n00:18:19.375 --> 00:18:22.151\nDefinitely recommend you get over there,\nif you have time to do so.\n\n383\n00:18:22.151 --> 00:18:25.769\nIncredible poverty, it's incredibly\nstark contrast when you go to India with\n\n384\n00:18:25.769 --> 00:18:28.472\nthe poverty that's there and\nthe richness that's there.\n\n385\n00:18:28.472 --> 00:18:32.221\nBecause you've got people living in\nthe street literally next door to up\n\n386\n00:18:32.221 --> 00:18:35.230\nagainst the wall of\nmagnificent five star hotels.\n\n387\n00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:36.780\nSo it's a study in dichotomy.\n\n388\n00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.440\nBut it's a beautiful country.\n\n389\n00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:40.850\nAnd we spent about ten days there,\nand when I was there,\n\n390\n00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.800\nI was traveling all over.\n\n391\n00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.325\nI flew from Delhi to Mumbai, and just\nall over the place internally throughout\n\n392\n00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:48.320\nthe country to a series of meetings.\n\n393\n00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.800\nAnd so, at the time I was using a much\nsmaller laptop, one of those Sony Vaios.\n\n394\n00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.456\nSo it's very portable and\nI'm rushing to catch a flight.\n\n395\n00:18:55.456 --> 00:18:59.245\nI'm sitting in the flight lounge or\nwhatever, doing a bunch of email and\n\n396\n00:18:59.245 --> 00:19:01.603\nI get up, I run to the plane and\nlo and behold,\n\n397\n00:19:01.603 --> 00:19:04.481\nfirst time it's ever happened\nto me in my entire life.\n\n398\n00:19:04.481 --> 00:19:07.737\nI run to the plane, and\nI leave behind, not my laptop, but\n\n399\n00:19:07.737 --> 00:19:09.879\nI leave behind my power cord, right?\n\n400\n00:19:09.879 --> 00:19:11.650\nBecause I wasn't paying any attention.\n\n401\n00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:15.730\nAnd so, this is not like where I can just\ngo run out down to the store to Best Buy\n\n402\n00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:17.810\nand I can go get another power cord.\n\n403\n00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.470\nI'm in a remote area cuz that's where I'm\ntraveling to in this particular trip and\n\n404\n00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.790\nI couldn't get a power cord for my laptop.\n\n405\n00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:26.130\nSo, I'm there for about two days.\n\n406\n00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:30.860\nAnd so, I get a phone call at the hotel\nlater that night when I get in, hey, Mr.\n\n407\n00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:31.450\nGordon?\n\n408\n00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:36.430\nThis is the concierge, whatever,\nand the airline called and said\n\n409\n00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:40.650\nthat they have your power cord, because\nI had said, when I got in there and\n\n410\n00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.690\nI finally figured it out, I said, hey,\nI left it behind in the transit lounge.\n\n411\n00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.510\nIs there any way you could possibly\nthink about that you may be\n\n412\n00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.410\nable to get it to me?\n\n413\n00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:49.910\nSo they call me and said hey,\nthey called, they found it first of all.\n\n414\n00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:50.810\nSo good news.\n\n415\n00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.200\nEven if I don't get it while I'm there,\nI'll get it when I fly back, so\n\n416\n00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.400\nthat's good.\n\n417\n00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.039\nSo they found it and\nthey've sent it on the next flight,\n\n418\n00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:58.399\nwhatever that was gonna be.\n\n419\n00:19:58.399 --> 00:20:01.894\nAnd it will be here in like two hours or\nwhatever it was.\n\n420\n00:20:01.894 --> 00:20:04.540\nAnd so they're gonna send somebody and,\nwe'll bring it to you.\n\n421\n00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.310\nAwesome.\n\n422\n00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:10.350\nSo it shows up and\nthey sent me my power cord, right?\n\n423\n00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.050\nThey also sent me somebody else's power\ncord, who I guess had left theirs, and\n\n424\n00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.220\nthey didn't know which was which.\n\n425\n00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.560\nSo I got a selection of power cords,\nwhich was nice.\n\n426\n00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.160\nDidn't need the other one, no big deal.\n\n427\n00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.695\nBut they had also sent me, I guess they\nfelt like I was sitting at a table,\n\n428\n00:20:22.695 --> 00:20:24.675\nthere were a couple different\npeople that had been there working.\n\n429\n00:20:24.675 --> 00:20:27.255\nSo I guess whatever was left behind,\nthey figured must have been mine.\n\n430\n00:20:27.255 --> 00:20:30.165\nSo they took everything that was left,\nput it in a box, sent it to me.\n\n431\n00:20:30.165 --> 00:20:31.855\nSo I opened it up,\nI get the two power cords.\n\n432\n00:20:31.855 --> 00:20:33.455\nI also get somebody's RSA token.\n\n433\n00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:36.480\nRandom, just totally random.\n\n434\n00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.000\nI opened a box, it was all this stuff.\n\n435\n00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.330\nA little note saying,\nsorry you left it all behind.\n\n436\n00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.070\nHope we can obviously get it all to you.\n\n437\n00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.180\nThank you for\nletting us know we can be of service.\n\n438\n00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:48.420\nNice note from the airline but\nI got some poor traveler's, I'm thinking,\n\n439\n00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.880\nI'm assuming to this day I don't know,\n\n440\n00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:53.120\nI'm assuming it's probably the same\nguy's power cord and RSA token.\n\n441\n00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.980\nThis guy was like in a world of hurt\nbecause he didn't get to the airline\n\n442\n00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.850\nbefore I did.\n\n443\n00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.130\nI got all his stuff, and to this day,\nI don't know who's it was.\n\n444\n00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.950\nI left it with the concierge at the hotel,\nand I said hey, here you go,\n\n445\n00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.650\nsomebody calls looking for this stuff,\nyou know where to send it.\n\n446\n00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:07.420\nSo I got mine, but\nI got everybody else's as well,\n\n447\n00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.090\nso it's kind of funny, cuz sometimes that\nhappens, and he left, whoever it was,\n\n448\n00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.440\nhe or she, left behind their RSA token.\n\n449\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.060\nSo it's interesting, right, because\nthese tokens can be lost, obviously.\n\n450\n00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:17.490\nAnd so you have to be aware of that.\n\n451\n00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:21.140\nSo hard tokens, these are gonna\nbe non-software physical tokens.\n\n452\n00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.280\nLike the RSA token that wound up in my box\nof stuff that I got from the airlines.\n\n453\n00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.920\nThat, or\nthey cleaned out the lost and found.\n\n454\n00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.420\nWhat if they just said, everything we got\njust throw it in the box, send it to him.\n\n455\n00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.760\nSo it's a physical token,\nit's a hard token, is what we call it.\n\n456\n00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.170\nObviously if you lose this,\nit's a problem.\n\n457\n00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.790\nThey're susceptible to physical attacks\nbecause somebody can try to compromise and\n\n458\n00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:41.160\nsteal it from you, different things.\n\n459\n00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.200\nSo you have to think about the different\nways we implement tokens, soft and hard.\n\n460\n00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.225\nWe have different kinds of hard tokens, we\nhave what are called a one time password\n\n461\n00:21:48.225 --> 00:21:51.000\ndevices, they just generate a random\nvalue, you can only use it once,\n\n462\n00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.130\nthey don't ever generate it again.\n\n463\n00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:55.360\nWe talked about the value of\nthis idea of a one time pad.\n\n464\n00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:56.333\nThings like that.\n\n465\n00:21:56.333 --> 00:21:57.572\nAn out band token.\n\n466\n00:21:57.572 --> 00:21:59.770\nThis is something like an SMS message.\n\n467\n00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:02.950\nSo for instance, if a bank or\na financial institution,\n\n468\n00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.680\ncredit card company, etc.,\nwants you to authenticate today,\n\n469\n00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.410\nthey use multi-factor or dual factor\nauthentication, depending on the company.\n\n470\n00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:11.830\nThey will traditionally have\nyou log in with the username.\n\n471\n00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.622\nThey use this thing called\npicture pass a lot.\n\n472\n00:22:13.622 --> 00:22:17.110\nSo, you'll put a picture on there and\nsay, hey, do you know this picture,\n\n473\n00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:18.110\nis this yours?\n\n474\n00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.970\nYes, I've seen the picture of\nthe floppy disk 1,000 times.\n\n475\n00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:21.870\nIt's always the same.\n\n476\n00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:22.805\nIt's definitely mine.\n\n477\n00:22:22.805 --> 00:22:23.678\nSo we have that.\n\n478\n00:22:23.678 --> 00:22:26.665\nAnd then they also will send\nyou a challenge code, right?\n\n479\n00:22:26.665 --> 00:22:29.140\nThey'll effectively send\nyou a PIN of some kind.\n\n480\n00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.710\nBut they'll send it to you in\nan out of bound mechanism.\n\n481\n00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.950\nSo they'll email it to you,\nthey'll text it to you to your phone.\n\n482\n00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.404\nThere's different options depending on\nwhat you set up when you registered in\n\n483\n00:22:37.404 --> 00:22:38.230\nthe system.\n\n484\n00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:41.630\nSo this can be an out of band token\nwhere they actually send you a message\n\n485\n00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.270\nto the token, and then you obviously\nhave that and you can represent it.\n\n486\n00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.780\nSome of them will give you a token,\nin other words,\n\n487\n00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:46.900\nas opposed to just using your phone.\n\n488\n00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.985\nJust depends on how it's done.\n\n489\n00:22:48.985 --> 00:22:53.412\nYou may have a cryptographic device,\na cryptographic token of some kind that's\n\n490\n00:22:53.412 --> 00:22:57.331\ngenerating cryptographic hashes or\nthings like that that can be used.\n\n491\n00:22:57.331 --> 00:22:59.120\nThere's different ways\nthat this can be done.\n\n492\n00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.510\nIt's dedicated for the storage and\nuse of private keys, traditionally.\n\n493\n00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.710\nYou may have different\nkinds of hardware tokens.\n\n494\n00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:07.336\nSo just be aware of that,\njust understand the logic of that.\n\n495\n00:23:07.336 --> 00:23:10.766\nWe've talked a lot about biometrics,\nthe different kinds of biometric systems,\n\n496\n00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:13.080\nwanna go through those a little\nmore detail in a minute.\n\n497\n00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.705\nBut we first wanna talk about what\ncan happen with biometric systems,\n\n498\n00:23:16.705 --> 00:23:20.030\nonce we register,\nif not everything's working the right way.\n\n499\n00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:23.990\nSo, if you walk up to a fingerprint\nscanner, you swipe your finger, and\n\n500\n00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:28.700\nyou're able to get in, but\nit's not really you, somebody else, right?\n\n501\n00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.330\nThen that's a bad thing, right?\n\n502\n00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:34.370\nBecause we have effectively,\nfalsely accepted you into the system.\n\n503\n00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:35.600\nYou weren't supposed to be there, but\n\n504\n00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.910\nwe allowed you in so\nthat's what we call an error.\n\n505\n00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:39.270\nIt's one type of error.\n\n506\n00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:43.516\nThere are two types of errors we deal with\nin biometric systems, false accepts or\n\n507\n00:23:43.516 --> 00:23:44.395\nfalse rejects.\n\n508\n00:23:44.395 --> 00:23:46.943\nFalse rejects are where\na valid user walks up,\n\n509\n00:23:46.943 --> 00:23:49.631\nswipes their finger, and\nis not allowed entry.\n\n510\n00:23:49.631 --> 00:23:50.687\nThat's a false reject.\n\n511\n00:23:50.687 --> 00:23:53.892\nYou should not have been rejected,\nbut we did reject you.\n\n512\n00:23:53.892 --> 00:23:57.068\nWhen a non-authorized user walks up and\nscans and is allowed entry,\n\n513\n00:23:57.068 --> 00:23:58.890\nit's called a false accept.\n\n514\n00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:02.180\nOf the two, clearly,\nthe false accepts are worse, right?\n\n515\n00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.980\nWe don't want the bad users getting in.\n\n516\n00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.200\nWe may upset legitimate users by falsely\nrejecting them, but that's okay,\n\n517\n00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.560\nthey'll get over it, right?\n\n518\n00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:11.890\nWhat's important is we don't\nwanna let the bad people in.\n\n519\n00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.080\nSo we don't want false acceptance,\n\n520\n00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.110\nand we wanna obviously\nminimize both errors, right?\n\n521\n00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.050\nBecause obviously both are problematic.\n\n522\n00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:20.160\nNow what we do is we measure these,\nyou know, we put them on an x/y plot,\n\n523\n00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.940\nso effectively on a grid if you\nwant to think of it that way.\n\n524\n00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.411\nAnd we track them, right, it's gonna look\nalmost like a bell curve, right, so you're\n\n525\n00:24:26.411 --> 00:24:29.700\ngonna have a line that goes something like\nthis for the number of false accepts.\n\n526\n00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.890\nA line that goes something like this for\nfalse rejects.\n\n527\n00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:32.930\nWhere they cross over and\n\n528\n00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.450\nmeet in the middle, somewhere those\ntwo lines are gonna intersect.\n\n529\n00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:39.500\nThat's called the CER, or\nthe cross over error rate.\n\n530\n00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.050\nThat is the point at which\nthe number of false accepts and\n\n531\n00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.252\nfalse rejects is essentially the same.\n\n532\n00:24:44.252 --> 00:24:48.040\nWe wanna manage that number\ndown as low as possible.\n\n533\n00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.570\nBy lowering that threshold,\nwe are effectively tuning the system,\n\n534\n00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:55.350\noptimizing it, making it run better,\nbecause it's not rejecting or\n\n535\n00:24:55.350 --> 00:25:00.120\naccepting people as often falsely, so\nit's gonna have less errors overall.\n\n536\n00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.260\nSo the CER, the crossover error rate,\n\n537\n00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.300\nit's a very important measure\nof biometric system accuracy.\n\n538\n00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.170\nAnd you wanna make sure you know\nthe difference between false reject and\n\n539\n00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.670\nfalse accept errors.\n\n540\n00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:10.959\nWanna make sure we're aware of those.\n\n541\n00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.280\nBiometric readers, right, we have\ndifferent kinds of biometric systems.\n\n542\n00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.430\nSo I talked about fingerprint\nscanning already.\n\n543\n00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:20.920\nWe have facial recognition,\nfacial imaging that's used often today.\n\n544\n00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.940\nYou scan the entire face\ninto a computer database.\n\n545\n00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.320\nThey look at multiple points.\n\n546\n00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.030\nAnd then they measure those points\nto see whether or not that's you.\n\n547\n00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:31.180\nThey use this in casinos,\nfor instance, in Las Vegas.\n\n548\n00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.230\nThey use it in airports, at sporting\nevents, where they're looking for\n\n549\n00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:37.230\npeople on watch lists\ntrying to find people.\n\n550\n00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:39.000\nWe often refer to them as eyes in the sky.\n\n551\n00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.750\nThey have cameras that are just\nbasically scanning as you walk by.\n\n552\n00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.330\nSome of this technology is very,\nvery specific and targeted.\n\n553\n00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:46.480\nIt works very well.\n\n554\n00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.610\nSome of it, you know, not so well.\n\n555\n00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.796\nHand geometry, we're gonna measure and\nscan the whole hand.\n\n556\n00:25:51.796 --> 00:25:55.500\nSo you often will see that somebody\nwill put their hand on a reader, and\n\n557\n00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.720\nit scans the entire hand, and\nlooks at the peaks and valleys, and\n\n558\n00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.000\nlooks at the distance between the fingers,\nthe height ratios, all that kind of stuff.\n\n559\n00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.510\nSo we have that,\nwe have voice recognition.\n\n560\n00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:10.520\nSo you speak or read a paragraph or\na sentence or two into a reader, and\n\n561\n00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.569\nthen you're able to say your name or\nsomething, it matches that up.\n\n562\n00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.010\nAnybody a big Simpsons fan?\n\n563\n00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:17.790\nEver watch Simpsons?\n\n564\n00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.330\n>> A few times.\n>> Okay, so pretty cool.\n\n565\n00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.590\nIt's been on for like what,\n150 years or something crazy like that?\n\n566\n00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.020\nThe longest running cartoon.\n\n567\n00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.220\nSo one of the episodes on\nthe Simpsons that I've\n\n568\n00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.930\nnever been able to figure\nout what episode it was.\n\n569\n00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.995\nI saw it, I don't remember the name,\nand I don't know what number it was.\n\n570\n00:26:31.995 --> 00:26:36.130\nBut one of the episodes,\nBart actually gets into trouble,\n\n571\n00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.720\nbecause that's so\nsurprising like that never happens.\n\n572\n00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.820\nGets into trouble, winds up\ngetting effectively kidnapped, and\n\n573\n00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:48.460\nis chained to a desk in a basement,\nand has to write greeting cards for\n\n574\n00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.800\nHallmark, that's kind of\nthe theme of the episode.\n\n575\n00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.030\nAnd so he's stuck writing greeting cards.\n\n576\n00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:57.050\nAnd in order to rescue them to get\nthem back, Homer has to go rescue him.\n\n577\n00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:58.940\nSo in order to go get him,\nright, ultimately,\n\n578\n00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.500\nthey have to go through all these security\nmeasures to get into the place where it's\n\n579\n00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.980\nsecure that he's actually chained to\nthe desk writing the cards, and so\n\n580\n00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.400\nthey go through all\nthese security measures.\n\n581\n00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:10.310\nIt was kind of cool cuz they did all\nthese things that we're talking about.\n\n582\n00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:11.140\nThey have the guards.\n\n583\n00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:11.990\nThey have the dogs.\n\n584\n00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:13.220\nThey have the closed circuit TV.\n\n585\n00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:14.620\nThey have the log book to sign in.\n\n586\n00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.170\nThey have the man trap, where you\nwalk in the box, locks on one end,\n\n587\n00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.010\nopens the other, and\nthen they had all this stuff.\n\n588\n00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:22.845\nAnd at the very end of it,\nwhen they get to the vault,\n\n589\n00:27:22.845 --> 00:27:27.150\nthe huge bolt door,\nthey have the biometric solution.\n\n590\n00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.074\nIt's the butt scan 3000.\n\n591\n00:27:28.074 --> 00:27:30.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So you know, they have to, you know,\n\n592\n00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.430\nthe guy, you know,\nyou don't see it but you hear it.\n\n593\n00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.590\nLike, the guy's, all right,\njust one second Mr. Simpson.\n\n594\n00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:35.910\nWe'll get this taken care for\nyou right away.\n\n595\n00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:37.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You hear the zipper go down.\n\n596\n00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.610\nJust got to take care of this\nlast little security thing.\n\n597\n00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.790\nAnd it's the butts,\nyou see the butt scan 3000 site.\n\n598\n00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.600\nSo it's really kinda funny, right,\nwe don't have that particular\n\n599\n00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.690\nbiometric technology yet, but\nwe have a lot of others, right?\n\n600\n00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.570\nSo voice recognition, iris pattern\nscanning or retinal scannings,\n\n601\n00:27:51.570 --> 00:27:54.760\nwe talked about the ability to\nscan certain patterns in the eye.\n\n602\n00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.205\nYou have to understand that with\nretina scanning in particular,\n\n603\n00:27:57.205 --> 00:27:58.860\nwhile it's incredibly accurate, right?\n\n604\n00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.780\nIt can be problematic,\nbecause number one users aren't real\n\n605\n00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.970\nwild about you shooting a beam\nof light in their eyes.\n\n606\n00:28:03.970 --> 00:28:06.890\nThey think that you're gonna blind them so\nthat is a legitimate concern.\n\n607\n00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:08.500\nSo there's pushback with this.\n\n608\n00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.600\nBut the other issue is that retinal scans,\n\n609\n00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.820\nin particular, can be susceptible\nto problems with disease.\n\n610\n00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.930\nSo, for instance, if you develop glaucoma,\nyou have diabetes and you develop problems\n\n611\n00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.750\nwith your eyes, things like that,\nthe retinal scan can be impacted by that.\n\n612\n00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.380\nAnd so as a result of that,\nthat can be a problem.\n\n613\n00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.230\nSo can the iris scan to certain degree.\n\n614\n00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.060\nSo you just wanna make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n615\n00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.580\nThat while some of these\nare incredibly accurate,\n\n616\n00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.120\nthey can be impacted by\nphysical conditions.\n\n617\n00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.936\nSo we wanna to make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n618\n00:28:34.936 --> 00:28:39.530\nSignature dynamics, you know, how we sign\ncan be effected by if you break your hand\n\n619\n00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:43.620\nor have an injury of some kind, you can\nactually sign differently, and as a result\n\n620\n00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.940\nthat may require a re-scan, a re-entry\ninto the system for a new capture.\n\n621\n00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.760\nVascular patterns,\nwe scan the vascular pattern in the hand.\n\n622\n00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:53.220\nOr in the eye, in different places,\nwe can do that.\n\n623\n00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.150\nKey stroke dynamics,\nhow quickly do you type?\n\n624\n00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:57.261\nI'm a hunt-and-peck typer myself.\n\n625\n00:28:57.261 --> 00:28:58.750\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I don't do well with\n\n626\n00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.950\nkey stroke dynamics are like,\ngo ahead and register.\n\n627\n00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.050\nI'm still trying to find the H when\nthe registration period's done.\n\n628\n00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:06.090\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Oh one key, no that's not enough Mr.\n\n629\n00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:07.220\nGordon you have to try again.\n\n630\n00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.770\nOkay, I'm ready, go ahead.\n\n631\n00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:09.685\nSo okay two keys.\n\n632\n00:29:09.685 --> 00:29:10.185\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Better?\n\n633\n00:29:10.185 --> 00:29:11.020\nNo not good.\n\n634\n00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:12.960\nWe need you to do like\nthe whole paragraph.\n\n635\n00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.040\nThat's not happening, right.\n\n636\n00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.140\nSo for me, not gonna work.\n\n637\n00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.320\nThe biggest thing I regret\nas an adult in my life,\n\n638\n00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:23.360\nthe biggest thing I regret all kidding\naside, is I never learned how to type.\n\n639\n00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.150\nWhen I was in school I never did.\n\n640\n00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:29.370\nI had the opportunity, right, but I didnt'\ntake that class, because I just didn't.\n\n641\n00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:31.420\nI don't know why,\nI'm an idiot, I should have.\n\n642\n00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.060\nBut I never did.\n\n643\n00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.000\nSo to this day, literally,\nI write books, right.\n\n644\n00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.550\nI mean I've written thousands of\npages of material, I write like this.\n\n645\n00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.300\nThis is what I do.\n\n646\n00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:40.440\nThis is me.\n\n647\n00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.430\nIf you come see me write at Starbucks,\nyou will see,\n\n648\n00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.260\nforget about coming to see me for\na live class, come see me write.\n\n649\n00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.540\nThis is what I'm doing.\n\n650\n00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.920\nOne key at a time.\n\n651\n00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.910\nSo I, to this day, I regret not having\ntaken advantage of learning how to type.\n\n652\n00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.610\nSo for me, key start dynamics are off\nthe table, it's not happening.\n\n653\n00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.050\nBut all the others, I'm good with,\nI can do any of those things.\n\n654\n00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:01.360\nSo we often try to do a movie\nreference for certain things.\n\n655\n00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.110\nSo if you've ever seen Minority Report,\nright, Tom Cruise movie.\n\n656\n00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:06.040\nFabulous movie.\n\n657\n00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.050\nNot such a great actor,\nbut a fabulous movie.\n\n658\n00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:12.000\nBut if you've ever seen Minority Report,\nyou will remember without being a spoiler,\n\n659\n00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.290\nyou will remember that there is a\nbiometric reference or two in that movie.\n\n660\n00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.180\nThey wind up being something\nthat's kind of interesting and\n\n661\n00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:19.820\na different take on biometrics.\n\n662\n00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:23.620\nSo if you've never seen that movie and you\nwanna see something kind of interesting\n\n663\n00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:26.360\nbut a little gory,\njust to give you a point of reference,\n\n664\n00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:28.680\nthen check that one out because\nit's kind of interesting.\n\n665\n00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.760\nYeah, it is kind of interesting.\n\n666\n00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.880\nHas to do with the eyes,\nI'll give you that much of a little hint.\n\n667\n00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:36.630\nAnd a sandwich bag,\nwithout getting into too much detail, but\n\n668\n00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:38.880\nkind of interesting and cool.\n\n669\n00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.030\nAll right, so\nwe've talked about biometrics,\n\n670\n00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.990\nwe're gonna wrap up here in just a second.\n\n671\n00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:46.060\nWe've talked about, obviously, a lot of\nthings that go in to making this work.\n\n672\n00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.570\nThe idea here is we're trying\nto create accountability.\n\n673\n00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:52.580\nThe idea is ultimately that accountability\nis really being able to determine whether\n\n674\n00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.500\nor not somebody legitimately\nis who they are, and\n\n675\n00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.520\nthat they're responsible for\nmaintaining their identity.\n\n676\n00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.180\nAnd so these systems are about\naccountability and responsibility.\n\n677\n00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:04.110\nDue diligence and due care in other words,\nthe terms we've often used.\n\n678\n00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:07.010\nAnd creating accountability\nwithin the logon process for\n\n679\n00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:09.200\nidentity management is\nobviously very important.\n\n680\n00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.450\nWe have to be thinking about those things\nand understanding how to implement and\n\n681\n00:31:12.450 --> 00:31:14.160\nto think through that logic.\n\n682\n00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:14.770\n>> Very good Adam.\n\n683\n00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.500\nAgain, great information, love it.\n\n684\n00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.240\nAnd, of course, who couldn't do\nwith more pop culture references?\n\n685\n00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.360\nIt helps it stick, right?\n\n686\n00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.220\nIt makes it fun.\n\n687\n00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.450\nSo, thanks for that.\n\n688\n00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:26.590\nYou know, you get a lot of information\nthere about that authentication process,\n\n689\n00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.655\ndifferent types of authentication and\nauthorization that we can put in place.\n\n690\n00:31:29.655 --> 00:31:34.473\nSo, remember if you guys wanna see Adam or\nattend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n691\n00:31:34.473 --> 00:31:37.104\nshoot us an email at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n692\n00:31:37.104 --> 00:31:40.670\nThat's gonna do it for this episode,\nsigning off, I'm Mike Broderick.\n\n693\n00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:41.190\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n694\n00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:42.910\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n695\n00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:43.691\n>> Take care, everybody.\n\n696\n00:31:43.691 -->

00:00:17.130\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.970\nToday, we're doing our CISSP content and\n\n5\n00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.130\nspecifically we're diving back into\nthe world of managing authentication.\n\n6\n00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.610\nWe've already done a couple episodes\non this, we've got more to cover,\n\n7\n00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.100\nso without further adieu,\n\n8\n00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.420\nI'll think we'll just jump right over to\nAdam and we'll dive right back into it.\n\n9\n00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.680\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.612\n>> Should I jump before I?\n\n11\n00:00:35.612 --> 00:00:37.427\nJump, I'm jumping in.\n\n12\n00:00:37.427 --> 00:00:39.590\nI'm trying to be literal and\nfollow instructions.\n\n13\n00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.590\nI'm doing well, I'm doing well.\n\n14\n00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.550\nHopefully everybody out there is as well.\n\n15\n00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.990\nSo we're going to continue\nour conversation.\n\n16\n00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.270\nWe're going to extend the thought\nprocess of access control a little bit.\n\n17\n00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.250\nBroaden out beyond the user, broaden out\nbeyond the subject object conversation.\n\n18\n00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.720\nTake it out into some of the other\nsystems that we're dealing with.\n\n19\n00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.730\nSo, what about desktops and\ndesktop session control?\n\n20\n00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.018\nHow do we manage\ninteraction on the desktop?\n\n21\n00:00:59.018 --> 00:01:02.322\nDo we have controls in\nplace like screensavers,\n\n22\n00:01:02.322 --> 00:01:05.553\ntime out policies of some\nkind to time them out?\n\n23\n00:01:05.553 --> 00:01:07.240\nDo we have automatic logouts?\n\n24\n00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.040\nThese are kind of things we'd also\nwant to think about from an access\n\n25\n00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.170\ncontrol perspective.\n\n26\n00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.020\nIt's not just about, in other words,\nthe human sitting down and\n\n27\n00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.480\nvalidating who they are.\n\n28\n00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.090\nIt's about the system making sure that\nit's only available for authorized users.\n\n29\n00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.240\nAnd when that authorized user leaves,\nthat that system is not left available for\n\n30\n00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.910\nsomebody else to take over and\nuse without proper authorization.\n\n31\n00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.570\nSo wanna think about those kind of things,\nright?\n\n32\n00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.830\nMaking sure that desktop\nsystems are managed accordingly\n\n33\n00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.460\nas part of encompassing them\ninto the access control system.\n\n34\n00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.850\nWanna think about as we said,\nscreensavers.\n\n35\n00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.150\nWe've all seen the screensavers\nthat lock out.\n\n36\n00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.400\nWe've seen the ones\nthat allow you to block\n\n37\n00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.210\nwhat's going on when\nyou're doing something, so\n\n38\n00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.880\nyou can use the glare screen,\nnot the screensaver, but a glare screen.\n\n39\n00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.090\nA glare screen protector, whatever they\nwould call them, the little film you put\n\n40\n00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.690\nover your screen is not the same\nthing as a screensaver that kicks\n\n41\n00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.150\nin when you are away from the system,\nto block people from seeing what's there.\n\n42\n00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.812\nBecause you sit down in front of\nthe system with a glare screen enabled,\n\n43\n00:02:07.812 --> 00:02:11.365\nyou will be able to look directly\nat the screen and see what's there.\n\n44\n00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:14.897\nIt's just preventing you from effectively\nseeing it off to the side because of\n\n45\n00:02:14.897 --> 00:02:18.284\nthe way that it filters the image coming\noff the screen or blocks the light.\n\n46\n00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:19.938\nSo just wanna make sure\nwe make a difference or\n\n47\n00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:22.570\nunderstand that there's\na difference there between the two.\n\n48\n00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.935\nWe've talked about some of these other\nthings like session limits or log on and\n\n49\n00:02:25.935 --> 00:02:28.350\nlogout, time outs, things of that nature.\n\n50\n00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.230\nDon't stay logged in after\na certain period of inactivity,\n\n51\n00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.350\nthese are all things to consider and\nto be aware of.\n\n52\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.160\nWe want to also think about the fact that\n\n53\n00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.420\nwhen we are going to be validating\nsomebody who is coming in and\n\n54\n00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.520\nauthenticating and\ntrying to figure out who they are.\n\n55\n00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.940\nAfter we authorize them, giving them\nrights to be able to do something,\n\n56\n00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.350\nwant to make sure we focus on\na concept known as identity proofing.\n\n57\n00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.110\nGenerically the idea of identity proofing\nis really what happens up at the front of\n\n58\n00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.986\nthat process which is the idea of\nvalidating the user's identity.\n\n59\n00:02:56.986 --> 00:03:02.350\nSo for instance, if I walk up to\na entry point in Disney World,\n\n60\n00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.360\nright, and I have on the magic\nbands that they use now, and\n\n61\n00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.221\nyou can see I got my own set of magic\nbands that I carry with me wherever I go.\n\n62\n00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:09.970\n>> [CROSSTALK] any park?\n\n63\n00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.865\n>> I can walk in any park in the world,\ncuz I'm already, everywhere I go,\n\n64\n00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:14.040\nI'm there, I'm good.\n\n65\n00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.960\nYou wouldn't know by looking at me that\nI was in the music business at one point\n\n66\n00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.470\nin my life.\n\n67\n00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.140\nBut I've retained certain elements\nof that, some more than others.\n\n68\n00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.110\nBut if you have a magic band, right,\nit's basically a Disney wristwatch.\n\n69\n00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.380\nIt's one of those grey bands that they\nhave, it's got the Disney logo on it.\n\n70\n00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.096\nAnd it looks like a Fitbit\nactually without a screen.\n\n71\n00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:34.516\nAnd what you do is you walk up and\nyou can put that up against a reader, and\n\n72\n00:03:34.516 --> 00:03:37.144\nyou may have to do your\nfingerprint scan along with it.\n\n73\n00:03:37.144 --> 00:03:41.134\nThey now use them for the hotel access if\nyou stay on the grounds, so you use that\n\n74\n00:03:41.134 --> 00:03:45.560\nto effectively log in and open up the door\nby holding it up against the card reader.\n\n75\n00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.620\nSo it's kind of an all in one device,\nand that's good.\n\n76\n00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:54.110\nBut if you have a magic band,\nlet's say, that is personalized.\n\n77\n00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.390\nThey offer you the ability if go\nonline two weeks ahead and say, hey,\n\n78\n00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.580\nI'm showing up and\nyou're an annual pass holder.\n\n79\n00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.860\nAnd anybody who has kids that lives in\nFlorida will know this cuz they probably\n\n80\n00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.690\nown annual passes.\n\n81\n00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.660\nAnd so when you do this,\nyou actually then are able to say,\n\n82\n00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.340\nhey I'm coming in two weeks, I want to\npick the color of my magic bands and, so\n\n83\n00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.680\nyou can have purple, pink, polka dotted\nmagic bands and all that crazy stuff.\n\n84\n00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.570\nAnd so you show up, and they give\nyou a box when you actually stay.\n\n85\n00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.115\nIf you stay on the grounds at the hotel,\nwith them, in the Disney parks,\n\n86\n00:04:24.115 --> 00:04:27.446\nyou get a box with your magic bands\nin it and they're personalized.\n\n87\n00:04:27.446 --> 00:04:28.583\nThey have your name on them.\n\n88\n00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:31.045\nI've got a drawer full\nof these things at home.\n\n89\n00:04:31.045 --> 00:04:33.240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Every time we go, you get a new set.\n\n90\n00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.020\nAnd it's not like you bring\nyour bands back and reuse them.\n\n91\n00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.030\nObviously, Disney is\ncontracted with somebody.\n\n92\n00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.590\nThey're paying like $0.02 apiece, I'm\nsure, cuz they're buying a gazillion of\n\n93\n00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.380\nthese things and, so as a result, they're\njust giving them out like candy, right?\n\n94\n00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.380\nSo if you stay on the grounds,\n\n95\n00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.050\nyou see everybody's walking\naround with the magic bands.\n\n96\n00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.590\nIt's how they know you're\nstaying in one of their hotels.\n\n97\n00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.620\nSo they're giving you that,\nbut they're personalizing it.\n\n98\n00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.750\nSo you can have a pink one or\na purple one, whatever color you want.\n\n99\n00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.000\nSo all of them work the same way.\n\n100\n00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.960\nBut the idea is that they're all\ninvolved with identity proofing and so\n\n101\n00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.860\nwhen you show up and you do that,\nyou're able to get in.\n\n102\n00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.780\nIf you don't have that because you're\nstaying on the grounds, when you go and\n\n103\n00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.360\nyou get your tickets or\nyou buy like a one day ticket or whatever.\n\n104\n00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.660\nThen they'll give you the equivalent\nto let you scan in for the day and\n\n105\n00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.300\nit's like a single use kinda thing.\n\n106\n00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.520\nHowever you do it, you can't just walk up\nand say well, here's my receipt I paid.\n\n107\n00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.100\nCan you let me in?\n\n108\n00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.050\nBecause that's not the identity\nproofing system that they use,\n\n109\n00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.470\nthey actually sell you a ticket or\ndevice that lets you prove your identity.\n\n110\n00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.820\nCuz they're linking it\nto your biometric scan.\n\n111\n00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:32.648\nSo as a result, identity proofing becomes\nreally important because we have to\n\n112\n00:05:32.648 --> 00:05:35.209\nunderstand how that works\nin the systems we're in.\n\n113\n00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:39.539\nSo a lot of times in many companies,\nyou will have some sort of identity badge.\n\n114\n00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.548\nIt's a smart card typically, it's got your\npicture on it, it's a swipe of some kind,\n\n115\n00:05:43.548 --> 00:05:46.770\nso it's usually got a chip embedded\nin it that'll store identities.\n\n116\n00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.390\nMaybe digital certificates,\nthings like that and\n\n117\n00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.350\nthen you can also put that into a reader.\n\n118\n00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.900\nIn the US military we call them CAC cards,\n\n119\n00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.670\nin the US government and\ngovernment and military.\n\n120\n00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.249\nCommon access control cards,\nalthough we're moving away from those.\n\n121\n00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:59.593\nSlowly but surely, but they use CAC cards.\n\n122\n00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:03.688\nAnd so CAC cards are basically your\nmilitary ID with a chip embedded in it,\n\n123\n00:06:03.688 --> 00:06:06.463\na smart chip that stores\nyour digital identity and\n\n124\n00:06:06.463 --> 00:06:11.041\nis then inserted into a USB reader that\neffectively then opens up a secure system.\n\n125\n00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:14.726\nWhere it let's you log on and get into\nwhatever kinda systems you may need, so\n\n126\n00:06:14.726 --> 00:06:17.277\nwhen you have that kind of\na thought process going on,\n\n127\n00:06:17.277 --> 00:06:19.109\nthat's how we do identity proofing.\n\n128\n00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:21.040\nWe're using that particular tool,\nwhatever it is.\n\n129\n00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.790\nSo, want to be thinking about identity\nproofing and understand that this concept\n\n130\n00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.600\nis really how we begin the process\nof kicking off, getting somebody to\n\n131\n00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.040\nidentify themselves, and ultimately\nthen figure out how that's gonna work.\n\n132\n00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.950\nRemember, we can also\ndo this electronically.\n\n133\n00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.500\nWe often do it electronically,\nwe're not talking individuals.\n\n134\n00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.310\nWe're passing these credentials\nelectronically back and forth.\n\n135\n00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.196\nSo, we talk about the fact that we're\ngoing to automate, but also that we're\n\n136\n00:06:42.196 --> 00:06:44.970\ngonna gather this information and\nstore it electronically in systems.\n\n137\n00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.879\nWe haven't really talked about\nfederation up till now, but\n\n138\n00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:51.380\nfederation of Federated ID Management\nis also very important.\n\n139\n00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.180\nFederation is the idea of extending trust\nto a partner in a business relationship.\n\n140\n00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.930\nSo if Mike and\nI are gonna go into business and\n\n141\n00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.000\nwe're gonna set up two separate\ncompanies that do similar things but\n\n142\n00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.060\nwe're not directly gonna\ncompete with each other.\n\n143\n00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.950\nAs a matter of a fact, one of us may be\nable to supply the other with a critical\n\n144\n00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.500\npart for\ntheir particular item that they're making.\n\n145\n00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.251\nA sprocket or whatever it is.\n\n146\n00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:16.860\nAnd so if Mike's making stuff and\nI can supply raw parts to him,\n\n147\n00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.982\nthen we may develop a relationship that's\njust a buyer, supplier kinda relationship.\n\n148\n00:07:21.982 --> 00:07:25.109\nBut if we wanna take that a little bit\ndeeper, integrate it a little bit more\n\n149\n00:07:25.109 --> 00:07:27.604\nformally, we may choose to\ndo what's called federating.\n\n150\n00:07:27.604 --> 00:07:31.947\nFederating allows Mike and I to negotiate\ntrust relationship between our two\n\n151\n00:07:31.947 --> 00:07:35.638\ncompanies, allows us to tie our\nsystems more closely together.\n\n152\n00:07:35.638 --> 00:07:40.268\nSo Mike may have a provisioning system for\ninventory management that he wants me\n\n153\n00:07:40.268 --> 00:07:44.774\nto tie into, so that I can know when he's\nrunning low on parts that I provide.\n\n154\n00:07:44.774 --> 00:07:46.791\nAnd that I can automatically\nship them to him, and\n\n155\n00:07:46.791 --> 00:07:49.671\nhe doesn't have to worry about getting\non the phone every three days and\n\n156\n00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:52.680\nrunning through a long drawn-out\nprocess of managing inventory.\n\n157\n00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.742\nWe can automate that whole system,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n158\n00:07:54.742 --> 00:07:58.522\nSo what we call JIT, or Just In Time\ndelivery, is something we can set up and\n\n159\n00:07:58.522 --> 00:08:01.342\nuse, but it would have to be\nthrough a federated model So\n\n160\n00:08:01.342 --> 00:08:03.626\nfederation's the idea of extending trust.\n\n161\n00:08:03.626 --> 00:08:07.112\nAnd the idea of trust is identification\nand management of identification of\n\n162\n00:08:07.112 --> 00:08:10.390\nindividuals, so that we understand\nwho they are in authorizing them.\n\n163\n00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.960\nSo, federated ID management,\nvery big area,\n\n164\n00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.050\nvery popular today within access control.\n\n165\n00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.270\nSo we wanna understand\nthe value of federation.\n\n166\n00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.270\nMany businesses that are strategically\npartnering will federate.\n\n167\n00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.183\nWhen we go through a merger and\nacquisition, what we call M and\n\n168\n00:08:25.183 --> 00:08:25.805\nA activity.\n\n169\n00:08:25.805 --> 00:08:29.900\nWhen we buy a company,\nwe effectively are acquiring their assets.\n\n170\n00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.000\nWe may actually choose to federate with\nthe IT infrastructure, as opposed to just\n\n171\n00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.180\ngobbling it up, and consuming it\ndirectly for a period of time.\n\n172\n00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.670\nSo we can integrate\nthe directory services.\n\n173\n00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:42.280\nWe can integrate the messaging services,\nthings like that.\n\n174\n00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.510\nIt's easier to federate, to extend trust\nto do that, than it is to potentially just\n\n175\n00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.562\nconsume everything, and\ntry to pour it all into our system.\n\n176\n00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:51.956\nMaking it really difficult to do that\nbased on the kinds of systems we're\n\n177\n00:08:51.956 --> 00:08:52.477\ndealing with.\n\n178\n00:08:52.477 --> 00:08:55.966\nSo instead of keeping them totally\nisolated and separate we may effectively\n\n179\n00:08:55.966 --> 00:08:59.140\nbuild a trust bridge and the trust\nbridge is the federation concept.\n\n180\n00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.830\nThat's what we often refer to it as.\n\n181\n00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.590\nSo just want to think about that and\nobviously understand that.\n\n182\n00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.300\nWe use certain languages,\ncertain security languages and\n\n183\n00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.810\nprotocols to be able to\ndrive these concepts.\n\n184\n00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.460\nI've mentioned SSAML, security search and\n\n185\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.890\nmarkup language, in one of our episodes\nat some point prior to this conversation.\n\n186\n00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.850\nBut it was I'm sure just in passing,\ndidn't really spend a lot of time on it.\n\n187\n00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.370\nSSAML is, currently version 2.0,\n\n188\n00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:24.870\nis the version of an XML based protocol\nthat is gonna effectively be used\n\n189\n00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.950\nto be able to drive a lot of these\nsecurity things that we're talking about.\n\n190\n00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:32.170\nWe use it to be able to\npass security information,\n\n191\n00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:36.720\npass what we call assertions back and\nforth with regards to authentication,\n\n192\n00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.570\nwith regards to authorization,\nwith regards to identity.\n\n193\n00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.670\nSo, we're effectively\ngonna use this language,\n\n194\n00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:45.140\nit's kind of an accepted standard language\nthat most systems can understand and\n\n195\n00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.150\nuse to effectively drive authentication\nin many of our systems today.\n\n196\n00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.480\nSo, SSAML is a language that the security\npractitioners, security professional,\n\n197\n00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.110\nthe CISSP would definitely wanna make\nsure they are aware of the necessity,\n\n198\n00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.220\nheard about before.\n\n199\n00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.550\nThat they have knowledge of and\nthat they identify, and assert, or\n\n200\n00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.540\nrather coordinate and really think\nof with regards to access control.\n\n201\n00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.430\nThis is where we tend to see SSAML.\n\n202\n00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.228\nSo SSAML relies on a bunch\nof different standards.\n\n203\n00:10:10.228 --> 00:10:12.754\nThe most important one\nis the XML language,\n\n204\n00:10:12.754 --> 00:10:16.721\nbecause XML really underlies what\nSSAML is and what it's able to do.\n\n205\n00:10:16.721 --> 00:10:18.680\nAnd so XML is used with SSAML.\n\n206\n00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:22.371\nWe use SOAP, which is a service\noriented architecture for\n\n207\n00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:24.690\nbeing able to provide services.\n\n208\n00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.190\nWe're gonna use HTTP, so\n\n209\n00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.370\nweb related protocols are used\nas part of SSAML as well.\n\n210\n00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.260\nSo these are all things that SSAML\nrelies on, to be able to do its job.\n\n211\n00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:36.800\nWhen we think about using SSAML,\nwe often interact with a new SSAML\n\n212\n00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.750\nwhich is known as credential management\nsystem, or a credentialing system.\n\n213\n00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.260\nCredential management system is\neffectively a system that automates and\n\n214\n00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.950\nmanages this entire life cycle\nwe've been talking about.\n\n215\n00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.940\nIt'll often keep a history of all\nthe users that have been provisioned,\n\n216\n00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.970\nwhen they've accessed something,\nwhat they've done,\n\n217\n00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:56.390\nwhere they've gone,\nhow often they've used something.\n\n218\n00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.140\nWhen was the last time they logged in,\nfrom where?\n\n219\n00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.200\nWhat did they wanna do?\n\n220\n00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.390\nWhere did they go?\n\n221\n00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.490\nSo it'll enforce the complexity and\n\n222\n00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.500\nstrong password requirements,\nwe often have in a system.\n\n223\n00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.910\nIt will find passwords and\nauthenticate them.\n\n224\n00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.710\nIt will find users and authenticate them.\n\n225\n00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.380\nIt will be able to limit access so\nit can cut off access.\n\n226\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:19.959\nIf some sort of conditions have been\nset up in the system where we say,\n\n227\n00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:22.922\nhey, don't allow people in after such and\nsuch time, or\n\n228\n00:11:22.922 --> 00:11:27.147\ndon't allow this person into this area,\nand they try to get in it blocks access.\n\n229\n00:11:27.147 --> 00:11:30.176\nSo it could control things\nlike smart car door readers,\n\n230\n00:11:30.176 --> 00:11:32.990\nit could control log on\nattempts at a system.\n\n231\n00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.740\nThese credential management systems could\nbe linked to all these other areas and\n\n232\n00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:39.070\nintegrated so\nthat effectively is the brains for\n\n233\n00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.810\nthe authentication behind\nall these systems.\n\n234\n00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.580\nSo we do just wanna be thinking\nabout that and be aware of it.\n\n235\n00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.830\nBut like anything else,\nrisk associated with this, right?\n\n236\n00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.420\nCould be a single point of failure.\n\n237\n00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:51.886\nSo if the credential e-management system\nbecomes unavailable, nobody's gonna be\n\n238\n00:11:51.886 --> 00:11:54.929\nable to authenticate, this obviously\ncan prove to be a bit of a challenge.\n\n239\n00:11:54.929 --> 00:11:58.540\nWe may have certain expectations\nof how the system will work.\n\n240\n00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.210\nIf we're not clear on what those\nexpectations are with the vendor,\n\n241\n00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.690\nand they get implemented\na different way than we wanted.\n\n242\n00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.120\nThese tend to be complex systems.\n\n243\n00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.990\nYou're not gonna go out and\nbuild this yourself.\n\n244\n00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.941\nYou don't get this from conventional\nmanagement systems or us, right.\n\n245\n00:12:09.941 --> 00:12:11.278\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is a pretty complex thing.\n\n246\n00:12:11.278 --> 00:12:13.415\nYou're gonna go out and\nbuy this from a vendor.\n\n247\n00:12:13.415 --> 00:12:17.603\nBig companies like IBM,\nlike Hewitt-Packer do this kind of work.\n\n248\n00:12:17.603 --> 00:12:20.625\nSo you're gonna have to go to a big vendor\nthat's gonna come and integrate this for\n\n249\n00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:22.133\nyou and install and configure it.\n\n250\n00:12:22.133 --> 00:12:24.795\nAnd you're gonna have to spend time\nunderstanding how to do requirements\n\n251\n00:12:24.795 --> 00:12:28.775\ngathering, and ultimately understand how\nto have the right expectations about how\n\n252\n00:12:28.775 --> 00:12:30.775\nto implement this system and\nintegrate it so\n\n253\n00:12:30.775 --> 00:12:32.805\nthat it does the things that you\nultimately you want it to do.\n\n254\n00:12:32.805 --> 00:12:34.290\nIt's gonna be very important.\n\n255\n00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.620\nWe also have to think about identity\nfrom the perspective of the cloud today.\n\n256\n00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:40.240\nWe think about identity in the cloud,\n\n257\n00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.340\nwe're thinking about identity as\na service, what's called IDAS.\n\n258\n00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.250\nID, as a service.\n\n259\n00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.590\nThis is another as a service concept.\n\n260\n00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:50.370\nWe have SAS, software as a service, PAS,\n\n261\n00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:54.110\nplatform as a service, IAS,\ninfrastructure as a service, and\n\n262\n00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:58.550\nwe have many other somethings as\na service, in the cloud ecosystem today.\n\n263\n00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:01.060\nIdentity as a service\nis one of those things.\n\n264\n00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.880\nSo IDAS is another accepted\nas a service model.\n\n265\n00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.770\nIt allows us to effectively\nhave cloud-based services\n\n266\n00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.650\nthat broker identity and\ncontrol access management functions.\n\n267\n00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.405\nSo access management through the cloud,\nis what identity, as a service, is.\n\n268\n00:13:14.405 --> 00:13:18.415\nIt combines administration,\naccount provisioning, authentication,\n\n269\n00:13:18.415 --> 00:13:20.545\nauthorization and reporting.\n\n270\n00:13:20.545 --> 00:13:22.135\nSo it combines all these things together.\n\n271\n00:13:22.135 --> 00:13:25.895\nAnd allows us to have a cloud based\ninterface that's available to anybody,\n\n272\n00:13:25.895 --> 00:13:29.335\nmore or less, without exception,\nas long as you authenticate from anywhere.\n\n273\n00:13:29.335 --> 00:13:33.355\nAnd allows you then to be able\nto essentially spread identity\n\n274\n00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:36.460\nwidely across the organization,\nand manage it through the crowd.\n\n275\n00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.850\nSo deals with identity governance and\nadministration, deals with access control,\n\n276\n00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:44.710\ndeals with intelligence, analytics and\nreporting around who's doing what and\n\n277\n00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.360\nwhat areas under what conditions, so\nwe can get very detailed pictures and\n\n278\n00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.440\nviews of what's happening\nwithin our systems.\n\n279\n00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.340\nThese are all good things.\n\n280\n00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.480\nSo we just wanna make\nsure we're aware of this.\n\n281\n00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.150\nThe features and\nbenefits of iDash were numerous.\n\n282\n00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.390\nBut certainly single sign-on is important.\n\n283\n00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.600\nGovernance is important as a feature, and\n\n284\n00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.440\na thought process about what\nthese systems can provide.\n\n285\n00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.670\nThey can provide auditability,\ntraceability, and visibility\n\n286\n00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.300\ninto the identity provisioning system, so\nwe wanna make sure we are aware of that.\n\n287\n00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.340\nGranular access control and granular\nauthentication controls can be applied.\n\n288\n00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:17.830\nSo they're very granular to manage\ndown to the individual user level.\n\n289\n00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.430\nSo we do wanna keep that in mind.\n\n290\n00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.410\nBut some of the downsides,\nthe risks associated with these systems.\n\n291\n00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.640\nWe may be using proprietary\nvendor driven API's.\n\n292\n00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.430\nWe may not understand it in other words\nwhat the software really is and does and\n\n293\n00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:32.560\nthe vendor may have very\nspecific data formats and\n\n294\n00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.330\nunique ways of doing things that can\nlead to what's called vendor lock in,\n\n295\n00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.650\nwhich means that you may be stuck with\nthat vendor and stuck with that sysadmin.\n\n296\n00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.100\nAnd that may or\nmay not be a good thing for you.\n\n297\n00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.350\nYou just wanna be aware of that and\nobviously understand that.\n\n298\n00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.870\nWe obviously have to think about how we're\ngonna audit these systems in the cloud.\n\n299\n00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.300\nHow do we have control over them?\n\n300\n00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.190\nWe may be partnering with\na third party vendor,\n\n301\n00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.790\nessentially giving them the identity\naccess and management control\n\n302\n00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.420\nfrom our system and saying, hey, you're\ngonna manage it in the cloud for me.\n\n303\n00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.420\nAnd if we've done that, it may be hard for\nus to understand what's happening, because\n\n304\n00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.060\nthe cloud vendor is now essentially gonna\npull the levers and control the data.\n\n305\n00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:07.440\nAgain, something to think about,\nsomething to be aware of.\n\n306\n00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.680\nSo, while there may be a lot of value\nhere, there's also potentially downsides.\n\n307\n00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:13.990\nRemember, CISSP's have to first and\n\n308\n00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:18.290\nforemost understand how to identify risk,\narticulate risk to the business.\n\n309\n00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.160\nAnd then think about the best way\nto approach and manage that risk.\n\n310\n00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.680\nAnd we have four acceptable ways\nof approaching and managing risk.\n\n311\n00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.350\nRight?\n\n312\n00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:26.980\nAnd no, Mike,\nI'm not gonna ask you what they are.\n\n313\n00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.318\n>> No, I had already [LAUGH]-\n>> I'm not gonna put you on the spot,\n\n314\n00:15:29.318 --> 00:15:32.398\nbecause I don't want you to feel like\nevery time I ask you something it's\n\n315\n00:15:32.398 --> 00:15:34.435\nbecause I think you're\nnot paying attention.\n\n316\n00:15:34.435 --> 00:15:38.230\nSo I'm not gonna ask Mike, what I am\ngonna do is ask all of you however right?\n\n317\n00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:42.100\nBecause you need to know what the four\nstandard ways of dealing with risk are.\n\n318\n00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.971\nSo what we're gonna do is we're gonna stop\nhere and we're gonna wait until you answer\n\n319\n00:15:45.971 --> 00:15:48.463\nus, if you don't answer us\nwe're never coming back.\n\n320\n00:15:48.463 --> 00:15:50.076\n>> Maybe a little Jeopardy,\ntick tock, tick tock.\n\n321\n00:15:50.076 --> 00:15:51.816\n>> Mike and I actually have tickets for\n\n322\n00:15:51.816 --> 00:15:54.600\nStar Wars which is why we're\ndoing this whole thing, but\n\n323\n00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.912\nWe need some sort of Jeopardy music or\nsomething like that, right.\n\n324\n00:15:57.912 --> 00:16:00.036\nLittle score board behind us.\n\n325\n00:16:00.036 --> 00:16:03.087\nMaybe we do the thing like they do in\nthe bars, where you have the trivia\n\n326\n00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:05.950\nwith the wireless things and\nthey can all buzz the answers right.\n\n327\n00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.550\n>> I'd like that.\n>> That would be kind of cool, right.\n\n328\n00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:08.860\nWe could do live quizzes.\n\n329\n00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.120\nAll right.\nSo since nobody's buzzed in with that and\n\n330\n00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.660\nnobody's invented that and\nset that up and linked it here,\n\n331\n00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.550\nwhat we're gonna do instead is give\nyou the answers to those four things.\n\n332\n00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.850\nSo what I asked was, hey what are the four\nacceptable ways we deal with risk?\n\n333\n00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:20.370\nRight?\n\n334\n00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.400\nSo we can, in no particular order,\nnot prioritized,\n\n335\n00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.740\njust any way you would like to name them.\n\n336\n00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:24.940\nWe can accept risk.\n\n337\n00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:26.020\nWe can avoid risk.\n\n338\n00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.540\nWe can transfer risk.\n\n339\n00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.950\nAnd or we can mitigate risk.\n\n340\n00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.220\nMitigating is to minimize.\n\n341\n00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.430\nRight?\nSo we can do any or all these things.\n\n342\n00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.320\nCISSPs are suppose to understand\nhow to deal with risk.\n\n343\n00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.240\nThis is one of the primary\njob functions we engage in.\n\n344\n00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.910\nUnderstanding the value proposition, but\n\n345\n00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:45.290\nalso understanding the dark side,\nthe liability of the risk,\n\n346\n00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.550\nassociated with this kind of technology,\nis very important for you to be aware of.\n\n347\n00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:51.640\nSo, just think about that, make sure\nwe're thinking about the value, but\n\n348\n00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.250\nalso the risk associated with the cloud,\nall right?\n\n349\n00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.470\nAll right.\nSo we also have the ability to\n\n350\n00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.570\nnot just look at identity as a service but\n\n351\n00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:04.110\nalso look at security token service\nproviders, what are called STS providers.\n\n352\n00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:07.070\nThese are providers that\nprovide token services and\n\n353\n00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:09.105\nare then able to allow us to consume them.\n\n354\n00:17:09.105 --> 00:17:12.400\nBecause remember,\nyour tokens are going to be hardware or\n\n355\n00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.260\nsoftware driven but\nthey're application or software and\n\n356\n00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.890\nhardware interfaces that we have\nto get from another vendor.\n\n357\n00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.170\nThis is not something\nwe created on our own,\n\n358\n00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:22.570\nwe're not able to start going out and\nstart creating tokens.\n\n359\n00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:23.850\nSo we have to buy this service.\n\n360\n00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:27.290\nSo the way we buy it is we consume it\nthrough what is known as an STS provider,\n\n361\n00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.450\nthe Security Token Service provider.\n\n362\n00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:33.470\nJust want to make sure you're aware of the\nconcept and that there's a formal name for\n\n363\n00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:36.370\nthat, it's called\na Security Token Service provider.\n\n364\n00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.810\nWant to mention in the next kind\nof part of our conversation,\n\n365\n00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.840\nI want to mention a little bit what\nthe access control models are.\n\n366\n00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.873\nI have been going on and on about them\nin various episodes and talked about\n\n367\n00:17:46.873 --> 00:17:50.350\ndifferent examples of them, so I want\nto just formally define a few for you.\n\n368\n00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:54.038\nWe have Role Based Access Control\ncommonly referred to as RBAC.\n\n369\n00:17:54.038 --> 00:17:57.250\nA role based access\ncontrol model is a model\n\n370\n00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:02.090\nthat is going to effectively describe\naccess and give control to certain roles.\n\n371\n00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:07.140\nAnd say, okay, backup operators get this\nright, data administrators get this,\n\n372\n00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.480\nguests have this, and\nnormal users have that.\n\n373\n00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.680\nThat's a role based access control model.\n\n374\n00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.430\nSo it's the standard model we think of in\nWindows when we assign users to groups,\n\n375\n00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.840\nright, and then we give groups rights.\n\n376\n00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.280\nThat's effectively a role\nbased access control model.\n\n377\n00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.440\nSo want to know about\nrole-based access control?\n\n378\n00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.200\nWe can have different kinds of\nrole based access control models.\n\n379\n00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.750\nWe can have what's known as non-RBAC,\nthat's essentially managing by exception,\n\n380\n00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.870\nas the name implies,\nnot using role-based administration, but\n\n381\n00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:37.870\nrather managing directly\nto the individual user.\n\n382\n00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.550\nSo we call that formally managing by\nexception, but the reality is we go to\n\n383\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.430\nan individual user, give them rights and\navoid putting them into a role or\n\n384\n00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.990\na group that's called non-RBAC,\nthat's what we call it.\n\n385\n00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:53.870\nLimited RBAC management or\nlimited RBAC application may be used for\n\n386\n00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:57.710\ncertain users to be put into groups,\nbut others may be managed outside that.\n\n387\n00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.870\nSo it's just a limited implementation for\nmaybe a small segment of the population.\n\n388\n00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:04.580\nWe could have what's known as hybrid RBAC.\n\n389\n00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:08.750\nThis is where users are mapped to multiple\napplication roles that could be given\n\n390\n00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.790\ndifferent levels of access or\ndiffering levels of access.\n\n391\n00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.150\nBut they may also be managed\noutside it as an individual\n\n392\n00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:16.350\nas opposed to a member of a group.\n\n393\n00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.200\nAnd then we have what's\nknown as full RBAC.\n\n394\n00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.790\nFull RBAC is just RBAC.\n\n395\n00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.860\nIt's where we're putting\neverybody into a role and\n\n396\n00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.190\nassigning them rights based on that.\n\n397\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.960\nSo we have different RBAC applications or\ndifferent implementations of RBAC.\n\n398\n00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.530\nWanna make sure we're familiar with.\n\n399\n00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:33.260\nObviously the benefits of an RBAC system\nis that we're gonna be able to manage\n\n400\n00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.880\nnot the individual user and\nassign permissions to them as a one-off.\n\n401\n00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.490\nWe follow the rule, and obviously,\n\n402\n00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.870\ndo it the right way, and\nwe use a full RBAC implementation.\n\n403\n00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:46.990\nBut rather, we are going to be\nable to assign access control and\n\n404\n00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:50.390\nassign permissions to the group level,\nor the role level.\n\n405\n00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:54.730\nAs a result of that, we can move users in\nout of role, in and out of group without\n\n406\n00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.870\nmessing up the permission assignments,\nand it's much easier to provision users.\n\n407\n00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.950\nIf you have to give the same\npermission to five users,\n\n408\n00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.290\nyou can probably do that five times in\na row without making a mistake, but\n\n409\n00:20:05.290 --> 00:20:08.360\nwhat about 500 users, maybe a little\nbit more difficult to do that.\n\n410\n00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:12.470\nAnd it's not an unrealistic thought\nprocess to say you may have 500 users you\n\n411\n00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:13.410\nhave to provision, right?\n\n412\n00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.370\nThat may not be unrealistic.\n\n413\n00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:18.780\nSo we wanna think about ways we can\nautomate and scale up quickly, but\n\n414\n00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.470\nalso keep errors at a minimum, and this\nis why these models make a lot of sense.\n\n415\n00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:26.900\nWe also have rule-based access control,\nanother thought process\n\n416\n00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.790\nthat sounds similar in the sense that the\nacronym, in theory, could also be RBAC.\n\n417\n00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.800\nBut we actually don't\nrefer to it that way.\n\n418\n00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.540\nWe use RBAC for role based, and we say\nrule based is a actually rule based so\n\n419\n00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.700\nwe spell that out.\n\n420\n00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:42.320\nSo rule based access control is the\nclassic example would be a firewall where\n\n421\n00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.690\nyou have a set of rules that\nare governing behavior.\n\n422\n00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:47.040\nYou have to match up against\nthose rules to be allowed or\n\n423\n00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:49.790\ndenied access as the rules indicate.\n\n424\n00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:54.356\nSo if you have a rule that says people\ncoming from this particular IP address or\n\n425\n00:20:54.356 --> 00:20:57.798\nthis particular subnet range\nare gonna be allowed in, but\n\n426\n00:20:57.798 --> 00:21:01.965\npeople coming from these other subnet\nranges or IP addresses are not.\n\n427\n00:21:01.965 --> 00:21:05.240\nThat's an example of a rule\nbased access control solution.\n\n428\n00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.570\nWe would put that rule\ninto a filtering device or\n\n429\n00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.720\na border gateway device of some kind.\n\n430\n00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.610\nWe would then implement filtering at\nthat particular point of access and\n\n431\n00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:17.010\nif you pass the rule, if you are\nsuccessful, you match and you get in and\n\n432\n00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:18.210\nif you're not you don't.\n\n433\n00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:22.330\nMost of these systems have a catch all\nrule at the bottom that says deny all.\n\n434\n00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.300\nRight.\nSo if you don't meet any of the criteria\n\n435\n00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.010\nfor the other rules we essentially don't\nallow you to engage in that activity.\n\n436\n00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:30.510\nThis is how a rule-based\naccess control model may work.\n\n437\n00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:33.660\nWe've talked about MAC,\nMandatory Access Control models, as well.\n\n438\n00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.230\nThis is where we label with\nsensitivity labels the user and\n\n439\n00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.980\nthe data, and then we effectively\ngo in and we manage the levels.\n\n440\n00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:45.730\nAnd we say if the user is at level two and\ndata is at level two, then the user and\n\n441\n00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.440\nthe data can effectively interact.\n\n442\n00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.530\nThe user is at level two, and the data's\nat level three, user and data do not\n\n443\n00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:55.450\ninteract, right, because obviously the\ndata's classified higher than the user.\n\n444\n00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.040\nSo, you want to think about\nthat understand that.\n\n445\n00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.270\nObviously, the system owner and the\ninformation owner have to coordinate here.\n\n446\n00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:05.050\nSystem owner is the owner that\nimplements the Mac system.\n\n447\n00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:08.950\nThe information owner is the owner of the\ninformation that system may be protecting.\n\n448\n00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:12.210\nAnd the two have to work together\nbecause the information owner\n\n449\n00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.705\nis going to classify information.\n\n450\n00:22:13.705 --> 00:22:16.360\nThe system owner is going\nto classify the users.\n\n451\n00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.830\nAnd the two have to work together\nto ensure that the proper\n\n452\n00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:23.230\nstructure is set up and the proper levels\nof classification are going to be met.\n\n453\n00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.335\nSo want to think about that,\nwe have Discretionary Access Control,\n\n454\n00:22:26.335 --> 00:22:30.900\nDAC, probably the most widely\nused access control model today,\n\n455\n00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.460\nthis is the one we're probably all\nfamiliar with Windows generically,\n\n456\n00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.140\nyou go in and you create a document, you\ngo in and you have a permission list for\n\n457\n00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.210\nsharing or for security and\nyou assign a user certain rights.\n\n458\n00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.656\nThat's a discretionary\naccess control model,\n\n459\n00:22:43.656 --> 00:22:47.889\nthis is effectively where the owner of the\ndata is placing the control's in place and\n\n460\n00:22:47.889 --> 00:22:50.587\nspecifying who exactly will or\nwill not gain access.\n\n461\n00:22:50.587 --> 00:22:54.790\nThis is discretionary access controls, so\nwe wanna make sure we are aware of that.\n\n462\n00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:57.070\nSo, these are the common\naccess control models, right,\n\n463\n00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:58.920\nthe most common ones we often find.\n\n464\n00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:03.110\nWe also have to be thinking about the fact\nthat we can attack authentication systems.\n\n465\n00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:04.076\nVariety of ways to do that.\n\n466\n00:23:04.076 --> 00:23:06.010\nWe've talked about a lot of those already,\nbut\n\n467\n00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.960\nwe can go ahead and\ntry to steal the passwords, and\n\n468\n00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:12.330\nwe've talked about the value of a rainbow\ntable in one of our prior conversations,\n\n469\n00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:15.510\nprior episode, with regards to\ncryptography and how that works.\n\n470\n00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.627\nAnd if you remember the idea behind a\nrainbow table, it's a precomputed list of\n\n471\n00:23:19.627 --> 00:23:23.808\nhash values that effectively allows us,\nwhen it's put into a password cracking\n\n472\n00:23:23.808 --> 00:23:27.617\nprogram or a program of some kind that\ncan brute force to go walk through and\n\n473\n00:23:27.617 --> 00:23:32.260\nfind the match and essentially then allow\nus to validate the password and log on.\n\n474\n00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.350\nSo access control attacks can take\nthe form of things like that.\n\n475\n00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:39.190\nWe may be able to socially engineer those\npieces of information out from underneath\n\n476\n00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.280\nsomebody and take them away.\n\n477\n00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.270\nAnd say hey,\n\n478\n00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:45.170\nMike, I see that's a cool lanyard you\nhave on your neck there with that card.\n\n479\n00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.722\nIt's kind of cool, what is that?\n\n480\n00:23:46.722 --> 00:23:48.846\nAnd Mike might not know who I am,\nand we're just talking.\n\n481\n00:23:48.846 --> 00:23:52.041\nMaybe Mike's out to lunch, and\nMike forgot the number one rule,\n\n482\n00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:55.950\nthe number one policy is take your Access\nbadge off when you leave the building.\n\n483\n00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.285\nDon't just leave it in your pocket.\n\n484\n00:23:57.285 --> 00:23:58.830\nI love when I see that, by the way.\n\n485\n00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.890\nPeople do one of these things, right?\n\n486\n00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.070\nThey have this, or whatever this is,\nit's hanging on the shirt.\n\n487\n00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.860\nAnd instead of taking it off\nthe right way and putting it away,\n\n488\n00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.700\nthey kind of stick it here so\nyou have the lanyard that has the name of\n\n489\n00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.620\nthe company and\nyou see the top of the card.\n\n490\n00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:14.820\nYou can tell, well duh,\nyou work for Boeing?\n\n491\n00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.660\nHow hard is that to figure out, right?\n\n492\n00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.230\nSo, I love when people do that.\n\n493\n00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:22.018\nOr the other one, they wear it down on the\nbottom, kinda like over here on the belt.\n\n494\n00:24:22.018 --> 00:24:24.739\nCuz they have a little clip, and they can\npull it out with whatever that thing is,\n\n495\n00:24:24.739 --> 00:24:25.530\nit's a string.\n\n496\n00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.360\nAnd so they leave it there, thinking,\nwell, nobody's gonna see it.\n\n497\n00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.675\nAnd of course that thing twirls around.\n\n498\n00:24:29.675 --> 00:24:31.852\nSo every so often, you're walking,\nit flips around, and\n\n499\n00:24:31.852 --> 00:24:33.950\nI can see your smiling face\nalong with your company name.\n\n500\n00:24:35.305 --> 00:24:38.290\nSo, I love when people just\nthink they know better, right?\n\n501\n00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:42.510\nIt's clearly evident that, from a security\nprofessional standpoint, one of\n\n502\n00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:47.840\nthe biggest highlights of our day is what\nis, what I'd call user jeopardy, right?\n\n503\n00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.755\nWhich is,\nwhat are users gonna do wrong next, right?\n\n504\n00:24:50.755 --> 00:24:51.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because it's so\n\n505\n00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.110\nobvious that users just sometimes, I mean,\nusers are good, sometimes they get it.\n\n506\n00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:57.360\nSometimes they don't, right?\n\n507\n00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.810\nThey just think they know\nbetter than everybody.\n\n508\n00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:03.113\nSo they're gonna do what they wanna do\nbecause they do is just never gonna cause\n\n509\n00:25:03.113 --> 00:25:04.429\nany problems, right?\n\n510\n00:25:04.429 --> 00:25:07.080\nSo this happens all the time,\nyou've seen this time and again.\n\n511\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.840\nSo if somebody does something like that,\nwalks out with a badge, and\n\n512\n00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.400\nwe can tell who they work for.\n\n513\n00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.130\nThat may be leading us down the road,\nthrough social engineering, to ultimately,\n\n514\n00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.890\nmaybe be able to steal their credential,\nor find out more about them.\n\n515\n00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:20.100\nSo, these are the kind of things\nwe don't often think about, but\n\n516\n00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.530\nwe have to think about.\n\n517\n00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.480\nDo you wear logo wear when you travel?\n\n518\n00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.870\nSo, for instance, my nice ITPro.TV shirt.\n\n519\n00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.440\nI appreciate the shirt, I'm gonna wear it\nproudly when I'm not here, but guess what,\n\n520\n00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.570\nI'm not wearing it when I get on a plane,\nright?\n\n521\n00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:33.700\nBecause I don't want people\nto know who I work for.\n\n522\n00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.180\nThat's just a common sense thing,\nespecially today.\n\n523\n00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.330\nBut yet, when I travel I see\ntons of business people, right?\n\n524\n00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:43.940\nProudly displaying their logo and\ntheir company on their shirt pocket.\n\n525\n00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.870\nWhich is great for business but\n\n526\n00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:50.150\nnot so good if somebody's trying to target\nyou and find out who are and what you do.\n\n527\n00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:51.930\nSo again, these are kind of\nthe things you wanna think about.\n\n528\n00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.000\nI love the backpack.\n\n529\n00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.650\nThey got the whole thing,\nthe whole ensemble.\n\n530\n00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:57.500\nThey got the thing, they got the logo,\nthey got the backpack.\n\n531\n00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.050\nThey've got the computer with\nthe big sticker with the logo on it.\n\n532\n00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:01.010\nThey're decked out.\n\n533\n00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:03.808\nNo matter where you are, you're gonna\nknow exactly who they work for, right?\n\n534\n00:26:03.808 --> 00:26:05.570\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And I'm sure when we go back and\n\n535\n00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:08.540\ntalk to the security function\nin that organization, and\n\n536\n00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.720\nwe ask them if they have a policy\nthat talks about travel and\n\n537\n00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.530\nmaking sure people\nare safe when they travel.\n\n538\n00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.872\nThey will tell us, yeah, we don't want our\npeople wearing our logo when they travel,\n\n539\n00:26:17.872 --> 00:26:19.778\ncuz we don't want them to be targets.\n\n540\n00:26:19.778 --> 00:26:20.358\nWow, really?\n\n541\n00:26:20.358 --> 00:26:21.805\nWell guess what.\n\n542\n00:26:21.805 --> 00:26:24.575\nYou may wanna do a refresher on that,\nright,\n\n543\n00:26:24.575 --> 00:26:26.745\nbecause there seems to be\na little bit of disconnect there.\n\n544\n00:26:26.745 --> 00:26:29.035\nSo it's kind of the thing we want\nto be thinking about as well.\n\n545\n00:26:29.035 --> 00:26:33.764\nRight, so obviously protecting against\naccess control attacks, very important.\n\n546\n00:26:33.764 --> 00:26:36.832\nWe wanna just remind ourselves quickly,\nas we're getting ready to wrap up.\n\n547\n00:26:36.832 --> 00:26:40.552\nKind of thinking about access control,\nand the identity management lifecycle.\n\n548\n00:26:40.552 --> 00:26:43.052\nWant to think about\na slightly different take.\n\n549\n00:26:43.052 --> 00:26:45.762\nI want to roll it up into\na three stage solution for you.\n\n550\n00:26:45.762 --> 00:26:50.112\nWe talked before about thinking of it\nfrom the perspective of being identity.\n\n551\n00:26:50.112 --> 00:26:53.227\nThinking of it as being then,\nauthenticating, authorizing and\n\n552\n00:26:53.227 --> 00:26:56.780\nthen auditing or accounting, right,\nkeeping track of everything.\n\n553\n00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:57.580\nSo we want to know that.\n\n554\n00:26:57.580 --> 00:27:00.120\nAnd then we also want to\nthink about specifically\n\n555\n00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.810\nthe identity management lifecycle.\n\n556\n00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.090\nSo the first part of that specifically for\n\n557\n00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:07.040\nidentity as being how do we\ncreate an issue identity?\n\n558\n00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.470\nHow do we manage it as being provisioning?\n\n559\n00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.150\nWe provision identities.\n\n560\n00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:14.480\nWe review them periodically to ensure that\nthere's still valid that they're good.\n\n561\n00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.240\nAnd if there's a problem,\nwe revoke them, right?\n\n562\n00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:18.890\nWe get rid of them.\n\n563\n00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:20.900\nWe no longer see them as being useful.\n\n564\n00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:26.246\nSo the identity management lifecycle is\nprovisioning, review and then revocation.\n\n565\n00:27:26.246 --> 00:27:29.820\nProvisioning, review and revocation.\n\n566\n00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.790\nVery important, just to have a sense of\nthat to understand the concept there.\n\n567\n00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:33.970\nAll right, so\n\n568\n00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:37.730\nhaving gone over the identity lifecycle\nin terms of identity management.\n\n569\n00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:42.630\nThe overall access control lifecycle\nfrom identity through accounting and\n\n570\n00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:44.998\ntalking about all\nthe different ways we do this.\n\n571\n00:27:44.998 --> 00:27:47.690\nWhat I wanna just leave you with as\na parting thought is the following.\n\n572\n00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:51.370\nIn this domain in particular, the access\ncontrol domain that we're talking about,\n\n573\n00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:51.960\nidentity and\n\n574\n00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.110\naccess management, domain five of\nthe body of knowledge in the CISSP.\n\n575\n00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:59.550\nWe're talking about a lot of\nthings that are not only new here,\n\n576\n00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.890\nin some cases they are, but we're starting\nto stitch together, starting to bring\n\n577\n00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:05.820\ntogether a lot of information that\nwe've referenced in other areas.\n\n578\n00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.182\nYou've heard me reference a lot in\nthis particular series of episodes,\n\n579\n00:28:09.182 --> 00:28:12.610\nhey we've said that in another episode,\nhey didn't we talk about that?\n\n580\n00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.130\nWasn't that something we said three or\nfour times in other places?\n\n581\n00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:17.470\nYou're starting to see that and\nhear that more.\n\n582\n00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:18.670\nThere's a reason for that.\n\n583\n00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:22.040\nWe want you to make connections back to\nprior knowledge, but we also want you to\n\n584\n00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:26.580\nunderstand that as much as a mile wide\ninch deep mastery of knowledge implies\n\n585\n00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.820\nlearning the important new things,\nit also implies something else.\n\n586\n00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:34.540\nIt implies being to link to the knowledge\nwe've given you another areas and\n\n587\n00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.240\nusing it in a slightly different context.\n\n588\n00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.300\nA slightly different\nway within this domain.\n\n589\n00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.590\nSo when we talk about the value and\nthe importance of cryptography for\n\n590\n00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:43.560\ninstance, right?\n\n591\n00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.131\nAnd confidentiality protection, with\nregards to data that's being transited and\n\n592\n00:28:48.131 --> 00:28:52.440\nhow we can use that to offset the lack of\na potential problem with access controls\n\n593\n00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.220\nduring transmission.\n\n594\n00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.140\nYou wanna make the connection that\ncryptography is important for\n\n595\n00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.310\naccess management, right?\n\n596\n00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:00.950\nAnd we wanna know how to link\nthat knowledge in order to be\n\n597\n00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:02.440\nsuccessful on the exam.\n\n598\n00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.380\nSo as you hear me say hey,\n\n599\n00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.900\nwe've talked about that before,\nthis is something you've seen,\n\n600\n00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.110\nthis is a good connection, you want\nto start thinking along those lines.\n\n601\n00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.852\nWe call that synthesizing information.\n\n602\n00:29:10.852 --> 00:29:13.500\nYou wanna be able to take two\ndistinctly different things and\n\n603\n00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.850\nput them together to effectively\nsynthesize something new.\n\n604\n00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.916\nAs a new context or\nnew perspective on how to manage and\n\n605\n00:29:19.916 --> 00:29:22.246\nsee and apply this information, okay?\n\n606\n00:29:22.246 --> 00:29:23.024\n>> Very good, Adam.\n\n607\n00:29:23.024 --> 00:29:26.379\nAgain, just a ton of information and\ngreat information, love it.\n\n608\n00:29:26.379 --> 00:29:30.175\nWe took a long look at managing\nidentities and access.\n\n609\n00:29:30.175 --> 00:29:34.122\nAs we said at the beginning,\nlot of moving parts to the whole picture.\n\n610\n00:29:34.122 --> 00:29:38.590\nAll right, remember, if you guys want to\nsee or attend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n611\n00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:42.400\nmake sure you shoot us\nan email at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n612\n00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.340\nThat's gonna do for\nthis episode, signing off,\n\n613\n00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.430\nI'm Mike Roderick\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n614\n00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:48.129\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n615\n00:29:48.129 --> 00:29:54.040\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:17.188\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.188 --> 00:00:20.392\nToday we're doing our CISSP content,\nand specifically,\n\n5\n00:00:20.392 --> 00:00:23.670\nwe're gonna be looking at assessment and\ntesting, right?\n\n6\n00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.400\nWe've talked a lot about different\ncontrols we can put in place.\n\n7\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.900\nAuthentication protocols and\nmethods and really,\n\n8\n00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.230\nin the end, if we don't test any of this,\nhow do we know if it's working, all right?\n\n9\n00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.410\nSo we've got Mr.\n\n10\n00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.020\nAdam Gordon here to help us out with\nour testing and assessment strategies.\n\n11\n00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.360\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.180\n>> Good, good.\nI'm gonna reach over and test Mike and\n\n13\n00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.340\nmake sure he's awake.\n\n14\n00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.255\nSee, I'm testing him.\n\n15\n00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:46.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's the goal of today's\n\n16\n00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.920\nconversation.\n\n17\n00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.325\nWe're gonna make sure we focus on\ntesting and assessment strategy.\n\n18\n00:00:50.325 --> 00:00:53.540\nSo, what do we have to talk about\nwith the CISSP's perspective on\n\n19\n00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.842\nassessment and testing?\n\n20\n00:00:54.842 --> 00:00:58.050\nThat's gonna obviously be something, as my\nvoice goes up three or four octaves, it's\n\n21\n00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.740\ngoing to be something that's obviously\nvery important for us to think about.\n\n22\n00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.550\nSo we have to start by thinking about\nwhat is the role of the systems engineer,\n\n23\n00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.320\nthe security professional, what's\nthe role of our particular skills and\n\n24\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.140\nconcerns here?\n\n25\n00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.580\nWhat do we have to focus on as CISSPs?\n\n26\n00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.320\nWe have to be thinking about testing and\nassessment from the what don't I know\n\n27\n00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.750\nperspective, let's start with that and\nlet's think about that for a minute.\n\n28\n00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.260\nSo, when we think about auditing,\n\n29\n00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.880\nwe've talked a lot about the value\nof understanding what's going on,\n\n30\n00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.330\nthe current state versus the state\nthat we think something's in,\n\n31\n00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.490\nknowing the difference between those two,\nexamining it, assessing it if you will.\n\n32\n00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.940\nAnd then effectively getting a measure of\nwhat that is and having then what we call\n\n33\n00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.320\na gap analysis, so we can figure out how\nto remediate the concerns that we find.\n\n34\n00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.835\nThis is basically auditing distilled\ndown into 30 words or less, right?\n\n35\n00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:45.283\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so the idea of assessment and\n\n36\n00:01:45.283 --> 00:01:50.700\ntesting is really about understanding\nthe current state of what something is.\n\n37\n00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.420\nWhether that's the expected state,\n\n38\n00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.548\nwhether that is the desired state,\nit is the current state.\n\n39\n00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:58.340\nAnd assessment and\ntesting is all about understanding\n\n40\n00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.040\nthe current state of something,\nthe good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\n41\n00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.250\nSo that we can truly, accurately,\nunderstand what is happening.\n\n42\n00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.830\nWe can then decide based on that,\nwhether we are happy,\n\n43\n00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.980\nwhether we are perhaps unhappy.\n\n44\n00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.940\nBut we can get happy again by doing\nsomething to fix the problem.\n\n45\n00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.450\nOr whether it is just unfortunately, gonna\nbe something that we're not able to fix.\n\n46\n00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.760\nWhen we think about assessment and\ntesting, we have to also think about\n\n47\n00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.570\nunderstanding current state, but then\nreally understanding what is root cause.\n\n48\n00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.060\nIn other words,\nhow did we get to the current state?\n\n49\n00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.970\nWhat is the thing or the issue,\n\n50\n00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.570\nthe concern, the driving force behind\nultimately why we're where we are.\n\n51\n00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.893\nSo if we have a policy,\nlet's say hypothetically, and\n\n52\n00:02:38.893 --> 00:02:41.450\nour policy is about password management.\n\n53\n00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.400\nWe've talked a little bit about that\nin one of our prior episodes and\n\n54\n00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.246\nso if we're focusing on password\nmanagement, we have a policy or\n\n55\n00:02:47.246 --> 00:02:50.010\ngroup of policies to deal with\naccount management in general.\n\n56\n00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.680\nAnd password management is part of that.\n\n57\n00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.400\nAnd we do a quick assessment,\n\n58\n00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.770\nwe do an audit in effect of\nwhat is going on in our system.\n\n59\n00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.500\nAre the policies being followed,\nare they being implemented correctly, and\n\n60\n00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.250\nwe find there is approximately 90 to\n95% compliance with the policies.\n\n61\n00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.710\nSomewhere between 5 to 10% of our users\nare not doing one or more things they need\n\n62\n00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.650\nto do, and as a result, were not being\nmanaged properly under the policies.\n\n63\n00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.300\nThat may or may not be a concern to us.\n\n64\n00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.190\nRight, we may or\nmay not be able to fix that.\n\n65\n00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.438\nBut the real driving issue at that point\nis not, hey, we're 5 or 10% non-compliant,\n\n66\n00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:29.860\n90% compliant, 95% in theory,\nwe're good, let's go home.\n\n67\n00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.025\nWhat really now becomes the secondary and\nadditionally equally important concern for\n\n68\n00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:40.060\nthe CISSP is what is causing that 5 to\n10% deviation with regards to compliance.\n\n69\n00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.290\nThis is what root cause is all about.\n\n70\n00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.630\nAnd so we have to really think\nabout not just how do we assess but\n\n71\n00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.458\nthen ultimately what does\nthe assessment tell us and\n\n72\n00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:52.698\nhow do we then ultimately understand what\nis driving the reasons to concerns or\n\n73\n00:03:52.698 --> 00:03:56.830\nthe behavior we're seeing and how do\nwe then remediate, how do we fix that?\n\n74\n00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.041\nSo we have a lot of things to go through,\n\n75\n00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:01.930\na lot of things to think\nabout with regards to this.\n\n76\n00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.401\nThe CISSP has to understand\nhow to do assessments,\n\n77\n00:04:04.401 --> 00:04:06.530\nhas to understand how to do testing.\n\n78\n00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.070\nWe have to think about static testing,\ndynamic testing.\n\n79\n00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.380\nWe have to think about\nreal-time user monitoring.\n\n80\n00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.830\nWe have to think about all sorts\nof different kinds of testing.\n\n81\n00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.410\nAnd we'll talk about these and what they\nare and of course, more along the way.\n\n82\n00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.178\nWe may wanna form a working group.\n\n83\n00:04:19.178 --> 00:04:21.230\nWe may wanna get a group of experts in,\n\n84\n00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.750\npeople that can help us from around\nthe organization to understand\n\n85\n00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.660\nwhat the operational dynamics are within\nthe areas that they are managing.\n\n86\n00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.705\nSo if we are not experts\nat database management, but\n\n87\n00:04:31.705 --> 00:04:35.095\nwe have to do some assessment and\ntesting on database security.\n\n88\n00:04:35.095 --> 00:04:38.085\nWe've talked a lot about the fact that\nyou have to get good at partnering\n\n89\n00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:40.781\nas a CISSP and\nnot just good at knowledge acquisition.\n\n90\n00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:45.505\nSo we may need a working group that will\nhelp us to understand how to do testing,\n\n91\n00:04:45.505 --> 00:04:48.305\nhow to do assessment specifically\nwithin that environment.\n\n92\n00:04:48.305 --> 00:04:51.398\nBecause we may not understand it well\nenough to know what we need to do\n\n93\n00:04:51.398 --> 00:04:52.170\nspecifically.\n\n94\n00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.731\nSo they're gonna help us update and test\nand really stress and think through and\n\n95\n00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:59.396\nlogically examine the evaluation criteria.\n\n96\n00:04:59.396 --> 00:05:02.644\nSo that way, when we form our assessment,\nwe form our testing regime,\n\n97\n00:05:02.644 --> 00:05:06.273\nit's been vetted, right, it's gonna\nhopefully, positively come out, and\n\n98\n00:05:06.273 --> 00:05:09.163\nwe're gonna see good things,\ncuz we know that we're spot on.\n\n99\n00:05:09.163 --> 00:05:11.371\nWe figured out exactly\nwhat we need to test for.\n\n100\n00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:14.946\nSo getting a working group together to\nhelp us in these areas is gonna be very\n\n101\n00:05:14.946 --> 00:05:16.060\nimportant.\n\n102\n00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.560\nI don't know everything about anything\nthat goes on in one of your systems,\n\n103\n00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.100\nI don't work with your systems,\nI just don't know enough about them.\n\n104\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.110\nI know generically you\nprobably have web service.\n\n105\n00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.920\nGenerically you probably have databases.\n\n106\n00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.370\nGenerically you probably\nhave a directory service.\n\n107\n00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.280\nGenerically you probably use DNS and DHCP.\n\n108\n00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.190\nBut the specificity of how that's\ndeployed, what those systems look like,\n\n109\n00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.140\nhow they're operating, may escape me\nif I'm not an expert in those areas\n\n110\n00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.120\nspecific to your configuration.\n\n111\n00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.540\nSo what I'm getting at is ultimately, you\nneed some inside assistance, some inside\n\n112\n00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.770\nknowledge specific to these areas to\nreally understand how to assess and\n\n113\n00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.020\ntest them properly.\n\n114\n00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.560\nVerification is really going to be\nabout a lot of different things.\n\n115\n00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.290\nWe can approach this different ways.\n\n116\n00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.940\nWe may look at ultimately\ndoing software testing,\n\n117\n00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:04.230\nverifying the integrity of software\nis part of a verification test.\n\n118\n00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.000\nIs the software the same\nsoftware the vendor gave us?\n\n119\n00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.050\nHas it been modified in some way?\n\n120\n00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.780\nI've talked about using the SigVerif tool\nin Windows as one way to do examination of\n\n121\n00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.990\nsystem files.\n\n122\n00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.950\nIf you go to a run line in any\nWindows program, starting with\n\n123\n00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:23.620\nprobably Windows Vista, maybe even back to\nWindows 2000 if I remember correctly, and\n\n124\n00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.190\nyou go forward,\nyou can run SigVerif at the run line.\n\n125\n00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.840\nAnd when you do that, you will get\na file signature verification tool.\n\n126\n00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.020\nIt pops up in a little gray box.\n\n127\n00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.500\nAnd what you will find is you effectively\nthen can hit a go or start button.\n\n128\n00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.000\nIt's gonna run through\nan assessment of all the DLL files\n\n129\n00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.440\nthat are core to the operating system,\nand it's gonna check the integrity.\n\n130\n00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.220\nEffectively checks the digital signatures,\nthe hashes of all those files.\n\n131\n00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.160\nIf anything is wrong with them,\nit will flag them and say, hey,\n\n132\n00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.660\nthis file has a problem,\nit's been compromised, something's wrong.\n\n133\n00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.460\nAnd then you'll be given a little\nopportunity there to have a report and\n\n134\n00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.590\nsee what's going on.\n\n135\n00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.880\nAnd ultimately then understand whether or\nnot all the core files are legitimate.\n\n136\n00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.380\nThis is one way we can do software\ntesting for verification, right?\n\n137\n00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.750\nSo that's something we could look at and\n\n138\n00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.950\nobviously be aware of and\nwanna think about.\n\n139\n00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.190\nWe may go in and\nwe may do some documentation inspections,\n\n140\n00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:15.710\nso you may have documentation\nabout system bills.\n\n141\n00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.270\nYou may have documentation\nabout settings and\n\n142\n00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.110\nconfigurations in your\nconfiguration management database.\n\n143\n00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.940\nWe'd wanna test and assess those and\n\n144\n00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.340\nunderstand whether they are valid,\nmeaning we would take them and\n\n145\n00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.090\nwe would effectively say, okay,\nlet's go look at what really is happening.\n\n146\n00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.940\nIs that server really built this way?\n\n147\n00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.690\nIs this server really set up and\nconfigured this way, or\n\n148\n00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.820\nis this what it says on paper, but\nthe reality is something different?\n\n149\n00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.150\nSo we could do that and we can look at\nverification of documentation as well.\n\n150\n00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.750\nWhen we do auditing work, we look at\na lot of these different kinds of things\n\n151\n00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.090\nin order to better understand the current\nstate of affairs in the organization.\n\n152\n00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:51.464\nValidation as opposed to verification,\nslightly different.\n\n153\n00:07:51.464 --> 00:07:55.748\nValidation is a matter of developing what\nwe call a level of confidence, right,\n\n154\n00:07:55.748 --> 00:07:59.717\nthat the software system that we're\nlooking at, that we're assessing,\n\n155\n00:07:59.717 --> 00:08:04.127\nis gonna meet all the requirements and\nthe user's expectations as documented, so\n\n156\n00:08:04.127 --> 00:08:07.840\nvalidation is ensuring that\nthe system is designed to spec.\n\n157\n00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:10.810\nIt is designed to meet all of\nthe user's requirements and\n\n158\n00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.600\nis operating that way, alright?\n\n159\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.110\nSo, we just wanna make sure\nwe're thinking about validation,\n\n160\n00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:19.470\nthinking about verification, level of\nconfidence is associated with validation,\n\n161\n00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.199\nwanna make sure we have a thought\nprocess about that, right?\n\n162\n00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.270\nSoftware development is\npart of system design.\n\n163\n00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.890\nIt's also important to think about.\n\n164\n00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.040\nWhen we are thinking about system design,\n\n165\n00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.070\nwe have to think about the fact that\nwe may potentially have to develop\n\n166\n00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:36.430\ncertain software or build out certain\nfunctionality in order to achieve the kind\n\n167\n00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:40.420\nof stuff that the system needs to do and\nmake sure we can recognize and do that.\n\n168\n00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:43.410\nSo, system requirements\nare typically gonna be specified and\n\n169\n00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.490\nwe may have to then build software\nthat may align with them.\n\n170\n00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.930\nAs opposed to just taking it off the shelf\nand assuming it will work the right way.\n\n171\n00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:54.240\nWindows may operate well for you, but it\nmay not be exactly what you're looking for\n\n172\n00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.450\nin an operating system.\n\n173\n00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.960\nYou don't have a lot of\nflexibility to customize that\n\n174\n00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.250\nbeyond some basic stuff, right?\n\n175\n00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.550\nYou could change the background color and\npattern on your desktop,\n\n176\n00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.850\nyou could decide whether you wanna\nmanually apply security patches or\n\n177\n00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:10.460\nautomate that, you can decide what\nkind of applications you wanna run.\n\n178\n00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.030\nWhether you want to turn on user\naccount control or turn it off, right?\n\n179\n00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.060\nThose are things you can\neffectively control.\n\n180\n00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.520\nYou can customize certain aspects, right?\n\n181\n00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.660\nBut the reality is the underlying code\ninside Windows is not available to you.\n\n182\n00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.400\nYou're not able to go in and\n\n183\n00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.450\ncustomize the operating system Really\nin a functionally meaningful way.\n\n184\n00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.810\nReally more window dressing, right?\n\n185\n00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:31.590\nJust some quality of life\nrelated stuff's what you can do.\n\n186\n00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:33.030\nBut nothing significant.\n\n187\n00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.380\nSo, we have to think about the fact\nthat when we need to potentially change\n\n188\n00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:40.350\nsomething that's fundamental, rudimentary\nin the basic operation of a system\n\n189\n00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:43.340\nWe may have to develop software\nthat will allow us to do that.\n\n190\n00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.640\nSo, documenting requirements,\nunderstanding what they are, and\n\n191\n00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.990\nensuring that we have a sense of\nthem is going to be very important\n\n192\n00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:53.960\nto us when it comes to software defining\nand ultimately then being able to meet\n\n193\n00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.600\nthat definition through build and\nthen deployment and\n\n194\n00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:01.340\nmanagement of custom software to create\nwhatever requirement solutions we need,\n\n195\n00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.410\nwe have to think through not\nonly the logic of what that is,\n\n196\n00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:09.640\nnot only verify that, but insure that\nwhat we've done is not gonna break or\n\n197\n00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.370\nin anyway invalidate\nother security controls.\n\n198\n00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.450\nOne of the biggest problems we have\nultimately with this kind of work\n\n199\n00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.140\nis that we think we get one\npart of this whole solution,\n\n200\n00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.270\nthis kind of Rubik's cube all set up.\n\n201\n00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:23.320\nAnd if you remember the rubix cube,\nfor those of you that were\n\n202\n00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.020\naround when it was first created and\nfirst generation rubix cube.\n\n203\n00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.010\nSo, I had this conversation actually and\nyou'll have to pardon me,\n\n204\n00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.900\nI do free associate at certain times as\nyou've noticed in our time together and\n\n205\n00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.640\nwhen something pops into my\nhead it comes out my mouth.\n\n206\n00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.280\nThat's just how it works so you may get\ngood stuff, you may get garbage we'll see\n\n207\n00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.340\nhow this goes, but I'm gonna free\nassociate for just a minute so you know,\n\n208\n00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.790\nthinking about first generation stuff,\nright, so the Rubix Cube.\n\n209\n00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:49.660\nI had this conversation with one of my\ngirls recently, not about the Rubix Cube.\n\n210\n00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.150\nDo you remember, Simon?\n\n211\n00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.250\n>> Yes.\nThe little memory game.\n\n212\n00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.610\n>> Remember the toy Simon, right,\nit's a memory game, you got red, green,\n\n213\n00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.390\nblue, yellow, right.\n\n214\n00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:57.400\n>> Yep.\nSo, first generation Simon.\n\n215\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.429\nWhen Simon first came out, it looked\nlike a Rumba, the vacuums, right?\n\n216\n00:11:00.429 --> 00:11:03.056\n>> Yes, [CROSSTALK] big [CROSSTALK]\n>> [CROSSTALK] like a big fig.\n\n217\n00:11:03.056 --> 00:11:04.640\nAnd it was solid, it was a toy.\n\n218\n00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.630\nYou could bang on this thing,\nit would not break.\n\n219\n00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.210\nSo, Simon must have come out,\nI don't know, I'm guessing in the 80s,\n\n220\n00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:12.330\nmaybe late 80s, early 90s,\nI don't remember exactly when.\n\n221\n00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.810\nBut it came out at some\npoint during that time.\n\n222\n00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.060\nIt was an awesome game.\n\n223\n00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.040\nAnd it was an expensive game\nwhen you got it back then.\n\n224\n00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.960\nSo, you know, I had gotten one of\nthese when it first came out, love it.\n\n225\n00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.330\nPlayed with it forever and then like\nwith everything else, it disappears.\n\n226\n00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.880\nYou start moving around,\nthings happen you don't know where it is.\n\n227\n00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.340\nSo, I could never find\nmy original Simon again.\n\n228\n00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.370\nIt's probably with my original\nRubik's cube somewhere,\n\n229\n00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.420\nthey're hanging out together.\n\n230\n00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.150\nProbably in Puerto Rico hanging out\nat a bar at a beach or something.\n\n231\n00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.950\nSo, I could never find it.\n\n232\n00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:42.800\nSo, at one point early on, when we do,\ngift giving every year for\n\n233\n00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.870\nthe holidays, right?\n\n234\n00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.950\nSo, kids come to me and say,\nhey daddy, what do you want?\n\n235\n00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.090\nBecause I'm one of those people\nyou don't buy gifts for.\n\n236\n00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.480\nI'm pretty straightforward,\nthere's not a lot I need.\n\n237\n00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.810\nAnd what I need, I already have.\n\n238\n00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:56.890\nSo, I don't really say hey, go get me\nthis, or go get me that, unless it's\n\n239\n00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.285\na really good bottle of single malt\nscotch, in which case feel free, right?\n\n240\n00:12:00.285 --> 00:12:01.190\nAdam@.\n\n241\n00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.175\nI'm only kidding.\n\n242\n00:12:02.175 --> 00:12:03.840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you know, I, they say, hey,\n\n243\n00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.010\nwhat do you want, you know, what do you\nwant for, for the holidays, whatever.\n\n244\n00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.300\nI said, you know, well, I don't know.\n\n245\n00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.810\nMaybe something like a cool game.\n\n246\n00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.780\nSo, you know, my wife goes out and\nsays, we have to get daddy this.\n\n247\n00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.280\nAnd so they show up with, like,\nthe new and improved, like, V2 Assignment.\n\n248\n00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.420\nYou know, which, I don't know,\nwhoever was making it.\n\n249\n00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.600\nBut it was just like half the size,\nlittle, like,\n\n250\n00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.410\nyou know, crappy copy of Simon.\n\n251\n00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.340\nAnd we played with it for\nlike five minutes and it broke.\n\n252\n00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.630\nBecause the first time, you know,\nyou put the thing on the table,\n\n253\n00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.220\nyou do one of these and\nthe thing just like, just exploded.\n\n254\n00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:30.880\nIt was gone.\n\n255\n00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.630\nSo, you know,\n\n256\n00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:36.270\nsometimes the next generation is just\nnowhere near as good as the original.\n\n257\n00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.860\nI don't know if it was better\nplastic back in the 80s,\n\n258\n00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.310\nI don't know if they did something\ndifferent with the chemicals, but\n\n259\n00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.480\nwhatever it was, it was just garbage,\nit was just horrible.\n\n260\n00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.540\n>> You get excited when you\nwere hitting those things.\n\n261\n00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:46.970\nIt's gotta be able to stand up to it.\n\n262\n00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:48.050\n>> It's a cool game.\n\n263\n00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.280\nIf you've never played with Simon,\nyou know what,\n\n264\n00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.700\nMike's gonna find a picture of Simon and\nput it up for us at some points.\n\n265\n00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.960\n>> I will. I will. >> If you've\nnever seen it, it's an awesome game.\n\n266\n00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.380\nSo what does all this have to\ndo with software development?\n\n267\n00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.940\nI have no idea, as a matter of fact.\n\n268\n00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.360\nNo, I do actually.\n\n269\n00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.610\nSo, you know we're digressing.\n\n270\n00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:03.930\nBut what does that have to\ndo with a Rubik's cube?\n\n271\n00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:06.680\nThe idea was you would line\nup all of these requirements,\n\n272\n00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.830\nall these things, right?\n\n273\n00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.940\nAnd you would have all this\nstuff set in one area.\n\n274\n00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.880\nAnd then all of a sudden when\nyou did that you thought,\n\n275\n00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.960\nhey I'm going to have the cube solved,\nyou made one move and what would happen?\n\n276\n00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.630\nYou'd screw everything up somewhere else,\nand you'd have to go back and\n\n277\n00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.470\nrestrategize.\n\n278\n00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:21.270\nThink through the logic of\nhow to solve the problem.\n\n279\n00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:24.990\nThis is the same thing that happens with\nsoftware development and assessment.\n\n280\n00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.770\nWhen we think we've got these solutions,\nthese requirements, these concerns nailed\n\n281\n00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:33.530\nin one area, what happens often is we\napply that and then something else breaks\n\n282\n00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:37.520\nsomewhere else because of the security\ncontrols and the changes we're making.\n\n283\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.240\nSo we have to really think through,\nbe very critical,\n\n284\n00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.500\nvery focused on the assessment process and\nunderstand that validation, really making\n\n285\n00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.340\nsure that something is gonna work and\nthat it's not gonna break everything else,\n\n286\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.980\nas well as verification is gonna be\ncrucial, crucial to our success.\n\n287\n00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.890\nIf we don't do this the right way,\nbad things are gonna happen.\n\n288\n00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:01.440\nI think Mike's had enough time to find\na picture, and I think he does have one.\n\n289\n00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.980\nSo, there, oh, look at it, that's awesome.\n\n290\n00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.510\nThat brings back such good memories.\n\n291\n00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:06.170\nSo, that's what the Simon\ngame looked like.\n\n292\n00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.680\nIt's the original one anyway.\n\n293\n00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.890\nAnd that's what we'll look.\n\n294\n00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:10.900\nAs a matter of fact,\nI think I was the hand model.\n\n295\n00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.130\nIf you do a close up,\nyou can probably see,\n\n296\n00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.320\nI think I may be able to get\nthe hand position just right.\n\n297\n00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.470\nI'm the hand model, the one with the long\npretty nails at the upper right hand side\n\n298\n00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.090\nof that, is actually me.\n\n299\n00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.490\nIn my former career before\nI started doing this.\n\n300\n00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:23.300\nAll right, so anyway.\n\n301\n00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.800\nSo, how does software and\nhardware differ, right?\n\n302\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.680\nWhen we're thinking about assessment,\nthinking about validation,\n\n303\n00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.260\nthinking about verification, thinking\nabout testing, remember the bulk of our\n\n304\n00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.090\nsecurity problems and concerns\nare not coming from hardware, right?\n\n305\n00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:37.570\nIt's not the power pack for\n\n306\n00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.330\nyour laptop that's causing you\nto have a security problem.\n\n307\n00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:44.510\nIt's not the hard drive that is\ncausing us security concern.\n\n308\n00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:45.760\nIt's not the CD-ROM reader.\n\n309\n00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.210\nNow, you might say well, yeah but\nwhat if I put malware in the CD-ROM?\n\n310\n00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.690\nWell yeah, then it is, but it's\na delivery vehicle for software, right?\n\n311\n00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:56.350\nAnd software is really\nwhere the problems lie.\n\n312\n00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:58.590\nSoftware is where malcode comes in.\n\n313\n00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:02.040\nSoftware is where anything\npotentially almost without exception,\n\n314\n00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.470\nthat will compromise our systems is going\nto come from if we are loading it in.\n\n315\n00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.930\nAnd then as a result of that,\nallowing to do something.\n\n316\n00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:11.700\nViruses, worms, trojans,\n\n317\n00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.690\nremote back door access tool kits,\nroom kits, anything you can think of.\n\n318\n00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:17.970\nThey're all software.\n\n319\n00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:21.060\nRight, so it's the software that\nwe really got to worry about.\n\n320\n00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.820\nIf we worry about the hardware,\n\n321\n00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.460\nif at all it's really because although\nthere are exploitations from hardware.\n\n322\n00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:30.600\nA hardware based key log for instance\nwould definitely be a concern, but it's so\n\n323\n00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.590\nminimal compared to what software\ndoes in terms of exploitations\n\n324\n00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.310\nthat it's usually not going\nto be at the top of the list.\n\n325\n00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.830\nWe're really focusing on hardware,\n\n326\n00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.510\nthe vast majority of our problems in other\nwords are going to come from software.\n\n327\n00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.530\nSo, the bulk of our verification\nvalidation and testing and\n\n328\n00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:50.090\nassessment concerns and\nfocus of energy and time is on software.\n\n329\n00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.563\nWhen was the last time you\nwere asked to assess hardware?\n\n330\n00:15:52.563 --> 00:15:57.434\nYou may be asked to test it out, road test\nit, drive it and say hey, this is good,\n\n331\n00:15:57.434 --> 00:16:02.020\nI like this, but the reality is we don't\ntend to assess hardware As often for\n\n332\n00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.481\nsecurity concerns, is we do software.\n\n333\n00:16:04.481 --> 00:16:08.277\nNow if you've done a lot of this work,\nyou will understand and know,\n\n334\n00:16:08.277 --> 00:16:11.628\nthat we obviously then have to\ntest individual components.\n\n335\n00:16:11.628 --> 00:16:14.101\nWe have to test them as a unit,\nwe have to integrate them and\n\n336\n00:16:14.101 --> 00:16:15.890\nultimately test them as a system.\n\n337\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.640\nSo we do get to test hardwares, no doubt\nabout it because without hardware,\n\n338\n00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.550\nsoftware doesn't run.\n\n339\n00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.370\nAnd the configuration of\nthe hardware will impact\n\n340\n00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.340\nthe ability of the software to do its job.\n\n341\n00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.030\nAnd the two together have to be a concern\nwhen we think about security controls.\n\n342\n00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.540\nSo I'm not trying to say that\nwe don't focus on hardware.\n\n343\n00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.180\nI want to be clear.\n\n344\n00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:36.906\nWhat I'm simply pointing out is that\nthe bulk of our concern with regards to\n\n345\n00:16:36.906 --> 00:16:41.121\nexploitation comes from software\nside as well the hardware side.\n\n346\n00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:44.530\nWe just wanna make sure we have a sense\nof that and we understand that as well.\n\n347\n00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.884\nSo when when we're thinking\nsecurity controls and testing,\n\n348\n00:16:46.884 --> 00:16:50.290\nand I think I might have been started\nup by saying this in this episode\n\n349\n00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:52.230\nwe don't really understand everything,\nright?\n\n350\n00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:55.920\nAnd so we have to start with is\nthe assumption that we don't know.\n\n351\n00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.360\nAnd most important, what we don't know is,\nwe don't know what we don't know.\n\n352\n00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.070\nYou've often heard that double speak,\nright?\n\n353\n00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.705\nIf I only knew what I didn't know\nthen I would know more than I do now.\n\n354\n00:17:03.705 --> 00:17:06.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I think anyway, something like that.\n\n355\n00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.990\nI'm not quite sure, cuz I don't really\nknow what I just said, it's all a mystery.\n\n356\n00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:11.579\nSo what I'm trying to get at is\n\n357\n00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.060\nthat there's a lot of unknown\nin system architecture.\n\n358\n00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.740\nThere's a lot of unknown in software.\n\n359\n00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.090\nYou know, the sheer volume, the lines of\ncode, the complexity of systems today.\n\n360\n00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:22.770\nIt's very hard for us to know everything.\n\n361\n00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.325\nNo matter how good you are,\nno matter how much you know.\n\n362\n00:17:24.325 --> 00:17:27.255\nThere is always stuff that is\nbeyond your understanding,\n\n363\n00:17:27.255 --> 00:17:30.875\nat the current moment in time, because\nthe system may not operate that way,\n\n364\n00:17:30.875 --> 00:17:35.325\nthat's going to bring the exploit to your\nattention until something is done and\n\n365\n00:17:35.325 --> 00:17:37.175\nthat something may not have been done yet.\n\n366\n00:17:37.175 --> 00:17:38.075\nWe find new new code,\n\n367\n00:17:38.075 --> 00:17:42.495\nnew exploitations all the time because\nsomething has been done in a system that\n\n368\n00:17:42.495 --> 00:17:47.350\ntriggers a series of events that nobody\nunderstood or foresaw until they occurred.\n\n369\n00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:49.480\nThis is just the nature of systems today.\n\n370\n00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:54.690\nSo as a result of that, there's a lot of\nuncertainty in the processes we engage\n\n371\n00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.360\nin and more often there are, we do things\nand they seem to be okay but then every so\n\n372\n00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:01.230\noften we have one of these unexplained\nmoments where I did something but\n\n373\n00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.730\nsomething different that I\nwasn't expecting happened and\n\n374\n00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.360\nI'm not quite sure why that happened.\n\n375\n00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.990\nAnd now we go back and we try to do,\nit's called root cause analysis.\n\n376\n00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.650\nAlright, we try to unwind the series\nof events and we try to figure out and\n\n377\n00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.600\nif we can reproduce, reverse engineer\nthat problem, see what caused it.\n\n378\n00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.020\nWe may be able to better understand it.\n\n379\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.555\nSo, we have to think about this and\nwe have to think about\n\n380\n00:18:19.555 --> 00:18:22.945\nwhat we can do in order to better\nunderstand systems and complexity.\n\n381\n00:18:22.945 --> 00:18:25.375\nBut we also have to look\nat some common guidance,\n\n382\n00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:29.095\nsome good controls that are available\nto us that can help us to generally\n\n383\n00:18:29.095 --> 00:18:32.505\nunderstand what we, you need to do\nin the places we need to be aligned.\n\n384\n00:18:32.505 --> 00:18:36.805\nWe actually have shown you this\nwebsite in one of our earlier episodes\n\n385\n00:18:36.805 --> 00:18:41.560\nwith regard to SANS and\nthe SANS critical security control list.\n\n386\n00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.130\nVersion six is the current\nversion were looking at.\n\n387\n00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.700\nYou can see the CIS, Critical Security\nControls up on the screen or right there\n\n388\n00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.890\nto my left and if I move to the other side\nof the screen, you'll see it to my right.\n\n389\n00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:51.730\nShould I try that quickly?\n\n390\n00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.250\n>> Let's do it. Jump. [LAUGH]\n>> It's not moving.\n\n391\n00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:55.040\nLet's try that again.\n\n392\n00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:55.800\nLet me go the other way.\n\n393\n00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.810\nIt's probably the other way.\n\n394\n00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.130\nI'm very confused when I'm on camera.\n\n395\n00:18:58.130 --> 00:18:59.100\nI never know which way is right.\n\n396\n00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.860\nIf I go this way, still not moving.\n\n397\n00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.980\nAll right, how about if I go forward?\n\n398\n00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.350\nAnyway, so, while we see all the controls\nsitting up there, I could duck,\n\n399\n00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.270\nI could go below them.\n\n400\n00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.062\nBut then I would be\nan unembodied box voice,\n\n401\n00:19:09.062 --> 00:19:11.640\nright, which is actually kinda cool,\nI've never done that.\n\n402\n00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.590\nLet's try it.\n\n403\n00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.940\nSo when you see all the controls\n>> Look, it worked.\n\n404\n00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.700\n>> Look at that, see, that would work.\n\n405\n00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.980\nAll right, so.\n\n406\n00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:19.770\nIt's Friday guys.\n\n407\n00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.590\nYou gotta have a little fun every so\noften, right?\n\n408\n00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.580\nInformation securities gonna be dry and\nboring without a little comedy.\n\n409\n00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:28.240\nSo when you see the CIS critical\nsecurity controls there,\n\n410\n00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.702\nversion six as I mentioned.\n\n411\n00:19:29.702 --> 00:19:31.520\nAre we able to zoom in just\na little bit to show them?\n\n412\n00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.020\n>> Yeah.\n\n413\n00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.750\n>> Just zoom in on the list actually so\nwe can see them,\n\n414\n00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.780\nyeah there you go,\na little bit easier to see.\n\n415\n00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.290\nSo, when you see we've got a list,\n\n416\n00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.810\nas Mike scrolls down,\nwe'll see there's a whole list.\n\n417\n00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:42.750\nThere's 20 of them there,\nactually, 25 rather, excuse me.\n\n418\n00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.430\nBut you'll see the top 20 there.\n\n419\n00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:48.540\nAnd what you're gonna see is there's\na specific set of things we have\n\n420\n00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.400\nto be aware of.\n\n421\n00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.160\nThings like malware defense, or defense\nagainst malware, item number eight.\n\n422\n00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.612\nEmail and web browser protections,\nitem number 7.\n\n423\n00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:58.670\nData protection, item 13.\n\n424\n00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.590\nBoundary defense, number 12.\n\n425\n00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.990\nPenetration testing and\nRed Team, number 20.\n\n426\n00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.810\nWe could go up and down the list here.\n\n427\n00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.620\nThe idea is that ultimately\nwhat we have to focus on\n\n428\n00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:12.149\nis that guidance like this is gonna\nhelp us to really understand ultimately\n\n429\n00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:18.390\nhow to categorize and ultimately how\nto then manage through categorization,\n\n430\n00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:21.400\nconcerns we have for\nsecurity within the system, right?\n\n431\n00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.610\nAnd so, when we think about it,\n\n432\n00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:25.570\nwe're gonna have risky resource\nmanagement kinda stuff.\n\n433\n00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:28.130\nThere's controls in there\nbased on that category.\n\n434\n00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.370\nDefense controls around porous defense,\n\n435\n00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:33.380\ndefense that's not set up and\nis really open more than it should be.\n\n436\n00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.040\nWe're gonna have insecure\ninteraction between components.\n\n437\n00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.540\nThese are categorized areas that\ncontrols will then align with.\n\n438\n00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.110\nIf we think about the guidance\nfrom something like SANS and\n\n439\n00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:44.190\nwe're able to then take\nthat information and\n\n440\n00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:48.290\nwork with the critical control systems\nthat have to be updated to make sure\n\n441\n00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:52.650\nthat we are building ultimately better\nsecure, better architected solutions,\n\n442\n00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.510\nwe're gonna ultimately not only\nbe able to assess and validate,\n\n443\n00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.590\nbut we're gonna find that we have\nprobably a lot of good stuff going on.\n\n444\n00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:03.000\nWe're gonna minimize, we're gonna mitigate\nthe potential attack surface that we\n\n445\n00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.100\npresent, that we are making\navailable to attackers right?\n\n446\n00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.110\nAnd so what we call ASR,\nAttack Surface Reduction,\n\n447\n00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:12.840\nis gonna be very important because if we\ncan reduce the attack surface of one or\n\n448\n00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.530\nmore elements or indeed an entire system,\nwe're gonna be a lot more successful and\n\n449\n00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:20.520\nnot only defend it but potentially then\nmaking sure that that security boundary,\n\n450\n00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.740\nthat perimeter we're building by\nmaking sure that system is secure,\n\n451\n00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.810\ncan be extended to other systems\nbecause it's gonna get better.\n\n452\n00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:27.770\nAs we get better at one thing,\n\n453\n00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.660\nwe ultimately find out we get better\nat lots and lots and lots of things.\n\n454\n00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.510\nSo, what are we thinking about this,\nand the impact of this?\n\n455\n00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:35.420\nWhat are we thinking about\nareas like logs, right?\n\n456\n00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.630\nWhat kind of information\nare we getting in log files?\n\n457\n00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:40.020\nCan logs tell us a lot of things?\n\n458\n00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:41.290\nThey absolutely can.\n\n459\n00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.050\nThey can tell us all sorts of stuff.\n\n460\n00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:47.200\nIn a Windows machine you've got several\nlogs in particular an event viewer\n\n461\n00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.220\nthat are going to be critical to your\nunderstanding of security on the system.\n\n462\n00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.460\nYou've go and application log,\n\n463\n00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.020\nwhich shows you general\napplication related information.\n\n464\n00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.850\nYou've got a system log that\nshows you system related things.\n\n465\n00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:01.000\nAnd you've got a security log that shows\nyou security events on the local machine.\n\n466\n00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.100\nSo you can look at, for instance,\nfailed logons or logon attempts.\n\n467\n00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.180\nYou can look at service account access and\nroles of the service accounts,\n\n468\n00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.450\nwhat they're doing, whether or\nnot they were able to get into something.\n\n469\n00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:12.830\nIf there was an error, why?\n\n470\n00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:14.970\nYou can see if applications\nstopped functioning,\n\n471\n00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.280\nif a network has become locked up.\n\n472\n00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.700\nThings of that nature are gonna\nbe documented in logs.\n\n473\n00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:24.440\nSo logs record the events, they record\nas the line goes to the soap opera,\n\n474\n00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.900\nThe Days of Our Lives.\n\n475\n00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.720\nThey record all of that stuff.\n\n476\n00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.720\nIt's really scary that\nI know that by the way.\n\n477\n00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.130\n>> Like sands through hourglass.\n\n478\n00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.480\n>> Like sands through the hourglass,\nso goes the days of our lives.\n\n479\n00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.620\nI actually used to be a Days of\nOur Lives junkie, believe it or not.\n\n480\n00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.230\nThat General Hospital, years ago,\nused to love, when I was in college,\n\n481\n00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.630\nused to love those two.\n\n482\n00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:45.740\nI'm ashamed to admit that in public,\nbut I am because I like you guys, and\n\n483\n00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.810\nI believe that I can trust you, cuz you're\nnever gonna tell anybody, I know that.\n\n484\n00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.480\nIt's gonna be all over\nthe internet tomorrow right?\n\n485\n00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.130\n>> Tomorrow.\n\n486\n00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:55.630\n>> Everybody's gonna know I used to love\nGeneral Hospital and Days of Our lives.\n\n487\n00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:56.650\n>> I'm Tweeting about it right now.\n\n488\n00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:57.460\n>> Exactly.\n\n489\n00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.660\nRight, Luke and Laura, that was my,\n\n490\n00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.450\nI'm dating myself,\nright that was my big thing.\n\n491\n00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:05.450\nBut anyways, so, we are recording\nall of the information, right.\n\n492\n00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.210\nEverything goes on,\nthat's what a log does.\n\n493\n00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:09.070\nIt's gonna obviously have\nindividual entries and\n\n494\n00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:13.220\nthose entries make up a sequence rate\nrun of events that we can then examine.\n\n495\n00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:15.750\nThe reason this is so important\nwhen we think about assessment and\n\n496\n00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.520\ntesting, is this is\nthe documentary evidence.\n\n497\n00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.370\nThe day by day,\n\n498\n00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:23.140\nliterally, moment by moment understanding\nof what's happening in a system.\n\n499\n00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.970\nIf we're not able to look at logs,\nit's really gonna be very difficult for\n\n500\n00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:27.450\nus to understand what's going on.\n\n501\n00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.540\nYou imagine if I come to you and say, hey,\n\n502\n00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:33.100\ncan you give me kind of a summary of\nwhat's going on in the last 24 hours here?\n\n503\n00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.680\nI'm trying to get caught up.\n\n504\n00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.800\nAnd you can't tell me anything,\ncuz you don't know.\n\n505\n00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.945\nYou could say, well, I'm here and\n\n506\n00:23:39.945 --> 00:23:42.936\ndon't really know much more than that,\nI'm sitting in a chair.\n\n507\n00:23:42.936 --> 00:23:44.140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not really sure.\n\n508\n00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:47.380\nI know a lot of stuff's happening,\nbut, it's happening outside, and\n\n509\n00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.770\nI don't see what's out there,\nand nothing's gone on in here.\n\n510\n00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:51.979\nI don't know what to tell you.\n\n511\n00:23:51.979 --> 00:23:55.138\nThat would not be a very useful\nconversation of either one of us.\n\n512\n00:23:55.138 --> 00:23:57.857\nSo what we need to understand is\nexactly what's happening in a given\n\n513\n00:23:57.857 --> 00:23:58.678\nthe moment in time.\n\n514\n00:23:58.678 --> 00:24:01.837\nWe talked about the value of NTP,\nNetwork Time Protocol, and\n\n515\n00:24:01.837 --> 00:24:05.851\nthe value of time stamping things to\nauthenticate when they're occurring and\n\n516\n00:24:05.851 --> 00:24:10.320\nto understand contextually what was going\non around them at that moment in time.\n\n517\n00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.940\nLogs give us that context.\n\n518\n00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.800\nThey tell us hey,\nat this moment in time on this system,\n\n519\n00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.190\nthis person was doing this or tried to\ndo this but failed for whatever reason.\n\n520\n00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.010\nThey couldn't get in.\n\n521\n00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:20.990\nThings didn't work.\n\n522\n00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:22.560\nIt's very important information.\n\n523\n00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.100\nWhen I do assessment work, when I do\naudit work, when I do forensics work for\n\n524\n00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:29.280\ncustomers, one of the most important\nthings we look at are log files.\n\n525\n00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.250\nWe don't have logs of the systems that\nare affected, the gateway devices,\n\n526\n00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:36.490\nright, all the systems that may have\nbeen touched by the compromise or\n\n527\n00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:39.530\nthe breach, or that we're assessing,\nlooking for vulnerabilities or whatever.\n\n528\n00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:42.530\nIf we don't have logs,\nit's incredibly difficult.\n\n529\n00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:46.590\nI would hazard a guess to say it may\nbe impossible to do our job properly.\n\n530\n00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.180\nCuz we don't have a record.\n\n531\n00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.630\nWe have no way of understanding and\ndeveloping the knowledge of what was going\n\n532\n00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:55.270\non in the system over the period of time\nthat we're looking at or we're examining.\n\n533\n00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.220\nSo this is very, very, very important.\n\n534\n00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:02.102\nLog management generically is the idea of,\nas the name implies, right, gathering up,\n\n535\n00:25:02.102 --> 00:25:03.490\nmanaging the logs.\n\n536\n00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.460\nIt could be on a local machine,\njust one machine, one device.\n\n537\n00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.810\nLogs locally there,\nwe get them, we look at them.\n\n538\n00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.090\nThings like Event Viewer, right,\nwould be helpful for that.\n\n539\n00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:15.300\nBut we've also talked about SEM systems,\nwhere we can gather log information up and\n\n540\n00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.050\nwe can centrally manage it.\n\n541\n00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:19.075\nWe can put it into a common area.\n\n542\n00:25:19.075 --> 00:25:22.675\nGather it up, if you will, using\ntechnology such as Netflow, which is Cisco\n\n543\n00:25:22.675 --> 00:25:27.415\nproprietary technology for grabbing\ninformation, logging information from\n\n544\n00:25:27.415 --> 00:25:31.805\nmultiple devices and centrally sending\nit to a Netflow server and managing it.\n\n545\n00:25:31.805 --> 00:25:35.105\nThe open source version of that,\nthe non-proprietary Cisco,\n\n546\n00:25:35.105 --> 00:25:39.780\nmeaning the actually, [COUGH]\nwhat\n\n547\n00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.825\nwas the snarky comment I was gonna make?\n\n548\n00:25:41.825 --> 00:25:43.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> On the cheap version,\n\n549\n00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.360\nyou don't have a pay a huge licensing and\n\n550\n00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:48.690\nroyalty fee for the sFlow,\nis what I was trying to say.\n\n551\n00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:51.246\nsFlow is kind of the open\nsource version of NetFlow.\n\n552\n00:25:51.246 --> 00:25:55.145\nNetFlow's supported by many vendors and is\nimplemented by the Mware for instance and\n\n553\n00:25:55.145 --> 00:25:56.564\ntheir virtualization stack.\n\n554\n00:25:56.564 --> 00:26:00.505\nThey support it, but you obviously have\nto pay a premium in effect to use that\n\n555\n00:26:00.505 --> 00:26:05.210\ntechnology because you're using a licensed\nproprietary version of something.\n\n556\n00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.780\nsFlow is just simply the open source\nversion that's available in most systems,\n\n557\n00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.000\nwhether you are supporting Cisco gear or\nnot.\n\n558\n00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.610\nEither one of these systems are gonna be\nable to effectively grab log information\n\n559\n00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.370\nand send it to a collector.\n\n560\n00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:21.155\nA collector is just generically, a server\nthat is gonna be centrally gathering.\n\n561\n00:26:21.155 --> 00:26:22.825\nAnd then monitoring and\n\n562\n00:26:22.825 --> 00:26:26.065\nultimately managing the logs that are\ncoming in from all these different points.\n\n563\n00:26:26.065 --> 00:26:29.915\nI don't know if you've ever heard of Kiwi,\nKiwi's one of those old syslog servers\n\n564\n00:26:29.915 --> 00:26:32.655\nthat I think SolarWinds had\nthat they put in market.\n\n565\n00:26:32.655 --> 00:26:34.257\nThey still have a free version.\n\n566\n00:26:34.257 --> 00:26:37.085\nSo syslog servers are kind\nof what our first gen\n\n567\n00:26:37.085 --> 00:26:38.915\ntechnology that we're talking about.\n\n568\n00:26:38.915 --> 00:26:42.075\nSEM systems are really just\nlike syslog on steroids,\n\n569\n00:26:42.075 --> 00:26:46.380\nbecause what they've done is they've\ntaken the ability to aggregate logs and\n\n570\n00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.270\nbrought business intelligence and\nbig data analytics to the party.\n\n571\n00:26:49.270 --> 00:26:53.100\nAnd have now effectively given us\na platform that we can look at logs,\n\n572\n00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.240\nmanage them, assess them,\nreport on them and analyze them and\n\n573\n00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.720\nvisualize them in real time.\n\n574\n00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.220\nSo data visualization,\nbusiness intelligence, dashboarding,\n\n575\n00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.980\nscorecarding, these are all capabilities\nof a SEM system traditionally.\n\n576\n00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.800\nAnd things like Splunk, for instance,\nare gonna be good examples of this.\n\n577\n00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.120\nThere's a whole bunch of them\nout there that can be used.\n\n578\n00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:13.210\nA lot of them are very good,\nvery powerful, but\n\n579\n00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:15.110\nthey are big and they are expensive.\n\n580\n00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:16.850\nSo you just have to think\nabout what those are.\n\n581\n00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:20.010\nA log management traditionally is one of\nthe things that from an assessment and\n\n582\n00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:23.260\ntesting standpoint, we have to be\nfocused on and thinking about as well.\n\n583\n00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.090\nWe don't often think about logging and\nlog files and\n\n584\n00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:28.586\nlog management as part of assessment and\ntesting.\n\n585\n00:27:28.586 --> 00:27:32.280\nBut it actually is going to play a very\ncrucial role in giving us the data and\n\n586\n00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.670\nthe documentary evidence that\nwe have to assess against.\n\n587\n00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:36.740\nSo it actually is a very\nimportant part of what we do.\n\n588\n00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.680\nWe have to think about security software\noverall as part of assessment and\n\n589\n00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.370\ntesting as well.\n\n590\n00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.442\nYou know we have anti-malware and\nanti-virus software, pretty common,\n\n591\n00:27:43.442 --> 00:27:44.580\npretty traditional.\n\n592\n00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.637\nWe have intrusion detection,\nintrusion prevention systems,\n\n593\n00:27:47.637 --> 00:27:49.285\ntalked a lot about these already.\n\n594\n00:27:49.285 --> 00:27:53.346\nThings like remote access softwares\nsuch as VPN gateways, radio solutions,\n\n595\n00:27:53.346 --> 00:27:54.464\nwe mentioned those.\n\n596\n00:27:54.464 --> 00:27:57.947\nWe have proxies, we've talked about\napplication level proxies on the web.\n\n597\n00:27:57.947 --> 00:28:02.323\nWe've talked about firewalls, we've talked\nabout vulnerability assessment systems,\n\n598\n00:28:02.323 --> 00:28:05.517\ntalked about authentication systems,\naccess control systems.\n\n599\n00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:08.234\nAll these things are gonna\nplay a part in security and\n\n600\n00:28:08.234 --> 00:28:12.621\nsecurity software that is gonna be able to\nprovide these capabilities as also part of\n\n601\n00:28:12.621 --> 00:28:14.320\nassessment and testing.\n\n602\n00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.172\nNot because necessarily,\nwe need the information coming from them,\n\n603\n00:28:18.172 --> 00:28:19.776\nalthough we certainly do.\n\n604\n00:28:19.776 --> 00:28:22.687\nWhat we really need to do though is\nthink about this as being the target of\n\n605\n00:28:22.687 --> 00:28:24.970\nthe assessments,\nthe target of the testing, right.\n\n606\n00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.610\nWe wanna test how good these systems are.\n\n607\n00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:28.440\nHow are they configured?\n\n608\n00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.740\nAre they doing their job?\n\n609\n00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.890\nIf not, why not?\n\n610\n00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.060\nIf they are,\nlet's make sure we do more of that, right.\n\n611\n00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:34.660\nBecause that's good,\nwe wanna keep doing that.\n\n612\n00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.690\nSo wanna be thinking about that.\n\n613\n00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.500\nWe get a lot of common data in\noperating systems that's gonna\n\n614\n00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.790\nhelp us drive security.\n\n615\n00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.340\nOperating system related events,\n\n616\n00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:46.790\nwe talked about with logging,\ntask manager events, process information.\n\n617\n00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.090\nThis is all stuff that may be valuable and\nstuff that we wanna be thinking about.\n\n618\n00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:53.280\nThink about all the stuff that gets logged\nin your systems on a regular basis.\n\n619\n00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.440\nThink about the volume of\ninformation that's there.\n\n620\n00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.770\nHow can you make heads or\ntails out of that?\n\n621\n00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:57.740\nIt may be tough.\n\n622\n00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.280\nIt may be something we have to think\nabout and obviously understand.\n\n623\n00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:04.100\nSo log analysis is gonna be\nvery crucial to what we do and\n\n624\n00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.360\nagain, these kind of systems\ncan help us to do this.\n\n625\n00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:09.470\nBut keep in mind the log analysis\nis often reactive, right.\n\n626\n00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:11.785\nIt's often something we do after the fact.\n\n627\n00:29:11.785 --> 00:29:13.425\nI can't remember the last time, honestly.\n\n628\n00:29:13.425 --> 00:29:14.775\nAnd I'm being honest\nwith you when I say this.\n\n629\n00:29:14.775 --> 00:29:18.025\nNow, I can't really remember, that means\nI'm kind of implying that I haven't been\n\n630\n00:29:18.025 --> 00:29:20.035\nhonest up until this point, right?\n\n631\n00:29:20.035 --> 00:29:23.407\nSo let me put on my yes,\nI'm gonna tell you the truth hat.\n\n632\n00:29:23.407 --> 00:29:24.517\nSo what I'm saying or\n\n633\n00:29:24.517 --> 00:29:28.164\nwhat I'm implying is when I talk\nabout log analysis is the following.\n\n634\n00:29:28.164 --> 00:29:31.148\nThe idea that more often than not,\nif you're honest with yourself and\n\n635\n00:29:31.148 --> 00:29:34.487\nmost security professionals are honest\nwith each other, in a candid moment,\n\n636\n00:29:34.487 --> 00:29:37.082\nthey will tell you that they\ndon't really ever look at logs.\n\n637\n00:29:37.082 --> 00:29:40.682\nUntil they have a problem, they're going\nback to research what went wrong, right.\n\n638\n00:29:40.682 --> 00:29:42.789\nSo, we often look at them reactively,\nwe look at them post-incident,\n\n639\n00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:46.797\npost-breach, because we know there's\nstuff there that's important.\n\n640\n00:29:46.797 --> 00:29:51.540\nBut if we and we also know, right, that if\nwe have been looking at them proactively\n\n641\n00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.860\nand have really been tracking and\ncontinuously monitoring, we may have\n\n642\n00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.460\nactually been able to stop this event\nfrom occurring, whatever the event was.\n\n643\n00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:59.780\nBut because we're so busy doing so\n\n644\n00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.210\nmany other things,\nwe just really don't have time.\n\n645\n00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.400\nI mean, who has time to sit around and\nread log files every day?\n\n646\n00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.470\nIt's tough to do, right?\n\n647\n00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:08.310\nThere's just so\nmany other things going on.\n\n648\n00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.430\nThis is one of the reasons we need\nautomated systems that can track and\n\n649\n00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:12.250\nmonitor activity.\n\n650\n00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:15.780\nSo IBS, IPS solutions become\nvery important for this.\n\n651\n00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.400\nThis is why we need continuous monitoring\nbecause we have systems that will\n\n652\n00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.530\nalways stay awake.\n\n653\n00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:25.420\nIf you remember in, I think it was\nTerminator 3, in another movie reference,\n\n654\n00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.300\npop culture time,\nwe should have a sign for that.\n\n655\n00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.952\nPop culture could pop up, right?\n\n656\n00:30:28.952 --> 00:30:34.380\nSo in, I think it was Terminator 3, where\nat some point the Terminator character,\n\n657\n00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.400\nArnold Schwarzenegger,\nis now become the good guy, right?\n\n658\n00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.680\nAnd he's trying to protect everybody.\n\n659\n00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:44.880\nAnd, at one point, the mother says\nshe's back at one of these things.\n\n660\n00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.060\nShe says, at some point, hey, I need\nsomebody who effectively is always gonna\n\n661\n00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:52.860\nbe there, is always gonna watch,\nis always gonna protect him, and\n\n662\n00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.050\nthis is kind of why I made the Terminator\ninto the good guy to do this.\n\n663\n00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:57.580\nBecause he never sleeps, right.\n\n664\n00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.680\nHe's always there and\nhe's never gonna stop.\n\n665\n00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.750\nHe's just always gonna be there\nprotecting this vital resource we have.\n\n666\n00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:07.070\nSo the general idea is\nthat we can automate it.\n\n667\n00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:10.070\nWe can do this so\nwe can always protect, right.\n\n668\n00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:13.200\nAnd it's important to understand\nthat if we do this, and\n\n669\n00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.750\nwe do it well, we can actually\nnot necessarily win all the time.\n\n670\n00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.100\nBecause there are still gonna be attacks\nthat'll happen without our knowledge.\n\n671\n00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.220\nAnd they're gonna come and\nwe're not gonna see them coming.\n\n672\n00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.870\nBut we're gonna probably find\na lot more of these attacks.\n\n673\n00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.290\nWe're probably gonna be more\nsuccessful at stopping them.\n\n674\n00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.198\nAnd so\nthis is something else to think about.\n\n675\n00:31:28.198 --> 00:31:32.110\nAnd something that you as CISSPs really\nneed to think about and understand.\n\n676\n00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:35.420\nHow do we get the organization to\nbe more aware, more proactive?\n\n677\n00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:38.700\nHow do I move them into that direction and\nthat frame of mind?\n\n678\n00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.160\nThis is part of what assessment and\ntesting is all about.\n\n679\n00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.380\nIf we can understand and\nvalidate current state, we can\n\n680\n00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.660\nfigure out how to become more proactive\nand stop things before they start.\n\n681\n00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.650\n>> Great information, Adam.\n\n682\n00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:50.550\nYou have a good look at assessment and\ntesting.\n\n683\n00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.350\nI know we've got more information to go.\n\n684\n00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:56.650\nIt's a pretty big topic, but\na really good, just get started in there.\n\n685\n00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:00.530\nLooking at that current state, looking at\nwhere it is we wanna be, and then as you\n\n686\n00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:05.280\nsaid, examining that gap in between and\nfiguring out what that root cause is.\n\n687\n00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:07.156\nSo thank you for that,\nAdam, appreciate that.\n\n688\n00:32:07.156 --> 00:32:10.778\nRemember, if you guys want to\nattend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n689\n00:32:10.778 --> 00:32:14.089\nall you gotta do is shoot us\nan email at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n690\n00:32:14.089 --> 00:32:15.390\nThat's gonna do it for this episode.\n\n691\n00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:16.250\nWe'll be back soon.\n\n692\n00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:18.260\nSo signing off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n693\n00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.055\n>> I'll be back.\n\n694\n00:32:19.055 --> 00:32:20.740\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Come back soon.\n\n695\n00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.719\nThat's my best Arnold.\n\n696\n00:32:21.719 --> 00:32:22.742\nI can't do better than that.\n\n697\n00:32:22.742 --> 00:32:24.089\n>> We'll see you next time.\n\n698\n00:32:24.089 -->

episode here at ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.630\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\ntoday we're doing our CISSP content.\n\n5\n00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.800\nAnd specifically we're gonna look at\nour assessment and testing strategies.\n\n6\n00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.250\nIt's really a continuation so\n\n7\n00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.000\nif you missed the first part, make sure\nyou go back and watch that episode.\n\n8\n00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.480\nOtherwise we're gonna continue on,\nand I'll hand it right back over Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.620\nAdam Gordon, how's it going, Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.020\n>> It's going good, it's going good.\n\n11\n00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.340\nSee I told you I would be back.\n\n12\n00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.700\nHere I am.\n>> [LAUGH] You didn't lie to us.\n\n13\n00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.690\n>> I did not lie.\n\n14\n00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.740\nI was being honest, as they say.\n\n15\n00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.040\nI was being honest.\n\n16\n00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.010\nSo, let's continue talking\nabout monitoring, right?\n\n17\n00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.690\nSo what we're talking about, or have\nbeen talking about on a prior episode,\n\n18\n00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.370\ncontinue talking about on this\none is all about assessment.\n\n19\n00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.050\nAbout monitoring.\n\n20\n00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.060\nAbout testing.\n\n21\n00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.390\nWith regards to monitoring, we haven't\nreally got in to the monitoring types per\n\n22\n00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.890\nse, we just set the stage talk\nabout a lot of background stuff.\n\n23\n00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.620\nWe have to think things like\nreal user monitoring and\n\n24\n00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.690\nsynthetic performance\nmonitoring as monitoring types.\n\n25\n00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.610\nThese are types that we engage in.\n\n26\n00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.450\nThat may be automated or may be done\nwith passive monitoring technology.\n\n27\n00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.195\nSo real user monitoring, I love\nthe acronym for this, RUM, by the way.\n\n28\n00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:14.590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I actually don't like rum, but\n\n29\n00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.730\nI like the acronym.\n\n30\n00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.460\nYou ever seen rum being made?\n\n31\n00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.960\n>> No.\n>> So\n\n32\n00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.980\nif you've ever been to a rum distillery,\nand spend some time down in Caribbean.\n\n33\n00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.950\nPart of my work involves in\nthe Caribbean a great deal.\n\n34\n00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.528\nAnd there's a lot of rum\nmade in the Caribbean.\n\n35\n00:01:26.528 --> 00:01:29.760\nAnd I happened to spend\nsome time going back and\n\n36\n00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.530\nforth in one of the countries I was in,\n\n37\n00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.190\npast one of the big rum distilleries\nlike everyday to get to work, right.\n\n38\n00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.480\nAnd great drink,\nif you like rum it's awesome stuff.\n\n39\n00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.330\nBut unfortunately,\n\n40\n00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.860\nthe smell when they make rum,\noh my God it's just absolutely horrible.\n\n41\n00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.610\nIt's horrible,\n\n42\n00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.120\nit's the process of what they're doing to\nprocess the sugar cane and do everything.\n\n43\n00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.995\nBut the stench that comes off\nthe rum plants is just unbelievable.\n\n44\n00:01:52.995 --> 00:01:53.950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n45\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.130\njust keep that in mind\nwhen you're drinking.\n\n46\n00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.541\nIt's good stuff but\nit's not fun to see it made at all.\n\n47\n00:01:57.541 --> 00:01:58.728\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, anyway.\n\n48\n00:01:58.728 --> 00:02:00.178\nSo real user monitoring, RUM, right?\n\n49\n00:02:00.178 --> 00:02:03.380\nYou know, the concept you're\nmonitoring web-related transactions so\n\n50\n00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.000\nwe're often doing web monitoring,\nthat's what we're looking at,\n\n51\n00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.450\ntrying to capture and analyze every\ntransaction that takes place because what\n\n52\n00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.490\nwe want to do is we want to get a complete\npicture not just of performance but\n\n53\n00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.530\nactually from a security stand point as to\nuse and to the capabilities of the system\n\n54\n00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.420\nand how it's being set up, it's being\nused, how it's being misused and used.\n\n55\n00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.960\nSo, real user monitoring\nallows us to do this.\n\n56\n00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.130\nIt's effectively a passive monitoring\nsolution, allows us to effect.\n\n57\n00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.970\nWe have a web monitoring service that runs\ncontinuously and it's just updating and\n\n58\n00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.370\nreporting on everything that's\nhappening within the box.\n\n59\n00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.840\nIt gives us availability,\ntracking solutions, things of that nature.\n\n60\n00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.120\nWe also have synthetic\nperformance monitoring.\n\n61\n00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.602\nThis has external agents that don't run on\nthe web server but simply run separately.\n\n62\n00:02:42.602 --> 00:02:45.230\nWhereas real user monitoring is\ngoing to involve typically a service\n\n63\n00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.580\nthat runs on the system locally that\nwe want to be able to monitor so\n\n64\n00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.960\non the web server itself we'd have\na monitoring service running there.\n\n65\n00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.640\nSynthetic performance\nmonitoring has external agents\n\n66\n00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.070\nthat are effectively running\nscripted transactions.\n\n67\n00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.550\nThink of them as almost tests\nthat are run against a web app.\n\n68\n00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.000\nWe effectively are trying to impersonate\nwhat a user will do to effectively\n\n69\n00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.050\nrun through a performance cycle\nthat synthetically, or synthesizes\n\n70\n00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.280\nwhat users may do, looking to test\nwithout actually involving real users.\n\n71\n00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.590\nSo this is a fake test in the sense that\nit's not really looking at real usage.\n\n72\n00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.650\nBut rather scripted fake use in order\nto be able to tell what would happen\n\n73\n00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.210\nif a user engaged in this activity.\n\n74\n00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.640\nWe don't track real user sessions,\n\n75\n00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.450\nin other words, we simply create them\nfrom some sort of testing script.\n\n76\n00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.310\nSo synthetic transactions\nare also very important.\n\n77\n00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.220\nWe do a lot of this kind of monitoring\nwhen we want to get a sense of\n\n78\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.500\nwhat performance will be,\na sense of how to scale up a system,\n\n79\n00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.950\na sense of what the security\nliabilities may be.\n\n80\n00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.290\nA good example of software that can do\nthis is Microsoft Systems Operation Center\n\n81\n00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.240\nor System Centers Operations Manager.\n\n82\n00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.680\nThe SCOM product,\nused to be called MOM years ago.\n\n83\n00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.160\nMicrosoft Ops Manager.\n\n84\n00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.250\nThis does synthetic transaction\nmonitoring, or can anyway.\n\n85\n00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.500\nAnd the monitoring of\npackages that are available.\n\n86\n00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.820\nSo we could do things\nlike website monitoring.\n\n87\n00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.480\nWe could do database monitoring.\n\n88\n00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.120\nWe could do TCP port base monitoring.\n\n89\n00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.700\nWe've talked about the value of\nport scanning with you before.\n\n90\n00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.865\nThat's a form of monitoring.\n\n91\n00:04:05.865 --> 00:04:09.195\nWe're looking at open ports but\nnot the form we're really talking about.\n\n92\n00:04:09.195 --> 00:04:12.265\nWhat we would be doing is looking\nat traffic in the ports, looking at\n\n93\n00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:15.445\nultimately what is coming through there,\nand trying to assess traffic.\n\n94\n00:04:15.445 --> 00:04:17.305\nWe did talk about a while back,\n\n95\n00:04:17.305 --> 00:04:20.415\none of our earlier conversations\nin one of the earlier episodes,\n\n96\n00:04:20.415 --> 00:04:23.275\na video that I recommended to you,\nThe Good Warriors of the .net.\n\n97\n00:04:23.275 --> 00:04:27.405\nAnd the reason I'm bringing it up again to\nremind you about that is ports just kind\n\n98\n00:04:27.405 --> 00:04:30.410\nof hit my mind and I'm thinking, oh,\nwhat are the connections there and\n\n99\n00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.640\nwhat should I be thinking about,\nwhat should I tell all of you?\n\n100\n00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.250\nAnd one of the things that's important\nthat when we think about with ports and\n\n101\n00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.670\nmonitoring, is what's the inbound traffic\nthat's causing the use of the port,\n\n102\n00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.070\nwhat kind of traffic is it?\n\n103\n00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.360\nWe may be sending traffic\nto a well known port but\n\n104\n00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.170\nit may be the incorrect,\nthe wrong type of traffic.\n\n105\n00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.100\nAnd we talked about what can happen\nwhen we send in incorrect information\n\n106\n00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.830\nin to a system.\n\n107\n00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.700\nFrom a testing and a scanning prospective,\nwe may get unexpected results.\n\n108\n00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.350\nAnd those results can tell us\nsomething about the system.\n\n109\n00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.015\nRemember the fin, expos, and null scan\nconversation that we had as well,\n\n110\n00:05:02.015 --> 00:05:05.945\nso when we think about stuff like that,\nwatching that video, Good Warriors of\n\n111\n00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:09.045\nthe .Net, may be helpful getting to\nbring all that together for you.\n\n112\n00:05:09.045 --> 00:05:10.805\nIt's a nice,\nI think it's about 10 minutes or\n\n113\n00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:13.825\nso, animated short made by Erickson Labs.\n\n114\n00:05:13.825 --> 00:05:15.095\nReally, really cool.\n\n115\n00:05:15.095 --> 00:05:18.205\nIt's a little old, little dated, they\nactually have Netscape browser in there,\n\n116\n00:05:18.205 --> 00:05:19.610\nif you remember Netscape.\n\n117\n00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.620\nOldie but a goodie till Microsoft\nput a knife right finally\n\n118\n00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:23.830\nin the heart of that thing.\n\n119\n00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.292\nBut one of the original web browsers,\nthey actually, you'll have it,\n\n120\n00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:28.330\nit is a little dated.\n\n121\n00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.850\nI mean, you get it, you'll see.\n\n122\n00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.610\nBut it's kinda interesting,\nit's kinda cool.\n\n123\n00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.510\nIt's a really fun way to learn about\nthe basic concepts of networking, and\n\n124\n00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.200\nit can help you tie a lot of this\nknowledge together with regards to some of\n\n125\n00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.000\nthe stuff we're talking about.\n\n126\n00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.129\nSo you definitely definitely\nshould go out and take a look.\n\n127\n00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:43.379\nMike will be offering signed\ncopies in the lobby later today\n\n128\n00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.921\nduring happy hour from 5:00 to 5:01.\n\n129\n00:05:45.921 --> 00:05:48.210\nIf you're here you can\ntake advantage of that.\n\n130\n00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.820\nSynthetic monitoring very important.\n\n131\n00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.560\nRight?\nSo you want to think\n\n132\n00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.680\nabout what are the benefits\nof synthetic monitoring.\n\n133\n00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.520\nYou know versus real user monitoring.\n\n134\n00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.240\nWe have to compare the two for a minute.\n\n135\n00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.370\nReal user monitoring\nmonitors real user sessions.\n\n136\n00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.610\nIf we don't have a lot of activity, we're\nnot doing a lot of real user monitoring.\n\n137\n00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.120\nRight?\n\n138\n00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.922\nSo if we want 24 by 7 assessment and\nwe only have 12 by 12 activity,\n\n139\n00:06:07.922 --> 00:06:10.090\nwe're not gonna get 24 by 7.\n\n140\n00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.180\nSo, in other words, if users are only in\nthe system during certain periods of time,\n\n141\n00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.760\nreal user monitoring is\ngreat when we have users.\n\n142\n00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.230\nIt's a little less than adequate when we\nhave none, there's just nothing going on.\n\n143\n00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.350\nThere's a whole lot of nothing,\nas they say.\n\n144\n00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.390\nSo synthetic monitoring\ncan fill the gap for us.\n\n145\n00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.130\nSo we have to really think about using\nthe two together because what synthetic\n\n146\n00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.450\nmonitoring can do is make up for the lack\nof real users by simply using test scripts\n\n147\n00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.750\nto approximate what real\nusage would look like.\n\n148\n00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.110\nSo, want to be thinking about that.\n\n149\n00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.290\nObviously think about whether\nwe can use synthetic monitoring.\n\n150\n00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.620\nTo be able to assess whether we're meeting\nour SLA requirements or not, right?\n\n151\n00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.510\nIs the system capable of scaling and\nperforming as needed?\n\n152\n00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.660\nAnother thing that synthetic\ntesting can do for us.\n\n153\n00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.740\nSo these are lots of different\nways that we can deploy and\n\n154\n00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.490\nuse this kind of technology.\n\n155\n00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.650\nWhen we think about code reviews and\ntesting, we think about code and\n\n156\n00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.330\nmonitoring and looking at what's going on.\n\n157\n00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.390\nWe have to think about the fact that,\nas I've said,\n\n158\n00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.800\nthere's a lot of complexity in operating\nsystem and application code today.\n\n159\n00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.310\nHundreds, thousands,\nperhaps hundreds of thousands or\n\n160\n00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.930\nmillions of lines of code that\nmake up a modern operating system.\n\n161\n00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.370\nProbably tens if not hundreds of thousands\nof lines to make up a modern application.\n\n162\n00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.760\nYou think about the fact that\nMicrosoft Office, the 2013 or\n\n163\n00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.380\n2016 version of Office, is gonna be\na significantly large application.\n\n164\n00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.810\nI mean it is approaching what,\nprobably three gigs now,\n\n165\n00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.520\napproximately, on 2016 version,\nsomething like that.\n\n166\n00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.200\nI mean, some Microsoft operating systems,\nsome of the earlier ones are not that big.\n\n167\n00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.480\nSo it's bigger than some of the operating\nsystems we actually install and run.\n\n168\n00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.850\nTo give you a point of reference,\n\n169\n00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:43.620\nVMware's ESXI operating system\nis approximately 75 megs, right?\n\n170\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.220\nThis is three or four gigs.\n\n171\n00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.360\nI mean, we're talking about programs that\nare bigger than operating systems in\n\n172\n00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.210\nsome cases.\n\n173\n00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.650\nThere's a tremendous amount of code\nthat's existing in that program.\n\n174\n00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.021\nYou're loading it all in, depending\non the choices you make, of course.\n\n175\n00:07:55.021 --> 00:07:57.888\nYou're loading it all in\neffectively sight unseen.\n\n176\n00:07:57.888 --> 00:08:00.385\nI mean, how many of us really\nunderstand what Office does?\n\n177\n00:08:00.385 --> 00:08:04.120\nI mean in theory we do but do you really\nknow what all the code in the Office\n\n178\n00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.640\napplication is capable of doing?\n\n179\n00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.990\nWe really don't,\nthat's part of the problem.\n\n180\n00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.750\nWe just don't know as users.\n\n181\n00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.970\nI'm sure somewhere, somebody at Microsoft,\nin theory, has an idea.\n\n182\n00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.950\nA lot of somebodies do, but the reality\nis, do they understand everything it does?\n\n183\n00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.830\nDo they understand everything it's\ncapable of doing in every circumstance?\n\n184\n00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.430\nThey don't, nobody does.\n\n185\n00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.460\nThat's why we have zero day exploits.\n\n186\n00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.950\nRight?\nBecause if we did understand everything,\n\n187\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.110\nif we understood how everything would\nwork no matter what the possibility and\n\n188\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:31.360\nthe combination would be,\n\n189\n00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.680\nwe would already know what all\nthe potential vulnerabilities are.\n\n190\n00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.050\nI'm gonna reach all the way back to one\nof our first episodes and talk to you for\n\n191\n00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:40.600\na minute about threat events,\nthreat sources, and vulnerabilities.\n\n192\n00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.170\nRight?\nThis is vocabulary we've really pounded on\n\n193\n00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:44.770\nfor some time and talked about.\n\n194\n00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.070\nRemember threat sources are threat actors.\n\n195\n00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.800\nThey're bad people,\nbad systems looking to do us harm.\n\n196\n00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.920\nAll right?\n\n197\n00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.670\nA threat event is the event\nthat's going to occur that\n\n198\n00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.060\ncould potentially take\nadvantage of the vulnerability.\n\n199\n00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.730\nThe vulnerability is the weakness.\n\n200\n00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.390\nThere are lots of hidden vulnerabilities.\n\n201\n00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.970\nWe call them zero day exploits in software\nthat we may not be aware of until\n\n202\n00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.340\nthe actually pop up and we find out that\nthere's a problem we have to take on and\n\n203\n00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.820\nsomehow deal with and mitigate.\n\n204\n00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.010\nCode review and\ntesting helps us to deal with this.\n\n205\n00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:14.190\nWe may not know about it ahead of time,\nbut by doing more review of the code,\n\n206\n00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.100\nthe more we look,\nthe more likely it is we're gonna find,\n\n207\n00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.290\nhopefully the things that are problematic.\n\n208\n00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.010\nSo security must be a priority,\nin every phase of software development.\n\n209\n00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.290\nAnd code review and testing helps us\nto focus on this thought process.\n\n210\n00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.640\nThe idea is ultimately, we want to\nprevent software vulnerabilities, and\n\n211\n00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.960\ntry to make sure that if we can\nidentify them, we are able to.\n\n212\n00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.260\nAnd then of course we have to\nalso understand that some of\n\n213\n00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.580\nthe vulnerabilities we may identify\nmay not be important enough for\n\n214\n00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.370\nus to fix at the time we identify them.\n\n215\n00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.410\nSome of them, in other words,\nmay not be that critical.\n\n216\n00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.220\nWe have to assess and judge impact and\nexposure, right, and risk.\n\n217\n00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.450\nBecause these are things\nthat we have to decide on.\n\n218\n00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:53.050\nA vulnerability that can be exploited, but\nit's low level and really isn't going to\n\n219\n00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.980\ncause a problem, may not be worth the\ndevelopment time and energy and money it\n\n220\n00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.640\ntakes to go back and fix it, unless we're\nfixing other problems in that area.\n\n221\n00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.380\nBut a high visibility vulnerability,\none that can lead to impact, and\n\n222\n00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.060\ncan lead to excessive risk or amount of\nvulnerability that is going to be very\n\n223\n00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:12.560\nvery significant may be important enough\nfor us to go back in to effectively patch.\n\n224\n00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.190\nAnd so we have to think about that.\n\n225\n00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:19.330\nBad programming, misconfiguration of\nsecurity infrastructure, functional bugs,\n\n226\n00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.370\nlogical flaws,\n\n227\n00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.210\nthese are all things that ultimately\nlead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n228\n00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:27.320\nWe have to be aware of that and we have to\ndo as much as we can from a due diligence\n\n229\n00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.900\nand due care perspective to identify\nthis as early on as possible.\n\n230\n00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.990\nWe often talk in the trade,\nin our industry, about securing early and\n\n231\n00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:39.110\nsecuring often as a way of thinking about\nthe idea that we have build security in\n\n232\n00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:43.280\nto every layer, every level of\nthe development cycle in the SDLC,\n\n233\n00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.130\nthe security development life cycle or\nthe software development life cycle or\n\n234\n00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:48.870\nthe system development life cycle.\n\n235\n00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.230\nSDLC can mean so\nmany different things, right?\n\n236\n00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.950\nSo the idea is that ultimately\nin that development life cycle,\n\n237\n00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.600\nwe have to put security in.\n\n238\n00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.770\nWe have to really think about\nbaking it in at every stage,\n\n239\n00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:02.560\nfrom the business requirements\nanalysis gathering up front,\n\n240\n00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.780\nall the way through to design,\nto development, to implementation,\n\n241\n00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.510\nto operation and maintenance, and\nultimately through decommission.\n\n242\n00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.040\nAll the phases have to have\nsecurity associated with them, and\n\n243\n00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.380\nif they don't, What's gonna happen is\nwe're gonna think about security late,\n\n244\n00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.690\ntraditionally in that life cycle, when\nwe're already into probably operation and\n\n245\n00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:22.920\nmaintenance, maybe in,\nyou know, implementation.\n\n246\n00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.930\nBut we're not gonna think about\nit during the requirements and\n\n247\n00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.265\nthe design phase traditionally.\n\n248\n00:11:26.265 --> 00:11:28.915\nThat's the disconnect,\nthe problem we have to address.\n\n249\n00:11:28.915 --> 00:11:32.915\nAnd because we don't get to it there,\nthe problem becomes that we often then\n\n250\n00:11:32.915 --> 00:11:36.175\nare very late to the party, and we start\ntrying to talk about what can go wrong,\n\n251\n00:11:36.175 --> 00:11:38.255\nand the reasons why this\nis not gonna make sense.\n\n252\n00:11:38.255 --> 00:11:40.095\nBut everything's already been designed.\n\n253\n00:11:40.095 --> 00:11:41.965\nIt's already been aligned\nwith business requirements.\n\n254\n00:11:41.965 --> 00:11:44.315\nWe've already effectively\nfigured out what we're gonna do.\n\n255\n00:11:44.315 --> 00:11:48.695\nTo go back and change things at that late\npoint in the game is incredibly costly,\n\n256\n00:11:48.695 --> 00:11:50.030\nboth in time and money.\n\n257\n00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.606\nRight?\nSo we have to think about the fact that\n\n258\n00:11:51.606 --> 00:11:53.376\na lot of people may say just hey,\nit's not worth it,\n\n259\n00:11:53.376 --> 00:11:55.000\nwe're not going to deal with that.\n\n260\n00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.900\nAnd that's why we have things\nthat are insecure being released.\n\n261\n00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:00.050\nIt's not the only reason, but\nit's one of the primary reasons.\n\n262\n00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.860\nSo want to make sure we're aware of this.\n\n263\n00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.120\nSo testing techniques become important.\n\n264\n00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.000\nHow are we gonna test?\n\n265\n00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.720\nRight?\n\n266\n00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.450\nBlack box versus white box.\n\n267\n00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.080\nDynamic versus static.\n\n268\n00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.700\nManual versus automated.\n\n269\n00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:12.250\nThese are testing techniques.\n\n270\n00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.290\nThese are mechanisms, methods,\nthat we can use to test.\n\n271\n00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.810\nBlack box versus white box,\nso let's talk about that.\n\n272\n00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.270\nMike was shaking his head and\nsmiling when I said that.\n\n273\n00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.130\nSo Mike, what do you think about\nblack box versus white box testing?\n\n274\n00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.990\n>> I'm thinking black box\nis gonna be very little or\n\n275\n00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.930\nno knowledge of what it is I'm\n>> testing or what it is I'm testing for,\n\n276\n00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:34.920\nwhite box might be where I have a lot\nof knowledge or all the knowledge.\n\n277\n00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.720\n>> Good, good.\nSo\n\n278\n00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.770\nwhat we're gonna do is just\nquickly put up a visual.\n\n279\n00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:40.545\nThis is white box testing.\n\n280\n00:12:40.545 --> 00:12:42.183\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This.\n\n281\n00:12:44.559 --> 00:12:45.060\nThis?\n\n282\n00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.870\nSure it's the right way?\n\n283\n00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.190\nThis is not black box testing but\nit's also not white box testing.\n\n284\n00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:50.150\nThis is a mixture.\n\n285\n00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.870\nWe actually left something off\nthe list called grey box testing.\n\n286\n00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.529\nLet's just talk about that for\na minute as well.\n\n287\n00:12:54.529 --> 00:12:57.215\nI don't have a black box to show you so\nwe're not going to go down that road.\n\n288\n00:12:57.215 --> 00:12:58.393\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But Mike's absolutely right.\n\n289\n00:12:58.393 --> 00:13:00.770\nBlack box testing really zero knowledge.\n\n290\n00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.130\nWe don't know much of anything,\n\n291\n00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.720\nif anything at all,\nabout the system we're testing.\n\n292\n00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.270\nWhite box knowledge full, or white box\ntesting full knowledge, but there's that\n\n293\n00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.470\nhybrid in the middle that we didn't\nput on the list, but it's important,\n\n294\n00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.920\nwhat I was trying to represent with\nthe black text on the white screen or\n\n295\n00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.190\non the white paper,\nwhich is gray box testing.\n\n296\n00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:19.370\nGray box testing is some knowledge,\nbut not full knowledge so\n\n297\n00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:20.610\nit's kind of a hybrid.\n\n298\n00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:22.560\nIt's a partial knowledge situation.\n\n299\n00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.170\nWe may know enough that we can start to\nbegin to probe and examine the system, but\n\n300\n00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.410\nnot enough to fully\nunderstand its operation.\n\n301\n00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.460\nThis is the middle ground,\nthis is gray box testing.\n\n302\n00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.770\nSo make sure we know all three.\n\n303\n00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.800\nDynamic testing versus static testing.\n\n304\n00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.489\nDynamic testing is gonna allow us\n\n305\n00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.580\nto be able to adapt the test as we\nsee things happening in real time.\n\n306\n00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.620\nWe're gonna be able to change\nthe parameters and we're gonna be able to\n\n307\n00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:50.560\nprobe and test activity in the system\nusing in effect a changing model as we go.\n\n308\n00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.940\nA static test is fixed.\n\n309\n00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:54.160\nIt's got certain parameters,\ngonna do certain things.\n\n310\n00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.430\nWhen it's over it's over.\n\n311\n00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.770\nSo the dynamic test is gonna change and\ngrow and\n\n312\n00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.160\nmodify with behavior in the system.\n\n313\n00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.480\nIt's effectively gonna change what we do\nbased on things that are happening in\n\n314\n00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.740\nthe system in real time,\nwhere static testing is just what it is.\n\n315\n00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.130\nI want these three things done.\n\n316\n00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.810\nWhen they're done I want you to stop.\n\n317\n00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.080\nOkay, I did one, two, three, and\nhere is the results and we're done.\n\n318\n00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.590\nManual testing versus automated testing.\n\n319\n00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.070\nLike the name implies, manual testing\nis going to be something that we do\n\n320\n00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.090\nwhen we are effectively\nnot going to automate it.\n\n321\n00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.560\nBut rather, just do it on our own.\n\n322\n00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.470\nWe're going to kick it off.\n\n323\n00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:26.190\nWe're going to walk\nthrough the test scripts.\n\n324\n00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.620\nWe're going to punch the buttons.\n\n325\n00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.190\nWe're going to click on the screen.\n\n326\n00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.260\nWe're going to write down the information.\n\n327\n00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.270\nAutomated testing is traditionally,\nmore often than not, what's done.\n\n328\n00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.070\nAnd automated is that we're going to\nhave some sort of a program run through\n\n329\n00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:38.640\na pre-determined script for us.\n\n330\n00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.445\nAnd do a variety of things,\nand then report back.\n\n331\n00:14:40.445 --> 00:14:42.110\nThat's what automated testing is.\n\n332\n00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:45.230\nSet and forget is how we often\nrefer to automated testing.\n\n333\n00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:49.900\nManual testing is sit on your butt for\nseveral hours, is what manual testing is.\n\n334\n00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.280\nAll right, testing method considerations,\nwhat do we have to think about,\n\n335\n00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.920\nwhat do we have to worry about here?\n\n336\n00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:54.790\nAttack surface, right?\n\n337\n00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.740\nWe've talked a lot about the attack\nsurface reduction concept.\n\n338\n00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.570\nHow big, how broad is the attack\nsurface of the system?\n\n339\n00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.560\nWe have to think about this because the\nbroader the attack surface potential is,\n\n340\n00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.910\nthe broader the test has to be.\n\n341\n00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.894\nIf the attack surface is very small,\n\n342\n00:15:07.894 --> 00:15:12.119\nmeaning the amount of system that is\nexposed potentially liable for attack and\n\n343\n00:15:12.119 --> 00:15:14.980\ntherefore that we have to\ntest against is small.\n\n344\n00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.400\nWe can engage in different kinds of\ntesting activities than if it's very broad\n\n345\n00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.010\nattack surface.\n\n346\n00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.240\nSo we want to think about that.\n\n347\n00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.530\nWhat kind of application\ntypes are we testing?\n\n348\n00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.800\nIs it a web service?\n\n349\n00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.820\nIs it a application that\nruns locally on the machine?\n\n350\n00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.440\nDoes it have remote procedure\ncalls that could be accessed\n\n351\n00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.620\nfrom outside the system to be\nable to engage the application?\n\n352\n00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.700\nIs it a streaming media application?\n\n353\n00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.390\nIs it dealing with sensitive data?\n\n354\n00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:38.560\nThere's a lot of things\nwe have to think about.\n\n355\n00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.140\nWhat application type is it?\n\n356\n00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:44.000\nWhat are the supported technologies that\nwe can use and/or are used on the system?\n\n357\n00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.310\nAre we using Java?\n\n358\n00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.040\nAre we using XML?\n\n359\n00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.490\nAre we using Flash, Adobe Flash?\n\n360\n00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.270\nThese are things to concern\nourselves with when we're testing.\n\n361\n00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.210\nPerformance and resource utilization.\n\n362\n00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.720\nWill the test eat up a certain\namount of performance and resource?\n\n363\n00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.858\nThe answer is absolutely.\n\n364\n00:15:57.858 --> 00:15:59.297\nSo what are we gonna do to offset that?\n\n365\n00:15:59.297 --> 00:16:00.400\nHow do we understand that?\n\n366\n00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.410\nWhat does that look like?\n\n367\n00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.256\nVery important for us to consider.\n\n368\n00:16:03.256 --> 00:16:06.733\nWe've talked about security throughout\nthe development life cycle and\n\n369\n00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:10.440\nthe fact that as we find and uncover\nissues and concerns we have to note them.\n\n370\n00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.705\nWe keep typically what's\nknown as a bug registry,\n\n371\n00:16:12.705 --> 00:16:16.140\na bug tracking system going where\nwe find these things and note them.\n\n372\n00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.360\nBut remember we may not be able to\ntake all of them on right away.\n\n373\n00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.330\nWe may not be able to go in and\nfix everything we find as a problem.\n\n374\n00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:28.050\nThat's why we call secondary releases,\nfeature 2.0 because we gather them all up,\n\n375\n00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.630\nwe fix them and\nthen we put them back out for\n\n376\n00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.400\nyou as if we intended them to happen and\nbe that way all the time.\n\n377\n00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:37.100\nDevious those software manufacturers are,\ndevious I tell you.\n\n378\n00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.290\nSo when we think about bugs,\n\n379\n00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.980\nwe're thinking about things that have\ngone wrong, something that's not right.\n\n380\n00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.330\nSomehow some way when we did a test,\n\n381\n00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:46.610\nwe uncovered something that\nwas not supposed to be there.\n\n382\n00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.460\nThe way that it operates,\nthe thing that it does, whatever it is.\n\n383\n00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.380\nWe document those and remember, we gather\nthem up, we may not fix them all at once.\n\n384\n00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.045\nSo, we may have a group of them that\nare then gonna be patched simultaneously.\n\n385\n00:16:56.045 --> 00:16:57.935\nOr things like that.\n\n386\n00:16:57.935 --> 00:17:01.075\nThis makes sense given the structure and\nthe complexity of the software today and\n\n387\n00:17:01.075 --> 00:17:05.465\nthis is why vendors tend to patch\nonce a month in an ongoing cycle and\n\n388\n00:17:05.465 --> 00:17:09.025\nthey batch those patch releases, so\nthey get multiple patches out the door\n\n389\n00:17:09.025 --> 00:17:13.005\nsimultaneously for various issues and\nconcerns based on bug tracking.\n\n390\n00:17:13.005 --> 00:17:15.575\nIf any of you are involved with bug\ntracking, if anybody does this kind of\n\n391\n00:17:15.575 --> 00:17:19.760\nwork, but it's actually a localized and\nvery specific specialty within security\n\n392\n00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.480\noverall and it's something you have to\nreally be trained to know how to do,\n\n393\n00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.340\ndo testing, do assessment,\ndo these kind of things.\n\n394\n00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:26.180\nIt's something you can learn.\n\n395\n00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.890\nIt's definitely something that you\ncan understand how to do more of,\n\n396\n00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.970\nbut it's something you have to\npractice at to get good at.\n\n397\n00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.290\nIt's one of those things, you can't just\nstart doing right away, you've gotta learn\n\n398\n00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:37.440\na little bit about it and learn\nthe methodologies behind how we do it.\n\n399\n00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.383\nSo it is something to consider.\n\n400\n00:17:39.383 --> 00:17:42.692\nWhen we think about application\ndevelopment, we have to think about not\n\n401\n00:17:42.692 --> 00:17:46.056\njust the development of the software,\nbut we also have to think about what\n\n402\n00:17:46.056 --> 00:17:49.650\nwe have talked about at least one\nother time, which is threat modeling.\n\n403\n00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:53.600\nThinking about the idea of understanding\nhow to build a picture if you will, or\n\n404\n00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.710\na thought process around what the threats\nare we face and how to address them.\n\n405\n00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.381\nThis is obviously going to be very\nimportant for us to think about.\n\n406\n00:17:59.381 --> 00:18:03.174\nIf I have pretty simplistic threats,\nI'm worried about a bad actor attacking my\n\n407\n00:18:03.174 --> 00:18:07.359\nfront end security perimeter, my gateway,\nand I'm worried about them getting through\n\n408\n00:18:07.359 --> 00:18:11.320\nmy DMZ and then trying to get into my web\nserver, that's fairly straightforward.\n\n409\n00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.610\nI can build a threat model that\naddresses that because there's only so\n\n410\n00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.300\nmany ways that can happen.\n\n411\n00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.550\nBut if I'm worried about a bad actor,\nnot just doing that but\n\n412\n00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:22.780\nthen maybe engaging an injection task\nagainst the database because we are or\n\n413\n00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.290\nare not, depending and\nwe'll find out with testing.\n\n414\n00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.850\nWe may or\nmay not be doing input validation.\n\n415\n00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.090\nWe've talked about the need for\ninput validation.\n\n416\n00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:30.730\nWhy its so\n\n417\n00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:34.620\nimportant to prevent malformed data\nfrom being put into the form frame area,\n\n418\n00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.190\nwhere we then insert it into the database\nfield and it may cause incorrect behavior.\n\n419\n00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:41.550\nRight, the database is not\nexpecting null values.\n\n420\n00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:44.820\nWe inject them, the database\nmay not like that very much and\n\n421\n00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:47.880\nit may cause an error and\nexpose data, things of that nature.\n\n422\n00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.640\nSo, input validation\nis gonna be important.\n\n423\n00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.630\nWe have to test for that.\n\n424\n00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.100\nSo if it's a web service,\n\n425\n00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.460\nwe may have additional testing\nconcerns we may have to engage in.\n\n426\n00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.320\nSo, thinking about threat modeling\nbecomes very important because\n\n427\n00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.820\nwe have to build a picture.\n\n428\n00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:03.120\nKind of assess and think through the logic\nof what an attack would look like.\n\n429\n00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.675\nWhat threat modeling does is it\nhelps us to answer the question.\n\n430\n00:19:06.675 --> 00:19:07.795\nWhat would happen if?\n\n431\n00:19:07.795 --> 00:19:09.195\nRight.\nAnd what would happen if\n\n432\n00:19:09.195 --> 00:19:12.995\nthis attack occurred, this thing was\ngoing on, this vulnerability was found.\n\n433\n00:19:12.995 --> 00:19:16.135\nThis particular solution was\nused this way to attack us.\n\n434\n00:19:16.135 --> 00:19:17.915\nHow would we be able to react?\n\n435\n00:19:17.915 --> 00:19:19.175\nWhat would go on?\n\n436\n00:19:19.175 --> 00:19:21.245\nThat's what threat modeling\nis really all about.\n\n437\n00:19:21.245 --> 00:19:23.575\nThreat modeling is something that\nwe do as part of assessment and\n\n438\n00:19:23.575 --> 00:19:26.775\ntesting cuz we have to have\nwhat-if scenarios available so\n\n439\n00:19:26.775 --> 00:19:30.510\nwe understand how we will react and\nwhat our capabilities are, so\n\n440\n00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.180\nwe can focus on making sure\nwe're as prepared as we can be.\n\n441\n00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.780\nSo it is important for us to think about.\n\n442\n00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:40.450\nWanna think about static source\ncode analysis, we'll call it SAST,\n\n443\n00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.510\nstatic source code analysis and\nmanual code review.\n\n444\n00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.560\nThe idea of being able to go through and\n\n445\n00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.160\nlook at the actual\napplication code as I said.\n\n446\n00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.430\nLine by line, looking for vulnerabilities\nand trying to figure out what's in there,\n\n447\n00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.890\nbut this is the trick with this.\n\n448\n00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:55.822\nWe're not gonna actually execute the code.\n\n449\n00:19:55.822 --> 00:19:59.420\nWe're gonna simply do a code\nreview of the raw code,\n\n450\n00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.750\nif you will,\nthe actual lines of code in the system.\n\n451\n00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:04.930\nBut without executing it to find\nout what the program actually does.\n\n452\n00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:09.060\nThis is one mechanism that we can use\nduring application development to look for\n\n453\n00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.160\nvulnerabilities, but\nwe're not going to run the application.\n\n454\n00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.020\nWe're simply gonna do\na line-by-line code review.\n\n455\n00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.020\nWith a static binary code analysis,\nand manual binary review.\n\n456\n00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.570\nI don't have an acronym for that one.\n\n457\n00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.790\nLet's just, static binary code\nanalysis and manual binary review\n\n458\n00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:28.410\nactually looks at analysis of the compiled\napplication, the binary itself.\n\n459\n00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.670\nTo look at vulnerabilities\n\n460\n00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:31.920\nwithout actually executing\nthe applications either.\n\n461\n00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.205\nSo we're looking at all the raw code\nwhen we do SAST, before it's compiled.\n\n462\n00:20:36.205 --> 00:20:38.490\nWe're then looking in\nbinary code analysis and\n\n463\n00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.660\nreview at the actual compiled programs\nto see what's going on there.\n\n464\n00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.120\nBecause things could change.\n\n465\n00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.100\nWe wanna make sure we\nunderstand both visions.\n\n466\n00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.130\nEither way, we are looking at this without\nactually executing the application.\n\n467\n00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:52.080\nSo we just wanna make sure we're aware\nof that and we think about that.\n\n468\n00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.100\nWe can do manual or automated pen testing,\nwe know and understand,\n\n469\n00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.728\nhopefully, the value of that.\n\n470\n00:20:56.728 --> 00:20:59.240\nWe could do vulnerability assessments,\nwe've talked a lot about that and\n\n471\n00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.790\nwhy testing in that regard\nis important as well.\n\n472\n00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:03.320\nWe haven't talked about fuzz testing.\n\n473\n00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.080\nFuzz test is kind of a fun one.\n\n474\n00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.240\nFun to say, fun to do.\n\n475\n00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:12.164\nFuzz testing and fuzz testing tools,\nis the idea of sending random data, fuzz,\n\n476\n00:21:12.164 --> 00:21:16.140\nnoise in effect, into the system\nto see how the system behaves.\n\n477\n00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.470\nSo the idea is that if we do fuzz\ntesting against a web server,\n\n478\n00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.385\nfuzz testing against a database,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n479\n00:21:22.385 --> 00:21:23.890\nWe're randomly sampling and\n\n480\n00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.720\nrandomly sending data into the system\nthat may or may not be accepted, may or\n\n481\n00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.630\nmay not be formatted correctly,\nmay or may not be expected\n\n482\n00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:34.070\nto see what the boundaries of limitations\nof the performance of the system will be.\n\n483\n00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.905\nIf the system doesn't like what we send\nit, it should throw an exception and\n\n484\n00:21:37.905 --> 00:21:38.865\ngenerate an error.\n\n485\n00:21:38.865 --> 00:21:40.655\nBut it should not stop working.\n\n486\n00:21:40.655 --> 00:21:43.055\nIt should not expose confidential data.\n\n487\n00:21:43.055 --> 00:21:45.665\nIt should not effectively\nhave a buffer overflow and\n\n488\n00:21:45.665 --> 00:21:49.495\nwind up dumping over into a command\nprompt with root level access.\n\n489\n00:21:49.495 --> 00:21:50.815\nThose things should not occur.\n\n490\n00:21:50.815 --> 00:21:53.375\nFuzz testing will help us push\nthe boundaries to see what does occur.\n\n491\n00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:57.300\nSo it's obviously gonna be a very\nimportant thought process for us as well.\n\n492\n00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.780\nWe have to think about system\noperation and maintenance.\n\n493\n00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.050\nWhat goes on when we're operating and\nmaintaining a system?\n\n494\n00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.540\nWe have to probe and\ntest during these phases as well\n\n495\n00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:08.277\nto better understand what the ultimate\nlimitations of the system maybe.\n\n496\n00:22:08.277 --> 00:22:12.095\nYour software testing is limited by our\nability to understand the system and\n\n497\n00:22:12.095 --> 00:22:13.315\nby the access we're given.\n\n498\n00:22:13.315 --> 00:22:15.655\nSo we have to be thinking about\nthe things that we can do and\n\n499\n00:22:15.655 --> 00:22:17.755\nthe things that may be available to us.\n\n500\n00:22:17.755 --> 00:22:20.075\nWe obviously are going to be\nthinking about expected results.\n\n501\n00:22:20.075 --> 00:22:21.760\nWe assume certain things will happen.\n\n502\n00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.640\nWe may not expect everything that happens,\nso\n\n503\n00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.820\nwe have to document what does happen, so\nthat way we can go back and assess that,\n\n504\n00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.990\nand figure out whether or not it was (a)\nexpected, and (b), if it was not expected,\n\n505\n00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.955\nthen what are we gonna do to be able\nto figure out how to address that.\n\n506\n00:22:34.955 --> 00:22:40.300\nIf purple unicorns come spouting out the\ntop of the server when we do fuzz testing\n\n507\n00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.120\nand we did not expect that, that may be\nsomething we wanna take note of, right?\n\n508\n00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.260\nBecause that could be a bit\nof a challenge for us.\n\n509\n00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.330\nUnless you like purple unicorns,\nin which case it's perfectly acceptable.\n\n510\n00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.295\nI happen to think they're\nabsolutely lovely myself so\n\n511\n00:22:51.295 --> 00:22:53.070\nthat;s just something to consider, right?\n\n512\n00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:56.178\nBut if we have unexpected behavior, we\nwanna make sure we're thinking about that,\n\n513\n00:22:56.178 --> 00:22:58.280\nand most importantly we're capturing that.\n\n514\n00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.510\nSo we understand what\nthe outcome of that will be.\n\n515\n00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.590\nSo, software testing, right?\n\n516\n00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.270\nWe've talked a lot about what we're doing.\n\n517\n00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.050\nAre there tenets, are there best\npractices, are there things we should be\n\n518\n00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:10.970\nthinking about doing, as CISSPs,\nas security professionals?\n\n519\n00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.420\nAbsolutely there are, right?\n\n520\n00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.460\nWe should make sure that if we have\nexpected outcomes that have been\n\n521\n00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:18.900\nidentified as we were just talking about,\nwe should document them and\n\n522\n00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.100\nwe should test to validate\nwhether they occur.\n\n523\n00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.340\nSo in other words if there\nare requirements the system is supposed to\n\n524\n00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.672\nmeet and we know what those are, we should\nmake sure our tests reflect those and\n\n525\n00:23:26.672 --> 00:23:29.350\nsee whether that's the actual case or not.\n\n526\n00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:33.550\nA good test case has a high probability\nof exposing errors, more often than not.\n\n527\n00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:37.180\nAnd if you have well formed test cases,\nyou should find errors.\n\n528\n00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.980\nThat's one of the key things we look for.\n\n529\n00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.250\nA successful test is considered to be\none that does find an error, and so\n\n530\n00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.580\nwe wanna make sure that we know that.\n\n531\n00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.600\nI'm not saying that if you\nrun a bunch of tests and\n\n532\n00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.580\nyou find no errors, that's a failure.\n\n533\n00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.500\nI'm just pointing out that if\nyou run a bunch of tests and\n\n534\n00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.740\ndon't find errors,\nwe don't consider that successful.\n\n535\n00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:54.750\nWhat we say is,\nyou simply didn't find errors.\n\n536\n00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:58.088\nThe goal, remember, I don't wanna\nseem negative when I say this,\n\n537\n00:23:58.088 --> 00:24:01.740\nbut the goal with testing is that we're\nlooking for what we know is there.\n\n538\n00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.326\nWe know errors are there, we're just not\nsure if we've identified where they are,\n\n539\n00:24:05.326 --> 00:24:06.754\nand therefore, why they exist.\n\n540\n00:24:06.754 --> 00:24:10.460\nThe goal by pushing the boundaries here\nis to try to figure out what those errors\n\n541\n00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.870\nare, try to make sure we know about them.\n\n542\n00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:16.520\nIf you run a set of tests against\nthe system you get no errors.\n\n543\n00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.870\nIt could mean one of three things right?\n\n544\n00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.150\nIt could mean that the tests were\nperfectly fine you set them up\n\n545\n00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:20.870\nthe right way.\n\n546\n00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:24.170\nYou did all the right things and there\nlegitimately are no errors in the system.\n\n547\n00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.090\nWe can throw that one off to the side and\nforget about it.\n\n548\n00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.320\n>> Right.\n>> Cuz that's not really never happens,\n\n549\n00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.550\nlike, we put a zero up and, you know,\nMike, put a line in front of that for me.\n\n550\n00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:34.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Put a zero up, we do that, right?\n\n551\n00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.610\nNo, we can't see it in the wide shot.\n\n552\n00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.400\nPut a zero up like that,\nright, there we go, right?\n\n553\n00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.360\nThat's never happened.\n\n554\n00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.490\nThat doesn't happen, right?\n\n555\n00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.490\nSo we can say that, but\nwe know that's not the case.\n\n556\n00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:43.205\nSo although that is an option,\n\n557\n00:24:43.205 --> 00:24:47.895\nreality says that it's probably not\nreally the case that there aren't errors.\n\n558\n00:24:47.895 --> 00:24:52.495\nSo the second option is you didn't setup\nthe testing properly to uncover the errors\n\n559\n00:24:52.495 --> 00:24:55.675\nthat are there, which means you have\na flaw in the testing methodology.\n\n560\n00:24:55.675 --> 00:24:57.395\nThe third thing is, you ran the test.\n\n561\n00:24:57.395 --> 00:24:58.615\nThey were set correctly.\n\n562\n00:24:58.615 --> 00:25:00.225\nBut you didn't run them long enough.\n\n563\n00:25:00.225 --> 00:25:02.245\nDidn't test the right areas of the system.\n\n564\n00:25:02.245 --> 00:25:05.875\nAnd or you found errors, but you're\nnot recognizing them because you don't\n\n565\n00:25:05.875 --> 00:25:09.480\nunderstand what you're seeing,\nwhich can also be a problem, legitimately.\n\n566\n00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.900\nYou may get bad data that\nindicates there are problems, but\n\n567\n00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.650\nyou may not know how to interpret it.\n\n568\n00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.010\nAnd this is also something to\nbe aware of and to consider.\n\n569\n00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.770\nSo again,\nthis is why we need professionals.\n\n570\n00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:21.630\nThis is why we need trained experts\nthat understand systems, and\n\n571\n00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.350\nunderstand output from tests.\n\n572\n00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:26.640\nTo look at it and go, yeah,\nthis line right here, where it says five.\n\n573\n00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.650\nAnd it really normally is\nonly supposed to be three.\n\n574\n00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.470\nThat's the problem, right?\n\n575\n00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:33.650\nBecause five indicates something's going\non that's not supposed to be happening.\n\n576\n00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.850\nWe may look at that, Mike and I,\nand go well that looks like five.\n\n577\n00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:37.540\nFive's good, right?\n\n578\n00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.550\nI mean it's bigger than four,\nless than six.\n\n579\n00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:40.820\nIt's a good number, right?\n\n580\n00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.230\nSo five is okay.\n\n581\n00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:43.090\nWe don't know.\n\n582\n00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:44.840\nThe problem is we're not\nthe ones who can tell you for\n\n583\n00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.480\nsure whether that's good or not.\n\n584\n00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.280\nYou need the application expert\nthat understands the code\n\n585\n00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.960\nthat can tell you whether five\nis actually an expected outcome.\n\n586\n00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.160\nAnd if it is let's\nidentify what it means and\n\n587\n00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.540\nif it's not why the hell is it showing up?\n\n588\n00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:57.950\nAnd what's it doing what's it mean?\n\n589\n00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:01.490\nSo you may understand what's there,\nbut not really get it or\n\n590\n00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:04.410\nyou just may not see it,\neither way that can be a problem as well.\n\n591\n00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:06.280\nThat's something else we have\nto think about and be aware of.\n\n592\n00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.680\nSo these are things you want to\n\n593\n00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.030\nthink about when we're talk\nabout software testing.\n\n594\n00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.980\nWhen we talk about software testing and\ncode testing,\n\n595\n00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.025\nwe're talking about\ndifferent levels of testing.\n\n596\n00:26:14.025 --> 00:26:15.655\nWe talk about unit level testing.\n\n597\n00:26:15.655 --> 00:26:18.535\nUnit level testing is the fact\nthat we're gonna test one little\n\n598\n00:26:18.535 --> 00:26:20.315\nfunctional component, right?\n\n599\n00:26:20.315 --> 00:26:23.915\nWhen we talk about system level testing,\nwe're talking about the entire system.\n\n600\n00:26:23.915 --> 00:26:25.715\nSo, if I go ahead and I grab\n\n601\n00:26:26.915 --> 00:26:31.925\nmy handy dandy testing implementation\nvisual aid tool here, my water bottle,\n\n602\n00:26:31.925 --> 00:26:35.355\nright, there are effectively three\ncomponents to this water bottle, right?\n\n603\n00:26:35.355 --> 00:26:37.190\nThere is the bottle itself.\n\n604\n00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.980\nThere is the water.\n\n605\n00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.900\nI'm not pouring this out to show\nyou there's water in there.\n\n606\n00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.340\nBut you can see there is water.\n\n607\n00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:43.970\nSo there's the information,\nor the liquid inside.\n\n608\n00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.990\nThere's the container, and\nthere's also the sealing mechanism,\n\n609\n00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:49.060\nwhich is the cap that goes on the top.\n\n610\n00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.540\nIf I was doing unit level testing,\nI would have to test the cap,\n\n611\n00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.390\nI would have to test the bottle,\nI would have to test the water.\n\n612\n00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:58.510\nThese are the three units that\nmake up the actual system.\n\n613\n00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.310\nWhen I want to do the system testing,\nI have to put the cap on the bottle,\n\n614\n00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.200\nthis is important right?\n\n615\n00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.840\nBecause then when you do this at Mike,\n\n616\n00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.880\nI want to make sure that\nwater doesn't come out.\n\n617\n00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.710\nSo when we put all three together,\nand we test the system.\n\n618\n00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.940\nI have to make sure all\nthe components work.\n\n619\n00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:13.870\nSo this is how we are gonna\nbe doing system testing.\n\n620\n00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.670\nWe talked about integration\ntesting where we are integrating,\n\n621\n00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.110\nwe're putting the components together.\n\n622\n00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:22.170\nI take the system container, I put\nthe water in and then I test those two.\n\n623\n00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.090\nI put the cap on, I test all three.\n\n624\n00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:25.100\nThat's the integration,\n\n625\n00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.340\nthe building of all the units\ntogether to create the system.\n\n626\n00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.980\nThat's a separate level of testing, and\nthen we do system testing on top of that.\n\n627\n00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:34.540\nSo, we're gonna do\ndifferent kinds of testing.\n\n628\n00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.330\nWe have different test cases that\nwe use to do the testing, right?\n\n629\n00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:40.975\nAnd we're gonna obviously wanna see\nwhat happens at each individual level,\n\n630\n00:27:40.975 --> 00:27:42.210\nthe unit level.\n\n631\n00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.480\nIs the cap gonna meet\nthe requirements in the stress test,\n\n632\n00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:47.140\ngonna keep the water in the bottle-\n>> Thankfully yes.\n\n633\n00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:48.430\n>> The container itself, right what?\n\n634\n00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.050\n>> Thankfully yes. [LAUGH] >> In\nthis case, right, thankfully yes.\n\n635\n00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.710\nMike's saying thankfully it did, great.\n\n636\n00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.085\nMike is dry, you'll notice, right.\n\n637\n00:27:53.085 --> 00:27:55.196\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Absolutely no water was harmed\n\n638\n00:27:55.196 --> 00:27:57.029\nin the filming of this episode at all.\n\n639\n00:27:57.029 --> 00:28:00.280\nSo I just wanna make sure we think about\nthe fact that we can test different\n\n640\n00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:00.934\ncomponents.\n\n641\n00:28:00.934 --> 00:28:04.381\nWe test the building of this components\ninto the integration of it, the system.\n\n642\n00:28:04.381 --> 00:28:11.521\nWe do unit testing of\nthe individual parts.\n\n643\n00:28:11.521 --> 00:28:13.274\nWe do the integration\nputting them all together.\n\n644\n00:28:13.274 --> 00:28:17.123\nAnd then, we do the system testing which\nis the entire system integrated fully as\n\n645\n00:28:17.123 --> 00:28:17.980\na coherent unit.\n\n646\n00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.360\nWe're going to do all three.\n\n647\n00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.720\nThis is also going to be very\nimportant for us to consider.\n\n648\n00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.750\nAnd when we talk about testing,\nfinally, to wrap up our conversation in\n\n649\n00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:28.650\nthis particular episode,\nwe also have to understand the outcome.\n\n650\n00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.160\nWe talked a lot about,\nwe have to have metrics.\n\n651\n00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.580\nWe have to understand and\nmeasure what we're seeing.\n\n652\n00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.660\nSo metrics are going to be very important,\nright?\n\n653\n00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:35.580\nWhat kind of metrics?\n\n654\n00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.170\nWell, it depends on what we're testing.\n\n655\n00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:40.600\nWe may just simply look at the fact\nthat the water stayed in the bottle so\n\n656\n00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.330\nwas it a success, yes or no?\n\n657\n00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.260\nMay look at how much\nwater is in the bottle.\n\n658\n00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.740\nMay look at how much volume the actual can\ncontain versus how much liquid's in there\n\n659\n00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.800\nversus the stress test of keeping\nthe liquid in the bottle,\n\n660\n00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.980\nbecause of the number of times\nwe shook it or whatever.\n\n661\n00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.490\nSo all these ways to measure things.\n\n662\n00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.200\nMy point is metrics, generically,\n\n663\n00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:00.240\nare important because they give us data\nabout outcomes success or failure and\n\n664\n00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.330\nthis is ultimately what we're looking for\nwhen we're doing assessment and testing.\n\n665\n00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:04.590\n>> Very good, Adam.\n\n666\n00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.730\nAgain, a lot of great information there\nwe looked at assessment and testing and\n\n667\n00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:14.840\nwe saw monitoring doing real user\nmonitoring verses synthetic monitoring.\n\n668\n00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.600\nA lot of looking at code, and\nhow complex that can be, and really,\n\n669\n00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.730\nthe importance of bringing in people\nthat can help you, trained experts,\n\n670\n00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.560\nas Adam said, in that particular area,\nif it's not yours.\n\n671\n00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.640\nAnd when you're analyzing thousands or\n\n672\n00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:30.860\nmillions of lines of code,\nthat can be a very complex process.\n\n673\n00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.650\nSo thanks Adam, for\nall that great information.\n\n674\n00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:34.990\nRemember, if you wanna sit in\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n675\n00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:38.171\nshoot us an email here\nat SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n676\n00:29:38.171 --> 00:29:40.010\nSigning off for now.\n\n677\n00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:41.260\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n678\n00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.150\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n679\n00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.510\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n680\n00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:46.205\n>> Take care, everybody.\n\n681\n00:29:46.205 --> 00:29:47.946\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.210\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.490\nToday we're doing our CISSP content and\n\n5\n00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.720\nspecifically we're looking\nat assessment and testing.\n\n6\n00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.540\nThis is our third part so\nif you missed those first few parts,\n\n7\n00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.550\nmake sure you go back and watch those as\nwe are continuing our thought process.\n\n8\n00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.750\nWith that in mind, I'm just going to turn\nit right back over to Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.680\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n10\n00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.510\n>> Good, good, good.\n\n11\n00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.330\nHow is that water treating you by the way?\n\n12\n00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.801\n>> Yeah, it's good.\nI got all dried up.\n\n13\n00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:40.843\n[LAUGH]\n>> Alright, that's good, good.\n\n14\n00:00:40.843 --> 00:00:43.580\nWe don't want you catching cold\nwhile we're talking about security.\n\n15\n00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.900\nSo we were talking about metrics,\ntalked a bit about how we measure things,\n\n16\n00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.680\nhow we test them, why that's important.\n\n17\n00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.660\nWhen we think about metrics,\n\n18\n00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.490\nwe also wanna talk about something\nspecific known as coverage metrics.\n\n19\n00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.000\nIt's really where we're gonna kinda jump\nback in and continue our conversations.\n\n20\n00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.530\nCoverage metrics\nare a measure of completeness\n\n21\n00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.250\nwith respect to test selection criteria.\n\n22\n00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.650\nWhat does that mean in English?\n\n23\n00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.760\nIn plain language,\nwhat that really means is,\n\n24\n00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.210\ndid we select the right things to test,\nand did we test them the right way?\n\n25\n00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.370\nSo, how do we know that, right?\n\n26\n00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.530\nHow do we know for sure?\n\n27\n00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.340\nAnd so the structural metrics,\n\n28\n00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.070\nthe common structural coverage\nmetrics we need to think about\n\n29\n00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.580\nare different ways of measuring how\ncomplete and how accurate our tests are.\n\n30\n00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.510\nSo, I wanna go through\nthe common ones with you, so\n\n31\n00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.540\nmake sure you're comfortable with them.\n\n32\n00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.160\nWe have a total of seven, we wanna talk\nabout with you in the next couple of\n\n33\n00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.430\nminutes, give you some quick definitions,\nmake sure you're good with what they are.\n\n34\n00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.480\nYou would want to potentially\nknow about these and\n\n35\n00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.540\nat least have a sentence or so\nsummary of what each one does\n\n36\n00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.060\nin order to become comfortable\nwith them if asked about them.\n\n37\n00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.850\nFirst one is statement coverage.\n\n38\n00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.590\nStatement coverage allows us to\nthink about making sure that\n\n39\n00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.680\nthe sufficient test cases are created for\n\n40\n00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.430\neach program statement that they\nhave to be executed at least once.\n\n41\n00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.960\nWhat we mean by that is if we have\n10 requirement we wanna test for,\n\n42\n00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.390\nwe have to have, I should never\nlook directly up at the lights and\n\n43\n00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.730\nlook down because now all I'm seeing in\nfront of me is actually the reproduction\n\n44\n00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.510\nof the light where everything\nelse should normally be.\n\n45\n00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.060\nSo anyway,\nmake sure I don't do that again.\n\n46\n00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.780\nSo when we're talking about\nthe statement coverage concept,\n\n47\n00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.660\nwe're talking about let's say\nhypothetically 10 requirements right?\n\n48\n00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.740\nWe wanna make sure we have a statement\nthat's gonna help us to figure out how to\n\n49\n00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.010\ntest each one of them so we're gonna\nhave some sort of a test solution or\n\n50\n00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.040\na requirement examination\nthat we're gonna engage in.\n\n51\n00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.960\nFor every one of them has to\nbe executed at least one time.\n\n52\n00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.430\nHowever, if we go through and\n\n53\n00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.550\nare successful at doing that,\nthat doesn't mean overall\n\n54\n00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.010\nthat we can accurately say we understand\nthe software product's behavior.\n\n55\n00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.290\nIt just means that we've effectively\nhit the highlights on our test.\n\n56\n00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.270\nSo statement coverage is a measure whether\nnot we executed all the requirements that\n\n57\n00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.370\nwe were supposed to, but it doesn't mean\nwe totally understand what the software\n\n58\n00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.770\ndoes or if the software's the target of\nthe test is what we're kind of assuming.\n\n59\n00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.960\nDecision or what's, try that again,\n\n60\n00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.040\ndecision, what is sometimes also called,\nI will talk slowly, a branch coverage.\n\n61\n00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.980\nSo decision or branch coverage.\n\n62\n00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.720\nThis is going to allow us\nto effectively make sure\n\n63\n00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.260\nthat we look at not just the actual things\nthat we wanna test the requirements, but\n\n64\n00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.190\nwe also wanna look at the branching\nin other words go in and\n\n65\n00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.120\nmake sure that when we are looking at the\nprogram decisions that are executed within\n\n66\n00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.890\nthe program, there's gonna be logical\nplaces where we kind of make a stop.\n\n67\n00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.790\nWe say, okay, I'm at a fork in the road.\n\n68\n00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.820\nIf I click this button and I go this way.\n\n69\n00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.820\nIf I do this, I'm going over here.\n\n70\n00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.390\nRight?\nWe call those branches,\n\n71\n00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.408\nbecause that's how the program, execution\nof the program application logic works.\n\n72\n00:03:23.408 --> 00:03:27.230\nWhen Mike hits the Save button,\nthere's a few things that will happen.\n\n73\n00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.840\nWe pop up a box that lets them save or\nname the file rather to save it.\n\n74\n00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.980\nHe chooses a location depending on\nwhether he chooses a location local\n\n75\n00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.726\nto this machine or\nremote out somewhere else.\n\n76\n00:03:37.726 --> 00:03:40.875\nWe may have to pop up another box that\nallows him to go out and log in or\n\n77\n00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:42.910\nauthenticate if it's a remote location.\n\n78\n00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.220\nSo there may be branching logic in there\nthat we also have to test and validate.\n\n79\n00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.180\nSo branch coverage is all about\nmaking sure we assess that and\n\n80\n00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.860\nunderstand that and\nfigure out what's going on there.\n\n81\n00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.970\nCondition coverage.\n\n82\n00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.790\nCondition coverage requires\nsufficient test cases for\n\n83\n00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.700\nevery condition in a program decision to\ntake all possible outcomes and test them.\n\n84\n00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.850\nWhat if Mike hits control and\nthe letter S to do save?\n\n85\n00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.190\nWhat if Mike clicks on the floppy\ndisk icon right, for save?\n\n86\n00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.810\nThat's usually at the upper left\nhand corner somewhere in the menu.\n\n87\n00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.185\nWhat if he clicks on whatever represents\nthe program menu where save would be and\n\n88\n00:04:16.185 --> 00:04:18.315\nchooses save is an option\nright out of the menu.\n\n89\n00:04:18.315 --> 00:04:21.280\nThere's at least three ways to\ndo everything in a Microsoft, or\n\n90\n00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.152\nWord, or Windows based program,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n91\n00:04:24.152 --> 00:04:25.930\nSo what if he does any,\nor all of those things?\n\n92\n00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.240\nAre they all gonna come out the way?\n\n93\n00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.000\nAre they all gonna lead\nto the same dialogue box?\n\n94\n00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.840\nDoes one of those three\ndo something different?\n\n95\n00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.198\nWhat if one of Mike hits Ctrl+S, but when\nhe goes to hit Ctrl+S He hits Ctrl+ S and\n\n96\n00:04:36.198 --> 00:04:37.630\nE at the same time?\n\n97\n00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.390\nWhat will happen then?\n\n98\n00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.940\nI don't know.\n\n99\n00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.220\nHopefully nothing.\n\n100\n00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.220\nBut if he does do that and\n\n101\n00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.580\nsomething different happens,\nare we testing for that?\n\n102\n00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.240\nBecause that's all what we're\ntalking about, condition coverage.\n\n103\n00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.765\nWhat are all the outcomes,\nthe conditions that can lead to this?\n\n104\n00:04:49.765 --> 00:04:54.580\nMulti-condition coverage requires us to\ndo sufficient testing exercise, any and\n\n105\n00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.200\nall possible combinations of\na program decision point.\n\n106\n00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.020\nSo again, condition tests will be any one\nof those that I just mentioned, Ctrl+S.\n\n107\n00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.180\nHit the save icon,\ngo to the file menu, do save.\n\n108\n00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.580\nMulti conditions,\nit's going to test all of those and\n\n109\n00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.440\nfind out what happens\nwhen we do all of them.\n\n110\n00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.010\nDo they all work the same way?\n\n111\n00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.240\nIs there something different?\n\n112\n00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.390\nWant to see the different approaches for\nthat.\n\n113\n00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.810\nWhat about loop coverage?\n\n114\n00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.510\nLoop coverage is yet another one.\n\n115\n00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.040\nThis criteria requires sufficient\ntest cases for all program loops\n\n116\n00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.330\nto be executed for 0, 1, 2, et cetera, for\nhowever many iterations that we specify\n\n117\n00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.380\ncovering the running, initialization and\ntermination of that program.\n\n118\n00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.830\nMeaning there are iterative solutions that\nwe have to test and engage in, right?\n\n119\n00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.400\nAnd we have to think about that\nto understand how they work\n\n120\n00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.370\nthroughout the life cycle of the program,\nturning on, running, turning off.\n\n121\n00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.930\nAnd so we're going to have to do\nloop coverage to test those, and\n\n122\n00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.250\nmake sure they're working\nthroughout that entire life cycle.\n\n123\n00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.520\nThat's what loop coverage does.\n\n124\n00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.290\nWhat about path coverage?\n\n125\n00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.470\nPath coverage, this criteria\nrequires sufficient test cases for\n\n126\n00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.100\neach feasible path.\n\n127\n00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.050\nSo in other words the path coverage is\nlooking at how we're able to do things,\n\n128\n00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.640\nand what path or what execution\nplan we're using to get there.\n\n129\n00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.490\nAm I gonna be able to you know again\nhypothetically use a keyboard shortcut?\n\n130\n00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.990\nAm I gonna be able to go in and\nclick on an icon?\n\n131\n00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.180\nAm I gonna be able to execute\na command from a command line?\n\n132\n00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.210\nYou know there's different ways I can do\nthings, different paths that will take me\n\n133\n00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.400\nthere and I have to look at all of those\nand path coverage helps me to do that.\n\n134\n00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.700\nAnd then finally data flow coverage.\n\n135\n00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.020\nData flow coverage.\n\n136\n00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.860\nData flow coverage requires\nsufficient test cases for\n\n137\n00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.170\neach feasible data flow to\nbe executed at least once.\n\n138\n00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.020\nHow does data move through the program?\n\n139\n00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.960\nHow is it executed?\n\n140\n00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.010\nHow is it assessed?\n\n141\n00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.090\nHow is it shown?\n\n142\n00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.340\nHow is it interacted with?\n\n143\n00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.020\nAre we putting it up on the screen?\n\n144\n00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.900\nIs it being recorded to the hard drive?\n\n145\n00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.830\nAre we holding it in\na memory buffer somewhere?\n\n146\n00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.820\nThese are all things we'd have to look at,\nand ultimately, we'd have to test for.\n\n147\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.770\nSo, these are all different levels\nof structural testing that we\n\n148\n00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:47.520\nhave to think about.\n\n149\n00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.225\nThere are seven.\n\n150\n00:06:48.225 --> 00:06:50.530\nWanna make sure we know what they are.\n\n151\n00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.060\nAnd just have again common\nstructural coverage.\n\n152\n00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.509\nWe want to be thinking about these and\n\n153\n00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:56.910\nmake sure we have like a one\nsentence understanding of each.\n\n154\n00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.230\nSo let me run through the names again for\nyou real quickly.\n\n155\n00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.430\nStatement coverage, decision, or\nwhat's sometimes called branch coverage,\n\n156\n00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.510\ncondition coverage,\nmulticondition coverage, so for\n\n157\n00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:12.360\nall the conditions, that's multicondition,\nloop coverage, path coverage and\n\n158\n00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.070\ndata flow coverage, all seven.\n\n159\n00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.670\nSo make sure we know what they are right?\n\n160\n00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.010\nWe may also want to talk about\ndefinition based testing.\n\n161\n00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.360\nDefinition based testing is sometimes\ncalled specification based testing,\n\n162\n00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.630\nfunctional testing or black box testing.\n\n163\n00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.500\nIt's referred to in different ways.\n\n164\n00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.050\nThis identifies test cases based on\nwhat the definition of the software\n\n165\n00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.860\nproduct should be doing,\nor is intended to do,\n\n166\n00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.800\nand then we test what\nthe intended outcome of that is.\n\n167\n00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.000\nIntended, keyword does what's\nintended always actually happen?\n\n168\n00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.080\nUnfortunately, not always.\n\n169\n00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.185\nSo as a result, what we may find out there\nwhen we're doing this, and we're engaging\n\n170\n00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:50.335\nin definition based testing is that\nthe definition is not the actual state.\n\n171\n00:07:50.335 --> 00:07:52.353\nAnd we're going to see that\nthere's a difference sometimes.\n\n172\n00:07:52.353 --> 00:07:54.325\nRight, so want to know about that.\n\n173\n00:07:54.325 --> 00:07:58.362\nJust want to be thinking about that and\njust be aware of that as well.\n\n174\n00:07:58.362 --> 00:08:01.779\nWhen we think about changes, and often\ntimes there's a lot changing going on in\n\n175\n00:08:01.779 --> 00:08:04.350\nsoftware and\nwe're testing to see the impact of this.\n\n176\n00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.210\nWe have to test changes,\nwe have to test for software changes.\n\n177\n00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.780\nRemember, changes occur\nfrequently during the dev cycle.\n\n178\n00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.190\nWe have to back and look at what\na change implies, because it may break\n\n179\n00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.450\nfunctionality that was working just\nfine until we made the change.\n\n180\n00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.520\nBut it also may make new opportunities and\nnew functionality available and\n\n181\n00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.470\nexpose them.\n\n182\n00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.530\nSo we have to be thinking about\nwhat the impact of change is.\n\n183\n00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.240\nSo we have to do what's known as\nregression analysis in order to\n\n184\n00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.208\nunderstand what the impact\nof change backwards may be.\n\n185\n00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:32.480\nThis is gonna make sure that a change\nhas not in any way compromised\n\n186\n00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.590\nexisting functionality\nthat has to be there.\n\n187\n00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.472\nWe call this regression analysis.\n\n188\n00:08:36.472 --> 00:08:39.110\nJust wanna make sure that we understand\nwhat the impact of change is.\n\n189\n00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:41.110\nAnd regression analysis\nhelps us to do this.\n\n190\n00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.430\nWe talked about levels of\ndevelopment testing already.\n\n191\n00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.920\nUnit, integration, system, I explained\nthe difference between all three.\n\n192\n00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.872\nJust want to make sure we're reminding\nyou of that and you know what those are.\n\n193\n00:08:49.872 --> 00:08:53.447\nJust to make sure you're thinking about\nunderstanding the different levels\n\n194\n00:08:53.447 --> 00:08:55.620\nof testing we may ultimately engage in.\n\n195\n00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.860\nWanna think about the fact\nthat when we are testing,\n\n196\n00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.630\nwe have to also think about\nmaintenance cycles, right?\n\n197\n00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.660\nBecause testing is all about what's\nthe current state of a system?\n\n198\n00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.540\nBut then we may, as we said, make changes,\n\n199\n00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.235\nwe may do that during\nthe development cycle.\n\n200\n00:09:08.235 --> 00:09:11.560\nBut we also may do it during the\nmaintenance cycle, where we apply software\n\n201\n00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.570\nor security patches or updates to\na system, or change configuratIons.\n\n202\n00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:18.510\nAnd as a result of that, we have to go in,\nand remember, we do maintenance on\n\n203\n00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.830\nhardware, we do swap-out hardware,\nwe do occasionally do updates to firmware.\n\n204\n00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.950\nWe do software maintenance,\n\n205\n00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.410\npatch management is kinda\nthe classic example of this.\n\n206\n00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.055\nWe may do corrective maintenance,\nchanging configurations and\n\n207\n00:09:29.055 --> 00:09:31.115\nreassigning or realigning the system.\n\n208\n00:09:31.115 --> 00:09:33.055\nAnd all of these things\nhave to be considered and\n\n209\n00:09:33.055 --> 00:09:34.865\nthought about with regards to change.\n\n210\n00:09:34.865 --> 00:09:36.635\nIt's obviously gonna\nall be very important.\n\n211\n00:09:36.635 --> 00:09:40.120\nIf we make a change due to maintenance\ncycle, in other words, and we don't not\n\n212\n00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:43.660\nwhat that change is, we may actually wind\nup with an issue if we're not testing it.\n\n213\n00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.270\nSo wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n214\n00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.540\nSo thinking about the impact, the change.\n\n215\n00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.660\nThinking about what is required to do\nthat, it's gonna be important for us.\n\n216\n00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.105\nWhat about negative testing or\nmisuse case testing?\n\n217\n00:09:54.105 --> 00:09:56.190\nIt's another way we do testing.\n\n218\n00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.880\nPositive testing, which I didn't\nmention but is also important for\n\n219\n00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.830\nus to think about.\n\n220\n00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.260\nPositive testing lets us determine that\nthe application works as expected.\n\n221\n00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.116\nSo we turn on the computer,\nwe either type in the Windows R key for\n\n222\n00:10:08.116 --> 00:10:09.590\na run line and type in winword.\n\n223\n00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:12.466\nOr we go to the desktop,\nclick on the Word icon, or\n\n224\n00:10:12.466 --> 00:10:16.448\ngo the launch from the program menu,\nchoose Microsoft Office Word.\n\n225\n00:10:16.448 --> 00:10:20.966\nAnd if word opens, positive testing says,\nyay, it's where we need the confetti and\n\n226\n00:10:20.966 --> 00:10:23.180\nthe balloon shower to come down, right?\n\n227\n00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.060\n>> [LAUGH] We'll get that next time.\n\n228\n00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.945\n>> Yeah, gotta make sure we have that for\nthe next time, right?\n\n229\n00:10:25.945 --> 00:10:27.870\nSo we have, yay, we've everything show up.\n\n230\n00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:28.728\nMaybe we can animate that and\n\n231\n00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:31.000\nput that in post production or\nsomething, I don't know.\n\n232\n00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.400\nSo anyway, point is when that happens,\npositive testing implies that Word should\n\n233\n00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.240\nopen and indeed if it does,\nthat's good, that's positive.\n\n234\n00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.672\nBut negative testing\nimplies that effectively,\n\n235\n00:10:40.672 --> 00:10:44.602\nwe have to handle invalid or\nunexpected input or output.\n\n236\n00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:47.460\nAnd somehow deal with that\nwithout causing an error.\n\n237\n00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.930\nSo positive testing is about yes the\nprogram did what it was supposed to do.\n\n238\n00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.750\nIt opened up, everything is good.\n\n239\n00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.745\nNegative testing is not\nthe program didn't open.\n\n240\n00:10:54.745 --> 00:10:56.223\nI had somebody say that\nto me in class once.\n\n241\n00:10:56.223 --> 00:11:00.515\nSo you mean negative testing is you\ntype in winword and you get Excel?\n\n242\n00:11:00.515 --> 00:11:02.405\nNo, that's not quite what I'm thinking.\n\n243\n00:11:02.405 --> 00:11:05.066\nAlthough that, in theory,\nmay actually be something we could say.\n\n244\n00:11:05.066 --> 00:11:09.043\nBut what we're really thinking is,\nwe go into Word, and we start typing, and\n\n245\n00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:10.630\nI type in a special character.\n\n246\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:15.360\nI hit Enter, and all of a sudden, the\nsystem crashes, that would be bad, right?\n\n247\n00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.050\nBecause that's negative testing,\nshowing us that invalid input is not\n\n248\n00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.120\nbeing supported, and is not being\ndealt with as an error properly.\n\n249\n00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.340\nSo negative testing is about\nunderstand when things go wrong.\n\n250\n00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.450\nNow it could be the yes,\nI typed in winword and I really got Excel.\n\n251\n00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:30.410\nBut that's really not\nwhat we would think of.\n\n252\n00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.680\nWe also want to think\nof misuse case testing.\n\n253\n00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.678\nBecause misuse and negative tests here\nare kind of two sides of the same coin.\n\n254\n00:11:37.678 --> 00:11:40.500\nMisuse case testing is really about\nwhat happens when you do something\n\n255\n00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.850\nthat's not supposed to be done,\nand how we handle that.\n\n256\n00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:48.310\nSo if somebody is using Word but\nthey now try to enter in Word,\n\n257\n00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.520\nsome sort of unsupported characters or\nthings like that, right?\n\n258\n00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.500\nAnd then Word doesn't know\nwhat to do with them,\n\n259\n00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.100\nthat would be considered a misuse case.\n\n260\n00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:57.170\nIt's also a negative test but\n\n261\n00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:01.400\nit's a misuse case, cuz we're looking at\nwhat happens when we misuse the product.\n\n262\n00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.040\nSo again, sometimes one class, I'm taking,\nand we're doing this whole thing, and\n\n263\n00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.490\nI'm going through all these test types.\n\n264\n00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:07.849\nAnd I talked about a misused case and\n\n265\n00:12:07.849 --> 00:12:10.040\nwe just talked about the code\nof ethics and quality.\n\n266\n00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.550\nYou know, making sure that you're\npaying attention to things,\n\n267\n00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.730\nact honorably, always safeguard life.\n\n268\n00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.410\nSo somebody stands up in the back and\nsays, misuse case testing, right?\n\n269\n00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.980\nSo that's when you try\nto take the software and\n\n270\n00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.470\nyou take the computer it's on,\nand you try to go ahead and\n\n271\n00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.180\nbeat somebody with it cuz\nyou don't like them, right?\n\n272\n00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.880\nThat's misuse case testing.\n\n273\n00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.180\nNo, I said that's not, that's actually\na felony and you can go to jail, right?\n\n274\n00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.350\nSo, we don't want to do that,\nright, obviously not important,\n\n275\n00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.040\nnot something we should think about doing.\n\n276\n00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:38.690\nWe don't talk about physical misuse case\ntesting, we don't want to stress test\n\n277\n00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.030\nthe computer or the people sitting\naround us at any point in time.\n\n278\n00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:43.720\nWe do just wanna understand\nthat we have to test for\n\n279\n00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.750\nthe negative implications,\nthe errors that can occur.\n\n280\n00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.470\nWhen you sit down and\n\n281\n00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:51.130\nyou create software, one of the things\nwe often do is during the dev cycle,\n\n282\n00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:55.050\nwe will bring in normal average users and\nsit them down at the keyboard.\n\n283\n00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:58.553\nAnd we then will say to them, okay,\ngo and engage in this script,\n\n284\n00:12:58.553 --> 00:13:01.766\nthis test script of behaviors\nwe want you to use the system.\n\n285\n00:13:01.766 --> 00:13:05.252\nCuz we've already written out a bunch of\nscripts that we think are gonna represent\n\n286\n00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:06.650\nwhat users are gonna do.\n\n287\n00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:08.770\nThat's gonna give us a lot of information.\n\n288\n00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:12.050\nBut what it doesn't tell us, typically,\nis what the misuse cases for\n\n289\n00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.300\nthat software are.\n\n290\n00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:16.870\nSo then what we do is we bring in experts\nthat really understand the software,\n\n291\n00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.150\nthat do this kind of function,\nwhatever they're doing every, day.\n\n292\n00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.940\nWe sit them down,\nwe don't give them any scripts.\n\n293\n00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.120\nWe just simply say, hey, have it.\n\n294\n00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.970\nSee what you can break, right?\n\n295\n00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.290\nAnd tell us what you\ndid when you broke it.\n\n296\n00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:30.590\nSo they're in there doing\nthe stuff they normally do and\n\n297\n00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:33.510\nthey're popping up keys and\nall sorts of stuff's going on.\n\n298\n00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:35.120\nAnd when things start happening,\n\n299\n00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.520\nthat's how we figure out\nwhat the misuse cases are.\n\n300\n00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.440\nBecause what often happens is, we don't\nreally know how to write a misuse case,\n\n301\n00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.850\ncuz we're just not sure what's\ngonna cause that behavior.\n\n302\n00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.370\nBut people that are using the system every\nday are gonna be aware of those things.\n\n303\n00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.970\nAnd we're gonna get them to come in and\n\n304\n00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.120\ntell us what the common\nmisuse cases will be.\n\n305\n00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.010\nWe'll write those up and\ndocument those and\n\n306\n00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.330\nthen we'll use those to figure\nout what else may go wrong.\n\n307\n00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.370\nThis is often how we do\nthis kind of testing.\n\n308\n00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.510\nWe'll give you a little insight into\nwhat that may look like, right?\n\n309\n00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:03.330\nAll right, so\nwe could often talk about misuse case,\n\n310\n00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.530\nnegative case testing, positive case\ntesting and things of that nature.\n\n311\n00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:08.030\nWe talked about interface testing.\n\n312\n00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.650\nWe talked about using and\nhaving users come in and\n\n313\n00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.190\nuse the interface,\nto see whether they like it or not.\n\n314\n00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:16.290\nYour usability testing,\nUI testing, is very important,\n\n315\n00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.690\nuser interface testing, is the menu\nstructure designed the right way?\n\n316\n00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:20.830\nIs it intuitive?\n\n317\n00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:21.790\nCan I navigate?\n\n318\n00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.200\nWhat's up with this whole ribbon thing?\n\n319\n00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:24.860\nWhat is that, right?\n\n320\n00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.240\nWhere are my menus?\n\n321\n00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.140\nThat kind of stuff is what we would\nthink of with interface testing.\n\n322\n00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.660\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n323\n00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.060\nDoes the interface work the right way?\n\n324\n00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:34.120\nIf we're supposed to connect to the Web,\ndoes it?\n\n325\n00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.110\nIf it does, does it connect and\nshow me the information I need?\n\n326\n00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.910\nThese are all things\nwe'd wanna think about.\n\n327\n00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:42.180\nHow many of you have been very excited\nabout some of the new developments\n\n328\n00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:42.850\nin software, right?\n\n329\n00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.830\nWhere, for instance, you take a look at,\nand I mentioned, the ribbon.\n\n330\n00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.920\nSay everything is moving\ntowards the ribbon today.\n\n331\n00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.154\nThe ribbon is okay, but\n\n332\n00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:52.754\nwe've all probably figured out\neventually how to navigate with it.\n\n333\n00:14:52.754 --> 00:14:56.850\nBut we've all probably also not known\nwhere something was at some point, right?\n\n334\n00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:58.940\nOr still may not know\nwhere certain things are.\n\n335\n00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.870\nI'm still stymied by certain things on\nthe ribbon in Microsoft Office, right,\n\n336\n00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.140\nand I use it all the time.\n\n337\n00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:04.950\nI actually was just looking now,\na little while ago,\n\n338\n00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.730\nbefore we got started with this episode,\nto try to figure out where on the ribbon\n\n339\n00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.620\nin the various menus, I could see\na feature that would allow me to zoom in\n\n340\n00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.140\nwithout having to use the zoom\ncontrols at the lower right-hand side.\n\n341\n00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.260\nSo I could program in a specific number,\nbecause I want to be able to zoom into\n\n342\n00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.760\na certain specification to see certain\ndetail on something to talk about it.\n\n343\n00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.860\nAnd I could zoom in with the slider bar,\nbut I don't know where exactly.\n\n344\n00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.260\nI know it's in the view menu\nsomewhere on the view tab.\n\n345\n00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.220\nBut I don't know exactly\nwhere cuz it's not apparent.\n\n346\n00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:31.090\nIt's just not right there.\n\n347\n00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:32.830\nI have to go digging and searching for it.\n\n348\n00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:34.360\nYou're aware of this in the old days,\n\n349\n00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.560\nwhen you had a menu it was\na little bit more intuitive.\n\n350\n00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.420\nYou went there and\nyou would see everything pop right out,\n\n351\n00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.390\nalthough it may have been this big.\n\n352\n00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:41.710\nBut it would all be listed, you'd say,\noh zoom, and it would pop out and\n\n353\n00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:42.725\nyou'd know what it was.\n\n354\n00:15:42.725 --> 00:15:46.560\nSo sometimes UI testing shows\nus that things are better,\n\n355\n00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.990\nsometimes it shows us that it may not be\nas intuitive and easy to use that way.\n\n356\n00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:52.605\nAnd we have to think about that as well.\n\n357\n00:15:52.605 --> 00:15:55.189\nAnd you'll understand that and\nlook at all these areas and\n\n358\n00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:56.937\nplaces where we have to focus, right?\n\n359\n00:15:56.937 --> 00:16:00.933\nSo internal interface testing,\nexternal interface testing,\n\n360\n00:16:00.933 --> 00:16:03.088\nusability testing, UI testing.\n\n361\n00:16:03.088 --> 00:16:06.655\nThese are things we have to look at and\nobviously as test manufacturers,\n\n362\n00:16:06.655 --> 00:16:09.285\npeople that are doing the testing,\nthe test stores,\n\n363\n00:16:09.285 --> 00:16:13.040\nas people that are gonna participate\nin the testing, the testees, right.\n\n364\n00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.060\nThese are all roles that\nwe have to think about.\n\n365\n00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:17.870\nBecause when we're doing testing,\nif we're not really thinking about\n\n366\n00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:22.470\nthe average use pattern and the average\ncustomer, the average user of that system,\n\n367\n00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.260\nwe may test for things that don't make\na lot of sense in the real world.\n\n368\n00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:28.180\nWe may want testing for things that\nactually don't really matter and so\n\n369\n00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.850\nthis is also very important.\n\n370\n00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.130\nSo we have to also think about\nthe role of the moderator.\n\n371\n00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.490\nThe moderator is going to effectively be\nthe person that is going to kind of keep\n\n372\n00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:39.160\nan eye on what goes on, controls\nthe testing, sees what's happening,\n\n373\n00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.340\nmakes sure everybody's on task, does the\nthings that got to happen and documents or\n\n374\n00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.490\nrecords the reactions of the users.\n\n375\n00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:49.030\nIn the case of use case testing of\nthe users towards the applications.\n\n376\n00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:52.830\nSo you'll have a moderator when you do\nUI testing with users or used case or\n\n377\n00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.140\nmisused case testing.\n\n378\n00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.660\nThey are effectively the person\nthat's gonna record the activities,\n\n379\n00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.890\nkind of get the commentary from\nthe customer, understand what's happening.\n\n380\n00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:02.250\nWe call them the moderator.\n\n381\n00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:03.520\nThat's what we refer to them as.\n\n382\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.130\nSo we just want to be thinking of that.\n\n383\n00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.530\nWhen we think about testing,\n\n384\n00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.030\none of the things that we have to\ndo after the testing, ultimately.\n\n385\n00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:16.150\nBecause we have to think about\nnow that the test has happened.\n\n386\n00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.400\nAnd the data has been produced we've\nanalyzed it we've kind of figured\n\n387\n00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.090\nout what we have to do.\n\n388\n00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:21.350\nWe've made some changes.\n\n389\n00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.360\nWe have to go in and now we have to\nmonitor to figure out what the impact of\n\n390\n00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:27.600\nthose changes are gonna be and ultimately\nas a result of that we have to figure\n\n391\n00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.870\nout through continuous monitoring if\nwe've made the right decisions and\n\n392\n00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:33.640\nmade the right changes or not and\nover time what those mean.\n\n393\n00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.770\nSo, continuous monitoring or\n\n394\n00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.010\ninformation security continuous\nmonitoring as it is sometimes called,\n\n395\n00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:43.820\nISCM, generically is really just the idea\nof ongoing monitoring of systems.\n\n396\n00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.920\nAnd continuous monitoring today is\na pretty common thing, you know,\n\n397\n00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.070\nwe talk a lot about it.\n\n398\n00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.140\nIt's pretty important.\n\n399\n00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:52.100\nWe think about the fact that if we\nwant to monitor mainline systems we\n\n400\n00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:54.100\nwant to know what's going\non with them all the time,\n\n401\n00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.670\nwe have to use continuous\nmonitoring solutions to do that.\n\n402\n00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.910\nWe have to have metrics as we've\ntalked about to be able to understand\n\n403\n00:17:58.910 --> 00:17:59.720\nwhat we're seeing.\n\n404\n00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.110\nYou know metrics may be things like\nthe number of employees that are currently\n\n405\n00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.540\nundergoing security awareness training.\n\n406\n00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.900\nAnd have they all finished?\n\n407\n00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.180\nThat would be one metric's\nthat may be important to us.\n\n408\n00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:11.470\nBecause when they wanna know how many of\nour users have been trained on the new\n\n409\n00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:14.100\nawareness techniques and\nthe new awareness concerns we have.\n\n410\n00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.400\nWe may want to know the number of\nunauthorized access attempts in a system,\n\n411\n00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.770\nhow many IP addresses are currently in\nuse through DHCP in our dynamic scope.\n\n412\n00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:23.170\nSo all these things we\nmay want to look at.\n\n413\n00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:24.600\nSome of them make a lot of sense.\n\n414\n00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.680\nSome make absolutely no\nsense at all to anybody but\n\n415\n00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.770\nthe people that are obviously going\nto want to know that information.\n\n416\n00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:32.750\nHow many open help desk tickets do\nwe have at any given moment in time?\n\n417\n00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:36.120\nHow often are they being,\nthose tickets that are open.\n\n418\n00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.080\nHow often are they being reviewed for\nclosure?\n\n419\n00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.880\nThese are all metrics\nthat may be important.\n\n420\n00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.720\nBut those metrics I just mentioned may\nonly be important to the help desk.\n\n421\n00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.420\nMay not be important to you,\nunless you're a part of the help desk.\n\n422\n00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.660\nYou just may not care.\n\n423\n00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:47.770\nSo I want to think about metrics,\n\n424\n00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:50.870\nI want to think about what they are, I\nwant to think about how we establish them.\n\n425\n00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.570\nContinuous monitoring allows\nus to understand what metrics\n\n426\n00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.980\nwe should be paying attention to, because\nthe list of things we're monitoring\n\n427\n00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.680\nis then going to help us focus in on\nthe kinds of things we want to know.\n\n428\n00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.630\nAnd there's a very large about of metrics\nthat potentially are available out there\n\n429\n00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.920\nfor us to consider, we want to be thinking\nabout the ones that are important,\n\n430\n00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.980\nand thinking about the ones\nthat are not so important.\n\n431\n00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.730\nAs I said context,\ncontextual, contextualness.\n\n432\n00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.200\nI don't know if that's a word.\n\n433\n00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.530\nContext and relevancy.\n\n434\n00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:17.840\n>> it is.\n>> Right. It is a word? >> Now it is.\n\n435\n00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:18.360\n>> Now it is.\n\n436\n00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.460\nOkay.\nBecause I made it a word.\n\n437\n00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.070\nSo now it is.\nRight.\n\n438\n00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.650\nSo context and relevancy,\n\n439\n00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.230\nlet's go with words we know actually\nexist in the English language.\n\n440\n00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.240\nContext and relevancy are gonna\nbe very critical for metrics.\n\n441\n00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.510\nSo, we do wanna understand,\nas security professionals,\n\n442\n00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:33.080\nas CISSPs, that we may be called on,\n\n443\n00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.090\npeople may ask us, to help understand\nwhat metrics we should be monitoring.\n\n444\n00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.450\nSomebody may say, hey,\nMike what do you think about this?\n\n445\n00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.645\nI need to understand more about this,\nwould these metrics be helpful?\n\n446\n00:19:42.645 --> 00:19:48.040\nAnd Mike as a CISSP, would have to have\na sense that he may or may not by the way\n\n447\n00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.840\nbut he's gonna be called on\nultimately to help give guidance.\n\n448\n00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:54.350\nAnd so with CISSPs are constantly\nreminding you of this right?\n\n449\n00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.180\nWe may or may not be experts in all areas.\n\n450\n00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.410\nWe have to understand is that there\nare certain things we don't know.\n\n451\n00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.820\nWhat's important, is for us to be honest\nwith the business honest with our\n\n452\n00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.880\ncustomers, our internal customers about\nthe things we can't help them with.\n\n453\n00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.690\nAnd to tell them honestly, you know what,\nI'm not an expert in this area.\n\n454\n00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.090\nI can give you some common\neducated guesses, but\n\n455\n00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.980\nI'm not really good enough to tell you for\nsure.\n\n456\n00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.310\nWhat I am good at is going out and\n\n457\n00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.500\nfinding out what other people\nthat know about this are doing.\n\n458\n00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:21.260\nGive me a week.\n\n459\n00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.330\nLet me go talk to some people.\n\n460\n00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.580\nLet me do a little research.\n\n461\n00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:27.060\nLet me come back to you, and\nlet's talk about some things that I found.\n\n462\n00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:28.500\nThat's a great conversation for\n\n463\n00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.570\na CISSP to have with the business and\nwith the business requirements\n\n464\n00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:35.920\nto help create the context necessary\nto understand them and measure them.\n\n465\n00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.600\nWhat's a bad conversation would be, oh\nyeah, no let's just do these five things.\n\n466\n00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.010\nAbsolutely do it all the time it's always\ngreat let's do that it's gonna work.\n\n467\n00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.960\nAnd what's probably not gonna work is the\nfact that you just don't really know what\n\n468\n00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.590\nyou're talking about.\n\n469\n00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:50.780\nAnd as a result what you are saying yes\nto is probably totally irrelevant and\n\n470\n00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.160\nis probably not gonna add any value.\n\n471\n00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.730\nThat's the best case, by the way.\n\n472\n00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.900\nWorst case is if you said yes to something\nthat's actually gonna cause a problem.\n\n473\n00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.490\nThat can actually lead to some\nvery significant concerns.\n\n474\n00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:01.380\nSo I wanna make sure we're\naware of that as well.\n\n475\n00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.180\nSo we have to be thinking about these\nkinds of things, having to think about\n\n476\n00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.950\nthe impact of compliance and compliance\nconcerns with regards to testing.\n\n477\n00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.590\nAre we being mandated to test,\nand if so how often and\n\n478\n00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.440\nunder what conditions and\nfor what reasons?\n\n479\n00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.580\nAnd the discussion point is that\nabsolutely, we probably are.\n\n480\n00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.870\nWe may have audit concerns.\n\n481\n00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:20.760\nRight?\nWe're going to talk about how we look at\n\n482\n00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.390\nthe outcome of audits here and\n\n483\n00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:25.170\nwhat the audit outcome may be\nfrom a reporting perspective.\n\n484\n00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:27.220\nIn just a couple minutes we're going\nto take a look at a little word table.\n\n485\n00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.950\nIt's going to help us to understand how\nto do that when we're conducting or\n\n486\n00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.790\nfacilitating third party audits,\n\n487\n00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.706\nwe're bringing people in from\nthe outside in other words.\n\n488\n00:21:33.706 --> 00:21:35.680\nRight?\nTrying to make sure we understand\n\n489\n00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.200\nwhat their area of expertise is and\n\n490\n00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.890\nhow they can help us look at\nour internal information.\n\n491\n00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.650\nWe have to be aware of\nthese kinds of things,\n\n492\n00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.380\nbecause there are standards we\nhave to uphold and abide by.\n\n493\n00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.260\nWe have the statement on auditing\nstandards, what's known as SAS 70,\n\n494\n00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.710\nwhich is actually an older standard\nthat is not really used anymore.\n\n495\n00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:55.230\nIt's been replaced with something known\nas SSAE 16, which is going to allow\n\n496\n00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:59.050\nus to effectively have a new updated\nversion of what this standard here.\n\n497\n00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.020\nWe're gonna throw up,\nif I'm not mistaken a word table here.\n\n498\n00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.700\nIt's gonna show us what the current\nthought process is around.\n\n499\n00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:08.970\nWhat was considered to be SAS70 or\nSSAE 16.\n\n500\n00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:14.420\nStatement on Standards for Attestation\nEngagements is what SSAE 16 represents.\n\n501\n00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.870\nAnd we're gonna be able to see.\n\n502\n00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:16.680\nAre we able to see?\n\n503\n00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.370\nYeah, we're not cutting\nanything off there.\n\n504\n00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.410\nWe're right at the edge,\nthat's good, no problem.\n\n505\n00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.440\nNo I think we're okay, just I wasn't\nsure if we were cutting off the edge of\n\n506\n00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.920\nthe diagram, I just wanted to make\nsure we weren't missing anything.\n\n507\n00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.320\nWe're going to be able to create what\nare known as, that's good, that's good,\n\n508\n00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.540\nnow I can see the edge so that's fine.\n\n509\n00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.880\nWe're gong to be able to create what\nare known as SOC 1, SOC 2, and or\n\n510\n00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.680\nSOC 3 reports.\n\n511\n00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.820\nYou'll see them up on the top\nof the screen right there.\n\n512\n00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:40.450\nAnd these are gonna to be report types\nthat are effectively generated from\n\n513\n00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.750\nthe output of an audit.\n\n514\n00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:46.760\nAnd they are going to be used either by\na vendor, an ISP let's say hypothetically,\n\n515\n00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.620\ncloud service provider, Internet service\nprovider, some sort of a vendor.\n\n516\n00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.280\nThey're going to be used\neither internally or\n\n517\n00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.370\ngiven to customers to\nrepresent to a test to.\n\n518\n00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:58.420\nThe current state of their protections and\n\n519\n00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.850\ntheir capabilities to be able to create\nand monitor a system that is trustworthy.\n\n520\n00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:07.190\nSo a SOC 1 report on the left hand\nside in, let's say column two there.\n\n521\n00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.090\nGoing right down the middle.\n\n522\n00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.950\nSo a SOC 1 report, did I say SOC 2?\n\n523\n00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.940\nSOC 1, let's start with SOC 1.\n\n524\n00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.830\nOff to the left.\n\n525\n00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.640\nIt's been a long day.\n\n526\n00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.820\nSo SOC 1, off to the left there,\ncolumn number two.\n\n527\n00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:25.220\nThe SOC 1 report says also sometimes\nreferred to as either an SSAE\n\n528\n00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:31.000\n16 as I said, either an AT 801 or\nan ISAE 3402 report.\n\n529\n00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.930\nThese are all basically just quoting\nstandards that all use the same definition\n\n530\n00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:40.130\nof what a SOC report is, in order to\nbe able to generate this SOC 1 report.\n\n531\n00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.960\nSo when you see those,\nwe're really just talking about\n\n532\n00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.240\ndifferent standards that reference\nthe same report at the end of the day.\n\n533\n00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.550\nSo we can scroll down just a little\nbit see the summary there.\n\n534\n00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:52.720\nSo what a SOC 1 report effectively does,\nis it's a detailed report for users and\n\n535\n00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:53.620\ntheir auditors.\n\n536\n00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.930\nIt is an internal report.\n\n537\n00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.613\nWe don't don't give SOC 1\nreports out to customers.\n\n538\n00:23:57.613 --> 00:24:01.836\nThese are kept internally and they are\nusually used to be able to understand what\n\n539\n00:24:01.836 --> 00:24:05.000\nthe current statement of system\nis inside of the business.\n\n540\n00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.758\nWe have applicability down below,\nif we scroll down.\n\n541\n00:24:07.758 --> 00:24:11.074\nYou'll see it's focused on financial\nreporting, risk, and controls,\n\n542\n00:24:11.074 --> 00:24:14.280\nthat are going to be specified\nby the service provider.\n\n543\n00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.830\nYou could find the most applicable there.\n\n544\n00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.270\nMost applicable,\none of the services you can see there.\n\n545\n00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.940\nI'm just gonna read off my screen,\njust cuz it's like this long column and\n\n546\n00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.440\nMike's going to have to scroll forever.\n\n547\n00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.350\nI'm just gonna basically\ntell you what's there.\n\n548\n00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.800\nMost applicable when the service\nprovider performs financial transaction\n\n549\n00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.920\nprocessing or\nsupports transaction processing systems.\n\n550\n00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.780\nIn other words, this is when we\nare dealing with financial services and we\n\n551\n00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:40.500\nhave to give a of some sort that the way\nthat we are processing financial data and\n\n552\n00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:45.260\nfinancial transactions is indeed secure\nand meets the outstanding requirements\n\n553\n00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.830\nlegislative or statutory requirements for\nwhatever that level of protection is.\n\n554\n00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:54.130\nBut this is an internal version of that\nreport that gives us attestation and\n\n555\n00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:58.570\ngives us the level of trust that we can\ncertify that the company operates against.\n\n556\n00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:59.960\nThis is a SOC 1.\n\n557\n00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.120\nSOC 2 is basically the same idea.\n\n558\n00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:06.560\nIf you take a look at the summary,\nit is a detailed report for\n\n559\n00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.880\nusers, their auditors, but\nwe add specified parties.\n\n560\n00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.580\nIn other words, a SOC 2 is essentially\na SOC 1 report that's given to\n\n561\n00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.270\nexternal parties or external customers.\n\n562\n00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.620\nSo it's gonna be basically\nthe same idea but\n\n563\n00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.470\nsomething we release outside\nthe business in other words.\n\n564\n00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.730\nSo it's the same idea.\n\n565\n00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.830\nIt's a detailed report,\nfocuses on those things.\n\n566\n00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:26.580\nYou'll notice what it focuses on.\n\n567\n00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:30.210\nSecurity, availability, confidentiality,\nwell we've heard about those before.\n\n568\n00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:34.520\nProcessing and integrity, yep, and most\nimportantly, equally importantly, privacy.\n\n569\n00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.100\nSo five things that the SOC 2 focuses on,\n\n570\n00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:40.150\nbecause these are the things\nthat customers need to know and\n\n571\n00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.740\nthese are the things that\ncustomers are gonna wanna know.\n\n572\n00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:47.470\nA SOC 3, which is often sometimes\nreferred to as a SysTrust, a WebTrust or\n\n573\n00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:48.740\nTrust Services report.\n\n574\n00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:53.630\nIt's very short report that is distributed\nto customers, if they want it.\n\n575\n00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:56.870\nBut really, more often than not what we\nsee is that the website that is gonna have\n\n576\n00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:00.730\na SOC 3 compliance rating has a little\ngold seal, a little website seal on it.\n\n577\n00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:02.230\nYou've probably seen\nthem when you go there.\n\n578\n00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.360\nNot the padlock.\n\n579\n00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:06.340\nNot the thing that shows that\nyou're using a secure protocol.\n\n580\n00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.030\nThey actually have a little trust seal.\n\n581\n00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.210\nIf you look around on the site,\nyou'll see one and\n\n582\n00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:13.380\nthis is evidence of a SOC\n3 report being on file.\n\n583\n00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.360\nThe fact that they have\nthis level of trust and\n\n584\n00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.630\nthis reporting to attest to\nit set up in their systems.\n\n585\n00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:23.150\nSo this is really a set of reports that\nhelp us to understand the level of trust.\n\n586\n00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:27.850\nThat a vendor or a partner is able to\noperate at and we can then attest to.\n\n587\n00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.780\nWe can effectively say\nbeyond any reasonable doubt.\n\n588\n00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.800\nWe've tested and\nwe've certified through auditing.\n\n589\n00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.020\nExternal, third party, and partial audit.\n\n590\n00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.480\nThat we meet these levels.\n\n591\n00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.993\nSo SOC 2 and SOC 3 system reports\nare gonna be very important for\n\n592\n00:26:40.993 --> 00:26:42.847\nus when we consume externally.\n\n593\n00:26:42.847 --> 00:26:47.800\nSOC 1 level reports are imported for\ninternal consumption of the same data.\n\n594\n00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.290\nI just wanna make sure we're thinking\nabout this, and we know what\n\n595\n00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:53.010\nthe SOC level reports are this stuff's\ngonna be very important as well.\n\n596\n00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.250\nWhen we think about audits generically,\n\n597\n00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.860\nwe think about the idea that we're\nbringing in some sort of third party,\n\n598\n00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.450\nand we're gonna ask them, more often than\nnot, it's a third party from outside\n\n599\n00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:06.700\nthe organization we may do internal audits\njust to prepare for the external one.\n\n600\n00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:10.560\nBut the reality is internal audits are not\ngoing to give us the same level of\n\n601\n00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.810\nattestation and binding findings that\nexternal third party impartial audits do.\n\n602\n00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.740\nSo we may have an internal audit\ndepartment that does auditing randomly\n\n603\n00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:21.750\nthroughout the year to find out\nwhat's going on and check on things.\n\n604\n00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.770\nBut it's really designed for\ncompliance internally and\n\n605\n00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:28.880\ndesigned for the ability to prepare for\nthe external audit that comes from\n\n606\n00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.170\noutside because that's typically\nlegislative or statutory driven.\n\n607\n00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:37.220\nAnd so external audits are going to happen\nprobably once a year, more often than not\n\n608\n00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.808\nby law, they more often than not\nhave to happen at least once a year.\n\n609\n00:27:39.808 --> 00:27:41.670\nSo under Sarbanes-Oxley,\n\n610\n00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:46.200\nunder HIPAA, under a lot of these in\nthe United States anyway these laws.\n\n611\n00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.530\nWe may have audits at least once\na year for a variety of reasons.\n\n612\n00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.235\nYou'll bring in an external company.\n\n613\n00:27:51.235 --> 00:27:54.920\nSo the Deloitte Touche's,\nthe Pricewaterhouse Coopers of the world.\n\n614\n00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:58.480\nThe big eight's that we'll talk about,\nreferred to the in the consulting and\n\n615\n00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.240\naccounting world.\n\n616\n00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.460\nThey typically will come in and\ndo the audits.\n\n617\n00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.870\nAnd they'll send in several\nindividuals that are certified to do\n\n618\n00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.560\neither financial audits or\nsecurity audits, risk audits.\n\n619\n00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.350\nThere's all these different kinds of\naudits you can engage in today, and\n\n620\n00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:13.710\nthey'll come in, and the idea is that\nbasically, we treat it as a project.\n\n621\n00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.050\nWe go through a phased approach, you're\ngonna be given a list of things that\n\n622\n00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:20.160\nhave to be done prior to them showing up,\nyou're gonna define the audit scope of\n\n623\n00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:24.300\nthe overall project timeline, you're gonna\nidentify existing or required controls\n\n624\n00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:27.110\nthat have to be documented,\nyou're gonna perform a readiness review.\n\n625\n00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.070\nThis is where the internal\naudit may come in.\n\n626\n00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.470\nYou're gonna communicate prioritized\nrecommendations that should be\n\n627\n00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.050\ndealt with prior to the actual\naudit taking place.\n\n628\n00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:36.950\nYou're gonna make sure you\ngo through all that stuff,\n\n629\n00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:40.830\nfigure out how to deal with it,\nverify all the gaps have been addressed.\n\n630\n00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:43.050\nYou're then gonna get ready and\nreport out and say okay,\n\n631\n00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:44.440\nI think we're good for the audit.\n\n632\n00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:47.540\nThe real audit happens, they come in and\nthey're gonna, the auditors are gonna go\n\n633\n00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:51.430\nthrough probably very similar stuff to\nwhat the prior audit or the pre-audit did.\n\n634\n00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.040\nAnd you're then gonna go through and\nhopefully, if you did your homework and\n\n635\n00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.670\ndid it well, you're gonna be\ngiven a clean bill of health.\n\n636\n00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.380\nWhat we don't wanna have with\naudits are what we call findings.\n\n637\n00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.990\nFindings are red x's that\ntell us something's wrong.\n\n638\n00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:06.030\nWe want to have a lot of green checks\non our report or smiley happy faces.\n\n639\n00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:11.100\nI give out gold stars, by the way when I\ndo my audits, or I give out big red x's.\n\n640\n00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.410\nJust like that right?\n\n641\n00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.250\nSo we don't wanna have a lot of findings\nbecause obviously findings indicate\n\n642\n00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:18.370\nsomething's wrong and if we have\nmultiple findings you most likely will\n\n643\n00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:21.510\nfail the audit and if you fail the audit\nyou'll become complicated because now we\n\n644\n00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:24.510\nhave issues and concerns, you're gonna\nhave to go through and remediate them,\n\n645\n00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.370\nusually given a period of time to do that,\nwe then have to come back and\n\n646\n00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:29.520\ndo another follow-up audit to\nensure that you fixed it and\n\n647\n00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.450\nif you don't then you've got\nsome significant issues.\n\n648\n00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:34.560\nYou may have some penalties and fines and\nall sorts of stuff can go on, and\n\n649\n00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.350\nobviously you can have problems with it.\n\n650\n00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:37.590\nSo it is very important for\n\n651\n00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:41.590\nus from a compliance perspective\nto pay attention to these things.\n\n652\n00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:42.200\n>> Very good, Adam.\n\n653\n00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.830\nA lot of information there, again,\nthat's three parts where we talk about\n\n654\n00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:49.140\ndesigning and validating assessment and\ntest strategies.\n\n655\n00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.130\nThere's just a lot too it.\n\n656\n00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:52.810\nThank you so much for\nall those great explanations.\n\n657\n00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:55.230\nRemember if you guys wanna sit\nin one of Adam's classes live,\n\n658\n00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:58.570\nall you gotta do is shoot us\nan email at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n659\n00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.490\nThat being said,\nwe're going to sign off for now.\n\n660\n00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:02.630\nI'm Mike Roderick.\n\n661\n00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:03.740\n>> And I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n662\n00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:08.410\n>> And we'll see you next time!\n\n",

00:00:21.660\nI'm your host Mike Roderick and\ntoday we are doing our CISSP content.\n\n4\n00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.190\nIn this episode specifically, we're gonna\nbe looking at our security operations\n\n5\n00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.230\nin the event that we have an incident.\n\n6\n00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.350\nWe're gonna need to know what to do,\nhow to handle it,\n\n7\n00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.880\nhow to respond to that,\nall of that good stuff and\n\n8\n00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.130\nthis is stuff that obviously has to\nbe planned out well of ahead of time.\n\n9\n00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.240\nSo here to help us figure out what we\ngotta do, where we gotta do it, and\n\n10\n00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.370\nhow to plan it all out is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.170\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.790\n>> Good, good, good.\n\n13\n00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.250\nYou mean I can instantly like somebody\ndoing this while you're talking and\n\n14\n00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.490\nintroducing yourself.\n\n15\n00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.340\nThat is potentially a problem.\n\n16\n00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.860\nYou should not allow that to take place.\n\n17\n00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.280\nShame on you, for allowing that\nto happen while you were talking.\n\n18\n00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.785\n>> We need a procedure.\n\n19\n00:00:56.785 --> 00:00:59.470\n>> [LAUGH] We need a procedure or\na policy to stop that from happening.\n\n20\n00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.630\nAnd we need controls in order\nto prevent that from occurring.\n\n21\n00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.780\nSo when we think about incident\nmanagement we think about\n\n22\n00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.780\nsecurity operations in general, and\ncertainly all the things that go into it,\n\n23\n00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.240\none of the things we have\nto really step back and\n\n24\n00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.920\nrealize that's the CISSP is [COUGH] that\nthere is gonna be a variety of things\n\n25\n00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.940\nthat go on in the organization that we may\nactually not have direct knowledge of.\n\n26\n00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.100\nIt's gonna be constantly things happening,\nusers are being created.\n\n27\n00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.750\nUsers are accessing data.\n\n28\n00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.300\nSystems are up and running.\n\n29\n00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.760\nNow all of a sudden they're not.\n\n30\n00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.180\nWe're logging, we're looking at firewalls.\n\n31\n00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.500\nThere's many people doing\na variety of things.\n\n32\n00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.640\nWe have to really get good at\nunderstanding hot to let go, right?\n\n33\n00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.120\nThis is one of the things we\ngotta understand as a CISSP.\n\n34\n00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.770\nWe're not gonna know everything.\n\n35\n00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.000\nWe're not gonna know when everything\nhappens right away, immediately.\n\n36\n00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.320\nIt's also very important and,\nso what we have to think about,\n\n37\n00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.680\nis how are we gonna set up solutions\nas we were just joking around about but\n\n38\n00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.010\nwe're actually being serious about it as\nwell policies procedures guidelines talk\n\n39\n00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.070\nabout the value of these things what\nthey are why they're important.\n\n40\n00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.150\nHow are we going to set these up to\nhelp us understand what is happening and\n\n41\n00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.380\nthen set up events and concerns and\nsolutions that tell us\n\n42\n00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.640\nwhen something does happen that we\nhave to pay attention right, so\n\n43\n00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.670\nhow are we gonna monitor talk\nabout the value of monitoring.\n\n44\n00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.680\nHow are we going to have not only policies\nand procedures, but auditing as we've\n\n45\n00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.730\ntalked about that tells us what\nthe current state is as opposed to what\n\n46\n00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.000\nwe would think of as the desired state,\nwhich may be happening and may not be.\n\n47\n00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.490\nWe spent a lot of time talking about these\nelements of the things we have to do.\n\n48\n00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.270\nWhat we're gonna focus on\nhere in security operations\n\n49\n00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.540\nis how to understand when something\ndoes happen, how we actually respond.\n\n50\n00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.930\nRight?\nSo what are the incident concerns and\n\n51\n00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.700\nissues we have with regards to discovering\nthat something has taken place in\n\n52\n00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.830\nthe incident scene.\n\n53\n00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.000\nHow are we going to manage that?\n\n54\n00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.430\nWhat are the rules of evidence?\n\n55\n00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.790\nHow do we respond and\nexamine a situation forensically\n\n56\n00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.220\nto find information that could be\nvaluable that we may need to know?\n\n57\n00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.440\nWhat is incident response?\n\n58\n00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.580\nWhy is it important?\n\n59\n00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.120\nThese are the kinds of conversations\nwe're gonna start having.\n\n60\n00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.970\nSo let's jump in, as we often say.\n\n61\n00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.290\nThe incident scene you know we run up on\nsomething, we see something happening and\n\n62\n00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.270\nour first reaction typically is\nas a security professional is,\n\n63\n00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.750\noh my god, I've got to go figure\nout how to be on call and\n\n64\n00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.450\nnot be here, No,\nno that's not our first response.\n\n65\n00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.970\nWhat our first response should be and\nindeed it is hopefully\n\n66\n00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.710\nif we're thinking logically is,\nI have to preserve evidence right?\n\n67\n00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.830\nHave to make sure that what's\nthere whether I see it or\n\n68\n00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.060\nnot right away, whether I know it or not,\nis not going to be contaminated or not,\n\n69\n00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.150\nnot going to be compromised,\n\n70\n00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.190\nnot going to be modified in any way\nuntil I can take stock of the situation.\n\n71\n00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.920\nI can find out what really is there and\n\n72\n00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.140\nI can gather that in such a way that\nI can then take it and analyze it.\n\n73\n00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.320\nWe were joking around off camera before\nwe started this episode about CSI.\n\n74\n00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.930\nIn talking about some things\nrelated to that generically.\n\n75\n00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.230\nBut this is really like the CSI mindset,\nthe concepts.\n\n76\n00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.620\nI have to come in and investigate.\n\n77\n00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.170\nI have to understand how\nto preserve evidence.\n\n78\n00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.850\nI have to understand\nwhat that evidence is.\n\n79\n00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.450\nAnd I have to make sure nobody\nelse is going to contaminate it.\n\n80\n00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.480\nThat evidence so that I can use it and\nunderstand the true value of it.\n\n81\n00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.530\nSo, the incidents scene is gonna\nbe the place where the incident or\n\n82\n00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.670\nthe event took place.\n\n83\n00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.810\nNow, the problem with that is in the real\nworld when we are investigating a crime,\n\n84\n00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.600\nwe walk into the room where the crime\ntook place, it's a physical location.\n\n85\n00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.050\nWe see the body on the floor, we see what\nwe need to see, we know if happened there.\n\n86\n00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.520\nIn the cyber world right,\nwhen we're thinking about computers,\n\n87\n00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.310\nwe're thinking about security,\nwe're thinking about the organization,\n\n88\n00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.450\nthe crime, the event area, the incident\nmay have happened in cyberspace.\n\n89\n00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.680\nIt may have happened on a cable leading\nto a machine that's in the data center\n\n90\n00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.020\nthat we don't have direct\ncontrol over in the cloud.\n\n91\n00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.770\nHow are we going to then\nexamine that information.\n\n92\n00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.130\nSo it may not be as simple as\ngoing into the room right and\n\n93\n00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.140\nfinding the smoking gun.\n\n94\n00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.260\nWe may have to figure out how to\nremotely examine this information.\n\n95\n00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.440\nWe may have to figure out how\nto safeguard what is there and\n\n96\n00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.920\nexamine what is there because we may\nnot be able to get the certain aspects\n\n97\n00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.640\nof the crime and\nthe scene that was associated with it.\n\n98\n00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.410\nThe side where the bad action took place,\nwe're not gonna see, right?\n\n99\n00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.580\nWe have no way of knowing,\nwe don't know where the bad actor is,\n\n100\n00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.760\ntraditionally at least not\nat the beginning, anyway.\n\n101\n00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.140\nSo we have to understand the limitations\nof incident management and\n\n102\n00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.300\nthe incident scene and what it is, but\nalso what it's not within our world.\n\n103\n00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.000\nSo when we think about the principles of\ncriminalistics which is generically what\n\n104\n00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.590\nwe're talking about here, for\nevidence preservation, chain of custody,\n\n105\n00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.190\nforensic examination,\nwe have to do the following.\n\n106\n00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.150\nWe have to identify the scene, so\nwe have to know what the extent,\n\n107\n00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.310\nthe perimeter is we have to lay out\n,so we understand how to investigate.\n\n108\n00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.890\nWe have to protect the environment,\n\n109\n00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.410\nwe have to put up the caution crime\nscene tape, proverbially or literally.\n\n110\n00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.560\nIn the environment that we live in,\nthe environment that we work in the cyber\n\n111\n00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.830\nworld, this may mean unhooking\na computer from the network.\n\n112\n00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.440\nLeaving the computer running and\nisolated, so\n\n113\n00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.570\nthat nothing can get into or\nout of it while we're examining it.\n\n114\n00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.130\nWe can put up a logical set of yellow\ntape barriers in other words, because it\n\n115\n00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.760\nmay not just be enough to say physically,\nhey, you can't go near that server.\n\n116\n00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.560\nEverybody is still able to\nlogically get into it right?\n\n117\n00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.020\nI mean it's connected to the network.\n\n118\n00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.150\nThat's the problem, if it's connected but\n\n119\n00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.100\nit's connected logically in the sense\nit's connected up to a cable and\n\n120\n00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.350\nyes, I know you're standing out there\ngoing, but Adam a cable is physical.\n\n121\n00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.010\nYes, I know it's connected physically.\n\n122\n00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.600\nI get that.\n\n123\n00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.330\nRight?\nI know that.\n\n124\n00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.010\nWhat i'm saying is it's not the same\nas walking up to the server and\n\n125\n00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.410\nactually being able to interact with\nit directly, right in front of you.\n\n126\n00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.480\nSo what I would think of as physical\nproximity is probably a better way\n\n127\n00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.330\nof saying that.\n\n128\n00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.230\nPhysical proximity access can easily\nbe controlled and constrained.\n\n129\n00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:20.660\nHey Mike, stand at the door and\nmake sure nobody comes in.\n\n130\n00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.820\nWe've taken care of that.\n\n131\n00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.530\nWell Mike's standing at the door\nis not going to prevent me from\n\n132\n00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.760\nremotely connecting to that\nserver over the network.\n\n133\n00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.980\nIt's just not,\nI mean it's just not how it works.\n\n134\n00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.970\nSo we have to unhook that server from the\nnetwork, in order to be able to safeguard\n\n135\n00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.440\nand to make sure that nobody is able\nto connect to it over the network.\n\n136\n00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.420\nThat's one of the things that in our world\nis different than if we were investigating\n\n137\n00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.820\na physical crime that happened [INAUDIBLE]\nin a room that's not related to computer.\n\n138\n00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.450\nUnless somebody picked up the computer,\nbeat somebody with it in which it would in\n\n139\n00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.130\ntheory have to worry about being able\nto examine the computer as well.\n\n140\n00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.060\n>> Misused case right?\n\n141\n00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.740\n>> That would be a misuse other case.\n\n142\n00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.590\nA computer case to beat somebody\nover the head with that.\n\n143\n00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.690\nWe could get silly here, it's Friday\nafternoon, we're allowed to do that.\n\n144\n00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.740\nIdentify evidence,\na potential source of evidence.\n\n145\n00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.310\nVery important for us to think about that.\n\n146\n00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.490\nAgain if we unhooked the cable\nfrom the back of the computer, so\n\n147\n00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.580\nthat way we can isolate\nthe computer from the network, and\n\n148\n00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.610\nthen we put Mike at the door and\nsay Mike don't let anybody walk in here.\n\n149\n00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.200\nLet's make sure nothing gets touched,\n\n150\n00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.280\nwe've effectively safeguarded\neverything right?\n\n151\n00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.720\nSo we've identified evidence,\n\n152\n00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.865\nwe now know that We're gonna\ntake stock of what's there.\n\n153\n00:07:20.865 --> 00:07:23.780\nOne of the things we have to know we\nhave to do is we're gonna have to take\n\n154\n00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.790\npictures of everything\nthat is in the room.\n\n155\n00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.870\nSo we're gonna make sure we take\na picture where the server is,\n\n156\n00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.330\nwhere it was located in the rack.\n\n157\n00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.260\nWe have to take pictures of all the cables\nthat are hooked up on the back of\n\n158\n00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.010\nthe machine.\n\n159\n00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.510\nExactly where they were plugged in and\nknow what order they were in and what went\n\n160\n00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.950\nwhere ,so we know exactly how to reproduce\nthat information later if necessary.\n\n161\n00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.950\nWe have to then collect all the evidence.\n\n162\n00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.800\nSo we're going to have to take\nnot just the photos, not just,\n\n163\n00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.290\nobviously, fingerprints and\nall the stuff we normally do.\n\n164\n00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.142\nBut we have to figure out how to gather\nall the information from the system\n\n165\n00:07:52.142 --> 00:07:52.908\nthat's running.\n\n166\n00:07:52.908 --> 00:07:56.076\nWe have to forensically gather\nthe evidence of data in memory, so\n\n167\n00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:59.316\nwe have to do a memory dump of the RAM\nwhile the system is powered on.\n\n168\n00:07:59.316 --> 00:08:02.184\nBecause that is volatile,\nit's dynamic information.\n\n169\n00:08:02.184 --> 00:08:05.320\nYou power off that machine,\nthat information and memory goes away.\n\n170\n00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:10.180\nSo we'll probably do a snapshot of the\nstate of the machine and we'll be able to\n\n171\n00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.100\ncapture all that or use special tools that\nallow us to capture what's in memory.\n\n172\n00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.260\nWe're gonna have to understand\nwhat's on the hard drive.\n\n173\n00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.050\nSo we're gonna have to take\nthe hard drive from the system and\n\n174\n00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.310\ndo a forensic image of it.\n\n175\n00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.620\nWe'll have to create an ISO image,\nmost likely, a bitstream copy,\n\n176\n00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.400\nbut we have to do that with\nwhat's known as a write blocker.\n\n177\n00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.850\nWe have to do it with special software\nthat allows us to copy data from\n\n178\n00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:32.020\nthe system without writing back to it,\n\n179\n00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.668\nto effectively ensure that we don't modify\nthe data and create an integrity problem.\n\n180\n00:08:36.668 --> 00:08:39.530\nWe're then gonna have to hash the data\nthat we capture in the image,\n\n181\n00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.190\nwe're gonna have to hash the hard drive,\nhash the image, compare the two,\n\n182\n00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.610\ninsure that they are accurate and\nthe same, and\n\n183\n00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:49.340\nthat validates the fact that the image\nis gonna represent the state of the data\n\n184\n00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.690\non the hard drive at the moment\nwe investigated and captured it.\n\n185\n00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:55.250\nAll this has to be time stamped,\nsigned off on, and\n\n186\n00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.670\nthen it all has to be what we\ncall bagged and tagged, right?\n\n187\n00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.120\nSo we put the evidence in the individual\nbags, we tag it with evidence tags,\n\n188\n00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.470\nwe sign off on it, and\n\n189\n00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:06.160\nthis is gonna now start creating what's\nknown as the chain of custody of evidence.\n\n190\n00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:09.440\nWe have to now certify that that\nevidence was gathered properly.\n\n191\n00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.280\nAnd that it has been examined and handled\nforensically with sound procedures.\n\n192\n00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.190\nAnd so in doing that, if we ever are\nultimately called into a court of law to\n\n193\n00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:21.050\ntestify, Mike can say definitively yes,\n\n194\n00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.610\nI was there in the room from this time\nforward until the investigation was over,\n\n195\n00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:28.860\nI was standing at that door\nwatching everybody come and go.\n\n196\n00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.630\nI saw two people enter the room.\n\n197\n00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.350\nThese were the two people at this time.\n\n198\n00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:32.940\nRight?\n\n199\n00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.190\nAnd Mike can now effectively\ntestify as to what he saw.\n\n200\n00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.560\nWe could say that the hard drive was\ngonna be entered into evidence and\n\n201\n00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.940\nwe can accept the data that's found there\nbecause we know that the hard drive was\n\n202\n00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.970\ngonna be examined.\n\n203\n00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.970\nWe took a bitstream copy, we used\na write blocker, we hash the drive,\n\n204\n00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.070\nthe image hash matches, so we know\nthe evidence that we are presenting\n\n205\n00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:55.070\nfrom the image analysis is gonna be\nidentical to what's on the hard drive.\n\n206\n00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.900\nWe never actually examine and\n\n207\n00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:01.520\nuse the original data on the hard\ndrive itself, we use the copied image.\n\n208\n00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.230\nThey are identical, after all.\n\n209\n00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:06.291\nBut we preserve the original evidence,\nso that way no matter what,\n\n210\n00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:10.158\nif there's ever any question, we have the\noriginal evidence in the original state,\n\n211\n00:10:10.158 --> 00:10:11.309\ncan always go back to it.\n\n212\n00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:13.557\nBut by using a copy,\nif anything goes wrong,\n\n213\n00:10:13.557 --> 00:10:16.425\nwe haven't blown up our\nonly evidence in effect.\n\n214\n00:10:16.425 --> 00:10:18.270\nHey sorry, can we do that again?\n\n215\n00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.150\nDidn't know we were gonna\nhave a power problem.\n\n216\n00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.201\nDo I get a do over?\n\n217\n00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:22.231\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> No, you don't get a do over,\n\n218\n00:10:22.231 --> 00:10:22.933\nright, that's it.\n\n219\n00:10:22.933 --> 00:10:25.880\nSo we could make multiple\ncopies at that point.\n\n220\n00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.040\nBut the point is, we never actually touch\nthe original evidence on the drive.\n\n221\n00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.590\nWe examine the forensically\nsound copy that has been hashed,\n\n222\n00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.690\nhas an integrity control\nassociated with it.\n\n223\n00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.070\nSo I wanna make sure we're\nthinking about all these things.\n\n224\n00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.630\nMinimizing the degree of\ncontamination of evidence.\n\n225\n00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.500\nVery important for us to consider.\n\n226\n00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.200\nWe've talked about\nthe idea of dynamic data.\n\n227\n00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.610\nOf what we call Live Evidence.\n\n228\n00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.840\nLive Evidence is that dynamic evidence.\n\n229\n00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.250\nSitting in memory, sitting in the system,\nin the cache registers, and\n\n230\n00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.390\nall those kind of things.\n\n231\n00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:55.860\nThat's cache, C-A-C-H-E,\ncache register, actually.\n\n232\n00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.710\nNot the cash register like the place\nwhere you put your money, right?\n\n233\n00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.860\nBut in the memory registers in the system,\n\n234\n00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.640\nthese are things we have to consider\nbecause if we don't take that data, and we\n\n235\n00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.320\ndon't grab it before the system is powered\ndown, we're gonna lose all evidence of it.\n\n236\n00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.630\nWhatever it may be is gone.\n\n237\n00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.610\nWe may or may not know what's there,\nbut it doesn't matter,\n\n238\n00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.580\nwe can't prove what it was cuz\nwe have no way of doing that.\n\n239\n00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.210\nSo live evidence is very important.\n\n240\n00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.700\nHave to consider what it is,\nconsider how to capture it.\n\n241\n00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.621\nWe have to also think about something\nknown as low-cards exchange principle.\n\n242\n00:11:23.621 --> 00:11:25.990\nLow-cards exchange principle.\n\n243\n00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.420\nLow cards said, right?\n\n244\n00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.570\nNot Captain Picard, but Locard.\n\n245\n00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:34.700\nLocard said it, his evil twin brother,\nnot as popular, didn't do as much TV.\n\n246\n00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.030\nWent straight to video for\nmost of the stuff he did.\n\n247\n00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:40.370\nLocard's exchange principle,\nwhen a crime is committed\n\n248\n00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.180\nthe perpetrators leave something\nbehind and take something with them.\n\n249\n00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:48.000\nIn effect, for every crime that's\ncommitted, the criminal is gonna\n\n250\n00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.200\ntake something away but\nthey're also gonna leave something behind.\n\n251\n00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.010\nAnd this exchange allows us\nto start to identifying and\n\n252\n00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.720\nbuilding a profile of who the criminal is,\nand, ultimately, if we\n\n253\n00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.010\nare able to examine it farther down the\nroad and perhaps the other evidence and\n\n254\n00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:05.640\nother crimes and match the pattern, we can\nbegin to see who this may or may not be.\n\n255\n00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.610\nSo Locard’s exchange principle,\nimportant concept of criminalistics,\n\n256\n00:12:09.610 --> 00:12:11.528\nin terms of the study of crime and\nhow this is done.\n\n257\n00:12:11.528 --> 00:12:14.420\nSo I wanna make sure we're aware,\nconceptually of that idea.\n\n258\n00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.710\nIn general, as I talked about,\nwe have best practices,\n\n259\n00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.040\nwe have guidelines we have to follow.\n\n260\n00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.220\nI mentioned some of them.\n\n261\n00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:24.340\nAll forensics procedures and\nprinciples have to be applied.\n\n262\n00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:27.110\nRules of evidence, chain of custody,\nevidence must be observed.\n\n263\n00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.700\nWe have to make sure that when we seize\nevidence, we don't alter it in any way.\n\n264\n00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.240\nWe have to make sure we uniquely\nidentify all the evidence with some sort\n\n265\n00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.060\nof specific identifier.\n\n266\n00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.590\nItem number one was this.\n\n267\n00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.350\nYou all consider these crime shows, right?\n\n268\n00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.590\nOr either documentaries or\ncrime shows, or whatever.\n\n269\n00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.710\nWe were talking about CSI, so even on CSI.\n\n270\n00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:44.810\nWherever you do it.\n\n271\n00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.100\nYou're gonna see when they go to\ninvestigate a crime that the crime scene\n\n272\n00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.930\ninvestigator, the forensic analysts,\nare gonna show up.\n\n273\n00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.210\nThey have this whole tool kit.\n\n274\n00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:53.650\nThey open it up.\nThey got all their stuff.\n\n275\n00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.867\nBut they have these name tent card\nthings with numbers on them and\n\n276\n00:12:56.867 --> 00:12:59.667\nthey put them next to anything\nthey find on the ground and\n\n277\n00:12:59.667 --> 00:13:02.289\nthey take a picture of it and\nit's got the number, so\n\n278\n00:13:02.289 --> 00:13:05.892\nthey can match the number to the evidence\nand the location it was found.\n\n279\n00:13:05.892 --> 00:13:09.665\nAnd then they enter all that in a log and\nthen they cross reference it so\n\n280\n00:13:09.665 --> 00:13:12.870\nthat they can say yeah item\nnumber five was this pen right?\n\n281\n00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.090\nIt was laying right here.\n\n282\n00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.145\nCould we do the overhead shot for\njust a second on the podium?\n\n283\n00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.190\nSo if we do this right,\nlet's put this over here.\n\n284\n00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.050\nAll right, now Mike we need a dead body.\n\n285\n00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.811\nWanna lay across,\njust side ways here real quick?\n\n286\n00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:27.702\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> What we would see effectively,\n\n287\n00:13:27.702 --> 00:13:29.670\nwhile I'm getting this whole camera angle\n\n288\n00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:30.980\nthing down,\n>> Hold down.\n\n289\n00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.780\nIt actually goes down.\n\n290\n00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.320\nI'm working on it.\n\n291\n00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.470\nRight.\nSo we would have something.\n\n292\n00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.850\nI need my number five from yesterday.\n\n293\n00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.250\nDo we have my number five from yesterday?\n\n294\n00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.060\n>> We'll have to make another one.\n\n295\n00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.070\n>> Oh, we'll have to make another one.\n\n296\n00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.920\nAll right. So anyway.\nSo what we would see effectively, right,\n\n297\n00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.610\nis something like this.\n\n298\n00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:43.070\nMike's gonna help me out with a prop here.\n\n299\n00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:44.065\nJust one second.\n\n300\n00:13:44.065 --> 00:13:45.780\nSo you would see something based on.\n\n301\n00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:46.330\nYeah, that's good.\n\n302\n00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.420\nRight?\nWe would see something.\n\n303\n00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.000\nThere you go.\n\n304\n00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.340\nRight.\nWe would see something like this.\n\n305\n00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.420\nRight.\nWhere they would put it kinda like that.\n\n306\n00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.730\nIt would have the number five on it.\n\n307\n00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.360\nWe would take a picture of it.\n\n308\n00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.380\n>> And then we'd be able to say okay,\n\n309\n00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.630\nwe found the pen in this location\ndoing this right here, right?\n\n310\n00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.750\nAnd this is now gonna go in evidence, and\nthis will be marked exhibit number 5 and\n\n311\n00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.210\nwe can track that and\nwe understand what that is, right?\n\n312\n00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.900\nSo the whole idea is that this\nis what we're gonna do and\n\n313\n00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.410\nthis is gonna be one of\nthe principles of evidence gathering,\n\n314\n00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.568\ngeneral guidelines that we have to follow,\nright?\n\n315\n00:14:14.568 --> 00:14:18.160\nSo, we wanna keep in mind that these kind\nof things are going to be very important.\n\n316\n00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.620\n>> Any person that accesses\nthe evidence has to be trained, right?\n\n317\n00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.960\nGood CSI on the fly.\n\n318\n00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.880\nAwesome, high-five for\nthat one, that was good, right?\n\n319\n00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:25.960\nCSI on the fly.\n\n320\n00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.690\nSo we wanna make sure we\nthink about the fact that\n\n321\n00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.930\nall these guidelines have to be followed,\nright?\n\n322\n00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:34.350\nIf we're in possession of any evidence,\nwe have to make sure at all times,\n\n323\n00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:37.020\nthat we are responsible for, or\nwe treat it with the proper care.\n\n324\n00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.340\nSo what we don't wanna have happen is you\nfind some evidence laying on the ground,\n\n325\n00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.470\nright, like the pen.\n\n326\n00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.710\n>> And you put it in a bag,\nyou throw it in your trunk,\n\n327\n00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.280\nand then like a week later you remember\nyou it, and it's been out there baking for\n\n328\n00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.620\na week, and I dont know,\nmaybe you went away, you went on vacation,\n\n329\n00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.760\nthrew a bunch of stuff in there, and then\nyou realize, you bring it into the office,\n\n330\n00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:57.110\nand check it and it's evidence,\nthat's not a good idea right?\n\n331\n00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.640\nIf you do that, don't tell anybody you\ndid that by the way cuz if you do that\n\n332\n00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.370\nthe evidence is worthless at this point.\n\n333\n00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:05.260\nIt's been out of the chain of custody,\nwe can't account for\n\n334\n00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:07.890\nwhat's gone on with that evidence for\na week, it sat in your trunk,\n\n335\n00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.660\nwe don't know who messed with it,\nwe don't know if anybody took it out and\n\n336\n00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:13.460\nmay have used the pen to make\nsome notes and put it back.\n\n337\n00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.160\nWe just don't know, no way to tell.\n\n338\n00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.340\nSo we gotta make sure we understand\nthat evidence must be contained.\n\n339\n00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.010\nIt must be specifically kept\nunder very tight conditions and\n\n340\n00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.500\nif anything happens to it, we have\nto note what does happen by whom and\n\n341\n00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.710\nwhen in order to satisfy\nthe rules of evidence.\n\n342\n00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.360\nVery important.\n\n343\n00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.710\nWe have to have obviously policy,\nroles, responsibilities.\n\n344\n00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.730\nWe have to have all these\nthings documented and\n\n345\n00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.580\nreally well understood in order\nto be able to work with evidence.\n\n346\n00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.060\nI mentioned chain of\ncustody several times.\n\n347\n00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.620\nThe tracking of evidence handling is\nwhat chain of custody is all about.\n\n348\n00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.090\nForm a well documented process that\nmust be followed with no exceptions.\n\n349\n00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:48.310\nNo exceptions at all.\n\n350\n00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.874\nEvidence that does not conform to chain\nof custody requirements is not gonna be\n\n351\n00:15:51.874 --> 00:15:54.740\nconsidered evidence that could\nbe brought into a court of law.\n\n352\n00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:55.878\nIt may be important.\n\n353\n00:15:55.878 --> 00:15:56.854\nMay be meaningful.\n\n354\n00:15:56.854 --> 00:16:00.440\nIt may be the thing that actually tells\nyou what happened As far as the court is\n\n355\n00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.019\nconcerned, it doesn't exist.\n\n356\n00:16:02.019 --> 00:16:03.180\nSo this is a problem.\n\n357\n00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.602\nSo if you remember, several years back,\nthis is a few years already,\n\n358\n00:16:06.602 --> 00:16:09.618\nthose of you who are from\nthe United States, who grew up here,\n\n359\n00:16:09.618 --> 00:16:13.690\nthat were around in this period of time,\nif you remember the O.J. Simpson trial.\n\n360\n00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.890\nWithout getting into the specifics\nof whether you think O.J.\n\n361\n00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.520\ndid or not, we're not taking about that,\n\n362\n00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.070\njust pointing out one trial that's fairly\nfamous that most people have heard of.\n\n363\n00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:25.510\nIf you remember the O.J. Simpson trial,\none of the key problems with the trial\n\n364\n00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.920\nthat the defense really harped on,\nthat Johnnie Cochran was just all over,\n\n365\n00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:33.950\nwas the fact that the evidence\nwas not handled properly and\n\n366\n00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:37.220\npotentially the chain of custody of\nevidence could be called into question.\n\n367\n00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.430\nWe may have been able to create\nwhat's called reasonable doubt.\n\n368\n00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:43.045\nBecause the forensic examination and\nthe procedures used to gather, and\n\n369\n00:16:43.045 --> 00:16:46.846\nthen ultimately examine that data,\nthe evidence was called into question.\n\n370\n00:16:46.846 --> 00:16:49.080\nWere the gloves kept the right way?\n\n371\n00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.410\nWere they bagged, were they tagged,\nwere they signed off on?\n\n372\n00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.860\nWere they examined the right way?\n\n373\n00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.370\nThe gloves that supposedly he did or\ndidn't wear, whoever the killer was.\n\n374\n00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.790\nSo these were things that\nwere called into question.\n\n375\n00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:02.860\nUltimately, if you can question\nthe chain of custody of evidence and\n\n376\n00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.830\nyou're able to successfully create\nreasonable doubt, that evidence may\n\n377\n00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:09.900\nnot be able to actually be used in the\nmind of the jury and the mind of the judge\n\n378\n00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.140\nto properly represent the issues and\nthe concerns of the case.\n\n379\n00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:13.960\nThis is a big deal.\n\n380\n00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.380\nWe have to be aware of that.\n\n381\n00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:16.490\nWe may have to interview people.\n\n382\n00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.790\nMay have to do fact-finding.\n\n383\n00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:21.130\nCuz it's not just, hey,\nsomebody broke into the computer.\n\n384\n00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.320\nLet me go check the logs on the computer.\n\n385\n00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:25.810\nWhat about all the people that were\noperating on the network at that time?\n\n386\n00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.740\nMaybe somebody was doing something and\n\n387\n00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.280\nmaybe they noticed that there\nwas some strange behavior.\n\n388\n00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.020\nWho knows?\n\n389\n00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.322\nMaybe there was somebody in the network\noperations center doing file monitoring or\n\n390\n00:17:34.322 --> 00:17:35.880\ngenerically just doing monitoring and\n\n391\n00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.491\nmaybe they recognized that there\nwas some suspicious behavior.\n\n392\n00:17:38.491 --> 00:17:40.180\nWe may have to interview people.\n\n393\n00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.610\nSo we have to get good at\npracticing these skills.\n\n394\n00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.410\nInterviewing is an art and\nscience like anything else.\n\n395\n00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.370\nTalking to people is not hard.\n\n396\n00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:48.750\nListening, that's hard.\n\n397\n00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.280\nTalking, not so hard.\n\n398\n00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.980\nBut asking the right questions,\nlistening to the answers and\n\n399\n00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:56.090\nthen figuring out what persons,\n\n400\n00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.360\nwhat people are telling you and figure\nout what they're not telling you and\n\n401\n00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.980\nhow to ask questions to get what you wanna\nknow is definitely an art and a science.\n\n402\n00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.020\nSo interviewing, you have to keep in mind,\n\n403\n00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.740\nis gonna be something you may\nneed to be involved with.\n\n404\n00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.220\nYou may have to do as well.\n\n405\n00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:13.210\nWe talk about five digital forensics\nrules, or things you should do.\n\n406\n00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.736\nSpecifically, they're called the five Bs.\n\n407\n00:18:14.736 --> 00:18:18.096\nThey're called the five Bs because\nevery one of the statements starts with\n\n408\n00:18:18.096 --> 00:18:20.120\nsomething like, be this, be that.\n\n409\n00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:21.859\nSo let me share with you what they are.\n\n410\n00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:23.450\nBumble Bee.\n\n411\n00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:24.210\nBBB.\n\n412\n00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.213\nSo let me share with you what they are.\n\n413\n00:18:26.213 --> 00:18:33.130\nBe authentic, be accurate, be complete,\nbe convincing, be admissible.\n\n414\n00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.400\nThe five Bs of digital forensics.\n\n415\n00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.055\nOne more time,\nbecause Mike cannot type that fast.\n\n416\n00:18:38.055 --> 00:18:39.610\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Mike's still on B.\n\n417\n00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:40.633\n>> How do you spell B?\n\n418\n00:18:40.633 --> 00:18:41.330\n>> B.\n\n419\n00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:44.010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Be authentic.\n\n420\n00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:45.716\nBe authentic.\n\n421\n00:18:45.716 --> 00:18:47.390\nBe accurate.\n\n422\n00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.416\nBe complete.\n\n423\n00:18:49.416 --> 00:18:51.850\nBe convincing.\n\n424\n00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:52.980\nAnd be admissible.\n\n425\n00:18:54.545 --> 00:18:56.715\nThese are the five B's\nof digital forensics.\n\n426\n00:18:56.715 --> 00:18:58.355\nWanna make sure we are aware of that.\n\n427\n00:18:58.355 --> 00:19:00.295\nWe will have to analyze\na variety of media.\n\n428\n00:19:00.295 --> 00:19:04.075\nI mentioned hard drives and using right\nblockers to be able to analyze them.\n\n429\n00:19:04.075 --> 00:19:08.884\nWe could be analyzing external media\nlike USB drives, external hard drives.\n\n430\n00:19:08.884 --> 00:19:10.975\nThere's a lot of different\nthings we may find.\n\n431\n00:19:10.975 --> 00:19:13.645\nCD-ROMs, things of that nature.\n\n432\n00:19:13.645 --> 00:19:14.875\nWhatever that is.\n\n433\n00:19:14.875 --> 00:19:17.964\nRemember, the media may have been\noverridden, it may have been damaged.\n\n434\n00:19:17.964 --> 00:19:20.320\nMay have been purposefully erased.\n\n435\n00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.710\nPeople may be trying to hide their tracks.\n\n436\n00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:26.940\nSomebody may have taken a cell phone,\na bunch of information on there,\n\n437\n00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.950\npulled the battery out,\ntried to destroy the phone.\n\n438\n00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:33.390\nWe maybe able to forensically go and\nexamine the data in the phone.\n\n439\n00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.980\nBut it may be harder to do\nbecause the phone's been damaged.\n\n440\n00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.810\nSo these are things you have to think\nabout, there are tools that are used for\n\n441\n00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:41.660\nthis stuff, there are experts that\nspecialize in these things and\n\n442\n00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.910\nknow how to do these things.\n\n443\n00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.720\nThey are forensically trained and\nthese are the kinds of things that you\n\n444\n00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.080\nmay need to go out and get help to do\nbecause this is not as simple as, oh,\n\n445\n00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.670\nlet me plug the cell phone into the\ncomputer, I'll sync it and I'll see what's\n\n446\n00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.170\non the hard drive in the phone or in the\nmemory on the phone or in the flash card.\n\n447\n00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:57.310\nDoesn't work that way..\n\n448\n00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.610\nIt may be very hard to do.\n\n449\n00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:02.466\nThe easy one is where I pop the memory\ncard out and I pop it in the reader and\n\n450\n00:20:02.466 --> 00:20:04.147\nup comes all the secret plans.\n\n451\n00:20:04.147 --> 00:20:05.710\nIt's usually not that simple.\n\n452\n00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.000\nI've done a lot of this work, trust me,\n\n453\n00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.120\nif it was that simple I\nwouldn't be this grey.\n\n454\n00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.790\nI just wouldn't be that way.\n\n455\n00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:12.160\nIt's a lot tougher.\n\n456\n00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.560\nPeople try to hide their tracks.\n\n457\n00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.040\nPeople are not dumb today.\n\n458\n00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.280\nThey read newspapers, those are the\nmythical things that used to be printed on\n\n459\n00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.885\npaper, we call them\ndigital editions today.\n\n460\n00:20:20.885 --> 00:20:25.550\n[COUGH] So people read about stuff that\nhappens, they see that if they destroy\n\n461\n00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.410\nthis evidence it's harder for\npeople to find out what they did, so\n\n462\n00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.870\nthey take apart their cell phones,\nthey throw them away.\n\n463\n00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.380\nThey try to rip the hard\ndrives out of machines.\n\n464\n00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.430\nLuckily for us most people don't know\nenough about what's in the machine\n\n465\n00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:38.650\nto know what a hard drive is and\nwhat it looks like.\n\n466\n00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.140\nAs a result, they usually don't\nget the right information.\n\n467\n00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.840\nSo you wanna think about these things.\n\n468\n00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.690\nBecause trying to potentially\nexamine the information\n\n469\n00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:49.960\ncan be easy if somebody really has\nnot taken a lot of precautions.\n\n470\n00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.820\nBut what if they've loaded up malware.\n\n471\n00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.740\nSomething like a logic bomb or\na time bomb of some kind,\n\n472\n00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:55.660\nthat's sitting in the system.\n\n473\n00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.030\nNot a real one that explodes and\nblows it up.\n\n474\n00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.180\nThose are fun to play with, but\nyou wanna have others with you,\n\n475\n00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.030\npeople that potentially understand\nexplosives to deal with those.\n\n476\n00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:06.080\nI'm talking about a computer bomb,\none that is a piece of malware that\n\n477\n00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.870\neffectively goes in and at the combination\nof a keystroke, or if some key is not\n\n478\n00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:15.180\nhit every so many minutes, it basically\nself-destructs the system, goes in and\n\n479\n00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:19.750\noverwrites the drive or blows up all\nthe data and crypto shreds the data.\n\n480\n00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.810\nEncrypts and then destroys the keys.\n\n481\n00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.560\nThese are things we really\nhave to be worried about.\n\n482\n00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.810\nAnd today, more and more,\nas we get into a lot of this cyber\n\n483\n00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:30.790\nsolution sleuthing that we do,\nwe are worried about the fact, indeed,\n\n484\n00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:33.440\nwe are finding that criminals\nare getting smarter.\n\n485\n00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.835\nThey understand that they have to\nhide their evidence digitally.\n\n486\n00:21:35.835 --> 00:21:39.460\nAnd it's not just a matter of\nhiding a gun, physically anymore.\n\n487\n00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.930\nIt's much more about hiding the evidence\nin the bit trail in the system.\n\n488\n00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.040\nAnd so, they're going in and trying to\nwipe all evidence of what they did and\n\n489\n00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.958\nits becoming a lot tougher for us to\nfigure out where these things are and\n\n490\n00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:49.705\nhow to find them.\n\n491\n00:21:49.705 --> 00:21:53.150\nIts becoming a real challenge today so\nwe have to think about that.\n\n492\n00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.725\nNetwork analysis, how do we analyze\nthe data coming across the network.\n\n493\n00:21:56.725 --> 00:21:59.515\nWe've shown you several times what\na screen capture looks like for\n\n494\n00:21:59.515 --> 00:22:00.465\nnetwork traffic.\n\n495\n00:22:00.465 --> 00:22:02.565\nYou have to obviously get trained\non how to read these things and\n\n496\n00:22:02.565 --> 00:22:03.735\nunderstand what you're seeing.\n\n497\n00:22:03.735 --> 00:22:06.205\nBut network analysis can yield\nsome very interesting and\n\n498\n00:22:06.205 --> 00:22:08.115\nvery important data, as well.\n\n499\n00:22:08.115 --> 00:22:11.045\nSoftware analysis,\nlooking at the software itself.\n\n500\n00:22:11.045 --> 00:22:13.700\nDrilling in and\nfinding out what makes malware tick.\n\n501\n00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:17.840\nLooking at how to deconstruct\na executable file and seeing what's going\n\n502\n00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.050\non inside of it using some sort of\na program that effectively will decompile,\n\n503\n00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:25.920\nthat's what we call them, decompilers,\nthat will decompile that information.\n\n504\n00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.180\nWe can use hex editors to read the hex\ncode inside of a program, line by line,\n\n505\n00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.790\nfile by file, and understand what's there.\n\n506\n00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.690\nBut you have to be trained forensically\non how to do these things.\n\n507\n00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:36.660\nVery important.\n\n508\n00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:39.290\nWe may be able to understand\nhow to identify the author that\n\n509\n00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:42.460\nwrote the software or the malware\nthat may have been used in an attack.\n\n510\n00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.585\nJust like everything else in the world,\npeople are proud of their work.\n\n511\n00:22:45.585 --> 00:22:46.791\nHey, criminals are proud people too.\n\n512\n00:22:46.791 --> 00:22:49.320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They want love.\n\n513\n00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.590\nLove your local criminal.\n\n514\n00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.970\nAnd so, as a result, they're gonna tag or\n\n515\n00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:55.130\nsign their work much\nlike graffiti artists do.\n\n516\n00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:57.742\nWhere you look at graffiti murals and\nyou can tell,\n\n517\n00:22:57.742 --> 00:23:01.046\njust based on the design over time,\nthat hey, this is so and so.\n\n518\n00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:02.120\nThis person did this.\n\n519\n00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.770\nYou could tell by the tag.\n\n520\n00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:05.310\nSoftware authors are the same way.\n\n521\n00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:06.290\nThey tag their work.\n\n522\n00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:09.370\nThey sign it in such a way\nthat we can tell who it is.\n\n523\n00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:13.260\nMalware that is being created is being\nwritten by people that create software.\n\n524\n00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.000\nIt's just very specifically, certain\nkinds of software that's being written\n\n525\n00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.930\nspecifically with certain\ncriminal enterprises in mind.\n\n526\n00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:23.470\nAnd so, as a result, author identification\nis also an area that we study,\n\n527\n00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:27.210\nthat we try to figure out how to do\nwhen it comes to forensic examination.\n\n528\n00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.460\nCertain authors are well known,\ncertain malware is well known.\n\n529\n00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:33.390\nAnd the signs of who wrote that\nmalware will trickle down in\n\n530\n00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:35.570\nto other pieces of\nsoftware that they touch.\n\n531\n00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:39.275\nWe may be able to look at the author\nidentification and maybe able to say, oh,\n\n532\n00:23:39.275 --> 00:23:40.478\nthis is done by so and so.\n\n533\n00:23:40.478 --> 00:23:43.260\nAnd then, go out and\ntry to find out what they were up to.\n\n534\n00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.790\nWe can do content analysi.\n\n535\n00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:51.456\nWe can look at the stuff that\ngoes on inside the goat.\n\n536\n00:23:51.456 --> 00:23:55.623\nThe systematic is what I'm trying to say,\nsystematic analysis of the code's purpose.\n\n537\n00:23:55.623 --> 00:23:58.598\nIn other words, we can literally go\nline by line examining the code,\n\n538\n00:23:58.598 --> 00:24:00.000\ntry to understand what it does.\n\n539\n00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.983\nAnd what each line of code is\nrepresenting in terms of an action.\n\n540\n00:24:02.983 --> 00:24:05.310\nOn the surface,\nthe program may look innocent.\n\n541\n00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:08.280\nWhen we look under the hood, we may\nsee that it has a nefarious purpose.\n\n542\n00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.610\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n543\n00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.810\nHardware and or embedded device analysis,\nwe may do this as well.\n\n544\n00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.000\nWe can look at what's going on.\n\n545\n00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.480\nI mentioned something like\na hardware key logger and\n\n546\n00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.410\nsomething like that in one of our\nprior episodes may be a problem.\n\n547\n00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:23.300\nA lot of hardware devices\ntoday can be stealthed to be\n\n548\n00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.050\nmade to look like something they're not.\n\n549\n00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.430\nLook at all the different ways\nUSB devices come today, right?\n\n550\n00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.970\nI mean, you have a standard USB drive, but\nyou got earrings that are USB devices.\n\n551\n00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.240\nYou got pen caps that are USB devices.\n\n552\n00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.260\nYou got all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n553\n00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.510\nSo while it may not seem obvious,\nright, and I'm not suggesting for\n\n554\n00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.520\na minute that this is a USB device.\n\n555\n00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.720\nBut you'll imagine if the top of the pen\ncame off, and there was a little USB\n\n556\n00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.940\ndevice on the side, you could plug in and\nthen clip back on and\n\n557\n00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.140\nwalk out with information, right,\njust sitting in your pocket.\n\n558\n00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.500\nYou notice I got that right.\n\n559\n00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.450\nI was looking there.\n\n560\n00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:53.820\nI wasn't [INAUDIBLE] and I got it right.\n\n561\n00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.500\n>> It was slick.\n\n562\n00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.670\n>> It finally figured\nout the direction thing.\n\n563\n00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.720\nIt only took all week, but\nI finally figured it out.\n\n564\n00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.000\nI didn't go over here, which would\nhave been my normal inclination.\n\n565\n00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.500\nAll right, so the idea would be\nthat this could be a USB device.\n\n566\n00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.527\nIt happens to be a pen, but\nwe don't know for sure what it is.\n\n567\n00:25:07.527 --> 00:25:10.978\nAnd the idea is that it could be a piece\nof hardware that's masquerading to\n\n568\n00:25:10.978 --> 00:25:11.820\nsomething else.\n\n569\n00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:16.110\nAgain, we have to examine and in theory\nbe suspect and really be suspicious of\n\n570\n00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:20.730\neverything, right, because anything today\nin theory could contain information\n\n571\n00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:25.368\ngathering, information monitoring,\ninformation observation capabilities.\n\n572\n00:25:25.368 --> 00:25:29.073\nWe talked about cell phones one of our\nprior episodes and how problematic they\n\n573\n00:25:29.073 --> 00:25:32.151\ncan be in secure environments,\nbecause they can be turned on and\n\n574\n00:25:32.151 --> 00:25:36.270\nremotely controlled for video, for audio,\nfor monitoring capabilities, right?\n\n575\n00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.465\nSo these are the kinds of things we\nwanna make sure we're aware of and\n\n576\n00:25:38.465 --> 00:25:40.180\nwe're thinking about as well.\n\n577\n00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:45.740\nWe also have to consider legal issues and\nconcerns with regards to jurisdiction.\n\n578\n00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:50.500\nThe issue and concern here is what law is\ngoing to be relevant for where we are.\n\n579\n00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:55.430\nAre we in a state,\nhypothetically let's just say Florida,\n\n580\n00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.980\nwhere there may be certain\nlaws that the state has\n\n581\n00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.620\nthat will say that evidence has to be\nmanaged and gathered a certain way.\n\n582\n00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.470\nAnd then there may be federal laws, laws\nthat are in the case of the United States,\n\n583\n00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:10.110\nat the federal level, that may override\nthose state laws or may not, it depends.\n\n584\n00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:13.440\nThere may be international laws that\noverride federal and state laws.\n\n585\n00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.110\nWe may be in a different country and the\nlaws of that country are gonna apply and\n\n586\n00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.560\nnot the laws where maybe\nwe call our home base, or\n\n587\n00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.070\nwhere we would normally work out of.\n\n588\n00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:25.180\nIn other words a CISSP that jumps on\na plane to go do incident response\n\n589\n00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.100\nin Bolivia is not gonna be bound by\nthe laws of the United States anymore,\n\n590\n00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.080\nyou're bound by the laws of Bolivia.\n\n591\n00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.300\nAnd you have to understand that\nif you work extranationally,\n\n592\n00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:38.200\noutside of your country and other\ngeography, as a security professional,\n\n593\n00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.160\nyou are responsible for understanding what\nthe laws and the accepted practices and\n\n594\n00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.390\nbehaviors are in that country.\n\n595\n00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:48.260\nIt may be illegal for\nyou to do certain things in country X or\n\n596\n00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.140\nY that you can do in your home country.\n\n597\n00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.770\nFor instance,\nit's illegal to use encryption\n\n598\n00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.160\nin certain countries the way\nwe do in the United States.\n\n599\n00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.062\nIt's against the law.\n\n600\n00:26:58.062 --> 00:27:02.820\nIn China, as an example, we're not\nallowed to use encryption the same way.\n\n601\n00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.990\nIf you do you're violating the state\nsecrecy and privacy acts, and\n\n602\n00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.660\nyou can actually go to jail.\n\n603\n00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.060\nSo there are considerations,\n\n604\n00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:13.750\nsignificant concerns that a CISSP\nwould have to be aware of.\n\n605\n00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.720\nThis may not apply to you.\n\n606\n00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.020\nYou may not work internationally.\n\n607\n00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.110\nIt may not be a big deal for you,\nand you may just simply say, well,\n\n608\n00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.180\nI work in this country.\n\n609\n00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.890\nThis is where I live,\nthis is what I do, and\n\n610\n00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.500\nI've just gotta know the law of the land.\n\n611\n00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:27.510\nAbsolutely, but also understand that there\nare different laws in different lands.\n\n612\n00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:28.690\nAnd just be aware of that.\n\n613\n00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:32.460\nJust to be clear, we're not gonna\nexpect you to know what those laws are.\n\n614\n00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.460\nRight, we're not gonna\ngive you a geography quiz.\n\n615\n00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.110\nAnd ask you where it is or is not\nappropriate for you to do certain things.\n\n616\n00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:42.900\nWe do expect you as a CISSP to understand,\ngenerically, that the laws of the location\n\n617\n00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.910\nwhere you operate are the laws\nyou must be aware of and follow.\n\n618\n00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:47.390\nThat is very important.\n\n619\n00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:49.536\nWe carry out different\ntypes of investigation.\n\n620\n00:27:49.536 --> 00:27:52.905\nThere will be criminal investigations,\nmaybe civil investigations,\n\n621\n00:27:52.905 --> 00:27:55.777\nmaybe operational investigations\nwithin an organization,\n\n622\n00:27:55.777 --> 00:27:58.057\njust internally to figure\nout what's going on.\n\n623\n00:27:58.057 --> 00:27:59.307\nThere could be e-discovery,\n\n624\n00:27:59.307 --> 00:28:02.300\nwhich is typically used in the cloud\nvery often to find evidence.\n\n625\n00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.050\nSo we have to understand there are\ndifferent types of investigations that may\n\n626\n00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:08.120\noccur and different outcomes\nfrom different investigations,\n\n627\n00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.425\nspecifically the difference between\ncriminal and civil for instance, right?\n\n628\n00:28:11.425 --> 00:28:15.360\nIn a criminal investigation,\nand potentially a criminal suit\n\n629\n00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.680\nthat follows that, if you're dragged into\ncourt, potentially you can be found guilty\n\n630\n00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.140\nof violating the law and in theory be\ngiven jail time, a jail sentence for that.\n\n631\n00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.730\nCriminal outcomes typically\ninvolve jail time and\n\n632\n00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.800\nsentences involving you going away.\n\n633\n00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.628\nThey put you in the big house as they say,\nright?\n\n634\n00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:36.680\nIn the civil cases, when you are found\nguilty, if you are, you may face a fine,\n\n635\n00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.110\ntypically a financial fine of some kind.\n\n636\n00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.960\nYou may have to pay restitution or\ndamages to somebody.\n\n637\n00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.230\nSo if you go back to the OJ Simpson\nexample we talked about earlier,\n\n638\n00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.780\ninteresting outcome in that case.\n\n639\n00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:50.098\nOJ Simpson was not found guilty\nin the criminal suit, all right.\n\n640\n00:28:50.098 --> 00:28:52.700\nHe was effectively found\ninnocent in theory of committing\n\n641\n00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.740\nthe crime that he stood to\npotentially be guilty of, right,\n\n642\n00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.360\nthe fact that he theoretically\nmurdered those two people.\n\n643\n00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.070\nBut he was found guilty in\nthe civil portion of the trial.\n\n644\n00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:04.890\nSo he actually was found guilty in\ntheory of a crime that they said he did\n\n645\n00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:07.630\nnot commit in the civil trial\nif you think about that, and\n\n646\n00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:11.110\nwas effectively made to pay damages for\nsomething that,\n\n647\n00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:15.300\nsupposedly, in the criminal version of\nthat trial, he was found innocent of.\n\n648\n00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.520\nSo it's kind of interesting\nthat the outcomes can differ\n\n649\n00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.330\nwhen you think about this.\n\n650\n00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.810\nBecause the civil case and the criminal\ncase have two very different outcomes and\n\n651\n00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:22.826\ntwo different focuses.\n\n652\n00:29:22.826 --> 00:29:24.630\nSo I wanna just make sure\nwe're aware of that, and\n\n653\n00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:25.901\nwe're thinking about that as well.\n\n654\n00:29:25.901 --> 00:29:30.630\nAll right, probably a good place for\nus to think about taking a break and\n\n655\n00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:32.200\ncoming back talking about some more stuff.\n\n656\n00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.860\n>> Sounds good to me, we'll do just that.\n\n657\n00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.600\nWe'll take a little break and we'll come\nback with more great CISSP for you guys.\n\n658\n00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.120\nRemember if you want to attend\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n659\n00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:44.520\nall you gotta do is shoot us\nan email here at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n660\n00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.780\nFor now signing off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n661\n00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.975\n>> Oh, that would be me.\n\n662\n00:29:47.975 --> 00:29:49.870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm, who am I today?\n\n663\n00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:50.927\nI'm George Smith.\n\n664\n00:29:50.927 --> 00:29:53.690\nThat's right, I'm George Smith,\nand we'll see you next time.\n\n665\n00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:59.710\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.240\nI'm your host Mike Roderick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.380\nToday we're doing our CISSP content and\nspecifically in this episode,\n\n5\n00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.730\nwe're going to be looking at secure\noperations concepts, some of these that\n\n6\n00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.060\nwe've already hinted at or talked about,\nthings like intrusion detection and\n\n7\n00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.850\nintrusion prevention if I\ncan get that out, logging.\n\n8\n00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.640\nAll of that kind of stuff that we\nmay need to be familiar with and\n\n9\n00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.560\nhere to help us with all that,\nis the one and only Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.610\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.700\n>> It's going well, it's going well.\n\n12\n00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.300\nSo another exciting episode.\n\n13\n00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.560\nI often think about this when\nI hear Mike say this for\n\n14\n00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.295\nlike the 25th time in the day.\n\n15\n00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:47.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They're all exciting,\n\n16\n00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.740\nbut is there not an exciting\nprogram on ITPro TV?\n\n17\n00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.020\nI ask you honestly.\n\n18\n00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.420\nEverything that happens here is exciting.\n\n19\n00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.070\nHow could you not think it's exciting\nwhen you're looking at socks that\n\n20\n00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.200\nare this cool.\n\n21\n00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.230\nI can't keep my leg up this long.\n\n22\n00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.524\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This cool, right?\n\n23\n00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:01.462\nHow could you think those are not\nexciting I ask you honestly.\n\n24\n00:01:01.462 --> 00:01:05.500\nSo everything here is exciting on good\nsock, cool sock, exciting sock Friday.\n\n25\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.860\nAll right, so IBS is an IPS.\n\n26\n00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.250\nThis is what we were talking about or\n\n27\n00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.700\nas Mike indicated we should\nstart talking about.\n\n28\n00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.510\nYeah, we're continuing our\nconversations with regards to\n\n29\n00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.740\nmaking sure we understand how to log,\nhow to monitor, how to track activity.\n\n30\n00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.720\nSecure operations concepts is all about\nthis idea of keeping track of things and\n\n31\n00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.940\ndoing so in a way that forces us and\n\n32\n00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.280\nensures that we're gonna be acting\nin a secure manner and if we don't,\n\n33\n00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.840\nWe then wanna know that something's going\non so we can take steps to stop it, right?\n\n34\n00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.090\nAnd so we often talk about logging,\nwe talk about intrusion gathering, or\n\n35\n00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.530\nexcuse me, intrusion detection,\nwhich we can then use to gather evidence,\n\n36\n00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.940\nintrusion prevention, which we can then\nuse to not only gather evidence, but\n\n37\n00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.250\nultimately then alert and take action\nto prevent activity from taking place.\n\n38\n00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.220\nWe wanna make sure we know\nthe difference between IDSs and IPSs.\n\n39\n00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.260\nWe've harped on this definition in several\nof our prior episodes, once again,\n\n40\n00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.330\nobviously very important for you to know,\nIDS is intrusion detection systems,\n\n41\n00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.650\nthey're considered to\nbe passive solutions.\n\n42\n00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.870\nSolutions that monitor, that can alert,\nthat can tell us something is going on.\n\n43\n00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.980\nPeople often mistake this for activity\nthat's implying that they can take action.\n\n44\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.650\nReality is no,\nthey can simply alert and monitor.\n\n45\n00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.610\nIPS is intrusion prevention systems,\nare gonna be able to do everything an IDS\n\n46\n00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.970\ndoes, so think of it as IDS plus but\nit can take action to stop an attack.\n\n47\n00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.990\nSo an IDS will be able\nto see an attack coming.\n\n48\n00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.960\nWill be able to tell you hey there's\na distributed denial of service event\n\n49\n00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.910\ntaking place.\n\n50\n00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.730\nMike wake up.\n\n51\n00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.890\nMike you should pay attention.\n\n52\n00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.170\nMike there's an IDS event happening but\n\n53\n00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.350\nthe IDS can only tell\nMike hey pay attention.\n\n54\n00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.680\nIt can only alert Mike.\n\n55\n00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.940\nIt can't actually do anything.\n\n56\n00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.050\nMike has to go and manually intervene and\n\n57\n00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.150\nif Mike pays attention to\nthe alert maybe he will.\n\n58\n00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.049\nIf he doesn't you know then unfortunately\nwe're gonna have a problem right?\n\n59\n00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.740\nBut the IPS system can do all that,\ncan tell Mike hey Mike you should pay\n\n60\n00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.300\nattention but if Mike doesn't take action,\nthe IPS can go ahead and\n\n61\n00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.920\nswitch off inbound traffic from that\noutside path, preventing the distributing\n\n62\n00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.330\nanalysis service traffic from\neffectively getting into the system.\n\n63\n00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.910\nIt can effectively reprogram\na route in the router.\n\n64\n00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.895\nIt can take steps to take\ndown a website and secure it.\n\n65\n00:03:04.895 --> 00:03:06.550\nDo all sorts of different stuff.\n\n66\n00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.350\nSo the idea is that it monitors actively,\nbut it also responds actively.\n\n67\n00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.350\nI want to make sure we\nunderstand the difference there.\n\n68\n00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.530\nWe've also talked about SIEM systems\nbefore, Security Information and\n\n69\n00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.060\nEvent Management systems.\n\n70\n00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.260\nThese are log aggregation engines.\n\n71\n00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.010\nThey take logs from different systems,\ncentrally manage and control them,\n\n72\n00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.860\nbring them into a common area, and\nthen provide depacket inspection,\n\n73\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.230\ndeblogging analysis capabilities,\n\n74\n00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.740\nthey're going to be able to do business\nintelligence and aggregation for us.\n\n75\n00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.690\nThey do data visualization.\n\n76\n00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.510\nWhich is actually a pretty cool technology\nif you haven't seen data visualization\n\n77\n00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.800\nsolutions look at any of the infographics\nthat get produced on the web these days\n\n78\n00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.330\ntaking all these different data points and\nshowing you how to visualize the data and\n\n79\n00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.020\ncreate interactive solutions\nthat's data visualization.\n\n80\n00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.720\nVisual E which is real cool program and\nwebsite and a company that does this is\n\n81\n00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.530\none of the companies that does data\nvisualization there's quite a few of them\n\n82\n00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.480\nout there but these technologies are built\ninto these kinds of solutions as well.\n\n83\n00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.110\nWe typically can store raw information\nin these SEM systems, hold it for\n\n84\n00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.610\na period of time so\nthey have retention capabilities.\n\n85\n00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.820\nWe could do aggregation of information,\nlooking for pattern analysis.\n\n86\n00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.990\nWe can normalize the information.\n\n87\n00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.920\nNormalizing involves, traditionally,\n\n88\n00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.380\nstandardizing the data,\nformats in the data types.\n\n89\n00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.700\nThat way we can see all\nthe data kind of the same way.\n\n90\n00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.100\nWe can use analytics,\nwe can do learning and reporting.\n\n91\n00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.160\nSo all these different things\nare characteristics of the SEM solution.\n\n92\n00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.840\nWanna make sure we're aware of all\nof them and thinking about them.\n\n93\n00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.380\nWe could do egress monitoring.\n\n94\n00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.540\nEgress is going to be external,\noutbound, monitoring, exiting.\n\n95\n00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.030\nWe can look at data as it\nflows out of our systems.\n\n96\n00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.290\nOne of the things we often miss and\n\n97\n00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.280\nwe forget about as security professionals\nunless we're architecting solutions on\n\n98\n00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.980\na regular basis is that we focus most of\nour attention on all the inbound traffic.\n\n99\n00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.110\nWe think, well,\nall the bad people are outside, so\n\n100\n00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.220\nif we just monitor all the inbound stuff,\nwe'll find out what's happening and\n\n101\n00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.720\nwe'll be able to prevent attacks.\n\n102\n00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.470\nNow that does make a lot of sense, but we\nhave one little glitch in that thinking.\n\n103\n00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.120\nWhat about A if the bad\nactor is on the inside.\n\n104\n00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.520\nThen they're already behind the monitoring\nand you're never gonna see them.\n\n105\n00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.850\nThey're gonna sneak up on you, they're\ngonna get you without you paying attention\n\n106\n00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.370\nand what if systems are compromised\nfrom the inside and\n\n107\n00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.140\nare now going to be used\nto attack other people.\n\n108\n00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.250\nSo in effect it's not just\nabout bad people attacking you.\n\n109\n00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.130\nThey may compromise you and\nuse you to attack other people.\n\n110\n00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.270\nIf they do that,\n\n111\n00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.350\nyour outbound traffic is going to become\nsomebody else's inbound nightmare, right.\n\n112\n00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.300\nAnd so as a result of that, they're going\nto catch whoever you are attacking, is\n\n113\n00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.670\ngoing to catch that with their monitoring\non the inbound but the problem is,\n\n114\n00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.040\nyou should know enough to try to\nmonitor inbound as well as outbound,\n\n115\n00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.940\nbecause you want to stop attack\ntraffic emanating from your network.\n\n116\n00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.630\nAs much as you wanna prevent inbound\nattack traffic getting into your network.\n\n117\n00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.850\nNeither situation is a good outcome.\n\n118\n00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.470\nWanna make sure we stop and try to analyze\nand ultimately defend against both.\n\n119\n00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.310\nSo we have to have internal monitoring.\n\n120\n00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.930\nIt's incredibly important.\n\n121\n00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.990\nFrom an architecture perspective,\nif we're not doing this,\n\n122\n00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.930\nwe're actually missing a huge,\n\n123\n00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:10.870\nhuge portion of the traffic that can\nbe generated can be problematic for us.\n\n124\n00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.540\nWe don't really know if we have bad\nactors inside the organization.\n\n125\n00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.220\nLet's me honest, we hope we don't and\nwe'd like to think we don't, right?\n\n126\n00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.850\nBut we just don't know and\n\n127\n00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.430\neven if somebody doesn't\nmean to get up to no good.\n\n128\n00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:22.580\nEven if they do it by accident.\n\n129\n00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.500\nMeaning, if they get infected by\nmalware because they go someplace and\n\n130\n00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.270\ndo something they shouldn't do.\n\n131\n00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.140\nAs a result of that, we may not realize\nthat that machine has been compromised.\n\n132\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.100\nWe're not monitoring for\n\n133\n00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.050\noutbound traffic flow, we're not gonna\nsee the effects of that for some time.\n\n134\n00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.960\nThis is one of the things we\nhave to really think about and\n\n135\n00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.010\nobviously understand.\n\n136\n00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.730\nSo hopefully you guys are doing that.\n\n137\n00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.250\nIf you're not, hopefully it's something\nyou're gonna think about doing differently\n\n138\n00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.898\non Monday morning.\n\n139\n00:06:43.898 --> 00:06:47.740\nData Leak and/or\nLoss Prevention technology, DLP.\n\n140\n00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.400\nFor a common technology today,\n\n141\n00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.750\nthis is gonna be able to\nscan the entire data stream.\n\n142\n00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.010\nIt's gonna give pattern matching looking\nfor specific data strings we specify and\n\n143\n00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.330\nwhat are called business rules and then\nwe're gonna then pull that data out or\n\n144\n00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.750\nflag it and prevent it from entering or\nleaving our systems.\n\n145\n00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.460\nSo in effect,\n\n146\n00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.480\ndata loss prevention these days is used\nin healthcare settings all the time.\n\n147\n00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.370\nWhen we wanna make sure that patient\ndata is not being compromised and\n\n148\n00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.480\nbeing sent out inappropriately.\n\n149\n00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.830\nIt's used in financial\nservices firms all the time,\n\n150\n00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.710\nto be able to monitor transactional data,\nlooking for\n\n151\n00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.210\ninformation in records that may\nbe inappropriate to be sent out.\n\n152\n00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.430\nWe use it in financial trading and\nservices companies as well to look for\n\n153\n00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.170\nevidence of insider trading.\n\n154\n00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.100\nPeople are sending out stock tips and\nthings like that.\n\n155\n00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.880\nInformation that they shouldn't be doing.\n\n156\n00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.660\nWe use companies that have a lot\nof intellectual property that they\n\n157\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.600\nwant to protect.\n\n158\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.890\nWe want to make sure\nthat we're looking for\n\n159\n00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.530\nevidence of that property being sent out\nof the company through an email system.\n\n160\n00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.430\nWe use it to protect data so\nit can't be printed.\n\n161\n00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.870\nRight, these are different\nthings that we do.\n\n162\n00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.000\nYou may not be able to forward the data.\n\n163\n00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.070\nYou may not be able to read the data.\n\n164\n00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.420\nYou may not be able to print the data.\n\n165\n00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.142\nWe'll strip the data out of the email so\nyou can't do these things.\n\n166\n00:07:52.142 --> 00:07:55.876\nWe look at attachments with DLP, not\njust the body of the message itself but\n\n167\n00:07:55.876 --> 00:07:56.658\nattachments.\n\n168\n00:07:56.658 --> 00:08:00.154\nWe also can scan data At rest so\nwe can look at storage and\n\n169\n00:08:00.154 --> 00:08:03.280\nwe can use DLP systems\nto scan stored data.\n\n170\n00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.890\nI get this question a lot\nwhen we talk about this.\n\n171\n00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.950\nWhat about encrypted data, people\noften ask can we scan encrypted data\n\n172\n00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.462\nboth in the stream, in transit,\nor in storage, at rest.\n\n173\n00:08:11.462 --> 00:08:15.140\nThe answer's absolutely, but\nwe have to load the encryption keys\n\n174\n00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.410\nin to the DLP engine in order\nto be able to do the decryption.\n\n175\n00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.290\nIn other words, we don't\nmagically decrypt the data, right?\n\n176\n00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.600\nSome sort of magical oh my god,\nit's DLP, let's just part the waters,\n\n177\n00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:27.010\nencrypt the data, decrypt it and we see it\nall there and we put it all back together.\n\n178\n00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.625\nThat would be really kinda cool,\nbut it doesn't work that way.\n\n179\n00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:33.380\nWe got to have encryption keys,\nas you know, to decrypt.\n\n180\n00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.625\nAnd as a result of that, if we load the\nencryption keys into the system in line,\n\n181\n00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:40.420\nwe're then able to do\nthe encryption decryption.\n\n182\n00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.550\nWe need to probably use what\nare called accelerators,\n\n183\n00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.880\ncrypto accelerators to do effectively,\nwhat we call off loading.\n\n184\n00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.990\nHardware decryption and\nencryption engines that speed up\n\n185\n00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.990\nthis process that work in\nline with the DLP technology.\n\n186\n00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:56.090\nBut we certainly can do that, and\nthat is a capability DLP has, but\n\n187\n00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.250\nwe have to plan for that and\nunderstand how to deploy that.\n\n188\n00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.100\nSo we just want to make\nsure we know what DLP is,\n\n189\n00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.140\nit's obviously very important as well.\n\n190\n00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.230\nData at rest, data in motion, data in use,\n\n191\n00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:08.848\nall three states data exists\nin DLP can be applied there.\n\n192\n00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:12.800\nData in use on the desktop,\nin application form in real time,\n\n193\n00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.200\nlooking at data coming\nout of an email program.\n\n194\n00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.310\nData at rest, as we said in storage,\ndata in transit sends across the wire,\n\n195\n00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.050\naccess control, and\nmitigation at the gateways.\n\n196\n00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.770\nAnd we use defensive gateway appliances\nto be able to do this kind of stuff.\n\n197\n00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:27.480\nSo wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n198\n00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.930\nIt's obviously a compliance issue,\nit is a regulatory issue.\n\n199\n00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:34.385\nWe can safeguard data,\nwe can look at PII protection, PII.\n\n200\n00:09:34.385 --> 00:09:37.523\nBy the way you see that nice piece of\npie that was sitting out there when we\n\n201\n00:09:37.523 --> 00:09:38.320\ntook a break.\n\n202\n00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.360\n>> I'm protecting it for later.\n\n203\n00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.690\n>> All right, okay,\nyou're protecting your secret.\n\n204\n00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.240\nYou're using pie protection for later.\n\n205\n00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.266\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> There was some sort of a tin of like,\n\n206\n00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:47.776\nmost of it's gone, but a really good\nlooking homemade pie it looked like that\n\n207\n00:09:47.776 --> 00:09:51.140\nwas sitting out there in the break area,\nso that was actually kinda cool.\n\n208\n00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.180\nSo that's the real kind of pie, P-I-E.\n\n209\n00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.220\nWe're talking about PII,\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n210\n00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.240\nThis is stuff we don't want to have seen.\n\n211\n00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.330\nWe don't want patient records\nto be exposed, as we said.\n\n212\n00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.770\nWe don't want financial information\nbeing exposed, so this is important.\n\n213\n00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.640\nWhat about things like steganography and\nwatermarking?\n\n214\n00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.594\nWhen we take a document of some kind,\nagain, proprietary information,\n\n215\n00:10:09.594 --> 00:10:12.721\ntheoretically, maybe it's blueprints for\nsomething,\n\n216\n00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:15.802\nmaybe it's some sort of\na document with financial data.\n\n217\n00:10:15.802 --> 00:10:18.420\nWho knows what it is,\nwe put a watermark on it, right?\n\n218\n00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.940\nWe mark it and basically say,\nproperty of, and when you go to print it,\n\n219\n00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.713\nit says that Cisco Courseware,\nfor instance, right?\n\n220\n00:10:24.713 --> 00:10:28.164\nThese days, it's all electronic for\nthe most part, but when you to to print it\n\n221\n00:10:28.164 --> 00:10:31.930\nout, it prints out the watermark,\nproperty of Cisco, do not reproduce.\n\n222\n00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.714\nMicrosoft Courseware,\nsame thing for trainers,\n\n223\n00:10:34.714 --> 00:10:38.830\ndown the right hand side on every\npage MCT use only, do not reproduce.\n\n224\n00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.800\nWe have those watermarks in\nthe documents to prove ownership and\n\n225\n00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.900\nto obviously specify that it\nshould not be copied illegally.\n\n226\n00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.420\nWe have talked before about copyrights,\ntalked about patents,\n\n227\n00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.060\ntalked about trademarks,\ntalked about those things.\n\n228\n00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.980\nAnd this is just one example of how we\nwould implement that kind of protection.\n\n229\n00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.500\nBut steganography is kind of interesting,\nit's a little bit different.\n\n230\n00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.210\nSteganography is the idea of\nhiding data within other data.\n\n231\n00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.950\nSo it's the idea of being able to\ntake what we call white space,\n\n232\n00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.930\nwhich is space in a hard drive,\nlet's say hypothetically,\n\n233\n00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.940\nthat is not normally used for\ndata storage, but is available.\n\n234\n00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.070\nBut you need special tools\nto be able to get to it and\n\n235\n00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.900\nspecial tools to be able to access it.\n\n236\n00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:14.920\nAnd we can steganophy the data,\n\n237\n00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.500\nmany we can effectively hide\ndata inside of the whitespace.\n\n238\n00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.230\nButton the drive back up,\nnobody would know it's there.\n\n239\n00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:26.610\nDrive passes inspection, use the file\nit's for, Windows Explorer in the system.\n\n240\n00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.770\nYou don't see anything because the white\nspace is not going to be exposed to\n\n241\n00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.180\nthe drive or for the drive and\nthe GUI interface.\n\n242\n00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:36.060\nIt is from the command line using\nspecial tools, but not in the GUI.\n\n243\n00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.960\nSo as a result I would never see the data.\n\n244\n00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.170\nYet if we know it's there, we can go\nlook at it and obviously pull it out.\n\n245\n00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.550\nThe first generation of this\ntechnology years ago was microfiche and\n\n246\n00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.607\nmicrodocs, right.\n\n247\n00:11:45.607 --> 00:11:50.426\nSo back in the second World War you\nwould have spy cameras that spies would\n\n248\n00:11:50.426 --> 00:11:53.132\ntake pictures of the plans, whatever.\n\n249\n00:11:53.132 --> 00:11:57.360\nAnd then they would develop the film,\nthey would shrink it down to a microdot.\n\n250\n00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.000\nA microdot literally would\nbasically be the size and\n\n251\n00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.900\nthe width of maybe like a period\nin a sentence on the typed page.\n\n252\n00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.955\nVery very small, right, it would fit\non your fingertip with no trouble.\n\n253\n00:12:07.955 --> 00:12:11.345\nYou'd be able to see it but it would be so\ntiny it would be almost invisible.\n\n254\n00:12:11.345 --> 00:12:13.325\nAnd they would paste it into a letter,\n\n255\n00:12:13.325 --> 00:12:15.095\nliterally like in\nthe period of a sentence.\n\n256\n00:12:15.095 --> 00:12:19.028\nAnd they would mail the letter to somebody\neffectively sending the secret plans or\n\n257\n00:12:19.028 --> 00:12:20.396\nwhatever through the mail.\n\n258\n00:12:20.396 --> 00:12:24.074\nAnd if nobody figured out that there was\nmicrofilm and a microdot on that letter,\n\n259\n00:12:24.074 --> 00:12:26.414\nit would effectively make\nit to where it was going.\n\n260\n00:12:26.414 --> 00:12:29.893\nThey would pull it off, they'd blow it\nback up, just basically, magnifying it and\n\n261\n00:12:29.893 --> 00:12:32.472\nthey would be able to have\nall the secret plans.\n\n262\n00:12:32.472 --> 00:12:36.692\nThis happens, or did happen, in many\ncases, for years and years and years.\n\n263\n00:12:36.692 --> 00:12:40.012\nWe've gotten a little smart about this,\na little new technology concept so\n\n264\n00:12:40.012 --> 00:12:43.310\nwe're not taking pictures and\nshrinking them down to microdots anymore.\n\n265\n00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.122\nBut we are doing the same kind\nof thing with steganography,\n\n266\n00:12:46.122 --> 00:12:48.099\nwe're hiding data inside of other data.\n\n267\n00:12:48.099 --> 00:12:53.204\nSo we could do this with music files,\nwith MP3's, MP4's, mpeg files.\n\n268\n00:12:53.204 --> 00:12:56.974\nThere's a program called MP3Stego that\nwe use in hacking classes to show you\n\n269\n00:12:56.974 --> 00:12:57.735\nhow to do this.\n\n270\n00:12:57.735 --> 00:13:02.580\nThere's White Noise and all sorts\nof different programs you can use.\n\n271\n00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.730\nIf you think about a famous artist,\na guy called Seurat, who you may or\n\n272\n00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:07.920\nmay not know about, but\nhe was the dot guy.\n\n273\n00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.115\nSeurat knew a lot about dots,\nis how you remember Seurat.\n\n274\n00:13:10.115 --> 00:13:15.030\nSo Seurat was a famous artist that\nactually painted pictures, but\n\n275\n00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.370\npainted them by making them up\nwith individual dots of color.\n\n276\n00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.457\nAnd so\nwhen you stood up close to his work,\n\n277\n00:13:20.457 --> 00:13:23.938\nyou would basically see not the whole\npicture, but a series of dots.\n\n278\n00:13:23.938 --> 00:13:25.820\nAs you stood back at a certain distance,\n\n279\n00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:29.290\nwhere you got to the right distance your\neyes focused and the field of focus and\n\n280\n00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:32.490\nvision changes, you actually saw\nthe picture suddenly emerge, literally.\n\n281\n00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.532\nOut of the field of scattered colors, you\nwould suddenly see a man and the woman,\n\n282\n00:13:35.532 --> 00:13:37.458\non a boat, on a lake, whatever it was.\n\n283\n00:13:37.458 --> 00:13:42.295\nRight, so Seurat was able to\neffectively make use of space and\n\n284\n00:13:42.295 --> 00:13:46.800\nhide information in plain sight in such\na way that you only saw it if you stood at\n\n285\n00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.960\na certain distance looking\nat it a certain way.\n\n286\n00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.745\nIt's not quite steganography, but\n\n287\n00:13:50.745 --> 00:13:53.615\nit's an early example of the concept\nin terms of what we think about.\n\n288\n00:13:53.615 --> 00:13:57.765\nSo covert channels, being able to hide\ndata in places where we don't expect it,\n\n289\n00:13:57.765 --> 00:13:59.865\nthis is what steganography is all about.\n\n290\n00:13:59.865 --> 00:14:01.235\nWanna be thinking about that,\n\n291\n00:14:01.235 --> 00:14:04.710\nwanna have a sense of this as we're\ntalking through some of these areas.\n\n292\n00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.280\nWhen we think about securing\nthe provisioning of resources,\n\n293\n00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.220\nwe also have to think about\nconfiguration management.\n\n294\n00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.440\nSecure operations is not just about,\nhey, did I put the data over there?\n\n295\n00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.150\nDid I log it, did I detect it,\ndo I know what's going on?\n\n296\n00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:20.100\nIt's also about making sure that the\nconfigurations that we use in our systems\n\n297\n00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.730\nare set up in such a way\nthat they are secure.\n\n298\n00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.020\nBut not just initially,\nthat we continue to monitor them.\n\n299\n00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.710\nAnd over time, if they change, that we\nnote that they are no longer compliant,\n\n300\n00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:33.430\nand we remediate, we change them and\nput them back into a compliant state.\n\n301\n00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.000\nWe call this configuration management.\n\n302\n00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.310\nIt's very important for\n\n303\n00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:40.070\nsecurity professionals to understand the\nimpact of configuration management, and\n\n304\n00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.060\nchange management as well,\nbecause they often go hand in hand.\n\n305\n00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.368\nYou really can't do configuration\nmanagement without getting good at change\n\n306\n00:14:46.368 --> 00:14:46.974\nmanagement.\n\n307\n00:14:46.974 --> 00:14:49.584\nYou have to understand how to master and\nmonitor and\n\n308\n00:14:49.584 --> 00:14:53.430\neffectively deal with change to then\nbe able to deal with configuration.\n\n309\n00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.560\nSo, it's important to know about both.\n\n310\n00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.560\nBut, when we think about\nconfiguration management,\n\n311\n00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.430\nwe're thinking about both hardware and\nsoftware.\n\n312\n00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:03.760\nAgain, we never want to leave one of these\ntwo important component system parts out.\n\n313\n00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.810\nIf we leave out the hardware and all we do\nis focus on the software what will happen\n\n314\n00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:11.510\nis we'll really get an understanding what\nsystem software we are using and changing.\n\n315\n00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:15.380\nBut if somebody swaps out hardware, we\neffectively have no idea that it happened.\n\n316\n00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.120\nWhat if they swap out a hard drive for\nanother hard drive and they take all of\n\n317\n00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.680\nour sensitive information,\nmake a copy of it and we don't know?\n\n318\n00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:23.190\nThat obviously would be a challenge.\n\n319\n00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:27.710\nWhat if they swap out the software,\nwe focus on the hardware so\n\n320\n00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.890\nwe lock all that down.\n\n321\n00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:32.700\nThey swap out the software and they put\nsome information gathering software in\n\n322\n00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.220\nthere that takes screen captures of\neverything we do every 30 seconds,\n\n323\n00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.710\nstores it as text files and\nthen batches it off the system.\n\n324\n00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.400\nThese are keystroke loggers that\neffectively will do this kind of thing\n\n325\n00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.600\nthat are software based.\n\n326\n00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.520\nWe have both hardware and\n\n327\n00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.548\nsoftware based keystroke loggers,\ninsidious little malware devices, right?\n\n328\n00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:50.690\nI mean, who's going to notice\nan extra text file is buried in\n\n329\n00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:51.492\nthe local hard drive.\n\n330\n00:15:51.492 --> 00:15:53.928\nProbably not gonna find them\nbecause chances are good you'll A,\n\n331\n00:15:53.928 --> 00:15:55.267\nyou don't know to go look for them.\n\n332\n00:15:55.267 --> 00:15:56.923\nAnd B, there's so\nmany of hem there already,\n\n333\n00:15:56.923 --> 00:15:58.758\nthat you're really not\ngoing to notice a few more.\n\n334\n00:15:58.758 --> 00:16:02.681\nAnd so they'll just be secreted somewhere\nand then they'll be sent off the system in\n\n335\n00:16:02.681 --> 00:16:06.800\nbatches every so often and as a result,\nyou may never realize this is happening.\n\n336\n00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.170\nSo remember,\nif you're typing on the screen, right,\n\n337\n00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.370\nand you're typing your password and\nwe put a bunch of asterisks up,\n\n338\n00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.930\nif we're logging the keystrokes and\nnot logging what's on the screen.\n\n339\n00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:19.420\nThen we're going to see what you type\neven though what you see is asterisks.\n\n340\n00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.880\nSo we can do these kind of things and\n\n341\n00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.260\nwe have to make sure we\nknow what's on a system.\n\n342\n00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:25.480\nThis is why our baselines are so\nimportant.\n\n343\n00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.920\nIf we have a system baseline and\nwe monitor the system and say well that's\n\n344\n00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:33.460\ninteresting, this program called Mike\nwants my password was not here yesterday.\n\n345\n00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.960\nNow all of a sudden its there and\nits running.\n\n346\n00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.100\nWhat's that all about?\n\n347\n00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.330\nWell, clearly Mike is up to no\ngood cuz you gotta watch him.\n\n348\n00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:42.390\nHe gets up to no good if you\ndon't pay attention to him.\n\n349\n00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:47.330\nSo if Mike wants my password softwares\nrunning, somebody's clearly put out there.\n\n350\n00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:50.340\nIf I have a base line that says\nnormally it's not there and\n\n351\n00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.280\nI come back 24 hours later, scan and\nfind out it is, I can tell two things.\n\n352\n00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.620\nOne, clearly the system's\nbeen compromised.\n\n353\n00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:59.120\nI may not know what Mike\nonce my password does, but\n\n354\n00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.100\nI'm pretty sure when I look it's not\ngonna be something that I'm gonna like.\n\n355\n00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.090\nAnd number two, I can tell that\nbecause that change has occurred I can\n\n356\n00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:10.890\ntell if I look 24 hours ago and I look\nagain today, I now have a time window,\n\n357\n00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:15.430\nI can tell roughly within the last 24\nhours or so that change has happened.\n\n358\n00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:16.880\nI can begin to work backwards.\n\n359\n00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.000\nWho had access to the system?\n\n360\n00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.500\nLet's look at the logs.\n\n361\n00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.280\nWho was doing what?\n\n362\n00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.090\nWhen did they connect?\n\n363\n00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:21.830\nThat kinda thing.\n\n364\n00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.000\nI could probably narrow down what happened\nand figure out where it came from.\n\n365\n00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.100\nBut I know most importantly, even if I\ndon't ever figure any of that out, and\n\n366\n00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.320\nnow most importantly that\nthe system has been compromised.\n\n367\n00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.570\nI can take note of that, I can understand\nwhat that program is I can isolate it,\n\n368\n00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:36.580\nI can analyze it.\n\n369\n00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.980\nBut I can also remove it and\n\n370\n00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.390\nput the system back into a compliant\nstate by having a base line.\n\n371\n00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:44.995\nIn effect, the last known good,\nif you will and we talk about last\n\n372\n00:17:44.995 --> 00:17:48.620\nknown configurations essentially\nalong the same lines of a baseline.\n\n373\n00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.060\nBasically the same idea.\n\n374\n00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.470\nSo hardware and software,\nvery important to think about those.\n\n375\n00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:55.840\nConfiguration management's all about\nreally understanding how a system is\n\n376\n00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.900\nconfigured, tracking that, taking into\naccount both hardware and software.\n\n377\n00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:04.720\nWe use configuration management databases,\nthe idea of a CMDB as we call it,\n\n378\n00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.680\nis generically the idea of a place\nwe store all these configurations.\n\n379\n00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.210\nIt's not necessarily a real database.\n\n380\n00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.640\nIt could be a series of spreadsheets,\n\n381\n00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:14.210\na word doc, there's all sorts\nof stuff that it could be.\n\n382\n00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.800\nBut if you use a system that\ncoordinates all those for\n\n383\n00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.900\nyou automatically, it's typically\ngonna be a software program, and\n\n384\n00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.090\nit's typically gonna\nstore it in a database.\n\n385\n00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.810\nBut it really just has to be a set of or\na group of areas and\n\n386\n00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:28.420\nsettings where you can store data safely,\nand understand what it is, and\n\n387\n00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.560\nkeep track of it with change control\nover time but normally, a database.\n\n388\n00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:35.290\nSo CMDB,\nConfiguration Management Database,\n\n389\n00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:37.660\nwhere we put all of the configurations.\n\n390\n00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:41.600\nCIs, configuration items, are the entries\nthat we enter into the CMDB.\n\n391\n00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.540\nThe CIs, the configuration items,\n\n392\n00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.280\nare really just entries that tell us\nwhat the configuration information is.\n\n393\n00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.250\nOh, we have a standard\nDell Latitude laptop.\n\n394\n00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:54.590\nIt's gonna run a standard operating\nsystem, Windows 7 Service Pack 2.\n\n395\n00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:58.430\nIt's gonna be configured\nwith two gigs of RAM,\n\n396\n00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:02.910\ndual core processor and it's gonna have\nthis, this, and this running on it.\n\n397\n00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:07.730\nEvery one of those is a configuration item\nthat goes into the configuration baseline\n\n398\n00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:11.020\nthat we store in the configuration\nmanagement database.\n\n399\n00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.830\nSay configuration management\nthree times quickly.\n\n400\n00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:13.370\nWith me, right?\n\n401\n00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.420\nSo configuration\nmanagement very important.\n\n402\n00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.730\nSo we have policies and standards that\nwe use to drive configure management,\n\n403\n00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.800\nwant to make sure that\nwe're aware of these.\n\n404\n00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.460\nWanted to find those policies,\nwant to broadly and\n\n405\n00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.820\nwidely communicate as we have\ntalked about often doing.\n\n406\n00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.330\nI want to make sure that everybody\nunderstands that they have to\n\n407\n00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.540\nmanage to them.\n\n408\n00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.130\nSo when we deploy a new system.\n\n409\n00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:36.730\nIt should be deployed using configuration\nmanagement aligned with the standards\n\n410\n00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.050\nthat we are using.\n\n411\n00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.710\nWhen we monitor that system for\nbaseline compliance,\n\n412\n00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:44.470\nit should be monitored with configuration\nmanagement in mind using the policies and\n\n413\n00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:45.890\nthe standards that we are going to use.\n\n414\n00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.780\nSo you wanna be thinking that and\nunderstanding that.\n\n415\n00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.370\nWe also have to think about things that\nare known as trusted paths, right.\n\n416\n00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:55.860\nWe have to understand how do we\nsecurely communicate information.\n\n417\n00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.610\nWhat is that trusted path or that\ntrustworthy interface that we can use?\n\n418\n00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:03.010\nMeaning when I sit down at a system,\nI open up my web browser and\n\n419\n00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.880\nI want to log on to Outlook Web Access\nto our company portal's email.\n\n420\n00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.310\nDo I have a trusted path to get there?\n\n421\n00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:11.280\nWell, I do.\nI have a URL that specifies specifically\n\n422\n00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.780\nhow to get to that portal and how to log\ninto my company's tenant, specifically.\n\n423\n00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.150\nIt's called a trusted path, right.\n\n424\n00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:21.410\nSo the trusted path is going to be\nthe known path that we know and trust and\n\n425\n00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:22.280\ncan use.\n\n426\n00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:25.850\nThe untrusted path is the one\nthat is provided in the email\n\n427\n00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.725\nfrom your cousin in Nairobi who wants to\ngive you a million dollars because your\n\n428\n00:20:29.725 --> 00:20:31.440\nlong-lost uncle just died.\n\n429\n00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.660\nHe was the king, by the way.\n\n430\n00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.890\nHe had a lot of money, and\nhe wants to give it to you.\n\n431\n00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.820\nThat's an untrusted path.\n\n432\n00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.755\nWe commonly call that spam these days.\n\n433\n00:20:38.755 --> 00:20:41.800\n[LAUGH] So just make sure you're aware\nof the difference between the two.\n\n434\n00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.265\nWe also wanna talk about failing safe and\nfailing secure.\n\n435\n00:20:44.265 --> 00:20:47.925\nWhen we think about failing safe,\nand failing secure,\n\n436\n00:20:47.925 --> 00:20:52.915\na classic example is let's think about\na vault door on a bank vault, right?\n\n437\n00:20:52.915 --> 00:20:55.225\nThe bank vault,\nwhen it is locked at night,\n\n438\n00:20:55.225 --> 00:20:57.485\nin theory, it has a time lock on it.\n\n439\n00:20:57.485 --> 00:21:00.695\nIt should only open again,\nlet's say eight o'clock the next morning,\n\n440\n00:21:00.695 --> 00:21:03.310\nwhen you're back in business and\npeople are in the bank.\n\n441\n00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.980\nSo once we close that door and\nlock it, it has control and\n\n442\n00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.380\nsafety mechanisms in place\nthat it fails to cure.\n\n443\n00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.860\nMeaning that bank clock or\nthat vault rather, is closed.\n\n444\n00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.460\nEven if the power is cut off.\n\n445\n00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.540\nThe lock stays in place you're not\ngonna be able to open the vault door.\n\n446\n00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:19.320\nSo it's secure.\n\n447\n00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:23.420\nIt's going to only be open when the time\nlock allows you to reopen in the morning.\n\n448\n00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.860\nA failsafe solution would allow you to\nget out of the bank vault because we have\n\n449\n00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.985\na crash bar on the inside of\nthe bank vault this would be cool.\n\n450\n00:21:29.985 --> 00:21:31.330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Crash bar on the inside of the bank\n\n451\n00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.510\nvault door, and you can Hit that,\nand if you're trapped inside,\n\n452\n00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:36.940\nit will disengage the locking mechanism,\nand allow you out.\n\n453\n00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.360\nNow we don't have that, traditionally.\n\n454\n00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.280\nBut what we do think about is for\ninstance in modern buildings,\n\n455\n00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.600\nwhere we have smoke doors\nin the middle of hallways.\n\n456\n00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:50.390\nThink of hospitals, for instance,\nor hotels, where you have the broad\n\n457\n00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:55.120\nhalls that you walk down, in a hotel or\na large area in a hospital.\n\n458\n00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.780\nEvery 50 feet, every 100 feet, whatever it\nis, you're gonna see these smoke doors,\n\n459\n00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.140\nthese large, heavy, metal doors\nthat are usually on mag locks or\n\n460\n00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.320\nup against the sides of the hallway and\n\n461\n00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.830\nthey're kept open like this all the time\nactually kept open like this all the time.\n\n462\n00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:12.870\nThis is the widescreen version of\nthe right, this is the letterbox version.\n\n463\n00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.710\nThey're kept open all the time, so\nthey're back on the walls with mag locks.\n\n464\n00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:19.690\nTypically those metal arms that have\nlittle discs on them with the magnets, so\n\n465\n00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:21.130\nthey're stuck up on the wall.\n\n466\n00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:26.900\nWhen the power fails or when there is\na fire, the mag locks let go, the door\n\n467\n00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.090\neffectively swing closed, preventing\nthe smoke from traveling down the hallway.\n\n468\n00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.060\nSo that way, it's safe for\n\n469\n00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.270\npeople that may be trapped in\nbetween those doors to stay there.\n\n470\n00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.990\nSo effectively, they're not gonna\nsuffer from the effects of the fire.\n\n471\n00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:42.220\nThose doors fail safe,\nmeaning when they close,\n\n472\n00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.180\nthey can be opened by individuals on\neither side using the crash bar or\n\n473\n00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.280\nthe door handle, so they're not locked\nin place and cannot be unlocked.\n\n474\n00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.040\nA fail secure door cannot\nbe unlocked once it closes.\n\n475\n00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.950\nA fail safe solution can be opened up.\n\n476\n00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:59.590\nWe want to make sure we understand\nthe difference between the two,\n\n477\n00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:04.480\nbecause obviously in certain situations\nfail safe is critical to life safety.\n\n478\n00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.440\nFail secure is critical to\ninformation security and\n\n479\n00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.800\nwe may not have both in the same\nplace at the same time.\n\n480\n00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.560\nSo we want to make sure we understand and\nknow the difference there.\n\n481\n00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.710\nWe've talked about need to know and\nleast privilege.\n\n482\n00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.810\nSome of these things are just really\nreviewing information from prior\n\n483\n00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.200\nconversations.\n\n484\n00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.290\nDo I have a need to know, then am I\nclassified to see that information?\n\n485\n00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.450\nLeast privileged, give you the minimum\namount of permission necessary to do my\n\n486\n00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.500\njob, but theoretically not\nanything more than I need.\n\n487\n00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.070\nCuz then I wanna be responsible and\nI also don't wanna have\n\n488\n00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:35.420\nany more permissions that I may\nneed to in order to do my job.\n\n489\n00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:39.330\nAnytime somebody's given special\npermissions, we should monitor that.\n\n490\n00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.310\nRemember we talked when we talked about\naccess controls in one of our prior\n\n491\n00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.640\nconversations about RBAC.\n\n492\n00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.740\nYou guys remember what RBAC was?\n\n493\n00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.070\nWas it rule or was it role based?\n\n494\n00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.430\nYou guys remember?\n\n495\n00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:51.630\nMike does.\n\n496\n00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.010\nLook at that happy.\n\n497\n00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:54.260\nMike, see that smile?\n\n498\n00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.820\n>> It is.\n>> Mike knows, right?\n\n499\n00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.269\nSo which one was it,\nwas it rule or was it role based?\n\n500\n00:23:58.269 --> 00:24:02.290\n>> It's gonna be role based because\nrule based we just called rule based.\n\n501\n00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.003\n>> Mike was paying attention for\nthat particular episode.\n\n502\n00:24:05.003 --> 00:24:05.839\nAll right, so.\n\n503\n00:24:05.839 --> 00:24:07.465\nIt is role-based access control.\n\n504\n00:24:07.465 --> 00:24:09.878\nWe talked about different types\nof role-based access control.\n\n505\n00:24:09.878 --> 00:24:14.775\nOne of them was non-RBAC, not using RBAC,\nin effect; going to individuals and\n\n506\n00:24:14.775 --> 00:24:19.168\neffectively bypassing the system of\nassigning them to a role to give them\n\n507\n00:24:19.168 --> 00:24:23.370\npermissions and managing them,\nwhat we call, by exception.\n\n508\n00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.130\nGiving them permissions directly,\n\n509\n00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.710\ndirect user assigning is often\nreferred to as managing by exception.\n\n510\n00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:33.220\nMonitoring special privileges is\nessentially keeping track of non RBAC\n\n511\n00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.530\nassignments for privilege because you have\nspecial permissions outside of the system.\n\n512\n00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.840\nWe want to know what they are and\nwhat you're doing with them.\n\n513\n00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:40.870\nSo we're monitoring them.\n\n514\n00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.170\nThis is what's commonly referred to\nas monitoring special privileges.\n\n515\n00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:45.750\nSo we just want to think about that.\n\n516\n00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.770\nBe aware of that.\n\n517\n00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:51.770\nThings like job rotation, account\nvalidation, are all forms of monitoring.\n\n518\n00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:56.300\nAll forms of things that we would do to\nimplement additional layers of control\n\n519\n00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.180\nwithin our system.\n\n520\n00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.270\nSo we want to be thinking about that.\n\n521\n00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.469\nWe also want to think about\nthe information life cycle.\n\n522\n00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.280\nLike most system life cycles,\nit is going to be a clearly understood and\n\n523\n00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.390\ndocumented process.\n\n524\n00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.780\nWhat that means just to be forthright\nwith you as we've often said\n\n525\n00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.780\nis it's something you\nshould know in order.\n\n526\n00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.300\nSo we are going to go ahead and\ndocument that for\n\n527\n00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.440\nyou right now, tell you what the steps\nare want to make sure you understand them.\n\n528\n00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.610\nPlease take a moment, listen carefully,\nwrite them down if you have to,\n\n529\n00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:24.750\nplease re-watch and rewind and then\nmake sure you have them all, excuse me,\n\n530\n00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:27.140\nyou have them all captured\nbefore we go forward.\n\n531\n00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:32.410\nSo creation and or receipt of data,\ntraditionally that's called creation\n\n532\n00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:37.700\nof data, meaning we're instantiating data\ninitially, then distribution of data.\n\n533\n00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:41.890\nSo creation,\nfollowed by distribution, use, so\n\n534\n00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:48.120\nwe distribute data to share it then we're\ngonna use it, maintenance, disclosure.\n\n535\n00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.740\nAnd I'll go through these again.\n\n536\n00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:50.990\nDisposition.\n\n537\n00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.650\nSo a total of six items in the life cycle,\nright?\n\n538\n00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:59.560\nCreation of data,\ndistribution of data, use of data,\n\n539\n00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.732\nmaintenance regarding data, so the up\nkeep of data, disclosure, disposition.\n\n540\n00:26:04.732 --> 00:26:07.260\nThese are the six stages of\nthe information life cycle.\n\n541\n00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.590\nJust wanna make sure we understand\nwhat's going on with all of them.\n\n542\n00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.960\nWe also wanna make sure we understand\nwhat and who an information owner is.\n\n543\n00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.060\nThe information owner is the entity\nthat is ultimately responsible for\n\n544\n00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:23.690\nthe disposition of data, meaning\nthe permissions assigned, the user rights\n\n545\n00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:27.590\ngiven, and what is done with the data\nin terms of how it is classified.\n\n546\n00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.330\nThat is all in the wheelhouse.\n\n547\n00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.070\nAll under the purview,\nunder the direct control and\n\n548\n00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.070\nresponsibility of the information owner.\n\n549\n00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.730\nWant to make sure we understand that and\nknow that as well.\n\n550\n00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:39.810\nWe've talked about data classification,\ndata categorization,\n\n551\n00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.400\nwhy these things are important.\n\n552\n00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.310\nWant to remind ourselves\nthe classification is a way that we can\n\n553\n00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:48.480\neffectively specify what level\nof protection data should get.\n\n554\n00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.280\nShould it be top secret, should be eyes\nonly, should be publicly available,\n\n555\n00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.860\nfor official use only?\n\n556\n00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.490\nIt's about the appropriate level\nof clearance that data should be\n\n557\n00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.770\nbasically ascribed to so when users see\nit, they're gonna match up to it, and\n\n558\n00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:05.010\nthey're gonna only be able to see it\nif they're cleared at that level.\n\n559\n00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:10.650\nCategorization is the idea of depending on\nthe kind of data, understanding the impact\n\n560\n00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:14.180\nresulting from the loss of confidentiality\nwhere the data to be exposed.\n\n561\n00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.190\nWhat is the impact of data loss,\nin other words,\n\n562\n00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.360\nis what we're thinking about\nwhen we categorize data.\n\n563\n00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:21.930\nSo we'll want to understand that whether\nit's confidentiality, integrity, or\n\n564\n00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.970\navailable that is lost and compromised,\nwe do want to understand all of that.\n\n565\n00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.520\nAnd that's what\ncategorization is all about.\n\n566\n00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.370\nSo we want to make sure\nwe're thinking about that.\n\n567\n00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:32.800\nWe also want to be thinking about\nretention periods and schedules,\n\n568\n00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.330\nwhen we managing data,\nwe have to make sure from a security\n\n569\n00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.710\noperations standpoint, we don't keep\ndata any longer than we need to,\n\n570\n00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:41.540\nbut we also make sure that we\nkeep it as long as we need to.\n\n571\n00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:44.690\nDon't want to go back and look for data\ntwo years from now that's supposed to be\n\n572\n00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:48.200\nthere for five and find out it was\ndeleted 30 days after we created it and\n\n573\n00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:49.250\nwe don't have a back up of it.\n\n574\n00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.490\nThat would be bad.\n\n575\n00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:53.530\nSo we violated the retention schedule,\nif that's the case.\n\n576\n00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:57.560\nMonitoring retention schedules, making\nsure that we keep a hold of data for\n\n577\n00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:58.780\nas long as we need to.\n\n578\n00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:02.080\nBut we get rid of data when\nthe retention period is expired so\n\n579\n00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.000\nwe no longer have the liability\nof owning it is very important.\n\n580\n00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.880\nWant to make sure we're\naware of that as well.\n\n581\n00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:11.370\nAnd we want to finish up our\ndiscussion in this area, talking about,\n\n582\n00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:15.350\na mechanism that we have mentioned before,\nsomething that's very important,\n\n583\n00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:18.280\nsomething known as an SLA,\na Service Level Agreement.\n\n584\n00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:21.850\nService level agreements are gonna be\neffectively contractual documents.\n\n585\n00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:25.920\nThey bind us as customers to our\nprovider that is providing a good or\n\n586\n00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.510\na service and they are in mutual\nagreement that allows for and stipulates,\n\n587\n00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:33.920\nlays out what the expectations on\nboth sides of that solution are.\n\n588\n00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.770\nThe service provider will say I'm gonna\nprovide a good or a service to you.\n\n589\n00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:40.440\nI'm gonna make sure it's available during\nthese times for this amount of time\n\n590\n00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:45.430\nunder these conditions and that as the\ncustomer you then can expect this from me.\n\n591\n00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:48.030\nThe customer side is I'm gonna\npay this amount of money.\n\n592\n00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:51.130\nI'm gonna follow these rules if I\nhave to escalate a server's problem.\n\n593\n00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.800\nI'm gonna follow this reporting\nmechanism in other words.\n\n594\n00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.950\nAnd if something goes wrong and\nMr. and Mrs.\n\n595\n00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:00.400\nService Provider, you can't fix it in the\nagreed upon time, then these penalties or\n\n596\n00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.310\nthese issues are then gonna become\npart of what we have to discuss.\n\n597\n00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:07.001\nYou may have a give back,\nmaybe some sort of a credit for\n\n598\n00:29:07.001 --> 00:29:09.819\nservice things of that nature can occur.\n\n599\n00:29:09.819 --> 00:29:13.790\nSo SLA's are very important because they\nare contractual vehicles that help us\n\n600\n00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:16.370\nessentially to manage\nservice expectations.\n\n601\n00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:19.020\nNow you may also have\nsomething known as a OLA\n\n602\n00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:22.730\nas well as a PLA although\nthey're not really as common,\n\n603\n00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.790\nwe should probably just define and talk\nabout what they are for just a minute.\n\n604\n00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:30.820\nSo SLA's are Service Level Agreements,\nOLAs, Operational Level Agreements.\n\n605\n00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.680\nThese are internal facing SLAs.\n\n606\n00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.180\nSLAs are traditionally between an external\nservice provider outside the business and\n\n607\n00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.100\nthe business itself.\n\n608\n00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:43.560\nThe IT arm of the business is gonna\nsign off on it or ultimately, engage,\n\n609\n00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.980\nand the SLA is the customer\nrepresenting the business.\n\n610\n00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:52.040\nEven though sometimes legal signs off,\nHR may get involved, central purchasing,\n\n611\n00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:56.410\nultimately it's the business that is the\ncustomer, and the service provider that\n\n612\n00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:59.990\nare contracting, and a representative of\nthe business represents the business and\n\n613\n00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.900\nsigns off on the SLA.\n\n614\n00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.165\nSo that's an external agreement.\n\n615\n00:30:03.165 --> 00:30:09.034\nIn OLA, an Operational Level Agreement,\nthere's gonna be an internal facing SLA.\n\n616\n00:30:09.034 --> 00:30:13.095\nIt is between the IT function of the\nbusiness and different business units for\n\n617\n00:30:13.095 --> 00:30:17.347\nconsumption of services, like provisioning\nof email, provisioning of VOIP,\n\n618\n00:30:17.347 --> 00:30:18.770\nthings like that.\n\n619\n00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:23.540\nSo when you have different business units\nthat centrally consume IT services and\n\n620\n00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.640\nyou have what's known\nas a charge back model,\n\n621\n00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.370\na model that effectively charges them for\nIT services.\n\n622\n00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:31.210\nYou may use OLAs to\nstipulate how that works and\n\n623\n00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:33.240\nthose first internal facing SLAs.\n\n624\n00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:37.040\nAnd then you may have what's known\nas a PLA, a Privacy Level Agreement.\n\n625\n00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.880\nThese are relatively new, really brought\non by the advent of cloud computing and\n\n626\n00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:45.660\nthe idea there is that when we have\na PLA we are focusing on privacy and\n\n627\n00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.530\nthe agreement on the expectation\nof how to manage privacy, and\n\n628\n00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:51.430\nthe privacy requirements that\nare necessary to safe guard data.\n\n629\n00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.450\nThis is known as a PLA.\n\n630\n00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:55.330\nSo I just want to make sure we\nunderstand the different kinds\n\n631\n00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.380\nof levels of agreements, right,\nthat may actually be stipulated and\n\n632\n00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.200\nbe found as we're talking\nabout secure operations.\n\n633\n00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:01.940\n>> Very good and\n\n634\n00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:06.250\nwe got a lot of great information there\ntalking about secure operations concepts.\n\n635\n00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:09.120\nRemember if you guys want to\nattend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n636\n00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.150\nshoot us an email at See Adam@itpro.tv.\n\n637\n00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.250\nSigning off for\nthis one

--> 00:00:17.270\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.120\nToday we're doing our CISSP content.\n\n5\n00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.835\nAnd specifically we're gonna be\nlooking at resource or asset, oh,\n\n6\n00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:27.340\nI wanna get the right there,\nresource protection techniques.\n\n7\n00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.870\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon, how's it going Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.090\n>> Good, good, my assets and my resources\nboth feel that they are protected.\n\n9\n00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.870\nYou covered both ends\nof that conversation.\n\n10\n00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.230\nSo we're going to talk a little bit\nabout resource protection techniques.\n\n11\n00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.130\nA little bit of a shorter conversation in\nthe sense that we're just focusing on this\n\n12\n00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.630\none topic, really just drilling down\nhere a little bit for a few minutes.\n\n13\n00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.440\nWe're gonna broaden our discussion\nin some of the other episodes.\n\n14\n00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.320\nBut for this area,\n\n15\n00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.030\nwhen we think about resource\nprotection techniques we're really\n\n16\n00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.860\nthinking about how do we approach the\nprotection of media that's storing data?\n\n17\n00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.040\nHow do we approach\nthe protection of hard copies?\n\n18\n00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.100\nWe don't often think these days about\nwriting something down on a piece of\n\n19\n00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.140\npaper, putting it somewhere and\nstoring it,\n\n20\n00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.810\nand having to worry about confidentiality\nor integrity associated with that.\n\n21\n00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.220\nBecause so\nmuch of what we do today is digital.\n\n22\n00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.280\nIn other words, it's bits and bytes on\na computer, we put a file somewhere but\n\n23\n00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.170\nrealistically the file is electronic.\n\n24\n00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.280\nBut today, just like it's been probably\nforever, we still write things down.\n\n25\n00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.410\nAnd so\nwe have to think about both soft and\n\n26\n00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.430\nhard copies when it comes to asset\nprotection, at least in terms of data.\n\n27\n00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.800\nWe also obviously have to think\nabout protecting hardware.\n\n28\n00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.330\nSo there's a lot of different\nareas that we focus on.\n\n29\n00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.970\nWe think about soft copy media,\nwe're thinking about optical drives, we're\n\n30\n00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.520\nthinking about magnetic media, solid state\nmedia today is becoming more popular.\n\n31\n00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.630\nYou may have data on an SD card,\nfor instance, right?\n\n32\n00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.805\nYou have to think about, or worry about,\nthinking about protecting that.\n\n33\n00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:50.950\nAnd SD cards may be, and they are,\n\n34\n00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.680\nrelatively small, they can be secreted\nalmost everywhere or anywhere.\n\n35\n00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.000\nThey're in your phone for instance,\nthey're gnna be in, potentially,\n\n36\n00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.350\ncomputers, depending on the kind\nof systems you have and\n\n37\n00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.480\nhow you're setting up\nyour systems to boot.\n\n38\n00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.677\nA lot of virtualized hosts these days are\ngonna be able to be run off of SD cards.\n\n39\n00:02:06.677 --> 00:02:09.230\nSo VMware for instance, will install or\n\n40\n00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:14.420\nat least allow support the installation\nof ESXI onto SD cards inside the servers.\n\n41\n00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.815\nAnd then you can effectively\nboot from an SD card,\n\n42\n00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:18.990\nan SD card is all of about\nthis big on average.\n\n43\n00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.460\nSo putting something like into play and\n\n44\n00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.470\nworry about securing that can present some\nchallenges just from a space perspective.\n\n45\n00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.930\nI mean, if you think about the fact\nthat in reality we're talking about\n\n46\n00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.880\nsafeguarding physically something\nthat is about this size, right?\n\n47\n00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.790\nAnd may even be, I don't know,\nsomething like about oh, that size.\n\n48\n00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.777\nIf I keep going I can make a swan,\nby the way.\n\n49\n00:02:39.777 --> 00:02:42.061\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm very good at that kind of stuff.\n\n50\n00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:44.860\n>> A little origami [CROSSTALK]\n>> Studied origami with the master in\n\n51\n00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.430\nJapan.\n\n52\n00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.175\nI am now the origami queen and\nking all in one.\n\n53\n00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:49.710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n54\n00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.278\nthe reality is we're talking about very,\nvery small physical devices.\n\n55\n00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:57.060\nAnd so in that case, suddenly just\nliterally getting lost could be\n\n56\n00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.807\nthe biggest issue we have to worry about.\n\n57\n00:02:58.807 --> 00:03:01.488\nBecause it falls out of a device,\nwe don't realize it's there,\n\n58\n00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:03.975\nit's small enough that somebody\nmay not realize what it is,\n\n59\n00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.497\nthey may pick it up and\nthrow it away, not understanding it.\n\n60\n00:03:06.497 --> 00:03:10.005\nSo we have to think about that as well\nas the fact that we have to safeguard\n\n61\n00:03:10.005 --> 00:03:11.970\nthe data on the actual device.\n\n62\n00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.931\nThe data stored on the SD device\nis also gonna be obviously\n\n63\n00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:18.153\npotentially critical for us,\nit could be mission critical.\n\n64\n00:03:18.153 --> 00:03:21.344\nIt could have confidentiality,\nintegrity concerns associated with it.\n\n65\n00:03:21.344 --> 00:03:25.190\nPaper, microfiche concerns\nwith regards to hard copies.\n\n66\n00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.511\nTalked about microdots and\n\n67\n00:03:26.511 --> 00:03:29.969\nhow they were used to secret information\nin regards to steganography.\n\n68\n00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.138\nOne of our prior conversations\nin another episode.\n\n69\n00:03:32.138 --> 00:03:35.362\nMicrofiche may be something that some\nof you out there just don't really have\n\n70\n00:03:35.362 --> 00:03:36.790\na point of reference for.\n\n71\n00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.740\nYou may not understand because\nit is older technology.\n\n72\n00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.527\nIt is something that literally\nis a generational thing.\n\n73\n00:03:43.527 --> 00:03:45.198\nSo are rotary phones I guess, right,\n\n74\n00:03:45.198 --> 00:03:48.800\nbecause that's also something you may\nnot realize existed at some point.\n\n75\n00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.790\nBut the reality is you just may not have\na point of reference for this technology\n\n76\n00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.670\nbecause it's not something you may\nactually come across at a regular basis.\n\n77\n00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.800\nBut we used to at a certain point,\nand we still do, but\n\n78\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.240\nyou don't really see it\nin many organizations.\n\n79\n00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.110\nYou see it in libraries if you go and\nlook up referenceable material,\n\n80\n00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.040\nyou will certainly see it in certain\norganizations that store records this way.\n\n81\n00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.430\nBut the reality is,\nmicrofiche is basically film.\n\n82\n00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.910\nAnd when I'm talking about film, I'm\ntalking about the kind of film we would\n\n83\n00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.380\nuse in theory, not to take pictures,\nper se, but a different kind of film.\n\n84\n00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.970\nIt is a clear sheet of film that we use,\nand\n\n85\n00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.608\nwe store information that has\nbeen photographed onto it.\n\n86\n00:04:25.608 --> 00:04:29.009\nIt's reduced down so\nit is gonna be effectively shrunken, and\n\n87\n00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.342\nyou can put a lot of information on,\nmaybe a two by two square or\n\n88\n00:04:32.342 --> 00:04:35.572\nsomething like that, or\nfour by four sheet of microfiche.\n\n89\n00:04:35.572 --> 00:04:40.175\nAnd you need microfiche reader which\nis really just a large device,\n\n90\n00:04:40.175 --> 00:04:43.657\nkind of a box-like device\nwith a glass plate on it.\n\n91\n00:04:43.657 --> 00:04:46.371\nIt shines a light up from\nunderneath ,or a light from on top,\n\n92\n00:04:46.371 --> 00:04:47.768\ndepending on how it's set up.\n\n93\n00:04:47.768 --> 00:04:50.867\nAnd it's really just a large magnifying\nglass that's kind of set up so\n\n94\n00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:54.490\nthat you can see what's on the microfiche\nand understand what's there.\n\n95\n00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.770\nSo you would need this kind of\ntechnology to access the data.\n\n96\n00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.294\nBut the reality is, you could easily\nfigure out how to do that by putting\n\n97\n00:05:01.294 --> 00:05:03.597\na piece of microfiche in\nfront of a projector.\n\n98\n00:05:03.597 --> 00:05:07.076\nIf it's displayed at a certain distance,\nthe projector will actually then throw up\n\n99\n00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:09.310\non the wall what's on\nthe microfiche as well.\n\n100\n00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.110\nSo safeguarding the physical media can\nbe sometimes a bit of a challenge.\n\n101\n00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.660\nWe have to lock this stuff up,\nnot only in a secure place,\n\n102\n00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.300\nbut we have to worry about environmental\nconcerns with regards to storage.\n\n103\n00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.660\nIf it's too hot,\nthe microfiche can be damaged.\n\n104\n00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.080\nIt it's too wet and there's mold or things\nof that nature that come into play because\n\n105\n00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.820\nof humidity, we could damage the\ninformation, damage the storage medium.\n\n106\n00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.410\nSame thing with paper records obviously,\nclearly water and\n\n107\n00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.270\npaper, never a good idea.\n\n108\n00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.430\nFire and paper, not a good idea\nunless you invite water to the party.\n\n109\n00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.660\nIn which case, it's actually a really\ncool concept, fire, water, paper.\n\n110\n00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.740\nYou have yourself a little messy party but\nit's kinda fun.\n\n111\n00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.630\nBut the reality with these kinds\nof physical media concerns are we\n\n112\n00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.381\nhave as many environmental concerns,\nas we have physical security concerns.\n\n113\n00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:55.339\nAnd we don't tend to think a lot about\nthat with some of the other stuff.\n\n114\n00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:59.215\nBecause you take, like I probably do,\nI know you do, I have thumb drives sitting\n\n115\n00:05:59.215 --> 00:06:02.135\nin my car that are probably been\nthere since I bought the car.\n\n116\n00:06:02.135 --> 00:06:04.990\nI never take them out, they just sit\nthere cuz every so often I need one.\n\n117\n00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.000\nSo I always have one or two there in case\nI'm stuck somewhere and I have it, and\n\n118\n00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.440\ntherefore I can use it for\nwhatever I need.\n\n119\n00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.560\nThose things sit and bake in the sun,\nmaybe 120 degrees in the car,\n\n120\n00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.465\n130 in the middle of summer\nwhen it's parked somewhere.\n\n121\n00:06:17.465 --> 00:06:22.240\nCuz I do live in the armpit of the United\nStates of America and it's wet and\n\n122\n00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.470\nhumid all the time.\n\n123\n00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.470\nAnd so the reality is that for\n\n124\n00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.790\nthat kind of stuff,\nwe just don't even think about it.\n\n125\n00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.290\nWe just take it for granted that\nstuff will be there and it's okay.\n\n126\n00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.600\nAnd indeed it normally is, right?\n\n127\n00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.820\nI mean it's not, in reflection,\nwhen I think about, it's not a good idea,\n\n128\n00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.340\nit's not a best practice.\n\n129\n00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.130\nI wouldn't want to put something on\nthere that I was worried about losing\n\n130\n00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.380\nirretrievably and leaving it in\nthe car for two years to bake.\n\n131\n00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.150\nBut the reality is it's still\nprobably gonna be okay.\n\n132\n00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.730\nThe same thing with a paper file,\nin theory.\n\n133\n00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.130\nIf I leave it in the car, nothing's going\nto happen to it unless somebody comes and\n\n134\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.330\nsmashes the window and takes it for me.\n\n135\n00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.005\nBut physically,\nit's perfectly fine sitting in the heat,\n\n136\n00:06:55.005 --> 00:06:56.741\nit's really not gonna have a problem.\n\n137\n00:06:56.741 --> 00:06:59.890\nBut when we think about the fact that,\nin data centers,\n\n138\n00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.385\ntoo much heat is really the biggest enemy\nwe have, as well as too much humidity.\n\n139\n00:07:04.385 --> 00:07:06.800\nAnd so we have to be thinking\nabout these things and\n\n140\n00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.770\nenvironmental concerns with regards to\nthe safe operation of electronic media,\n\n141\n00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.900\nis also gonna be very important for us.\n\n142\n00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.530\nSo we wanna think about not\njust environmental concerns,\n\n143\n00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.000\nnot just physical concerns.\n\n144\n00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.330\nBut as we've always talked about, how\ndo we safeguard the data on the device?\n\n145\n00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.860\nCertainly encryption, number one thing\nwe're often gonna always think about.\n\n146\n00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.640\nEncrypting during transit, encrypting at\nrest, encrypting potentially during use.\n\n147\n00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.810\nWe have to have applications\nthat support encryption.\n\n148\n00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.090\nThese are all gonna be\nimportant things to consider.\n\n149\n00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.450\nWant to think about cloud storage,\nwe have to deal with the issues and\n\n150\n00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.640\nconcerns of data in the cloud.\n\n151\n00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.190\nMay not be directly within our purview,\n\n152\n00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:43.985\nour security perimeter to defend, we're\ngonna rely on a vendor to do this for us.\n\n153\n00:07:43.985 --> 00:07:47.685\nSo now we have to worry about\ncontractually making sure the vendor's up\n\n154\n00:07:47.685 --> 00:07:52.115\nto the task with the focus on due care,\ndue diligence responsibilities.\n\n155\n00:07:52.115 --> 00:07:54.595\nHave to make sure we\ndetail out in our SLAs,\n\n156\n00:07:54.595 --> 00:07:58.535\nas we've talked about in some of our prior\ndiscussions, what the expectations are.\n\n157\n00:07:58.535 --> 00:08:01.624\nAnd we have to make sure we\nhave a focus on the operational\n\n158\n00:08:01.624 --> 00:08:05.507\nspecifics of security when we're giving or\ntransferring the risk and\n\n159\n00:08:05.507 --> 00:08:08.427\nthe liability to manage\nyour data to another party.\n\n160\n00:08:08.427 --> 00:08:12.440\nIn this case to a third party vendor,\ntypically a cloud service provider.\n\n161\n00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.240\nWe may also include managed\nsecurity services providers,\n\n162\n00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.980\nwhat are called MSSPs in that mix.\n\n163\n00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.990\nThey might not be cloud providers\nin the traditional sense.\n\n164\n00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.215\nThey simply may be a managed service\ncompany that we're gonna contract with to\n\n165\n00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:27.109\ncome in and manage our security,\nour data on-prem.\n\n166\n00:08:27.109 --> 00:08:30.908\nBut they're gonna be an outsource vendor\nthat effectively will take over management\n\n167\n00:08:30.908 --> 00:08:32.720\nof that particular system for us.\n\n168\n00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.690\nSo again, we wanna think about that,\nwanna be aware of that.\n\n169\n00:08:35.785 --> 00:08:39.530\nCloud-based storage concerns, as we've\ntalked about, data certainly, is it\n\n170\n00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:44.025\nsecure, is it encrypted when it's stored,\nis it encrypted when we're accessing it?\n\n171\n00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:48.470\nSo data in transit, data at rest,\nalso data in use encrypted there.\n\n172\n00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.050\nIs the network secure?\n\n173\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.850\nAre the devices secure?\n\n174\n00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.830\nAre the APIs, the software interfaces\nthe vendor provides, are they secure?\n\n175\n00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.690\nIn general in other words,\nsame conversation but\n\n176\n00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:03.320\nsimply stop, in your mind, stop at\nthe border internally in your network and\n\n177\n00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.570\nsay okay, this is me without cloud.\n\n178\n00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:10.210\nRemember those commercials years ago for,\nhey, say no to drugs and all that stuff?\n\n179\n00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.780\nRemember the ones about\nthis is your brain?\n\n180\n00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.927\nThis is your brain on drugs, right?\n\n181\n00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:13.475\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n182\n00:09:13.475 --> 00:09:16.572\n>> The guy would crack the eggs in\nthe pan, fry your brain up, right?\n\n183\n00:09:16.572 --> 00:09:20.320\nKinda graphic, right, but\nthe reality is, think about it this way.\n\n184\n00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.170\nThis is your network without cloud, right.\n\n185\n00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.440\nSo your security perimeter\nstops at the edge of the LAN,\n\n186\n00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:29.780\nthe border of the LAN WAN,\nwhich is basically your gateway, right?\n\n187\n00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.192\nYour network on cloud,\nI was about to say your brain on cloud.\n\n188\n00:09:32.192 --> 00:09:33.843\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Your network on cloud,\n\n189\n00:09:33.843 --> 00:09:37.578\nright, is gonna be everything that\ngoes not up to the LAN WAN border, but\n\n190\n00:09:37.578 --> 00:09:40.830\nactually goes out through\nthat border to the provider.\n\n191\n00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:46.460\nBecause in effect, the cloud is now\ngoing to be the operational environment.\n\n192\n00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.640\nAnd it is ubiquitous as we know,\nit's everywhere.\n\n193\n00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.170\nRight, it's remotely accessible,\nit's scalable, it's resource pooled, and\n\n194\n00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.420\nit is metricized or measured for use.\n\n195\n00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.810\nAll of these things are defining\ncharacteristics of the cloud.\n\n196\n00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:01.560\nSo the advantage of that is,\nyour data is everywhere.\n\n197\n00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.190\nThe downside to that is,\nyour data is everywhere.\n\n198\n00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.838\nAnd so as a result of that, we have to\nthink about the fact that the border that\n\n199\n00:10:07.838 --> 00:10:11.315\nwe now have to worry about defending\nis not one that's well demarcated,\n\n200\n00:10:11.315 --> 00:10:13.828\nnot one that we understand and\nwe control directly.\n\n201\n00:10:13.828 --> 00:10:17.180\nBut rather, one that we stand out and\nlook on the horizon towards.\n\n202\n00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.290\nAnd we see that it is literally\never moving back from us,\n\n203\n00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.880\nevery time we try to get close\nto it it's further away.\n\n204\n00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:27.978\nBecause the cloud provider is managing,\nif not all, almost all the infrastructure.\n\n205\n00:10:27.978 --> 00:10:31.839\nAnd certainly all of the data that is\nplaced on that infrastructure is held by,\n\n206\n00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:34.520\nand ultimately managed by,\nthe cloud provider.\n\n207\n00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.490\nSo we do need to think about this and\nbe concerned about this as well.\n\n208\n00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:41.390\nWe have to think about virtualized\nstorage, software defining storage and\n\n209\n00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.410\nvirtualizing it.\n\n210\n00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.800\nOur cloud-related concepts that we have\nto understand as security professionals.\n\n211\n00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.717\nWhether it's host-based storage,\ndevice-based storage,\n\n212\n00:10:49.717 --> 00:10:52.590\nwhether we use a NAS,\na network attached storage device.\n\n213\n00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.420\nWe may use a SAN, storage area network.\n\n214\n00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.768\nWe may have virtual SAN which is\neffectively a local storage pool.\n\n215\n00:10:59.768 --> 00:11:03.120\nA RAID 5 array that's created\nthrough multiple local hard drives\n\n216\n00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.530\nacross multiple hosts.\n\n217\n00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.250\nThere's different ways to do this.\n\n218\n00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.710\nSome of it may be specific to us and we\ncontrol, again some of it may be external\n\n219\n00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.630\nto us and maybe provided across\nthe network by a vendor.\n\n220\n00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:14.790\nWe have to think about this.\n\n221\n00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.360\nWhat about archival and offline storage?\n\n222\n00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.830\nAgain, we may have long-term storage\nrepositories that are being used and\n\n223\n00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:23.640\nwe have to worry about data that is there.\n\n224\n00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.310\nBut they're not being\nused in the same way.\n\n225\n00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.165\nWe're storing long-term retention\ndata there, right, 7, 8,\n\n226\n00:11:29.165 --> 00:11:32.488\n12-year retention cycles\nwhere we're not really gonna\n\n227\n00:11:32.488 --> 00:11:36.688\ngo to the data very often if at all,\nafter it's been marked for archiving.\n\n228\n00:11:36.688 --> 00:11:39.150\nBut we are gonna have to keep it,\nwe are gonna have to audit it.\n\n229\n00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.600\nSo every year we kinda go there,\nwe check to see who's accessed the data,\n\n230\n00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.210\nwhat condition it's in.\n\n231\n00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.710\nIs the encryption still strong enough,\nare all the attributes still in place,\n\n232\n00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:48.930\nis everything okay?\n\n233\n00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.440\nWe'll do a quick sanity check,\nif you will, on the data.\n\n234\n00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.400\nBut we're probably not\ngonna use it very often.\n\n235\n00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.130\nIt's like a deep freeze, right?\n\n236\n00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:57.860\nIn that respect,\nthe data has to be secured but\n\n237\n00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.770\nit's gonna have to be secured with\nslightly different protections and\n\n238\n00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:04.360\nthought processes cuz we're not in and\nout of there on a daily basis.\n\n239\n00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.840\nSo while auditing and\naccounting, authentication,\n\n240\n00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.170\nauthorization are all important,\nwe're not gonna exercise that very often.\n\n241\n00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:14.955\nSo we have to have additional controls\nthat are monitoring that system to insure\n\n242\n00:12:14.955 --> 00:12:17.665\nthat if somebody does knock on\nthat door and try to get in,\n\n243\n00:12:17.665 --> 00:12:19.147\nwe're alerted immediately.\n\n244\n00:12:19.147 --> 00:12:22.875\nBecause there's so little activity\nthat whoever goes there, really,\n\n245\n00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:24.350\nwe have to pay attention to.\n\n246\n00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:28.460\nBecause chances are good, if they're going\nthere out of a normal business cycle,\n\n247\n00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.880\naround typically in audit\npreparation to check the data,\n\n248\n00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.940\nthen there may be a concern there, right.\n\n249\n00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.170\nBecause otherwise somebody's gotta go\nthrough a sign out process to check in and\n\n250\n00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:38.130\ncheck out that data.\n\n251\n00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:41.040\nAnd if they're not following that,\nthey're probably up to no good.\n\n252\n00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.540\nSo we have to think about archival and\noff-line storage as well.\n\n253\n00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.230\nRecord management,\nin general, very important.\n\n254\n00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:50.540\nHow do we do record and information\nmanagement, how do we engage in those\n\n255\n00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.380\nactivities, how do we audit for\naccess, how do we audit for compliance?\n\n256\n00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:56.390\nThese are all concerns of ours.\n\n257\n00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.610\nAlso, disposal and\nreuse with regards to data,\n\n258\n00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.930\nwe've spoken a lot about this and\nsome other thought areas,\n\n259\n00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.170\nother areas in knowledge that\nwe've discussed in other episodes.\n\n260\n00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.480\nWe've talked about data remnants,\n\n261\n00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.160\ndata that's being left behind after\nwe clean and clear a solution.\n\n262\n00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.330\nSo if we simply override a drive one time,\nwe can assure ourselves, and\n\n263\n00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.120\nI can assure you,\nthat data will be left behind.\n\n264\n00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.200\nBecause the data that is there is not\nnecessarily being destroyed or deleted.\n\n265\n00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.850\nThe file allocation table\nthat tells us where the data\n\n266\n00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.780\nis on the drive is being reset.\n\n267\n00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.980\nBut the reality is the data still\nlives there in the sectors and\n\n268\n00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.580\nthe clusters on the drive\nthat it was assigned to.\n\n269\n00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:36.210\nWe just may not have realization of it\ncuz we don't see a record of it anymore.\n\n270\n00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:37.380\nThat doesn't mean the data's not there,\n\n271\n00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.510\nit just means that we can't tell\nit's there using traditional tools.\n\n272\n00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:43.240\nWe have to use special tools that\ncan go in at a low level and\n\n273\n00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.300\nfind the data and\nthen show us what's there by mapping it.\n\n274\n00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:49.420\nSo disk recovery and\ndata recovery tools can be used here.\n\n275\n00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.419\nSo we have to think about this.\n\n276\n00:13:50.419 --> 00:13:52.795\nMedia destruction,\nhow do we destroy media?\n\n277\n00:13:54.105 --> 00:13:56.955\nReally, the only traditional way to\nget rid of media that is safe and\n\n278\n00:13:56.955 --> 00:14:01.565\nbeyond reproach is to effectively\nmelt the media and liquefy it, right?\n\n279\n00:14:01.565 --> 00:14:04.795\nThrow it in a furnace,\nit's gotta be high enough temperature,\n\n280\n00:14:04.795 --> 00:14:07.175\nhot enough to be able to\neffectively melt metal.\n\n281\n00:14:07.175 --> 00:14:10.555\nIf it does that,\nthe data's essentially gone, right?\n\n282\n00:14:10.555 --> 00:14:13.599\nThink of the idea of putting\nit into a gas furnace or\n\n283\n00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:17.668\nsomething that burns at a thousand,\ncouple of thousand degrees.\n\n284\n00:14:17.668 --> 00:14:20.831\nAnd like you see on those documentaries\nwhere they take the steel out or\n\n285\n00:14:20.831 --> 00:14:22.935\nthe gold out or\nsomething they're smelting.\n\n286\n00:14:22.935 --> 00:14:25.575\nAnd they pour it out of\nthe big holding bin, and\n\n287\n00:14:25.575 --> 00:14:28.950\nall of a sudden it's just\nlike liquid stream of metal.\n\n288\n00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.079\nThat's what we're thinking about.\n\n289\n00:14:30.079 --> 00:14:31.619\nIf you can do that to a hard drive,\n\n290\n00:14:31.619 --> 00:14:35.207\nthen we can pretty confidently say\nthere's nothing you're gonna recover.\n\n291\n00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:37.966\nBut if you don't do that,\nif you shred the drive,\n\n292\n00:14:37.966 --> 00:14:42.234\nif you use a hammer mill to beat it to\npieces, if you drill holes in it, I mean,\n\n293\n00:14:42.234 --> 00:14:46.400\nthese are all things that can be done,\nreality is there may be pieces left.\n\n294\n00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.910\nI'm not saying it's gonna be easy,\n\n295\n00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:50.940\nI'm not saying you're gonna have\na complete solution to work with.\n\n296\n00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:54.440\nBut there may be fragmentary pieces\nof the platters that are left,\n\n297\n00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.230\neven if you take the platters out and\netch them.\n\n298\n00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.570\nAnd people do all sorts of crazy things.\n\n299\n00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.048\nWhatever you do, if you don't destroy\nthe platters, and it's not the actual hard\n\n300\n00:15:02.048 --> 00:15:04.896\ndrive, it's the platters inside\nthe drive we're worried about.\n\n301\n00:15:04.896 --> 00:15:06.540\nIn the case of a solid state drive,\n\n302\n00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.470\nit's the actual memory that's storing\nthe information within the drive.\n\n303\n00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.670\nThe drive casing itself, the electronics,\nwe don't care about those,\n\n304\n00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:14.800\ngive them to a hacker.\n\n305\n00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:18.054\nTake the platters out, give those\nto a hacker, they've got some fancy\n\n306\n00:15:18.054 --> 00:15:21.702\npaperweights, maybe some cool things to\nmake arts and crafts projects out of.\n\n307\n00:15:21.702 --> 00:15:23.595\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> They can go to the local county fair,\n\n308\n00:15:23.595 --> 00:15:25.110\nmaybe open a little booth.\n\n309\n00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.360\nYou know, art by hack,\nsomething like that.\n\n310\n00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.960\nWhatever it is but\nit's not gonna do them any good,\n\n311\n00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.090\nyou're not gonna give\nthem any information.\n\n312\n00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.360\nWhat you need to really safeguard\nare the platters that store the data\n\n313\n00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.950\nbecause that's really what we need.\n\n314\n00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:42.330\nThe rest of the stuff's just effectively\nhousing, protective and access, right?\n\n315\n00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:44.060\nYou're using electronics to read the data.\n\n316\n00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.620\nBut the electronics that\nare used to read the data don't\n\n317\n00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.960\nretain any data when\nthe drive is powered off.\n\n318\n00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.010\nSo the reality is,\nit's all on the platters.\n\n319\n00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:54.650\nSo first of all, we could strip the drive\ndown, obviously, focus on that.\n\n320\n00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:59.190\nBut out beyond that, if we just take those\nplatters and try to destroy them without\n\n321\n00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:03.830\nreally, totally getting rid of everything\nthat makes the platter itself readable,\n\n322\n00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.860\nwe're still gonna leave data behind,\nis the point.\n\n323\n00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.490\nSo we do need to understand that.\n\n324\n00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.380\nWhat about software that's\ninstalled on a system?\n\n325\n00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:11.360\nThere may be data associated with that.\n\n326\n00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.360\nIf we uninstall software,\nare we truly getting rid of all the data?\n\n327\n00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.947\nHow many times have you\nseen those pop-ups,\n\n328\n00:16:15.947 --> 00:16:18.387\nalthough they're not as often today,\nnot as prevalent in Windows.\n\n329\n00:16:18.387 --> 00:16:21.997\nBut years ago, if you remember, you\nwould uninstall a software product, and\n\n330\n00:16:21.997 --> 00:16:25.115\nit would say, hey, there's all\nthese DLLs that seem to be shared,\n\n331\n00:16:25.115 --> 00:16:28.090\nthey seem to be pretty important,\nWindows is using them.\n\n332\n00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.810\nBut we think you should delete them.\n\n333\n00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:30.702\nWhat do you think, right?\n\n334\n00:16:30.702 --> 00:16:32.434\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You would get that prompt that would\n\n335\n00:16:32.434 --> 00:16:35.290\nbasically say, yeah, do you want\nto get rid of these things or not?\n\n336\n00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:38.420\nAnd you didn't know what to do because the\nsystem was basically saying, hey it looks\n\n337\n00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.510\nlike we need these things, but we may\nneed to get rid of them just, because.\n\n338\n00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.230\nAnd so you would often say no\nbecause you didn't know any better,\n\n339\n00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.650\nyou wouldn't know whether or\nnot they're imported.\n\n340\n00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:53.170\nAnd so you would leave behind a lot\nof additional junk that ultimately,\n\n341\n00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.760\nover time, would pile and may or\nmay not be important, may or\n\n342\n00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.360\nmay not be prevalent, may or\nmay not be a security liability, but\n\n343\n00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.080\nclearly was potentially gonna\nprove to be a challenge over time.\n\n344\n00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.360\nThat may not be the same\nthing as leaving data behind.\n\n345\n00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.850\nBut the reality is, there may have been\ndata associated with that installation or\n\n346\n00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.720\nuninstallation that also was not removed.\n\n347\n00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.897\nAnd so we have to be thinking about all\nthese kind of things when we're thinking\n\n348\n00:17:14.897 --> 00:17:19.110\nabout how we're going to use protection\nmechanisms to safeguard media.\n\n349\n00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.175\nThis is gonna be the kind of\nconversation that in our mind\n\n350\n00:17:22.175 --> 00:17:24.470\na CISSP is gonna wanna have.\n\n351\n00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.650\nAnd ultimately,\na CISSP is responsible for it.\n\n352\n00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:28.180\nSo you remember,\n\n353\n00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:32.170\nwe've talked about, and I've stressed to\nyou in many of our discussions together,\n\n354\n00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:36.510\nit's the CISSP's responsibility to\nfocus the business on these risks.\n\n355\n00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.580\nWe may not have all the answers, but\nit's our responsibility to drive\n\n356\n00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:44.250\nthe conversation and ultimately frame\nthe questions that will lead to solutions.\n\n357\n00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:47.760\n>> Very good Adam, a great look at how\nwe can employ our resource protection\n\n358\n00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:52.270\ntechniques across a wide variety of\nmedia that we've gotta consider.\n\n359\n00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:56.090\nAll right, remember, if you guys want\nto attend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n360\n00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:00.380\nall you gotta do is shoot us an email,\nSeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n361\n00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.150\nThat being said,\nwe're gonna sign off for now.\n\n362\n00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.896\nI'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n363\n00:18:02.896 -->

--> 00:00:17.202\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.202 --> 00:00:20.488\nToday we're doing our CISSP content.\n\n5\n00:00:20.488 --> 00:00:22.126\nAnd specifically, in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:24.645\nwe're gonna be looking at\nincident management, right?\n\n7\n00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:27.524\nSomething that we really hope\nwe don't have to do, but\n\n8\n00:00:27.524 --> 00:00:30.654\nthe reality is we probably will\nif we're in it long enough,\n\n9\n00:00:30.654 --> 00:00:34.140\nand it's very important that\nwe understand how to do it.\n\n10\n00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.140\nBefore we get to that situation and here\nto help us with that is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.210\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.060\n>> Good, good.\nSo\n\n13\n00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.130\ncould we classify an incident as being\nyou're about to introduce a topic but\n\n14\n00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.600\nyou screwed up and we have to do\nit again in order to get it right?\n\n15\n00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.340\nThat-\n>> I think so.\n\n16\n00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.992\n>> Could actually be an incident, right,\n\n17\n00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:51.915\nthat could be something we wanna\nmanage and perhaps have a response to?\n\n18\n00:00:51.915 --> 00:00:53.960\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm just saying that could happen.\n\n19\n00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.530\nNot that it happens here but\nit could happen at some point.\n\n20\n00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.350\n>> They would never know.\n\n21\n00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.110\n>> They would never know that,\nthat's true, but unless we told them.\n\n22\n00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.085\nBut we would never do that.\n\n23\n00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:04.050\nCuz then they would know and\nwe wouldn't want that to happen.\n\n24\n00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.400\nAll right, so incident response.\n\n25\n00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.095\nLet's talk about incident\nresponse a little bit.\n\n26\n00:01:07.095 --> 00:01:11.800\nSo as CISSPs, as security professionals,\nwe wanna make sure\n\n27\n00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.020\nthat as Mike pointed out, right,\nall kidding aside, things will happen.\n\n28\n00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.230\nWe have to understand that on occasion,\nwhen we are dealing with concerns,\n\n29\n00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.620\nwe may actually want to, or dealing\nrather with just general issues and\n\n30\n00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.160\nthings that are going on day to day,\nmoment to moment in terms of management,\n\n31\n00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.640\nthat at certain points in time, hopefully\na lot of points in time, things go well.\n\n32\n00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.040\nBut there are gonna be points in\ntime where things don't go so well.\n\n33\n00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.230\nThings are gonna happen.\n\n34\n00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.230\nWe're gonna have some sort of a problem,\nsome sort of an incident, an event.\n\n35\n00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.730\nHopefully it's not catastrophic.\n\n36\n00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.200\nWe have disaster recovery and\nbusiness continuity concerns that we'll\n\n37\n00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.970\nat some point get into that help us\nunderstand how to deal with those things,\n\n38\n00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.250\nif those events occur.\n\n39\n00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.630\nBut generically, when we do have some sort\nof an incident, an event that occurs that\n\n40\n00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.790\nhas a negative impact in our world,\nit's called an incident.\n\n41\n00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.770\nWhen we have an incident that occurs,\nwe can't just randomly decide we're gonna\n\n42\n00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.070\ndeal with it in a certain way this time\nand maybe a different way the next time.\n\n43\n00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.593\nAs a CISSP, as a security professional,\nwe have to have a plan,\n\n44\n00:02:08.593 --> 00:02:12.703\nwe have to be prepared, and we have to\ngo then execute the plan when there's\n\n45\n00:02:12.703 --> 00:02:15.350\nan incident that calls for our attention.\n\n46\n00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.870\nAnd so, incident management is\nreally all about incident response.\n\n47\n00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.950\nReally all about formulating that plan,\n\n48\n00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.260\npracticing to understand what that plan\nentails, being prepared, in other words.\n\n49\n00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.660\nAnd then, if called upon,\n\n50\n00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.745\nbeing able to be confident in executing\nwhatever the plan or the response may be.\n\n51\n00:02:30.745 --> 00:02:34.595\nAny kind of incident response is\nreally about identifying a problem,\n\n52\n00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:37.295\nso understanding what the issue or\nconcern is.\n\n53\n00:02:37.295 --> 00:02:39.665\nDetection, in other words,\nis gonna be crucial.\n\n54\n00:02:39.665 --> 00:02:44.665\nDetermining cause, so root cause analysis\ntraditionally, things like that.\n\n55\n00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.945\nMinimizing damage, so\nhow are we gonna prevent the issue or\n\n56\n00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:52.105\nthe concern from having anything other\nthan the immediate impact that's already\n\n57\n00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:55.180\nbeen effectively inflicted\non the organization.\n\n58\n00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.378\nResolving the problem, and then ultimately\nas we do that, documenting each step.\n\n59\n00:03:00.378 --> 00:03:03.310\nSo we wanna make sure that\nin our minds generically\n\n60\n00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.980\nwe're thinking about this kind of thought\nprocess I just shared with you, right.\n\n61\n00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.080\nDetect, determine, minimize,\nresolve, and ultimately document.\n\n62\n00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.710\nThese are gonna be the five critical\ncomponents of incident response.\n\n63\n00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.800\nSo we have all sorts of ways\nwe can go about doing this.\n\n64\n00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.070\nWe may have a group of individuals\nthat are trained with special skills\n\n65\n00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.570\nthat help us to come in and\nforensically examine, talked\n\n66\n00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.860\na little bit about forensic examination,\nrules of evidence, chain of custody,\n\n67\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.555\nthe approaches we use in some of our\nprior conversations in earlier episodes.\n\n68\n00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:35.510\nWanna make sure we understand\nthat incident handling and\n\n69\n00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.114\nresponse has three distinct\nphases associated with it.\n\n70\n00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:42.850\nThere're gonna be triage, kind of,\nif you think about triage,\n\n71\n00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.790\nwe're thinking about getting in there,\n\n72\n00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.100\nassessing early on, figuring out\nthe extent of the concern and the damage.\n\n73\n00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.750\nAssessing whether or not and measuring\nwhether or not the damage is catastrophic.\n\n74\n00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.540\nIt is gonna be painful,\nbut we can survive.\n\n75\n00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.830\nIt is minimal.\n\n76\n00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.220\nIt's really just nothing,\nwe don't have to worry about it.\n\n77\n00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.280\nSo detection,\n\n78\n00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.780\nidentification, notification, these are\nactivities that take place during triage.\n\n79\n00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.270\nInvestigation is the secondary phase,\ntakes place after triage.\n\n80\n00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.930\nAnalysis, reaction, recovery,\ncontainment, tracking,\n\n81\n00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.430\nthese are all actions that take\nplace in the investigative phase.\n\n82\n00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.250\nDuring recovery, last phase, we're gonna\nget the business back up and running,\n\n83\n00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.730\nget things back to normal.\n\n84\n00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.830\nReally try to deal with whatever the\noutcome or the fallout of the incident is.\n\n85\n00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.500\nSo triage, investigation,\n\n86\n00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.600\nrecovery are the three distinct handling\nphases that we concern ourselves with.\n\n87\n00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.970\nAnd as security professionals, we have\nto think about activities that go on\n\n88\n00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.360\nin each of these phases,\nit will be very important.\n\n89\n00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.940\nWe think about attack detection,\nwe're often thinking\n\n90\n00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.890\nabout some thing that may happen to us\nthat's blatant, that's obvious, right?\n\n91\n00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.470\nSomebody comes along, breaks through\nthe front door of the office and\n\n92\n00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.070\nthen comes and\nsteals our servers and runs away.\n\n93\n00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.800\nIt's pretty obvious that detection\nis involved there in the sense that\n\n94\n00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.420\ndetection means hey, when somebody drives\nthrough the front of the building and\n\n95\n00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.940\nis running through your data center,\nright, with servers under each arm.\n\n96\n00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.960\nRemember the bionic man, right,\nthe Six Million Dollar Man years ago?\n\n97\n00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.920\nWe can make him stronger, we can make\nhim quicker, I'm running in place,\n\n98\n00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:13.660\nlook at that circle.\n\n99\n00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.840\nDo that again, I'm running in place.\n\n100\n00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.563\nIt's so awesome, right.\n\n101\n00:05:15.563 --> 00:05:19.081\nSo you can see I'm running in place, and\nby the way, I've also got my cool socks.\n\n102\n00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:21.937\nYou can't really see the pattern too\nwell today, but they are the orange and\n\n103\n00:05:21.937 --> 00:05:22.478\nblue colors.\n\n104\n00:05:22.478 --> 00:05:23.360\n>> Nice,\na little gameshow color going [CROSSTALK]\n\n105\n00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.181\n>> Yeah, a little gameshow\n\n106\n00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:24.927\ncolor going on there.\n\n107\n00:05:24.927 --> 00:05:25.508\n>> There you go.\n\n108\n00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:26.646\n>> So that's kind of neat.\n\n109\n00:05:26.646 --> 00:05:30.405\nSo when you're running through the data\ncenter with the servers under each arm,\n\n110\n00:05:30.405 --> 00:05:32.463\nit would probably be\nmore like one of these.\n\n111\n00:05:32.463 --> 00:05:34.797\nYou've got one server doing one of\nthese to keep people out the way.\n\n112\n00:05:34.797 --> 00:05:37.201\nHeisman Trophy pose, right, so-\n>> There you go.\n\n113\n00:05:37.201 --> 00:05:38.954\n[LAUGH]\n>> When you're doing that kind of stuff,\n\n114\n00:05:38.954 --> 00:05:40.160\nattack detection is obvious, right?\n\n115\n00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.900\nSomebody's driven through the front door.\n\n116\n00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.870\nThere is one or more unknown people\nrunning through your data center.\n\n117\n00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.410\nThere's probably something going on,\nright, you need to pay attention to that.\n\n118\n00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.460\nBut the reality is that it\nmay not be obvious, right.\n\n119\n00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.900\nWe may have malware.\n\n120\n00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.850\nWe may have somebody that's\ninflicting an attack surreptitiously.\n\n121\n00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.610\nThey've back doored one or more systems.\n\n122\n00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.360\nThey are remotely accessing them but\nthey're under our radar.\n\n123\n00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.550\nWe're not really seeing them.\n\n124\n00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.890\nWe're not aware of the fact\nthat they are there.\n\n125\n00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.400\nRecently we just heard over the last\nfew days about a series of different\n\n126\n00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.410\nkinds of attacks and concerns, one of them\nhaving to do with Juniper, huge network\n\n127\n00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.660\nsupplier of security related products,\nespecially router switches, router gear.\n\n128\n00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.280\nAnd the issues and concerns they have\nwith potentially now being identified\n\n129\n00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:27.450\na master backdoor that may have been\nplaced into their software on their\n\n130\n00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.170\nequipment that could allow in theory,\na bad actor not only to gain access but\n\n131\n00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.790\nto decrypt all the data flowing\nthrough their devices in real time.\n\n132\n00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:40.870\nAnd as a result potentially of access to\nany device that ran this software for\n\n133\n00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.570\nat least three years according to\nthe early returns on these reports.\n\n134\n00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.790\nAnd this can affect not just\nbusinesses but clearly anybody,\n\n135\n00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.910\nany organization that has\ndeployed this kind of technology.\n\n136\n00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.090\nSo it could be something that goes dormant\nand it stays hidden for a long time\n\n137\n00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.100\nthat we don't know about, it could be\nsomething that's in our face, right.\n\n138\n00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.464\nSo thinking about signature or\npattern matching is one of the ways\n\n139\n00:07:00.464 --> 00:07:04.695\nwe do attack detention techniques to be\nable to find and to capture this behavior.\n\n140\n00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:09.228\nThis is the classic let me update my\nmalware or anti-malware software, let me\n\n141\n00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:13.980\nupdate my antivirus software, I download\nthe latest signatures, I put them in.\n\n142\n00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.287\nThe engine goes through scans looking for\nevidence and\n\n143\n00:07:16.287 --> 00:07:18.130\nbehavior that matches the pattern.\n\n144\n00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.610\nWe could do protocol anomaly or\nstatistical anomaly based scanning or\n\n145\n00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.860\ndetection as well.\n\n146\n00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.700\nProtocol anomaly, why are we seeing\na protocol we've never seen before.\n\n147\n00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:32.576\nOur normal traffic patterns are HDTP,\nHDTPS, maybe some SNMP,\n\n148\n00:07:32.576 --> 00:07:39.240\nsome SMTP, some MTP, probably protocols\nlike that are pretty prevalent.\n\n149\n00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.890\nSo TCP, UDP based protocols, but we may\nnever see Protocol X and Protocol Y.\n\n150\n00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:45.636\nRight?\nAnd so\n\n151\n00:07:45.636 --> 00:07:49.267\nif all of a sudden we start seeing those\nprotocols, then that may be unusual.\n\n152\n00:07:49.267 --> 00:07:52.783\nAnd so these systems that do\nprotocol based anomaly scanning or\n\n153\n00:07:52.783 --> 00:07:56.897\ndetection are gonna create a baseline\nprofile of what normal behavior and\n\n154\n00:07:56.897 --> 00:07:58.500\nnormal traffic equals.\n\n155\n00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.700\nThey're gonna start flagging protocols.\n\n156\n00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.267\nThat are not part of that baseline.\n\n157\n00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:03.689\nThis is again something to think about.\n\n158\n00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:08.107\nStatistical anomaly based detection,\nsame idea, but instead of just looking at\n\n159\n00:08:08.107 --> 00:08:12.370\nprotocol traffic or protocols,\nwe're looking at the traffic flow overall.\n\n160\n00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.620\nHow much traffic from all locations\nto what locations, what IP addresses,\n\n161\n00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.460\nwhat MAC addresses, what are we using,\nwhat are the transmission mechanisms?\n\n162\n00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.830\nThings like that, we're gonna build\nagain a baseline of normal behavior.\n\n163\n00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.740\nThe longer these systems run,\nthe better they get at detecting anomalies\n\n164\n00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.720\nbecause the better they\nunderstand what normal equals.\n\n165\n00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.270\nRight, if I just really met you for\nthe first time and I said to you hey,\n\n166\n00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.720\ndo you know a lot about me?\n\n167\n00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.710\nYou're gonna say,\nwell no not really, we just met.\n\n168\n00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.010\nI don't know much about you.\n\n169\n00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.970\nBut if we spend a lot of time together,\nwe're gonna learn a lot more\n\n170\n00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.830\nabout each other just through the time\nwe spent talking and interacting.\n\n171\n00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.160\nAnd it's gonna be easier\nto answer that question.\n\n172\n00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.120\nAnd so the systems that run for long\nperiods of time, examining your traffic,\n\n173\n00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.980\nbuilding your baseline, are gonna be\na lot better at finding anomalies.\n\n174\n00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.080\nSo these programs,\nin other words have to be tuned.\n\n175\n00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.900\nThey have to be, what's called broken in.\n\n176\n00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.470\nWe often talk about a break in period with\nthese, where you have to run them for\n\n177\n00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.740\nseveral weeks, maybe even several\nmonths before they really get good.\n\n178\n00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.460\nAt understanding all the things that\npotentially are going on in the system.\n\n179\n00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:10.256\nSo just wanna be thinking about that.\n\n180\n00:09:10.256 --> 00:09:12.160\nWe have anti-malware, antivirus systems,\n\n181\n00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.020\nwe talked about these,\nhopefully have a sense of what they are.\n\n182\n00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.820\nHopefully you're running them,\nby the way, and\n\n183\n00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.095\nnot just running one; shouldn't you be\nrunning more than one of these, right?\n\n184\n00:09:20.095 --> 00:09:24.025\nThe problem with running a single\nantivirus and/or anti-malware program\n\n185\n00:09:24.025 --> 00:09:28.795\ntoday is that the signature files that are\nput up by the vendor may not be enough and\n\n186\n00:09:28.795 --> 00:09:29.985\nmay not be current enough and\n\n187\n00:09:29.985 --> 00:09:32.445\nbe updated enough to capture\neverything that's out there.\n\n188\n00:09:32.445 --> 00:09:35.285\nBecause not every vendor is\ngonna have a signature for\n\n189\n00:09:35.285 --> 00:09:38.725\nevery attack that exists, and\nthey may have different signatures for\n\n190\n00:09:38.725 --> 00:09:41.330\ndifferent derivatives or\nversions of that attack.\n\n191\n00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:42.940\nBecause malware can change.\n\n192\n00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.550\nWe have polymorphic viruses\nthat can effectively morph or\n\n193\n00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.430\nchange every time they execute.\n\n194\n00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.290\nAnd so there's a lot of things\ngoing on out there that\n\n195\n00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.140\none vendor by themselves may\nnot be able to keep up with.\n\n196\n00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.380\nThe recommendation in the Enterprise,\nthat you run at least two or\n\n197\n00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.610\nthree different programs, overlapping.\n\n198\n00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.450\nBecause chances are good,\nif you run two or\n\n199\n00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:03.242\nthree different vendors programs,\nbetween the three of them,\n\n200\n00:10:03.242 --> 00:10:07.350\nit's hghly likely that you will capture\nmost of the bad things that are going on.\n\n201\n00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.740\nSo you wanna be thinking\nabout that as well.\n\n202\n00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.290\nSo I don't know if you have any favorites.\n\n203\n00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:15.020\nI know ESET's a real good one,\nI'll often talk about and use that.\n\n204\n00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.770\nEverybody talks about Norton, everybody\ntalks about Symantec, everybody but\n\n205\n00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.450\nme, right?\n\n206\n00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.700\nBut everybody talks about those.\n\n207\n00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.710\nAnd certainly at an enterprise level,\nwithout specifying any vendor good or bad.\n\n208\n00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:31.120\nYou wanna have several different options\nbecause if only one option is there, aside\n\n209\n00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.730\nfrom the thing we just talked about which\nis do they have enough of the signature\n\n210\n00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:38.390\nfiles to really be relevant, we also\nhave a single point of failure concern.\n\n211\n00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.650\nOne vendor only, if that vendor either\nhas a problem and/or their software for\n\n212\n00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.010\nsome reason is deactivated.\n\n213\n00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.440\nAnd this is the other nasty\nside of malware today.\n\n214\n00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.958\nThere's malware and virus software out\nthere that specifically targets AV and\n\n215\n00:10:50.958 --> 00:10:55.550\nanti-malware systems,\nit will go after them and take them out.\n\n216\n00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.550\nIt's really just designed to do one thing.\n\n217\n00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:01.540\nThen there's other malware and viruses\ncoming behind that that are injected or\n\n218\n00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.700\ninserted in the system once\nthe defensive software is removed.\n\n219\n00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.520\nAnd as a result of that can\nthen infect the system.\n\n220\n00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:09.850\nSo this is a multi-pronged approach.\n\n221\n00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.130\nWe knock out the defenses, and\nthen we take over the system.\n\n222\n00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.770\nSounds like a battle plan for\ntaking over the Normandy Beach or\n\n223\n00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:16.658\nsomething like that, right.\n\n224\n00:11:16.658 --> 00:11:17.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're gonna go over there,\n\n225\n00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:19.510\ntake out that nest of machine guns.\n\n226\n00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.620\nThen we're gonna come behind you,\ndo a pincer move around to the right.\n\n227\n00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.520\nSo you'll think about the fact that we\nactually do have targeted software today\n\n228\n00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.490\nthat's designed really mission specific\nto take out defensive protections.\n\n229\n00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:34.630\nAnd this is not a new phenomenon,\n\n230\n00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.300\nbut this is a newer occurrence, and\nthis is becoming more prevalent.\n\n231\n00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.430\nAnd again, this is pretty\nhighly specialized software.\n\n232\n00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.650\nThis is pretty highly specialized stuff.\n\n233\n00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.090\nBut if you get infected with it,\n\n234\n00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.860\nit can be difficult,\nif not impossible, to remove it.\n\n235\n00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.090\nLot of these target system\nfunctionality at the root level.\n\n236\n00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:56.100\nYou may not even realize you've been\ninfected with it because the AV software\n\n237\n00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.750\nappears quote/unquote right to still work,\nbut it's controlled by the virus or\n\n238\n00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:04.650\nthe malware now and it will not\ndetect any of the system-altering\n\n239\n00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.020\nsoftware that it injects once\nit has taken over the system.\n\n240\n00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:12.370\nSo it's very, very scary and insidious\nwhen you think about the logic of let me\n\n241\n00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.320\ntake the system protection software out,\nbut then let me mimic its functionality\n\n242\n00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.630\nto make it look like it's still working so\nI effectively can control the strings.\n\n243\n00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:22.970\nThat's essentially what's going on.\n\n244\n00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.935\nSo Dr Evil is sitting somewhere\nwearing his ice caste right?\n\n245\n00:12:26.935 --> 00:12:27.660\nExactly you see.\n\n246\n00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:28.905\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> See Mike's got the laugh.\n\n247\n00:12:28.905 --> 00:12:30.495\nI could not do the laugh last time.\n\n248\n00:12:30.495 --> 00:12:31.795\nMike's got the laugh.\n\n249\n00:12:31.795 --> 00:12:33.155\nRight?\nSo we should have teamed up on that.\n\n250\n00:12:33.155 --> 00:12:34.285\nBecause you have the hand thing.\n\n251\n00:12:34.285 --> 00:12:35.945\nI could do the hand thing but\nMike had the laugh.\n\n252\n00:12:35.945 --> 00:12:37.125\n>> We could lip synch that in there.\n\n253\n00:12:37.125 --> 00:12:38.735\n>> We could do that it was pretty cool.\n\n254\n00:12:38.735 --> 00:12:41.375\nAll right, so next Halloween we got,\nwe know what we're doing.\n\n255\n00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.470\nSo we've talked about\nstem systems as well.\n\n256\n00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.820\nWe've talked about log management,\ncentrally controlling, aggregating logs.\n\n257\n00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.210\nWhy this is important.\n\n258\n00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:52.680\nLog management systems overall\nare gonna give us, as defenders,\n\n259\n00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.800\na lot of potential capabilities\nwith regards to incident response.\n\n260\n00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.490\nWe need to be looking at logs\nto find out what's gone on.\n\n261\n00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.550\nWe need to look at logs to\nunderstand the sequence of events,\n\n262\n00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.110\nthe timing of events, the general control.\n\n263\n00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.230\nAnd the overarching reach of events.\n\n264\n00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.740\nIn terms of what was done,\nwhat systems were potentially affected.\n\n265\n00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.440\nWhere traffic came from,\nwhere traffic was going to.\n\n266\n00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.340\nNow having said that,\n\n267\n00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.360\none of the things that's also very\nimportant to know about logs,\n\n268\n00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.460\nis that logs can be altered, and they can\nbe compromised, they can be manufactured.\n\n269\n00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.280\nSo one of the things we talk about a lot.\n\n270\n00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.956\nWhen I teach hacking classes we talk\nabout this, is the best way to cover your\n\n271\n00:13:28.956 --> 00:13:32.600\ntracks, if you're attacking somebody\nis to take out the log system.\n\n272\n00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.440\nSo that way, once you've done\nall the stuff you wanna do,\n\n273\n00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.020\nyou remove the logs on the way out\nthe door, and there's no record of that.\n\n274\n00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.400\nNow we've made it harder for\nyou to do that with centralizing log gate.\n\n275\n00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.630\nAnd shipping logs out to a central system.\n\n276\n00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:46.816\nBecause now you have to run that system.\n\n277\n00:13:46.816 --> 00:13:50.624\nFigure out where the central servers are,\nand you have to effectively crawl that\n\n278\n00:13:50.624 --> 00:13:53.368\nthat escalation chain to get\nback to the central servers,\n\n279\n00:13:53.368 --> 00:13:55.290\nand then remove them from the database.\n\n280\n00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.150\nIt's harder, it's not impossible,\nit's just harder to do.\n\n281\n00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:02.100\nBut one of the interesting things we\nalso talk about and teach you how to do\n\n282\n00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.640\nis that you can manufacture log files, and\ninject your own logs that are effectively\n\n283\n00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.860\naltered to represent the kind of behavior\nthat you want the defenders to see,\n\n284\n00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:13.360\nto think went on even though\nthat's not what went on.\n\n285\n00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.030\nBut you don't want them to see no logs\nbecause you know that if you wipe out\n\n286\n00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:21.960\nthe logs, yeah cover my tracks but there's\na big gaping whole of 30 minutes or\n\n287\n00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.620\ntwo hours of no activity,\nno log where you were in the system.\n\n288\n00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:26.360\nThey're gonna know.\n\n289\n00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.310\nI mean that's like a big spotlight sitting\nright there saying okay something went\n\n290\n00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.480\non here, we don't know what but\nguess what that's where the something is.\n\n291\n00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.350\nAnd they're gonna focus their energy\non figuring out what that is.\n\n292\n00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.550\nAnd you're probably not gonna\nget rid of all the evidence.\n\n293\n00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.630\nLet's be honest right?\n\n294\n00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.280\nWe know Locard's principle.\n\n295\n00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:45.180\nYou have the principle of\nexchange in criminal activity.\n\n296\n00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.910\nWe leave something, we take something.\n\n297\n00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:49.810\nChances are good you're\ngonna leave evidence behind.\n\n298\n00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.670\nSo blowing out the log files is\nkinda setting off a bomb and\n\n299\n00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:56.760\nhoping that the bomb obliterates\nthe majority of the evidence.\n\n300\n00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:02.970\nWhat actually makes more sense is not to\nuse a nuclear device to do damage control.\n\n301\n00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:07.940\nBut rather, to actually leave behind a or\naltered set of log files that if we done\n\n302\n00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.470\nproperly and are good enough will actually\nfool, sometimes, not all the time, but\n\n303\n00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:16.050\nsometimes fool the defenders into\nthinking that certain behavior or\n\n304\n00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.650\na certain activity took place in\ncertain areas when in fact, it did not.\n\n305\n00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.410\nAnd so this is a lot more difficult.\n\n306\n00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:24.660\nThis requires much more finesse,\nmuch more capability.\n\n307\n00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.300\nBut if you're good at what you do, right,\n\n308\n00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.380\nnumber one, you're never gonna\nbe seen in the first place.\n\n309\n00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.440\nAnd number two, you're not gonna\nleave behind a lot of evidence.\n\n310\n00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.648\nYou're gonna leave behind manufactured\nevidence that points people into different\n\n311\n00:15:35.648 --> 00:15:37.338\ndirections that you want them to go.\n\n312\n00:15:37.338 --> 00:15:40.600\nSo you can simply waltz out the door and\nnobody pays attention to you.\n\n313\n00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.920\nIt's this idea of hiding in plain\nsight that we often talk about.\n\n314\n00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:46.090\nSo, while log management\nsystems are critical.\n\n315\n00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.675\nAs a defender we have to look\nat them with a skeptical eye.\n\n316\n00:15:48.675 --> 00:15:51.787\nWe have to understand that\nthey could be compromised and\n\n317\n00:15:51.787 --> 00:15:56.088\nif we're not taking steps to insure\nthe safeguarding of information there,\n\n318\n00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:58.225\nwe have to validate the information.\n\n319\n00:15:58.225 --> 00:16:00.288\nIf we can't do that beyond\na reasonable doubt,\n\n320\n00:16:00.288 --> 00:16:03.656\nwe have to look at the reality of whether\nor not that information is accurate.\n\n321\n00:16:03.656 --> 00:16:07.150\nAnd we have to be aware of that and\nkind of be a little skeptical, ultimately,\n\n322\n00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.050\nat the end of the day.\n\n323\n00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.760\nJust be aware of that, obviously, think\nabout that. Containment strategies have to\n\n324\n00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.750\nbe thought through.\n\n325\n00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:15.470\nContainment strategies\nhave to be practiced.\n\n326\n00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:17.340\nI know that, a lot of times,\n\n327\n00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:22.250\nour first inclination when we walk up to a\ncrime scene, walk up to an incident scene,\n\n328\n00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:26.560\nis to take everything that's there in,\nmake sure we have a sense of it, but\n\n329\n00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.730\nthen we may start sitting down and\nworking with systems.\n\n330\n00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:31.325\nWe talked about the issues and\nconcerns around this.\n\n331\n00:16:31.325 --> 00:16:35.115\nWell, we have to train our first\ndefenders, our first responders,\n\n332\n00:16:35.115 --> 00:16:36.310\nthat are gonna be on the scene to do.\n\n333\n00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.080\nAnd by the way,\nnot just our first responders, but\n\n334\n00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.560\nalso all the information\nworkers in our system.\n\n335\n00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.800\nBecause what will often happen,\nis the system will get hacked.\n\n336\n00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.620\nAn individual user will figure\nout there's something wrong.\n\n337\n00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.440\nThey will take some steps to try\nto figure out what was going on.\n\n338\n00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.500\nHey, that's weird.\n\n339\n00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.690\nWhy do I have a skull and crossbones\non my screen that's laughing at me?\n\n340\n00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.220\nThat doesn't normally happen.\n\n341\n00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:57.610\nLet me see if I can fix that.\n\n342\n00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.930\nLet me do Ctrl + Alt + Del and\ngo to Task Manager and\n\n343\n00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.910\nrandomly start whacking services and\ntrying to get rid of that.\n\n344\n00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.170\nLet me see if I can restart my machine.\n\n345\n00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.890\nMaybe restarting it will clear it.\n\n346\n00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:10.020\nOh, I know, it's Windows,\nI should shut it off; because,\n\n347\n00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.530\nyou know, it normally does that.\n\n348\n00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.220\nAnd that's probably a new\nfeature in Windows, right?\n\n349\n00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.450\nThat's Windows, the Pirate Edition, right?\n\n350\n00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.590\nSo, we should shut that off for\nlike a minute or two.\n\n351\n00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:19.380\nRight?\nCuz\n\n352\n00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.920\nthat's what they normally tell us\nto do when we call the help desk.\n\n353\n00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.640\nOh, yeah, just shut it off and restart it!\n\n354\n00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.770\nSo, they'll shut it off and do that.\n\n355\n00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:27.340\nWell, what they just did,\neffectively, is prevented you,\n\n356\n00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:30.930\nwhen you finally get around to being told,\nor they get around to telling you and\n\n357\n00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:34.540\nyou get around to seeing it,\nthey've potentially wiped out evidence.\n\n358\n00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:35.940\nRight?\nBecause the malware that was\n\n359\n00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.680\nrunning may have been running in memory.\n\n360\n00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.280\nAnd by resetting the machine they may have\ncleared it until it comes back again.\n\n361\n00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.100\nBut they may have wiped out\nvaluable evidence along the way.\n\n362\n00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.330\nSo, what we want to do is broadly and\n\n363\n00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:50.850\nwidely disseminate information about\nhow to respond and how to act.\n\n364\n00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.180\nAnd it's not just about training\nthe security professionals,\n\n365\n00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.900\nit's about training everybody.\n\n366\n00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.100\nBecause, more often than not,\n\n367\n00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.122\nthe first responder is not gonna\nbe the security professional.\n\n368\n00:17:59.122 --> 00:18:02.470\nIt's gonna be the person who was actually\nusing the system that was targeted.\n\n369\n00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:05.900\nAnd they might not know anything\nabout what to do other than,\n\n370\n00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.950\nI did these things that I just described,\nand now nothing else is working.\n\n371\n00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.010\nSo, well, maybe I should call\nthe help desk now, right?\n\n372\n00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:17.020\nSo, what we wanna train them on is to make\nsure that they back away from the system\n\n373\n00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.340\nphysically as well as logically,\n\n374\n00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.520\nthe sense that their first\ninclination is not to do anything.\n\n375\n00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.160\nAs opposed to trying to fix our problem\nand let the professionals handle it.\n\n376\n00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:25.690\nRight?\n\n377\n00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:26.750\nBecause if we come in and\n\n378\n00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:30.810\nwe see there's an issue, then we can take\nsteps to safeguard the data that's there\n\n379\n00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.590\nthat can help us to understand what\nthat issue is and where it came from.\n\n380\n00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:37.030\nSo, want to make sure that we're thinking\nabout response, and how we can adjust or\n\n381\n00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.910\nappropriate that behavior and\nturn it to our advantage.\n\n382\n00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.270\nWant to make sure we're\nreporting on our findings.\n\n383\n00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.100\nVery important to think\nabout this as well.\n\n384\n00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.900\nTalked a lot about the need to\ncommunicate broadly and widely.\n\n385\n00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:51.100\nMaking sure that we understand that\nreporting is not just about internal\n\n386\n00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:55.180\nreporting to senior stakeholders, but\nit may also be about reporting externally,\n\n387\n00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.550\nto the media, to law enforcement,\nto partners, federation.\n\n388\n00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.630\nAll right?\nFederated partners.\n\n389\n00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.350\nVendors.\n\n390\n00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.530\nWe may have to tell them what's going on.\n\n391\n00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:07.360\nImagine being,\nbecause this person was fired ultimately.\n\n392\n00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.790\nBut imagine being the CIO or\nthe CTO at Target, right?\n\n393\n00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.690\nOne day before the breach.\n\n394\n00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.280\nYou're going on about your business,\nyou're all happy, right?\n\n395\n00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:22.170\nAnd then, all of a sudden you wake up\nthat next morning, you come to work and\n\n396\n00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.020\nyou're not so happy, right?\n\n397\n00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.050\nAnd you're not happy for\na long time, right?\n\n398\n00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:30.020\nAnd so, having to be that person, right?\n\n399\n00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.230\nAnd having to then talk to, not just the\ninternal stakeholders, the board, right,\n\n400\n00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:39.500\nthe shareholders, the senior decision\nmakers in the organization, but\n\n401\n00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.830\nhaving to deal with the media,\nhaving to deal with law enforcement,\n\n402\n00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.760\nhaving to deal with vendors,\nhaving to deal with partners,\n\n403\n00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.010\ngiving them a sense of what's going on,\nnot to mention customers, right?\n\n404\n00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.530\nMillions of customers,\n\n405\n00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:53.430\npeople whose information has\nbeen compromised and stolen.\n\n406\n00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.270\nThat's not a good place\nto find yourself in.\n\n407\n00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:58.110\nSo, reporting can imply a lot of things.\n\n408\n00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.230\nWhat we don't want to have happen\nis have an individual go out and\n\n409\n00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.258\nstart rambling on to the media.\n\n410\n00:20:03.258 --> 00:20:08.000\nRambling on to different entities outside\nthe organization without a clear message,\n\n411\n00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.820\nwithout a clear purpose, and\nwithout a direction of some kind.\n\n412\n00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:15.320\nSo, what you often see\nwhen these incidents occur\n\n413\n00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.350\nis that there will be multiple\nrepresentatives from different areas, but\n\n414\n00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.813\nyou're gonna have a spokesperson\nmore often that not, right?\n\n415\n00:20:21.813 --> 00:20:25.830\nSomebody who's kind of been given\nthe facts, who's told what to say, but\n\n416\n00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:30.900\nalso has practice talking to the media,\nis polished, looks professional.\n\n417\n00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:34.380\nWhenever you see these large scale\nincidents that occur, you tend to see,\n\n418\n00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.070\nespecially with law enforcement,\nright, you tend to see\n\n419\n00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.150\nthat a lot of the law enforcement\nofficials are standing there, right?\n\n420\n00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:43.660\nThe mayor, the governor, the head of\nthe police department, this person,\n\n421\n00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.670\nthat person.\n\n422\n00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:48.220\nBut you have one or two spokespeople\nthat will come up and speak and\n\n423\n00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:52.390\nkind of give the briefing and deal with\nthose concerns, answer those questions.\n\n424\n00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.460\nThey may call on some of those individuals\nto say something, to add something.\n\n425\n00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.190\nBut the general briefing is\ngiven by a representative,\n\n426\n00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:03.220\nsomebody who's been trained and who\nunderstands how to deal with the media and\n\n427\n00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.450\nis gonna say what needs to be said, but\nis not gonna get dragged down rabbit holes\n\n428\n00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:09.740\nabout giving out more\ninformation than they should.\n\n429\n00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:12.630\nThis is very important when we\nthink about reporting with regards\n\n430\n00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:13.860\nto incident response, right?\n\n431\n00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:17.250\nBecause we have to make sure that\nwe're not gonna give out information\n\n432\n00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.260\nthat can compromise an investigation.\n\n433\n00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:20.310\nWe don't wanna start rumors.\n\n434\n00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.430\nThey're not on purpose, but\n\n435\n00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.520\nwe just don't wanna give out information\nthat may not be accurate, in other words.\n\n436\n00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:28.517\nAnd we wanna make sure that the\ninformation we are giving out is gonna be\n\n437\n00:21:28.517 --> 00:21:32.130\nokay to discuss, but\nalso is gonna be appropriate to release.\n\n438\n00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:33.720\nAnd these are things to consider.\n\n439\n00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.760\nSo, wanna make sure when we're\nthinking of recovery, ultimately,\n\n440\n00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.010\ngetting back to normal.\n\n441\n00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:41.250\nThat we are eradicating any traces\nof whatever may have occurred, and\n\n442\n00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.600\nwe are restoring any and\nall affected systems.\n\n443\n00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.870\nAnd, of course, obviously,\nas a result of that, restoring any or\n\n444\n00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.258\nall affected capabilities.\n\n445\n00:21:48.258 --> 00:21:50.470\nSo, we wanna make sure we get back\nto normal, in other words, right?\n\n446\n00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.820\nSo, if we need to have a web server,\n\n447\n00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:55.130\nthen we need to make sure that web\nserver's functioning correctly.\n\n448\n00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:57.600\nWe need to make sure we can resolve and\nget to the web.\n\n449\n00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.810\nThese are all things that we, you would\nwant to make sure are gonna be intact.\n\n450\n00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.490\nWe need to also think about\nwhat's known as lessons learned.\n\n451\n00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.970\nIn project management speak,\nthis would be a post mortem, or\n\n452\n00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.840\na post implementation review, a PIR.\n\n453\n00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.220\nProject management speaks\nabout it differently.\n\n454\n00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.712\nBut the end of the day, we're really\ntalking about root cause analysis.\n\n455\n00:22:14.712 --> 00:22:17.720\nWe wanna make sure we understand\nwhat the true nature,\n\n456\n00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.610\nthe true purpose behind that\nparticular incident was.\n\n457\n00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.122\nThe reason why it occurred.\n\n458\n00:22:22.122 --> 00:22:24.960\nWe wanna know the how,\nthe when, the who, the what.\n\n459\n00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.130\nBut we really, ultimately,\nwanna understand the why.\n\n460\n00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.920\nWhy did this occur?\n\n461\n00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.500\nWhat was the root reason for this?\n\n462\n00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.520\nWas it a misconfiguration?\n\n463\n00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.070\nWas it operator error?\n\n464\n00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:37.130\nWas it going to be because\nwe were infected with\n\n465\n00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:41.200\na bad malware that came\nthrough on a scanned media?\n\n466\n00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.290\nWas it because the system\nhad been rooted by somebody?\n\n467\n00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.830\nWas it internal action?\n\n468\n00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:48.650\nThere's all these answers\nthat could go into the why.\n\n469\n00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:50.020\nWe wanna know what it was.\n\n470\n00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:55.110\nIf we keep asking why, iteratively,\nuntil we get down to what\n\n471\n00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:00.560\nwe call the root cause why,\nthe ultimate why.\n\n472\n00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:04.420\nI sound like the prophet of why here,\nright?\n\n473\n00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.740\nI keep asking why.\n\n474\n00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.170\nJust keep saying why, boys and girls,\nand everything will become right.\n\n475\n00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.490\nAll copacetic.\n\n476\n00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:15.040\nSo, the Japanese actually\nhave a methodology for this.\n\n477\n00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.520\nSpecifically, Toyota as a company\nhas a methodology for this.\n\n478\n00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.370\nIt's called the seven Ws.\n\n479\n00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.860\nAnd they use it to kind of drive\ntheir manufacturing process.\n\n480\n00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.700\nAnd they use it to understand\nhow to get to root cause.\n\n481\n00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.630\nIt's actually well-studied in\nindustrial engineering, and\n\n482\n00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.830\nit's a methodology that no matter how many\npeople have tried to reproduce, it's very\n\n483\n00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:38.045\ndifficult because the reality is getting\nthe root cause is very challenging.\n\n484\n00:23:38.045 --> 00:23:41.560\nBecause sometimes even though we ask\nthe question, we're really not able to\n\n485\n00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.830\nunderstand how to derive the answer,\nwhich is really what, ultimately, we need.\n\n486\n00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.960\nWhich is what caused this\nparticular event to occur?\n\n487\n00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.270\nWhy did it occur?\n\n488\n00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:50.680\nYeah.\nWe may come up with answers, but\n\n489\n00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.390\nthey may not be at the root, ultimately,\nat the bottom of what really occurred.\n\n490\n00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:56.181\nOr we may not be willing to go there,\nright?\n\n491\n00:23:56.181 --> 00:23:59.068\nPeople may just not be willing to\naccept responsibility, and say,\n\n492\n00:23:59.068 --> 00:24:02.472\nyeah, I'm the one who did that thing,\nand as a result, it's really my fault.\n\n493\n00:24:02.472 --> 00:24:03.602\nSo in the general thought process\nof how we do incident response,\n\n494\n00:24:03.602 --> 00:24:04.865\nwe're really just ultimately dealing\nwith events that are occurring.\n\n495\n00:24:04.865 --> 00:24:08.790\nBut we do want you to think about that and\ndo need you to understand that.\n\n496\n00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:13.140\nSo asking why, going through and asking\nwhy, it's relatively very important.\n\n497\n00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.050\nWe may also look at things like\nfailure mode and affects analysis.\n\n498\n00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.485\nWhat's called FMEA, it's another\napproach to get through root cause.\n\n499\n00:24:19.485 --> 00:24:24.260\nParental analysis, analysis, diagrams.\n\n500\n00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.640\nThese are all examples of potentially\nhow to get to root cause through\n\n501\n00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:32.100\nfault domain analysis and different\nsolutions that ultimately allow us to map\n\n502\n00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:37.020\nout the sequence of events and\ntrace them back to the origination point.\n\n503\n00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.358\nWhen they do outbreak studies for\n\n504\n00:24:38.358 --> 00:24:40.804\nviruses this is effectively\nthe methodology that's used.\n\n505\n00:24:40.804 --> 00:24:42.770\nWe trace back to patient zero.\n\n506\n00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:44.885\nAnd that's the idea,\nthat's root cause, ultimately.\n\n507\n00:24:44.885 --> 00:24:47.436\nSo we wanna make sure we\nunderstand that logic and\n\n508\n00:24:47.436 --> 00:24:49.689\nreally understand how that can impact us.\n\n509\n00:24:49.689 --> 00:24:52.926\nWe also need to think about problem\nversus incident management and\n\n510\n00:24:52.926 --> 00:24:57.190\nthe definition of what a problem is versus\nthe definition of what an incident is.\n\n511\n00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:00.570\nSo in the general thought process\nof how we do incident response,\n\n512\n00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:04.325\nwe're really just ultimately dealing\nwith events that are occurring.\n\n513\n00:25:04.325 --> 00:25:07.496\nBut the question becomes is it an event\nthat we've never seen before or\n\n514\n00:25:07.496 --> 00:25:09.280\nis it an event that we have seen before?\n\n515\n00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.398\nAnd if we have seen it before and it\nbecomes a repetitive event then why are we\n\n516\n00:25:12.398 --> 00:25:15.915\nresponding to it the same way we have been\nresponding to it before because ultimately\n\n517\n00:25:15.915 --> 00:25:18.360\nthe outcome is probably\ngoing to be the same?\n\n518\n00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.070\nSo, we have to differentiate between\nevents that have never occurred and\n\n519\n00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:23.550\nevents that are repetitive.\n\n520\n00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:27.880\nIncidents are events that we've never\nseen before, we don't have knowledge of.\n\n521\n00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.400\nThey effectively are occurring for the\nfirst time in the traditional definition.\n\n522\n00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.480\nA problem,\n\n523\n00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.070\nat least in the classic definition of\nwhat an incident versus a problem is.\n\n524\n00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:40.390\nA problem is classified as an incident\nthat has become systemic or is repetitive.\n\n525\n00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:44.430\nIn other words, it keeps recurring and\nit's grown up to become a problem.\n\n526\n00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:48.690\nSo incidents are things we've never\nseen before, first time events,\n\n527\n00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:52.220\nproblems are repetitive incidents that\nhave not really been root caused and\n\n528\n00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.525\nhave not actually been solved properly.\n\n529\n00:25:54.525 --> 00:25:57.625\nIn the sense we put a patch on them,\nwe think we dealt with them, but\n\n530\n00:25:57.625 --> 00:26:01.545\nthen in hindsight as we look at them\nlater, through analysis we see it keeps\n\n531\n00:26:01.545 --> 00:26:04.275\nreoccurring and as a result of\nthat we understand, hopefully,\n\n532\n00:26:04.275 --> 00:26:07.465\nif we do this right, we understand we\nhaven't really found the root cause and\n\n533\n00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:09.819\nwe have to keep drilling down\nto figure out what that is.\n\n534\n00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.500\n>> Very good, Adam.\n\n535\n00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:14.020\nIt's a great look at\nthat incident management,\n\n536\n00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:17.640\nsomething that we hope we don't have to\ndeal with but in reality we're going to.\n\n537\n00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:22.000\nNow we have a better understanding of how\nwe need to handle that to make sure we\n\n538\n00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.020\nminimize damage,\nhandle that situation properly.\n\n539\n00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:25.520\nThanks for that.\n\n540\n00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.260\nAnd remember

00:00:19.600\nI'm your host Mike Roderick,\ntoday we're doing our CISSP content,\n\n4\n00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.610\nand specifically we're gonna be\nlooking at how to operate and\n\n5\n00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.960\nmaintain our preventative measures, right.\n\n6\n00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.580\nWe've talked a lot about\nthe different preventative measures\n\n7\n00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.940\nthat we have available.\n\n8\n00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.300\nGotta make sure we're working those\nright and keeping them going.\n\n9\n00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.020\nSo here to help us with all that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.150\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.680\n>> Good, good.\n\n12\n00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.035\nWe're gonna talk a little bit\nabout preventative measures.\n\n13\n00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:44.280\nSo let's start by thinking about what\nit is we are looking to prevent, right?\n\n14\n00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.500\nBecause if we have preventive measures,\nand\n\n15\n00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.820\nwe're not sure what we're focusing them\non, then they might not be appropriate.\n\n16\n00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.660\nSo what we want to understand\nis; what are the concerns we may\n\n17\n00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.370\nhave as a security professional?\n\n18\n00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.310\nThat would force us or think us.\n\n19\n00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.010\nOr think us?\n\n20\n00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.030\nListen to me.\n\n21\n00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.280\nWould ask us to think about the ways\nin which we may have to actually use\n\n22\n00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.450\na preventative measure.\n\n23\n00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.780\nWhat we have to get good at as security\nprofessionals is understanding risk.\n\n24\n00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.760\nWe talked a lot about risk and\nwhy risk is important.\n\n25\n00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.940\nWe've talked about threats.\n\n26\n00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.200\nWe've talked about vulnerabilities.\n\n27\n00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.690\nWe talked about threat sources and\nthreat events.\n\n28\n00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.420\nAll, reminding you of all\nthis vocabulary yet again.\n\n29\n00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.880\nBecause it is important.\n\n30\n00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.620\nSo if we're focused on risk, and\n\n31\n00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.940\nwe're focused on vulnerability, then the\npreventative measures we have to be using\n\n32\n00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.080\nreally have to be tailored to help us to\nunderstand how to address those concerns.\n\n33\n00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.100\nThings like firewalls, for instance,\nwhich will be border gateway devices\n\n34\n00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.200\nthat will filter inbound and\nor outbound traffic.\n\n35\n00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.460\nLooking for IP address,\nMac address, protocol, port number.\n\n36\n00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.684\nThese are the kind of things that we\nuse to match traffic and allow or\n\n37\n00:01:44.684 --> 00:01:46.480\nto deny it through the firewall.\n\n38\n00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.940\nSo these are designed effectively,\nas we've talked about these devices,\n\n39\n00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.070\nto filter,\nto do examination of traffic flow.\n\n40\n00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.180\nWe've also talked about the fact that\nfirewalls can be either stateless or\n\n41\n00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.730\nstateful.\n\n42\n00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.620\nYou wanna remember the difference between\nthe two, making sure that we understand\n\n43\n00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.000\nthat firewalls can operate\nat the network layer,\n\n44\n00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.190\nthe application layer of the OSI model.\n\n45\n00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.980\nThey can be found in different places,\n\n46\n00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.260\nthey can have access to different\ninformation as a result of that.\n\n47\n00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.600\nAnd so we want to understand that\nservices, ports, protocols would obviously\n\n48\n00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.580\nbe things that we'd be looking at\nup near the application layer.\n\n49\n00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.530\nWhereas IP addresses, MAC addresses are\nthings we traditionally want to be looking\n\n50\n00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.144\nat down towards the network layer,\nand maybe even lower into\n\n51\n00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:27.075\nthe to the data link later if we're\nlooking at Mac addresses, right.\n\n52\n00:02:27.075 --> 00:02:30.055\nSo wanna be thinking about where\nthe device is, where it operates,\n\n53\n00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:34.425\nwhat kind of access to information it will\nhave as part of a preventative measure.\n\n54\n00:02:34.425 --> 00:02:38.815\nWe've also talked about IDSs,\nintrusion detection systems, IPSs,\n\n55\n00:02:38.815 --> 00:02:40.575\nintrusion prevention systems.\n\n56\n00:02:40.575 --> 00:02:43.680\nWe've spoken about whether they\nare network based or host based.\n\n57\n00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.320\nNetwork based devices will be effectively\ninstalled at flow points within\n\n58\n00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.260\nthe organizational flow of\ninformation in the routing path.\n\n59\n00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.510\nSo this will typically be a device\nof some kind that is installed\n\n60\n00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.410\nat a key choke point we wanna monitor\non the network or in the network.\n\n61\n00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.640\nAnd all the traffic will flow through\nthat device on its way to and\n\n62\n00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.290\nfrom wherever it's going.\n\n63\n00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.810\nIf it is a host based IDS or IPS,\nit's gonna be an agent based solution\n\n64\n00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.090\nthat will effectively allow us to\ninstall software on a single entity.\n\n65\n00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.850\nWe're traditionally\nthinking about servers,\n\n66\n00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.520\nnot really desktops in this regard.\n\n67\n00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.130\nNo reason we couldn't in theory put\nan IDS or an IPS on a desktop, but\n\n68\n00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.050\nthe traditional place we find them is on\nservers that we wanna monitor traffic\n\n69\n00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.500\nagainst, so web servers, email servers,\ndatabase servers, file and\n\n70\n00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.890\nprint servers tend to be the targets\nof this kind of monitoring,\n\n71\n00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.600\ncuz they tend to be\nthe targets of attacks.\n\n72\n00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.220\nThat's really where we wanna\nsee the behavior occurring.\n\n73\n00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.560\nSo we'll be putting a software agent of\nsome kind, a little program Onto a system.\n\n74\n00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.740\nWe will then be using that program to\ngather data about the information flow in\n\n75\n00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.960\nand out of that computer.\n\n76\n00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.784\nAnd then we're then going to ship that off\ninto a management solutions somewhere.\n\n77\n00:03:50.784 --> 00:03:54.380\nAnd aggregate the data and\nanalysis it, visualize it.\n\n78\n00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.150\nUse business intelligence to assess it and\nto look for patterns.\n\n79\n00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.570\nAlso to retain the data for\n\n80\n00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.830\na period of time so we can look back\nhistorically and see what's been going on.\n\n81\n00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.030\nSo these are the kind of\nactivities we would see there.\n\n82\n00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.390\nDifference between host based and\nnetwork based will be important for\n\n83\n00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.070\nyou to consider as well.\n\n84\n00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.730\nKeep in mind there are traditionally\ntwo ways we do IDS or IPS solutions.\n\n85\n00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.560\nWe can assign from network and host based.\n\n86\n00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.080\nThere are two ways we drive the engines\nthen after we do the analysis,\n\n87\n00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.700\nthe scanning and therefore\nthe pattern matching on our data.\n\n88\n00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.780\nWe could do pattern matching or\nwe could do anomaly detection.\n\n89\n00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.540\nPattern matching is\nthe idea of looking for\n\n90\n00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.710\nbehavior that matches certain signatures.\n\n91\n00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.020\nSo we can think of this much\nlike we would a antivirus or\n\n92\n00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.150\nanti malware software item where we\nare downloading signature file and\n\n93\n00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.950\nthen we are effectively looking for\nbehavior that matches that.\n\n94\n00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.390\nCall that pattern matching or\nsignature file detection.\n\n95\n00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.920\nWe then can also do anomaly detection.\n\n96\n00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.780\nAnomaly detection is much like\nwe talked about with protocol or\n\n97\n00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.990\nstatistical anomaly thought processes.\n\n98\n00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.700\nWhen we look at AV or\nmalware software, and\n\n99\n00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.770\nwe look at the idea that we can\ndevelop a base line effect.\n\n100\n00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.390\nWe understand what is normal, right?\n\n101\n00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.770\nAnd then when we know what's normal,\nwe then can know what is abnormal.\n\n102\n00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.790\nAnd if we understand what's abnormal or\nnot normal, We can see deltas or gaps, and\n\n103\n00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.240\nwe can then start zeroing in on that\nkind of traffic, and then identify it,\n\n104\n00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.130\nof course, and understand it as such.\n\n105\n00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.540\nSo, just want to think about that.\n\n106\n00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.928\nWant to think about the ways in\nwhich anomaly detection may work.\n\n107\n00:05:19.928 --> 00:05:22.415\nYour anomaly detection\nmay not look at anything.\n\n108\n00:05:22.415 --> 00:05:25.855\nSuspicious log ons during or\noutside of the normal log on period,\n\n109\n00:05:25.855 --> 00:05:28.935\nyou learn how to fail log on\nattempts at 2 in the morning when\n\n110\n00:05:28.935 --> 00:05:31.345\nwe don't normally see a lot of traffic\nwould potentially be an anomaly.\n\n111\n00:05:31.345 --> 00:05:33.535\nIt would raise a red flag.\n\n112\n00:05:33.535 --> 00:05:38.275\nWe may look at the use\nof certain protocols,\n\n113\n00:05:38.275 --> 00:05:42.205\nthe use of certain software,\nthe use of certain addresses.\n\n114\n00:05:42.205 --> 00:05:44.920\nAny or all of these things that\nmight normally not be the case.\n\n115\n00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.650\nWould stand out as red flags.\n\n116\n00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.160\nWe may see an account that supposed to be\ndormant, and not supposed to be used very\n\n117\n00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.270\noften, suddenly coming to life and\nhaving a lot of activity.\n\n118\n00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.850\nThis would also be something that\npotentially could be an anomaly.\n\n119\n00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.700\nWe may have multiple attempts\nto access restricted files,\n\n120\n00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.470\nthat are normally not accessed\nover the network, remotely, but\n\n121\n00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.460\nrather only locally would also\npotentially be an anomaly.\n\n122\n00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.350\nUnexplained system restarts or\nshutdowns could be anomalies, right?\n\n123\n00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.060\nThis could be malware infecting and\n\n124\n00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.190\nthen having to restart in order to\ngain control at a different level.\n\n125\n00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.940\nUnusual error messages.\n\n126\n00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.990\nTalk about this one, but then the reality\nis you look at messages that vendors give\n\n127\n00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.830\nyou today, and they're all unusual because\nthey make absolutely no sense to anybody.\n\n128\n00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.740\nSo that may or may not actually\nbe a good indicator of anomalies.\n\n129\n00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.620\nBut in general, suspicious behavior,\nanything out of the ordinary.\n\n130\n00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.180\nWould certainly be that.\n\n131\n00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.120\nIf you remember an oldie but a goodie,\n\n132\n00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.330\nwe'll reach back into the way\nback bag of geek lore and trivia.\n\n133\n00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.180\nDo you remember Back Orifice?\n\n134\n00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.160\nBack Orifice 2.0?\n\n135\n00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.182\nI think the second version?\n\n136\n00:06:42.182 --> 00:06:46.320\nThese were malware devices,\nhacking tools that you could get and\n\n137\n00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.730\nuse on the Internet years ago.\n\n138\n00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.130\nA lot of people would get back orifice and\n\n139\n00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.710\nthey would use it, because one of\nthe things you could do with it,\n\n140\n00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.000\nwas you could pop open\nthe CD-ROM tray on the machine.\n\n141\n00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.860\nYou know,\nit gave you remote control capability so\n\n142\n00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.440\nyou could do all sorts of stuff.\n\n143\n00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.180\nSo you know, you'd be sitting at work and\n\n144\n00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.670\nall of a sudden CD-ROM tray would\nstart popping out and going back in,\n\n145\n00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.326\nyou'd be like, all right,\nwho's playing games, right?\n\n146\n00:07:07.326 --> 00:07:08.770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because somebody's obviously\n\n147\n00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.220\nremoting into the machine and\ndoing stupid stuff.\n\n148\n00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.620\nSo, you know, that kinda stuff\nused to happen all the time.\n\n149\n00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.980\nPeople would flash, you know,\nscripts up on the screen,\n\n150\n00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.140\nthey would open a console window and\nput up, you know, messages like, hey,\n\n151\n00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.175\nwe're gonna shut your\nmachine down in five minutes.\n\n152\n00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:23.490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Or, ha, ha, I can see you.\n\n153\n00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.620\nYou know, stuff like that.\n\n154\n00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.800\nIt's stupid stuff that you\ncould do with these programs.\n\n155\n00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.990\nThis was just fun and games.\n\n156\n00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.190\nI'm not saying it was stupid.\n\n157\n00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.660\nClearly it was behavior that was obviously\nin the hands of a wrong individual.\n\n158\n00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.200\nA bad actor could very\nwell be catastrophic.\n\n159\n00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.550\nBut you could use these tools\nto do all sorts of things.\n\n160\n00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.370\nThat kind of behavior, right,\nwould be considered anomaly detection.\n\n161\n00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.350\nSo that's the kind of thing\nwe're thinking about.\n\n162\n00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:49.560\nWanna make sure that we understand that we\ncan do these kinds of detection solutions.\n\n163\n00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.719\nImplement them, use them on them,\non our networks internally.\n\n164\n00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:56.355\nAgain we may be stressed when we're\ngoing out to the cloud to try to provide\n\n165\n00:07:56.355 --> 00:08:00.051\nthe same level of protection because we\nnow have to extend the border of that\n\n166\n00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:02.355\nprotection All the way\nup to the Cloud Vendor.\n\n167\n00:08:02.355 --> 00:08:06.516\nThe reality is the Cloud Vendor's probably\nnot gonna give us access to their network,\n\n168\n00:08:06.516 --> 00:08:09.708\nso we now have to rely on the Cloud Vendor\nto do a portion of this heavy\n\n169\n00:08:09.708 --> 00:08:11.830\nlifting scanning and securing for us.\n\n170\n00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.812\nSo this can also prove to\nbe a bit of a challenge.\n\n171\n00:08:13.812 --> 00:08:16.812\nYou wanna be thinking about that,\nand understand that as well.\n\n172\n00:08:16.812 --> 00:08:18.930\nAlso, wanna think about the fact\nwe can monitor traffic,\n\n173\n00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.380\nand traffic anomaly detection,\ngenerically, is also important.\n\n174\n00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:26.120\nWhat kind of traffic, what volume, from\nwhere, to where, kind of hinted at and\n\n175\n00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.050\ntalked about this already,\n\n176\n00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.110\nbut just throwing that out there as well,\nso you can think about that.\n\n177\n00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.340\nWe wanna keep in mind the difference\nbetween IDSs and IPSs,\n\n178\n00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:36.880\nremembering that an IDS\nis a passive device.\n\n179\n00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.960\nAn IDS, in other words, can monitor,\nit can alert us that something's going on.\n\n180\n00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.220\nBut it cannot take action on it's own.\n\n181\n00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:47.270\nWe made a clear distinction between\nthe fact that alerting us that something\n\n182\n00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.390\nis happening saying, hey, pay attention\nthrough an event, in a log, through maybe\n\n183\n00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.790\na message that flashes on the screen,\nan alarm that's generated in the system is\n\n184\n00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:00.800\nnot action, and the same way that an IPS,\nan intrusion prevention system can do.\n\n185\n00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.500\nWhich is it can go out and reconfigure\na router, it can shut off a path.\n\n186\n00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.780\nIt can affect we change a protocol or\n\n187\n00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:12.490\na porter service setting in the firewall\nto block traffic things of that nature.\n\n188\n00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:16.420\nIt has advanced recovery and\nadvance response capabilities.\n\n189\n00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.818\nSo an IPS can go effectively and\ngo on the attack.\n\n190\n00:09:19.818 --> 00:09:22.740\nWhereas an IDS really is\njust gonna be passive,\n\n191\n00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.328\nit's gonna listen, it's gonna alert us but\nalerting is not action.\n\n192\n00:09:26.328 --> 00:09:27.160\nWe just wanna be clear,\n\n193\n00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.350\nnot in the sense that we are the finding\nit out with regards to IPSs.\n\n194\n00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:32.640\nSo alarms are important.\n\n195\n00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.970\nEvent alerts are important,\nlogging information is important.\n\n196\n00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.565\nBut let's be honest, how many of us\nactually pay attention to these things-.\n\n197\n00:09:41.565 --> 00:09:43.120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And that's the challenge.\n\n198\n00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.700\nSo we talk about the fact that with logs.\n\n199\n00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.200\nWhile logs are important,\nthere's a lot of information there.\n\n200\n00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.770\nThe reality is that most security\nprofessionals, they are a reactive device.\n\n201\n00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.750\nMeaning, we look at them after the fact\nand say, oh yeah, right there.\n\n202\n00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.420\nSure enough, there's the entry.\n\n203\n00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.830\nWe see that somebody had a bad entry.\n\n204\n00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.260\nA bad access attempt to 201, immediately\nfollowed by a good access attempt to 203.\n\n205\n00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.940\nLooks like somebody finally broke in.\n\n206\n00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.280\nWe could see evidence of it there.\n\n207\n00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.210\nIt will be there, but the problem is, we\nmay not look at it until after the fact.\n\n208\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.400\nThat's really one of the challenges.\n\n209\n00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:16.130\nSo we just wanna understand\nthat while logging, alarms, and\n\n210\n00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.480\nthese kinds of things we\ntalk about are valuable.\n\n211\n00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.855\nUnless we're paying attention\nto them in real-time,\n\n212\n00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:25.391\nthere really gonna only be a story that we\nread after the fact, look back on fondly,\n\n213\n00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:29.050\nand say yeah, well that's right, I see it\nthere, should have paid attention to it.\n\n214\n00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:30.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe next time.\n\n215\n00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.760\nSo we do know and we do wanna\nunderstand the things are happening.\n\n216\n00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.700\nWe may not be able to deal with\nwhat's happening until we actually\n\n217\n00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.940\nstart to focus and pay attention.\n\n218\n00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.895\nSo sensors and control mechanisms that\ngenerate alerts, I'm thinking about things\n\n219\n00:10:43.895 --> 00:10:49.052\nlike and ICS systems now, where we're\ngonna have a lot of these inline sensors,\n\n220\n00:10:49.052 --> 00:10:53.042\na lot of these alerting mechanisms,\nthat are remotely monitoring,\n\n221\n00:10:53.042 --> 00:10:57.079\nare gonna really need to be paid\nattention to in these environments.\n\n222\n00:10:57.079 --> 00:11:00.120\nAnd there's a different thought process,\na different methodology there.\n\n223\n00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.650\nBecause these are out on the fringe\nperiphery of our networks or\n\n224\n00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.390\nof the control areas and\nthey are monitoring in real\n\n225\n00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:09.476\ntime what's happening and there are no\nhuman beings around looking at this stuff.\n\n226\n00:11:09.476 --> 00:11:14.940\nWhen they report back and an alert goes\noff, an alarm goes off, a red siren starts\n\n227\n00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.732\ngoing off or whatever it is, operators\nthat pay attention to this stuff.\n\n228\n00:11:18.732 --> 00:11:20.840\nBecause they've been trained\nthat if that happens,\n\n229\n00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.150\nmaybe there's a pressure\nbuild up in pipe system.\n\n230\n00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.325\nMaybe there is a need to\ndo an emergency event.\n\n231\n00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:29.937\nMaybe there is a pipe that will be\ncompromised, maybe its leaking.\n\n232\n00:11:29.937 --> 00:11:33.760\nThese are the kind of things that sensors\nwill typically be programmed to tell us.\n\n233\n00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.890\nAnd so, in those areas, alarms and\nsignals are very, very important.\n\n234\n00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.810\nAnd we have to think about the fact\nthat it's not just the response\n\n235\n00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:42.170\nin a computer network.\n\n236\n00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.860\nBut it can be the response and\nthe monitoring that takes place\n\n237\n00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.040\nin a physical control system\nthat is reported back.\n\n238\n00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.296\nThink about alarms that go off, and\nagain this behavior we see all the time,\n\n239\n00:11:52.296 --> 00:11:56.106\nthink about when you have a fire\nalarm that goes off in the building.\n\n240\n00:11:56.106 --> 00:12:00.080\nIf you're in a common building,\nan office building, got lots and lots and\n\n241\n00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:04.116\nlots of people, if the alarm goes off,\nunless you been told that is a drill,\n\n242\n00:12:04.116 --> 00:12:06.030\nyou should take it seriously.\n\n243\n00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:08.620\nWe should think about the fact\nthat there may be a fire.\n\n244\n00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.530\nWe should get out.\n\n245\n00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.961\nBut how many of us actually\npay attention to that?\n\n246\n00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:12.380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Reality is,\n\n247\n00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.520\na lot of people sit around and\nwait to be told either its real, or\n\n248\n00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.990\nwait to be told, hey,\nyou have to evacuate or know it's a drill.\n\n249\n00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.180\nWhatever.\nSo you don't get up and leave right away.\n\n250\n00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.940\nAnd that's really bad behavior.\n\n251\n00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.310\nIt's bad because it\nimpacts personal safety.\n\n252\n00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.330\nIt's bad because there\nmay actually be an event.\n\n253\n00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.945\nA fire, in which case, obviously,\na lot of bad things can happen.\n\n254\n00:12:30.945 --> 00:12:33.341\nAnd it's bad because it just shows that,\nhonestly,\n\n255\n00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:36.280\npeople just don't take\nthese things seriously.\n\n256\n00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.350\nAnd this is not the behavior that we want.\n\n257\n00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.895\nSo when those kind of things happen,\nwe have to train our users,\n\n258\n00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:45.390\nthe CIS's peas, remember, life safety\nis one of the paramount things we\n\n259\n00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.290\nhave to uphold through the code of ethics.\n\n260\n00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.314\nPeople need to know if\nthere is an emergency,\n\n261\n00:12:49.314 --> 00:12:53.130\nif there is an alarm that somebody,\nsomewhere, has to take that seriously.\n\n262\n00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:55.760\nYou may not wanna get up and\ngo running out of the building, but\n\n263\n00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.200\nthe reality is you have to get up and\nleave and then, be told,\n\n264\n00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.910\nit's safe to come back by somebody who\nis qualified to make that determination.\n\n265\n00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.062\nThat is very important.\n\n266\n00:13:04.062 --> 00:13:06.524\nI think I mentioned in one\nof our episodes earlier,\n\n267\n00:13:06.524 --> 00:13:09.010\nI spent some time working\non bases recently.\n\n268\n00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.590\nAnd I was in, one of the bases I was on,\ndoes a lot of very secure work, and\n\n269\n00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.530\ninside the secure base, inside\nthe security perimeters, the guards,\n\n270\n00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.631\nthe monitoring devices, the [INAUDIBLE],\n\n271\n00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:22.450\netc., there's actually a secondary very\nsecure compound where I actually do work.\n\n272\n00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.770\nThat is a whole nother layer\nof what it means to be secure.\n\n273\n00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:31.260\nAnd we were in there doing work in the\ndata center, and there was a fire drill.\n\n274\n00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.170\nNobody said, hey, no big deal.\n\n275\n00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.144\nOr everybody rather said,\nit's a fire drill, we gotta go.\n\n276\n00:13:36.144 --> 00:13:39.259\nBut everybody thought it was a fire drill,\nI should say, when it actually happened,\n\n277\n00:13:39.259 --> 00:13:41.220\nit turned out to be that\nthere was actually a problem.\n\n278\n00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.380\nBut it was a fire drill,\nat least we thought it was.\n\n279\n00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.930\nSo everybody does what they need to do,\neverybody walks out,\n\n280\n00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:49.310\nwe go through the various layers of\nsecurity to get out of the building, but\n\n281\n00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:51.030\nthe interesting thing,\nbecause of where we were,\n\n282\n00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.530\nand because of the nature\nof the base I was on,\n\n283\n00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:57.300\neverybody's got multiple access cards for\nthis kind of a location.\n\n284\n00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.322\nBecause you have your normal cap card,\nyou've got your additional\n\n285\n00:14:00.322 --> 00:14:03.291\nsecure cards that show what level\nof secure clearance you have, or\n\n286\n00:14:03.291 --> 00:14:05.920\nwhat level of the building\nyou're allowed to be in.\n\n287\n00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.760\nSo everybody walks through\nthe security perimeter, from the very,\n\n288\n00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.540\nvery secure area, into the base.\n\n289\n00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.570\nWe're actually still on the base.\n\n290\n00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.739\nWe're in the, basically,\non the back of the base,\n\n291\n00:14:15.739 --> 00:14:20.070\nin an area that nobody can get to\nunless they basically attack the base.\n\n292\n00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:20.582\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n293\n00:14:20.582 --> 00:14:22.120\n>> Come in with a battalion of people.\n\n294\n00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.230\nSo we're in a secure area,\nnobody's gonna see us,\n\n295\n00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.100\nnobody knows anything about what we do.\n\n296\n00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.825\nBut these people are trained and they\nunderstand exactly what has to happen when\n\n297\n00:14:29.825 --> 00:14:33.549\nthey leave, the minute they walk through\nthat inner security fence, all those\n\n298\n00:14:33.549 --> 00:14:37.275\nbadges get taken off and hidden because\nnobody's allowed to see what they are,\n\n299\n00:14:37.275 --> 00:14:39.022\nwho they are, and where they can go.\n\n300\n00:14:39.022 --> 00:14:41.736\nAnd even though we're standing\nin the middle of a base,\n\n301\n00:14:41.736 --> 00:14:44.914\nthousands of people around us\nthat are providing security, 5,\n\n302\n00:14:44.914 --> 00:14:47.860\n10, 15 fences between us and\nthe outside world.\n\n303\n00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.051\nThey still take the badges off and\nput them away.\n\n304\n00:14:50.051 --> 00:14:50.810\n>> Wow.\n\n305\n00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.727\n>> This is the kind of training that\nspeaks volumes about the fact that clearly\n\n306\n00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:56.903\nin that environment there are policies,\n\n307\n00:14:56.903 --> 00:15:01.206\nthere are procedures and there is training\nthat explain to you what you need to do.\n\n308\n00:15:01.206 --> 00:15:03.624\nAnd they actually,\nas a guest, as a visitor,\n\n309\n00:15:03.624 --> 00:15:07.592\nI have badges as well but obviously mine\nare nowhere near as cool as theirs and\n\n310\n00:15:07.592 --> 00:15:11.889\nthey don't have all the cool colors and\nlines and special insignias and all that.\n\n311\n00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:15.040\nI have a set of badges, and I'm wearing\nthem on a lanyard like most people are.\n\n312\n00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:18.238\nAnd everybody's kinda looking at me and\nreminding me say, hey,\n\n313\n00:15:18.238 --> 00:15:19.938\ngot to make sure you have that off.\n\n314\n00:15:19.938 --> 00:15:21.002\nAnd you know, I know that.\n\n315\n00:15:21.002 --> 00:15:22.632\nI mean, first thing I do when\nI walk through is to put it in\n\n316\n00:15:22.632 --> 00:15:23.872\nmy pocket, as well.\n\n317\n00:15:23.872 --> 00:15:26.722\nBut I'm standing out there, and you watch\nthese people walk through the gate.\n\n318\n00:15:26.722 --> 00:15:28.932\nAnd the minute they scan,\nthey badge to come through the gate,\n\n319\n00:15:28.932 --> 00:15:30.752\nbecause it's one of the secure turnstiles,\n\n320\n00:15:30.752 --> 00:15:34.220\nwhere you can only badge and\none person gets to go through at a time.\n\n321\n00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.250\nAnd so, everyone is lining up, waiting.\n\n322\n00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.270\nAnd as soon as you badge out, that's it.\n\n323\n00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:40.790\nBadges go right in the uniforms or\nthe jumpsuits or\n\n324\n00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.020\nwhatever they happen to be wearing,\nwhatever it was.\n\n325\n00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.700\nAnd so it's interesting, because you\ncan train people to do this stuff.\n\n326\n00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.222\nBut you clearly have to have a focus on.\n\n327\n00:15:48.222 --> 00:15:49.951\nIt's got to be something\nyou're considering,\n\n328\n00:15:49.951 --> 00:15:51.840\nreally something you're thinking about.\n\n329\n00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.830\nAnd then, the security officer.\n\n330\n00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.470\nThe basic security officer comes out.\n\n331\n00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:55.848\nDoes a head count, looks for everybody.\n\n332\n00:15:55.848 --> 00:15:59.528\nEverybody's marshalled in this area and\neverybody is kinda asking, hey,\n\n333\n00:15:59.528 --> 00:16:00.513\nwhere's so and so.\n\n334\n00:16:00.513 --> 00:16:02.254\nIs this person here today?\n\n335\n00:16:02.254 --> 00:16:03.567\nIf not, okay.\n\n336\n00:16:03.567 --> 00:16:04.994\nSo they do a quick headcount.\n\n337\n00:16:04.994 --> 00:16:07.513\nAnd then ultimately you have\nto stand outside and wait.\n\n338\n00:16:07.513 --> 00:16:10.790\nSo we're hanging out, we're waiting,\neverybody's just kind of talking.\n\n339\n00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.900\nAnd then eventually the base security\nofficer comes out and says, okay,\n\n340\n00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:17.650\nit's all clear, or comes out and says a\ncouple of times, there actually is a fire,\n\n341\n00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:18.600\nit's not a drill.\n\n342\n00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.008\nWe heard the fire trucks coming,\nthe whole nine yards.\n\n343\n00:16:21.008 --> 00:16:23.540\nEventually they clear the building and\nthey say, yeah, it's all clear,\n\n344\n00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.280\nyou can come back in.\n\n345\n00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:25.990\nAnd then you have to go\nthrough the process,\n\n346\n00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.890\nput the badge back on, badge back in,\ngo through the gate, go in the other way.\n\n347\n00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.250\nBut it's a process, and you gotta make\nsure people understand the process.\n\n348\n00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.010\nIt's very important,\nnot just with regards to fire safety, but\n\n349\n00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.330\nwith regards to anything.\n\n350\n00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.660\nIf there was an incident,\n\n351\n00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.630\nthe same thought process should apply,\npeople show be trained as to what to do.\n\n352\n00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:47.790\nTalked about the fact that the first\nresponder is probably not going to be\n\n353\n00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.680\na security professional, it's probably\ngoing to be an individual user.\n\n354\n00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:54.750\nThey're going to be at the point of the\nattack, and we have to train them enough\n\n355\n00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.300\nto make them understand they should pay\nattention to the warning signs, and\n\n356\n00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.430\nthen report back to us.\n\n357\n00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:59.230\nIt's very important.\n\n358\n00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.640\nSo, think about that,\nmake sure we're aware of that.\n\n359\n00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:06.232\nObviously updating IPSs and IDSs regularly\nwith signature file updates, with\n\n360\n00:17:06.232 --> 00:17:11.620\npatches from the vendor, very important,\ngotta do that, just like anything else.\n\n361\n00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:13.070\nWe may using white listing or\n\n362\n00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:17.740\nblack listing on these devices to be\nable to create allow or deny lists.\n\n363\n00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:22.670\nWe may be doing spam filtering, we may be\ndoing sand boxing, or honey potting, or\n\n364\n00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:26.460\nhoney nets to be able to catch and\nexamine traffic and\n\n365\n00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.560\ninformation that may\nprove to be a challenge.\n\n366\n00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.750\nThere are lots of different ways\nto achieve this end result today.\n\n367\n00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.340\nAny or all of these technologies\nare appropriate, but\n\n368\n00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.320\nwe have to understand them.\n\n369\n00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.890\nWe have to understand them for\nwhat they are, their limitations, but\n\n370\n00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.195\nalso their capabilities.\n\n371\n00:17:39.195 --> 00:17:40.510\nSandboxing has become very,\n\n372\n00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.420\nvery important today because\nof the rise of virtualization.\n\n373\n00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.950\nIt's very prevalent today.\n\n374\n00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.650\nYou can create a virtual machine, and\n\n375\n00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:52.010\nwe can use one in almost any circumstance\nto not only recreate behavior but\n\n376\n00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:55.680\nalso to create an environment where we can\ntest things because we can isolate them.\n\n377\n00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.510\nWe can effectively put a VM on a host,\ndisconnect it from the network so\n\n378\n00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:03.740\nit cannot communicate, we call it\nisolating the VM, and as a result of that,\n\n379\n00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.790\nwe effectively have a memory bubble that\nallows us to be interactive with the VM.\n\n380\n00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:12.060\nWe can infect the VM with malware, we can\nexamine what it does, without allowing it\n\n381\n00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:16.000\nto escape beyond the memory bubble to get\ninto the host and affect anything else.\n\n382\n00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.970\nAnd this is how a lot of\nAV research is done today.\n\n383\n00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.530\nWe use virtualized sandbox\nenvironments to effectively reproduce\n\n384\n00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:26.530\nthe behavior of the malware, or\nreproduce the behavior of the issue, and\n\n385\n00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.090\nthe thing that we were talking about and\nexamining, to then better understand it.\n\n386\n00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:33.010\nSo when we think about patch management,\nvulnerability management,\n\n387\n00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:36.430\nwe're thinking about these kinds\nof thought processes as well.\n\n388\n00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.020\nWe know generically that\npatch management is critical.\n\n389\n00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.330\nWe have to apply patches to systems,\nwe have to keep up to date with them.\n\n390\n00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:46.300\nOn average most major vendors put out,\nI don't know, I'm guessing,\n\n391\n00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.810\nmaybe 15 to 20 patches a month,\nmaybe every other month.\n\n392\n00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.840\nMicrosoft tends to put out at\nleast 10 to 15 patches a month.\n\n393\n00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.750\nVM ware maybe not so much.\n\n394\n00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.480\nCisco, maybe not so much.\n\n395\n00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.090\nBut they do put out patches.\n\n396\n00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:01.730\nJuniper is gonna be putting out a major\npatch, they actually already did actually.\n\n397\n00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:04.910\nThey have an emergency patch they\nput out to deal with their issue.\n\n398\n00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.520\nAnd I love the guidance\nthat comes with this.\n\n399\n00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.260\nYou need to apply the patch,\nit's really important blah, blah, blah.\n\n400\n00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.760\nAnd it's super critical,\n\n401\n00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.090\nthis is the official term,\nit's a super critical patch.\n\n402\n00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.970\nYou should apply it immediately.\n\n403\n00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.410\nYeah, it's super critical we\nshould apply it immediately.\n\n404\n00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.300\nWhat you should have done, was done\na better job of figuring out if some body\n\n405\n00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.690\nbroke in to your systems immediately\nis what really should have happened.\n\n406\n00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:29.780\nBut, reality is look, this stuff is\ntough to find, it's tough to understand,\n\n407\n00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:30.990\nit's tough to diagnose.\n\n408\n00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.900\nIf they had known about,\n\n409\n00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.920\nit I'm sure they would have taken steps\nto obviously, immediately deal with it.\n\n410\n00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.150\nSo we don't wanna make fun\nof a situation like this.\n\n411\n00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:40.680\nIt's very serious, all kidding aside, and\nthere are a lot of potential concerns and\n\n412\n00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.920\nliabilities, that could come out of\nan attack on a major vendor like this.\n\n413\n00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.110\nBut, there's nothing wrong with laughing\nat somebody elses pain once in a while,\n\n414\n00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.660\nas long as you don't do it too often,\nright?\n\n415\n00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.180\nSo, when we talk about patch management,\n\n416\n00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.720\nwe talk about vulnerability concerns, this\nreally, an event like this focuses us,\n\n417\n00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.670\nfocuses our minds, on the fact that A,\nwe don't wanna be that person.\n\n418\n00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.220\nWe don't wanna be the person\nwho obviously has this concern.\n\n419\n00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.350\nBut if we're using a vendor's product and\nwe don't know that the vendor has\n\n420\n00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.220\nbeen compromised, cuz the vendor\ndoesn't know they've been compromised,\n\n421\n00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.830\nthen we're obviously gonna be at the mercy\nof the vendor to figure out how to fix it.\n\n422\n00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:16.210\nYou know kudos, and all kidding aside,\nkudos to Juniper for\n\n423\n00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:19.220\nputting out a patch right away,\nas soon as they figured it out.\n\n424\n00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.270\nGetting it out there.\n\n425\n00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:23.240\nTelling every customer they have\nto apply this patch immediately\n\n426\n00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.160\nno matter what else they're doing,\nit's a priority for them.\n\n427\n00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.060\nThey did all the right things,\nthat's exactly what they need to do.\n\n428\n00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:31.840\nAnd obviously, as a customer, you have\nto then take that to the next level,\n\n429\n00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.540\npay attention to it and understand\nthe impact of running a potential system\n\n430\n00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.900\nwith this kind of root\nlevel vulnerability.\n\n431\n00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.098\nThis can be a very,\nvery big concern for you.\n\n432\n00:20:40.098 --> 00:20:43.770\nSo determining if patching is necessary,\nit's obviously a combination of examining\n\n433\n00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:46.740\nthe system,\nunderstanding what the vendor guidance is.\n\n434\n00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.460\nAnd you know what?\nWe often make mistakes doing\n\n435\n00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.940\nthe security professionals,\n\n436\n00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.790\nwe often don't spend as much time as\nwe should reading the patch guidance,\n\n437\n00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:58.670\nthe release notes, really understanding\nwhat patches are designed to do.\n\n438\n00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.750\nWe do regression testing, hopefully,\nwe do patch testing, hopefully.\n\n439\n00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.710\nWe do have a sense of\nwhat the patches are.\n\n440\n00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.980\nHopefully, we understand\nthe impact of them, and\n\n441\n00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.790\nhopefully you're doing your due diligence\nand exercising due care with those things.\n\n442\n00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:12.260\nBut I find,\nwhen I talk to security professionals,\n\n443\n00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:15.380\nthat they don't tend to spend a lot\nof time reading the release notes and\n\n444\n00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.700\nreally understanding what\na patch is designed to do.\n\n445\n00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.800\nThey apply it after they test it to\nmake sure it doesn't break anything, but\n\n446\n00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.280\nthey don't necessarily\nknow what the patch does.\n\n447\n00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.800\nThey just know generically yeah,\nthe vendor put out these four patches,\n\n448\n00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.740\nI was told I gotta apply them,\nour change window is tomorrow night,\n\n449\n00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.710\nwe're regression testing today in QA,\nand we've teed them up for tomorrow.\n\n450\n00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:36.290\nBut if you ask the security professional\nwhat do the patches actually do?\n\n451\n00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.372\nI'm not really sure, I just know we gotta\napply them is what you often hear, and\n\n452\n00:21:39.372 --> 00:21:40.670\nthat's a little scary, right?\n\n453\n00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:46.410\nThat's effectively saying to me,\nI don't really know what I'm doing, but\n\n454\n00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.780\nI think I'm doing what I'm supposed to,\nso I'm just gonna go ahead and\n\n455\n00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.150\ndo that until somebody tells\nme to do something else.\n\n456\n00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:55.250\nDue diligence and\ndue care is not about blindly following\n\n457\n00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.630\na prescribed path simply because\nit sounds like it's a good idea.\n\n458\n00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.820\nYears ago, or just in general at\nleast when I was growing up anyway,\n\n459\n00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.090\nmy grandmother, my mother,\nmy parents in general,\n\n460\n00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:10.370\nbut certainly my grandmother in\nparticular, would often sit me down and\n\n461\n00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:13.800\ntell me, basically in plain English,\ndon't be stupid.\n\n462\n00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.260\nRight, don't do things that other people\ndo just because they're doing them.\n\n463\n00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.110\nYou often hear people say,\n\n464\n00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.960\nwould you jump off the roof if\nsomebody else jumped off the roof?\n\n465\n00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.842\nWell, no, I wouldn't jump off\nthe roof if somebody else did, right,\n\n466\n00:22:24.842 --> 00:22:27.675\nunless they were below me and\nI could land on them, in which case then,\n\n467\n00:22:27.675 --> 00:22:30.260\nthey would break my fall,\nit wouldn't be a big deal.\n\n468\n00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:34.430\nBut you don't wanna be that blind\nleading the blind kind of person, right.\n\n469\n00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:37.470\nWe don't wanna be in that situation\nwhere we're doing something\n\n470\n00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.440\nbecause we think we have to, but we\nreally don't understand what we're doing.\n\n471\n00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.630\nMake sure you're not that\nsecurity professional.\n\n472\n00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:49.400\nCISSP's first and foremost,\nhave to understand how to offer guidance,\n\n473\n00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.380\nand offer a perspective on\nwhat is appropriate, and\n\n474\n00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.410\nalso what is possible in the business.\n\n475\n00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:55.970\nAnd again, I've said this several times,\n\n476\n00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:59.090\nif you're not clear on that,\nit's okay to say, I don't know.\n\n477\n00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.910\nAs long as you're willing to\ncome back with a solution and\n\n478\n00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:04.570\nan alternative,\nafter you've done some research.\n\n479\n00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.750\nI sit down and talk to senior level\nexecutives all the time in companies, and\n\n480\n00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.520\nI'm always asked for\nmy opinion on this or that.\n\n481\n00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.950\nHey Adam, what do you think about this?\n\n482\n00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.740\nIs this something we\nshould be concerned about?\n\n483\n00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.100\nShould we be doing this cloud thing?\n\n484\n00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.790\nHow are we dealing with\nthis thing over here?\n\n485\n00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.710\nWhat are you seeing from other customers?\n\n486\n00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.315\nHelp us to better understand our world.\n\n487\n00:23:20.315 --> 00:23:23.080\nIt's what I spend the majority\nof my time doing.\n\n488\n00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.180\nAnd I'm the first person to tell\na customer, to tell a colleague,\n\n489\n00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.780\nto tell a friend, I'm an expert at this,\n\n490\n00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.090\nI can help you with this,\nI can do this with my eyes closed.\n\n491\n00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.806\nI don't know the first thing about that.\n\n492\n00:23:32.806 --> 00:23:34.720\nYou're not gonna wanna\ntalk to me about it, but\n\n493\n00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.110\nguess what,\nI can find somebody that you can.\n\n494\n00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.250\nLet me give, give me a couple of days,\nlet me make a couple of phone calls,\n\n495\n00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:41.140\nsend an email.\n\n496\n00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.540\nI'm gonna hook you up with somebody\nthat's gonna be able to give you good\n\n497\n00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.260\ninformation, because this is\njust not something that I do.\n\n498\n00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.860\nAnd I don't wanna give\nyou wrong information,\n\n499\n00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.550\nI don't wanna give you bad guidance.\n\n500\n00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:52.400\nBecause I may make a mistake\njust not knowing the terrain,\n\n501\n00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.940\nnot knowing the details, not\nunderstanding the technology that well.\n\n502\n00:23:55.940 --> 00:24:00.870\nSo determining when a patch is necessary,\nunderstanding what action we should take,\n\n503\n00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:03.920\nthis is something that a trained\nprofessional needs to do.\n\n504\n00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.380\nIf you're not able to do that, you need to\nfind the people that are and partner with\n\n505\n00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:12.250\nthem in the scenarios that are deployed,\nor that are happening in front of you.\n\n506\n00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:17.060\nRemember that applying a patch is\na question of following a prescribed\n\n507\n00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:21.290\nprocedure, you should have that\nprocedure inside the organization.\n\n508\n00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:24.270\nWe should have policies that dictate\nwe should do have patch management.\n\n509\n00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:26.830\nWe should have procedures that dictate\nthat we'll download patches from\n\n510\n00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:30.960\nthe vendor, insert comma and\nparentheses and comment here.\n\n511\n00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.560\nAdam said make sure you read\npatch release notes, got that?\n\n512\n00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.880\nThen what we're gonna\ndo is test the patches\n\n513\n00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.820\nin a variety of different\nscenarios within our organization.\n\n514\n00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.050\nAgain, sandboxing, virtualization\nto drive regression testing and QA.\n\n515\n00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.990\nIt's an acceptable mechanism today,\nyou may not do it that way,\n\n516\n00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.080\nyou may load up a bunch of physical boxes.\n\n517\n00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.100\nWhatever you do, just make sure that\nthe first time that patch is deployed and\n\n518\n00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.120\nlooked at, is not the time you\nput it into production, right?\n\n519\n00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.875\nBecause that will obviously,\npotentially lead to some concerns.\n\n520\n00:24:59.875 --> 00:25:04.542\nIf anybody is old enough to remember, and\nwas a professional working during this\n\n521\n00:25:04.542 --> 00:25:09.550\ntime, remembering the NT4, service pack\nsix versus service pack six A debacle.\n\n522\n00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.820\nYou don't wanna be on the bleeding\nedge of patch management and\n\n523\n00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.280\nfind out that you patch your host just\nthen to turn around and watch a blue\n\n524\n00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:20.290\nscreen, which was the original version of\nthe NT4 service pack six service pack did.\n\n525\n00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:22.380\nSo if you were the first kid\non your block to say yes,\n\n526\n00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.350\nI'm gonna patch my NT Four\nback office implementation.\n\n527\n00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:28.310\nYou were then, the next morning,\nthe first kid on your block who got\n\n528\n00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:31.428\nthe blue screen to watch the system\nnever come back up again.\n\n529\n00:25:31.428 --> 00:25:34.920\nSo you wanna make sure that you\nunderstand the impact of these patches.\n\n530\n00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.495\nAnd all major vendors, by the way,\nhave had their oopsy moments with NT Four,\n\n531\n00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:42.720\nsix like patching, every vendor has had\nat least one of those, if not more.\n\n532\n00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.800\nAnd it's not uncommon, it doesn't happen\nvery often, but it's not uncommon.\n\n533\n00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.830\nSo as a result of that you understand\nthe impact of what you're doing to your\n\n534\n00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:50.700\nsystems.\n\n535\n00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:56.276\nVery, very significant kind of concern\nthat we have to pay attention to here,\n\n536\n00:25:56.276 --> 00:25:58.803\nright, good\n>> All right very good Adam, we got\n\n537\n00:25:58.803 --> 00:26:02.938\na great look at going over preventative\nmeasures, making sure we've got those and\n\n538\n00:26:02.938 --> 00:26:07.070\nthen a great look at patch management\ngotta keep everything up and running.\n\n539\n00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.536\nSo thanks for all that information Adam.\n\n540\n00:26:08.536 --> 00:26:12.676\nRemember if you guys want to,\nSit in one of Adam's classes live,\n\n541\n00:26:12.676 --> 00:26:15.742\nshoot us an email here\nat SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n542\n00:26:15.742 --> 00:26:19.880\nThat being said, we're gonna sign off for\nthis one, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n543\n00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.595\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n544\n00:26:20.595 --> 00:26:22.749\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n545\n00:26:22.749 --> 00:26:28.920\n[SOUND]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.131\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:19.546\nToday we're doing our CISSP.\n\n5\n00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:21.594\nAnd specifically in this episode,\n\n6\n00:00:21.594 --> 00:00:24.671\nwe're gonna be looking at\nour recovery strategies.\n\n7\n00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:29.215\nHow do we get everything back the way we\nwant it to be after maybe an incident or\n\n8\n00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:30.573\nsomething like that?\n\n9\n00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:33.000\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.876\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:33.876 --> 00:00:34.944\n>> I'm good, I'm good.\n\n12\n00:00:34.944 --> 00:00:37.345\nI'm feeling refreshed and\nrecovered this morning.\n\n13\n00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:38.929\nSo let's talk.\n>> [LAUGH] Our strategies are working.\n\n14\n00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:40.950\n>> Our strategies are working,\nright, right.\n\n15\n00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.390\nSo let's talk a little bit\nabout recovery options.\n\n16\n00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.640\nHow do we recover?\n\n17\n00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.990\nWe know what we're gonna cover, right.\n\n18\n00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.390\nWe're gonna recover our data.\n\n19\n00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.420\nWe're gonna make sure that all the things\nthat we need to have are there.\n\n20\n00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.370\nBut how we do that,\nwhat our strategies are,\n\n21\n00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.420\nis really what the focus\nof this conversation is.\n\n22\n00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.940\nSo backup strategies in general\nare really what we talk about.\n\n23\n00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.172\nHaving a backup of something implies we're\ngoing to have a copy somewhere hopefully\n\n24\n00:01:03.172 --> 00:01:04.672\nsafely and securely stored.\n\n25\n00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:08.557\nSo if something goes wrong we then know\nhow to deal with it in the sense that if\n\n26\n00:01:08.557 --> 00:01:12.320\ncatastrophically we lose access to\nthat data, we can always recover and\n\n27\n00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.575\nrestore it from the copy that's sitting\nin a vault, sitting on another machine,\n\n28\n00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:20.426\nsitting out on the cloud, sitting in\nyour glove compartment in your car.\n\n29\n00:01:20.426 --> 00:01:21.979\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Whatever it may be,\n\n30\n00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.936\nI'll tell you a funny story\nabout glove compartment storage,\n\n31\n00:01:24.936 --> 00:01:28.054\nas we have come to call it, in a little\nbit with regards to what one of\n\n32\n00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:31.910\nmy customers did with some backup tapes,\nkind of interesting thought process.\n\n33\n00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.450\n>> Can't wait to hear that.\n\n34\n00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.340\n>> Yeah, very interesting.\n\n35\n00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.070\nTales from the crypt,\nas we often refer to it as.\n\n36\n00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.140\nSo we want to think about the fact\nthat we have what is known as RTO,\n\n37\n00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.860\nrecovery time objective, and RPO,\nrecovery point objective issues and\n\n38\n00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.560\nconcerns, with regards to backups and with\nregards to strategies around recovery.\n\n39\n00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.905\nThe idea of a recovery point objective,\nan RPO, is gonna be the time value.\n\n40\n00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:58.510\nWe kind of put a stick in the mud,\nso to speak, line in the sand.\n\n41\n00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.070\nAnd we say, and I'm just gonna use 15\nminutes as a random value just for\n\n42\n00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.570\npurposes of our conversation.\n\n43\n00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.850\nIt may be less, it may be more in your\nworld, right, but just generically for\n\n44\n00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.300\npurposes of illustration.\n\n45\n00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.460\nIf we say that our RPO is 15 minutes,\nwhat we are effectively are saying or\n\n46\n00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.040\nimplying is two things.\n\n47\n00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.150\nOne that every 15 minutes we\nare replicating data out of the system so\n\n48\n00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.810\nour replication window for\nrecovery is 15 minutes.\n\n49\n00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.011\nAnd then the second thing we're implying\nwith that time value is that we\n\n50\n00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:29.582\neffectively have decided that\nwe are willing to walk away and\n\n51\n00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:32.873\nlose up to 15 minutes worth\nof transactional data, or\n\n52\n00:02:32.873 --> 00:02:36.258\nwhatever that is in your world,\nin a recovery scenario.\n\n53\n00:02:36.258 --> 00:02:37.930\nAnd we're still going\nto be okay with that.\n\n54\n00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.060\nAnd if we can recover up to 15 minutes\nworth of data and have a gap there,\n\n55\n00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.390\nthen we're going to be all right.\n\n56\n00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.800\nSo what an RPO represents, recovery\npoint objective, is the point in time\n\n57\n00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.550\nduring our replication cycle, that we\neffectively are willing to recover to,\n\n58\n00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.700\npotentially losing data up to that\npoint in time as part of recovery.\n\n59\n00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.580\nAnd RPOs obviously can range in time.\n\n60\n00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.396\nTypically, we may say\nan RPO is 15 minutes.\n\n61\n00:03:03.396 --> 00:03:08.095\nIf we are using many of the free\nreplication appliances and\n\n62\n00:03:08.095 --> 00:03:11.620\nvirtualized solutions that exist\ntoday that are vendor provided but\n\n63\n00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.600\nare free as part of core licensing,\n\n64\n00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.360\ntend to have a low 15 minute RPO window,\nmeaning you can't go past that.\n\n65\n00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.470\nSo you're willing, in effect,\n\n66\n00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.820\nto say if you use that technology you\nmay give up up to 15 minutes of data.\n\n67\n00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.180\nIf you are paying money, licensing\nadditionally for back up and recovery\n\n68\n00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.560\ncapabilities, you can typically move that\nRPO down below the 15 minute barrier.\n\n69\n00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.160\nBut it really just depends on\nhow you choose to set this up.\n\n70\n00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.660\nThe RTO, recovery time objective, is again\nthat line in the sand, that point in time\n\n71\n00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.990\nthat we specify where we are targeting to\ntry to recover and get back online by.\n\n72\n00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.430\nSo if we say, for instance, that a one\nhour RTO has been established, the RTO\n\n73\n00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.710\nindicates the time value, the line in the\nsand, the amount of time we think it will\n\n74\n00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.770\ntake to recover and to successfully\nsay we're able to restore services by.\n\n75\n00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.070\nThat is our earliest opportunity\ntraditionally, typically,\n\n76\n00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.590\nbased on time and how long we think it\nwill take to successfully recover and\n\n77\n00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.760\nrestore services when we've had an outage\nor a problem, whatever it may be.\n\n78\n00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.580\nSo the RTO is a measure of our\nbest case scenario for recovery.\n\n79\n00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.641\nThe MTD, maximum tolerable downtime,\nis the next stop on the recovery train.\n\n80\n00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:23.737\nAnd the MTD is gonna represent\nthe outer limit of recoverability,\n\n81\n00:04:23.737 --> 00:04:26.480\nbefore we have to declare a disaster.\n\n82\n00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.970\nSo what the MTD implies is the time\nvalue that is usually going to be\n\n83\n00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.570\nlonger in duration.\n\n84\n00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.640\nSo it's gonna take longer to\nreach MTD than it does RTO.\n\n85\n00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.020\nAnd we purposefully tell you that\nyou should place RTO before MTD,\n\n86\n00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.440\nmeaning you should make\nthe RTO value smaller.\n\n87\n00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.380\nIt should be smaller.\n\n88\n00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.190\nAnd so if the RTO is one hour, MTD may be\nthree or four hours, whatever that is.\n\n89\n00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.470\nBut it should be less.\n\n90\n00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.760\nThe RTO was that first shot, that first\nwindow where we think realistically,\n\n91\n00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.649\nit's probable we can recover by.\n\n92\n00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:02.891\nBut if we miss that window, we want\nthe additional buffer up to the MTD as\n\n93\n00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:06.921\nan additional space we can play in,\nto try to change our approach and\n\n94\n00:05:06.921 --> 00:05:11.309\napply additional capabilities to\nthe system to then recover the system,\n\n95\n00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:14.060\nbefore we have to declare a disaster.\n\n96\n00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:18.180\nThe disaster declaration at the MTD\nboundary is an important thought process\n\n97\n00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.440\nfor us because what that implied at that\npoint is that all the recovery efforts\n\n98\n00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.390\nwe've engaged in up until\nthat point have not worked.\n\n99\n00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.910\nNow we have a disaster.\n\n100\n00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.290\nA disaster implies we have to take our\ndisaster recovery plan off the shelf.\n\n101\n00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.930\nWe have to execute the recovery plan,\nwhatever that plan is, whatever it says.\n\n102\n00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.048\nIt may say when you open the book,\nit's been five years since we tested this.\n\n103\n00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:40.180\nWe don't know if it's going to work or\nnot.\n\n104\n00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.270\nHopefully it doesn't say that, right,\nbecause you know you should be testing and\n\n105\n00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.340\na regular basis.\n\n106\n00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.817\nBut if it says that, that may be a good\ntime for you to put in for vacation,\n\n107\n00:05:47.817 --> 00:05:50.964\nsee if you could go out and\ndo something else for a couple of weeks.\n\n108\n00:05:50.964 --> 00:05:54.640\nGet the resume up to date, you may just\nwant to do that proactively as well\n\n109\n00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.978\nbecause that's gonna really be,\nhopefully, not what you see.\n\n110\n00:05:57.978 --> 00:05:59.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because if you see that, or\n\n111\n00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.014\nif you indicate based on\nyou're looking at the plan,\n\n112\n00:06:02.014 --> 00:06:05.180\nthat it looks a little out of date,\nit says go start up the modem.\n\n113\n00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.760\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n114\n00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.700\nput the hamsters on the flywheel to\ngenerate some remote recovery power.\n\n115\n00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.110\nAnd you're now using cloud services and\nthere's no mention of cloud\n\n116\n00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.080\nin that DR plan, you've got a problem,\nbecause the plan is probably out of date.\n\n117\n00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.190\nAnd so one of the big holes, one of the\nbig problems we often see in the industry,\n\n118\n00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.240\nout there in the real world, is that\nrecovery plans, disaster recovery plans,\n\n119\n00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.480\nbusiness continuity plans,\nare not kept up to date.\n\n120\n00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.290\nThey are not reviewed on a regular basis.\n\n121\n00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.085\nAnd they don't incorporate new\ntechnologies that we are using in\n\n122\n00:06:36.085 --> 00:06:36.982\nthe services or\n\n123\n00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:41.370\nin the services area to provide\nservices when we bring them online.\n\n124\n00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.059\nI see this from cloud all the time and\n\n125\n00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:45.376\nvirtualization all the time\nwith my customers.\n\n126\n00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:49.042\nWe come and we do an audit, and\nthey've in the last 12 months decided\n\n127\n00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:52.320\nto start virtualizing or\ndeploy cloud based solutions.\n\n128\n00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.331\nAnd the DR and BCP documentation,\nis not up to date.\n\n129\n00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:58.709\nAnd as a result of that, they are still\nsaying we are going to go recover\n\n130\n00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:02.680\nthe on-prem solution for this or that\nsystem, but that doesn't exist anymore.\n\n131\n00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.660\nThe system is now in the cloud,\nbeen given to a vendor and been ported.\n\n132\n00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.458\nAnd if you go to recover\nthat on-prem solution,\n\n133\n00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:11.230\nyou're goinna see a bunch of empty spaces\nin the rack cuz there is nothing there.\n\n134\n00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.785\nSo we really have to think about\nwhat these values mean and\n\n135\n00:07:14.785 --> 00:07:16.800\nultimately how they\nare gonna be played out.\n\n136\n00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.690\nSo RTO, RPO, and MTD, maximum tolerable\ndowntime, recovery time objective,\n\n137\n00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.690\nrecovery point objective, make sure you\nknow the definitions of these terms,\n\n138\n00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.240\nvery important vocabulary, right?\n\n139\n00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.970\nSo make sure we know, very,\nvery important vocabulary terminology for\n\n140\n00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.200\nyou to be aware of.\n\n141\n00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.930\nWhen we think about backups themselves,\n\n142\n00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.750\nwe wanna think about the different\ntypes of backups that we have.\n\n143\n00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.760\nMike's been kind enough to volunteer to\nhelp me with this particular conversation.\n\n144\n00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.158\nSo Mike, you're gonna write,\nMike's going to, no, no, not quite,\n\n145\n00:07:46.158 --> 00:07:47.351\nnot quite yet, not yet.\n\n146\n00:07:47.351 --> 00:07:48.500\nWe're gonna get to that in a minute.\n\n147\n00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.960\nNo, I'm thinking about\nfull incremental and\n\n148\n00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.330\ndifferential backup specifically\nbefore we get to RAID.\n\n149\n00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.673\nRAID's gonna be important as well.\n\n150\n00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:57.454\nAnd for those of you that were watching,\nif you could identify the four different\n\n151\n00:07:57.454 --> 00:08:00.854\nraid types you saw on the screen in\nthe four seconds that they flashed up.\n\n152\n00:08:00.854 --> 00:08:02.747\n>> [LAUGH] Mike is gonna come to your\nhouse and have egg nog with you,\n\n153\n00:08:02.747 --> 00:08:03.330\nfor the holidays.\n\n154\n00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.419\n>> [LAUGH] There's your quiz.\n\n155\n00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:08.570\n>> All right so we're gonna get\nback to that in just a minute.\n\n156\n00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.840\nBut no we want to talk first about full\nincremental and differential back.\n\n157\n00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.953\nSo we want to make sure that\nwe understand not just what\n\n158\n00:08:14.953 --> 00:08:16.610\na full is because that's\nkind of the easy one, right?\n\n159\n00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.660\nThat's the one that everybody gets,\n\n160\n00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.820\nso when we have a full back up\nwe're backing up everything, right?\n\n161\n00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.110\nEverything there is.\n\n162\n00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.980\nAnd we're then going to affect we have\na complete record of all the information.\n\n163\n00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:29.290\nWhat we want to do is we want to talk\nabout incremental and differential.\n\n164\n00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.390\nSo, Mike's going to help me.\n\n165\n00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.210\nWe're gonna do a little give and\ntake here.\n\n166\n00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.710\nSo, I wanna pull both of us on screen\nhere for just a minute, if you could.\n\n167\n00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.790\nI'm gonna get my trusty,\nlittle [COUGH] visual aid here.\n\n168\n00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:43.380\nOur multi purpose token and remote\ncontrol, all in one, from prior episodes.\n\n169\n00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.300\nTokey has come back and\nmade a repeat review here.\n\n170\n00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.390\nEverybody said they liked Mister Token,\nso we're gonna have him come back and\n\n171\n00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:51.250\ndo some work for us.\n\n172\n00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.190\nSo, we're gonna use the token here,\nthe remote control and\n\n173\n00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.340\nalso a little other\nstage prop that I found.\n\n174\n00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.930\nWe're just gonna use\nthis to represent some\n\n175\n00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.660\nchanges that are taking place with data.\n\n176\n00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:02.710\nAnd how we would then see them\nrepresented in a back up, right.\n\n177\n00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:03.670\nSo we're gonna talk about that.\n\n178\n00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.890\nSo if we do a full back up and\n\n179\n00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:10.085\nwe effectively are gonna have let's say\ntwo specific pieces of information.\n\n180\n00:09:10.085 --> 00:09:15.030\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Two specific pieces of information,\n\n181\n00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.390\nfollow the red light wherever it goes,\n\n182\n00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.780\ntwo specific pieces of information that\nare going to change during the backup.\n\n183\n00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.720\nWhen we do a full backup,\nwe're gonna back those two things up and\n\n184\n00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.920\nwe're gonna put them safely and\nstore them somewhere,\n\n185\n00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.710\nso if I give Mike the full\nbackup when I do it, Mike now\n\n186\n00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.820\nhas the two pieces of information in\neffect, so every time we do a full backup.\n\n187\n00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.620\nAll that information is there, and if I\nneed to recover, all I would have to do,\n\n188\n00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.280\nis effectively go get the full backup.\n\n189\n00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.090\nRestore it,\nI would get the pieces of information.\n\n190\n00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.550\nI would have them back,\nand then in effect,\n\n191\n00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.620\nI could apply them right to my computer\nsystem, and then they would be restored.\n\n192\n00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.520\nNo big deal.\n\n193\n00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.450\nSo full backups are easy to work with.\n\n194\n00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.290\nAn incremental backup however,\nlittle bit different, right.\n\n195\n00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.620\nDifferential backup,\na little bit different as well.\n\n196\n00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.510\nSo we normally would do full backup\nlet's say at least once a week.\n\n197\n00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.130\nSo let's say we do that on Monday just\nas a baseline for our conversations.\n\n198\n00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.970\nWe're doing a full back up on Monday.\n\n199\n00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.060\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday we're\ngonna do an incremental backup.\n\n200\n00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:12.520\nSo when Tuesday comes along, right,\nwe're gonna do an incremental backup.\n\n201\n00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.300\nThen on Tuesday this\npiece of data changed.\n\n202\n00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.560\nAnd so we're going to back this\npiece of data up on Tuesday.\n\n203\n00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.370\nSo I'm going to hand this to Mike.\n\n204\n00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.610\nMike has now got our\nincremental backup for Tuesday.\n\n205\n00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:24.410\nAnd then what we're then\ngoing to do is on Wednesday,\n\n206\n00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.230\nwe're going to do another\nincremental backup, right?\n\n207\n00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.115\nSo on Wednesday, we come along.\n\n208\n00:10:29.115 --> 00:10:33.465\nWe see that on Wednesday this piece of\ndata has been changed, been updated or\n\n209\n00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:34.845\nmodified in some way.\n\n210\n00:10:34.845 --> 00:10:35.845\nSo I have to back up this.\n\n211\n00:10:35.845 --> 00:10:38.075\nSo on Wednesday's incremental backup,\n\n212\n00:10:38.075 --> 00:10:40.465\nI'm gonna do this particular\npiece of data and back it up.\n\n213\n00:10:40.465 --> 00:10:41.845\nI'm gonna give this to Mike.\n\n214\n00:10:41.845 --> 00:10:43.455\nThis is Wednesday, right?\n\n215\n00:10:43.455 --> 00:10:46.135\nAnd so now on Thursday morning,\nI come in and\n\n216\n00:10:46.135 --> 00:10:48.545\nI see that the data has been compromised.\n\n217\n00:10:48.545 --> 00:10:51.405\nThere's been some sort of an event,\na failure, but don't know what, but\n\n218\n00:10:51.405 --> 00:10:52.660\nI need to restore.\n\n219\n00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.310\nSo I've got Monday's full backup so\nI start with that.\n\n220\n00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.400\nI put that on the system,\neverything is there.\n\n221\n00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.240\nBut I'm still missing Tuesday and\nWednesday's information.\n\n222\n00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.560\nSince I have incremental backups,\nwhat I need is, I need the backups and\n\n223\n00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.860\nI need them in the proper order,\napplied one at a time.\n\n224\n00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.760\nSo Mike's actually switched his hands,\nyou may or may not have noticed that.\n\n225\n00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.420\nBut he switched his hands,\nhe's gonna hand me Tuesday's backup,\n\n226\n00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.890\nincremental backup first.\n\n227\n00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.520\nWe're gonna take that,\napply that to the system.\n\n228\n00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.680\nWe then need Wednesday's backup, so\n\n229\n00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.710\nhe's gonna give me Wednesday's incremental\nbackup, apply that to the system.\n\n230\n00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:27.210\nAnd then as long as I have\nevery incremental tape and\n\n231\n00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.730\nI apply the back ups in order, right?\n\n232\n00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:32.900\nThen I've effectively restored all\nthe information to the system,\n\n233\n00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.140\nas of Thursday morning everything's back.\n\n234\n00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.290\nNow if we talk about differential backups.\n\n235\n00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:39.490\nSame idea.\n\n236\n00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.910\nFull backup on Monday, so we've done that.\n\n237\n00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.930\nOn Tuesday, we're gonna go ahead and say\nthat we're going to have the same change.\n\n238\n00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.450\nTuesday this data changes.\n\n239\n00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.440\nRight?\nMr. remote control token.\n\n240\n00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.100\nSo on Tuesday this is our change.\n\n241\n00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.770\nBut we're going to do\na differential backup.\n\n242\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.340\nI'm going to give this to Mike and\nMike's going to hold that for\n\n243\n00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.310\nTuesday's differential.\n\n244\n00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.425\nOn Wednesday, we're going to go ahead and\nwe're going to do a backup and\n\n245\n00:12:00.425 --> 00:12:04.270\nI have one more piece of data\nthat has changed on Wednesday.\n\n246\n00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.620\nSo again, another piece of data, but\nthe difference with differential is, where\n\n247\n00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.160\nincremental would have been a separate\nbackup where we would have had these two\n\n248\n00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.510\npieces of information effectively being\nstored separately on separate backups.\n\n249\n00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.500\nWhat we're gonna do is, with\na differential, we're going to effectively\n\n250\n00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.240\nhave them both on every backup, or\non this case, on Wednesday's backup.\n\n251\n00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.950\nNot on every one, but on Wednesdays.\n\n252\n00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.140\nBecause the key difference between\nan incremental backup and a differential\n\n253\n00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:34.550\nbackup, is the fact that an incremental\nbackup resets the backup flag or\n\n254\n00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:39.080\nthe backup parameter on the information,\nwhen we back it up, so it\n\n255\n00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.920\ndoes not show up as needing to be backed\nup every day once we've backed it up.\n\n256\n00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:46.570\nWe back it up incrementally, and then\nit simply sits on that backup tape and\n\n257\n00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.620\ndoes not show up again\nunless it changes again.\n\n258\n00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.330\nBut with a differential backup,\nwe don't reset the archive bit or\n\n259\n00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.130\nthe backup flag parameter,\nand as a result,\n\n260\n00:12:56.130 --> 00:13:00.400\nwhen we go to backup on Tuesday, the\nremote control token data gets backed up,\n\n261\n00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.800\nbut we don't reset the fact that that\nbacked up data has indeed been backed up.\n\n262\n00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.050\nWe leave it marked as needing backup.\n\n263\n00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.000\nAnd as a result of that,\non Wednesday's differential,\n\n264\n00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.650\nwe actually capture that plus whatever\nnew data has been added to the mix.\n\n265\n00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.710\nAnd so when we come in Thursday morning\nand we say hey we've had a failure and\n\n266\n00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:22.600\nneed to restore, I do Monday's full\nbackup, put that back on the system.\n\n267\n00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.450\nI go and I get Wednesday's differential.\n\n268\n00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.030\nWednesday's differential is going\nto have all of the backup data\n\n269\n00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.840\nfrom both Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n270\n00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:35.180\nSo I'm going to apply both\npieces of data to the system.\n\n271\n00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.780\nWith one back up tape or\none back up run for restore.\n\n272\n00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:42.250\nAnd once I've done that effectively\nusing Monday's full and\n\n273\n00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.750\nWednesday's differential.\n\n274\n00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.410\nI've gotten all the changes from\nTuesday and Wednesday together.\n\n275\n00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.050\nI effectively,\n\n276\n00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:51.060\nif everything good in the back up is\ngoing to be valid, we're back to normal.\n\n277\n00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:55.320\nSo we want to make sure we understand\nthe difference between, full back ups.\n\n278\n00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.030\nBetween incremental backups and\nbetween differential backups, right?\n\n279\n00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.450\nThese are gonna be important.\n\n280\n00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.310\nMaking sure we know the difference\nin how they operate is gonna be very\n\n281\n00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.270\nimportant for you,\nas you prepare for the exam, right?\n\n282\n00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.470\nBig hand, big round of applause.\n\n283\n00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:08.405\nBig hand everybody for Mike.\n\n284\n00:14:08.405 --> 00:14:10.600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Mike did an awesome job,\n\n285\n00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.070\nright, you should take a bow.\n\n286\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.640\nThat was awesome.\n\n287\n00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.010\nSo Mike did a great job.\n\n288\n00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.010\nTotally unrehearsed by the way.\n\n289\n00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:18.700\nMike works without a safety net.\n\n290\n00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.520\nMike is a confident professional.\n\n291\n00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.710\nMike said, I do my own stunts,\nnot going to get a stunt double.\n\n292\n00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:24.670\nI'm going to do this.\n\n293\n00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:25.930\nAdam, I'm with you.\n\n294\n00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.130\nI'm gonna support you.\n\n295\n00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.490\nWe've gotta help our vendors,\n\n296\n00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.960\nour users, our customers to\nunderstand how this all works.\n\n297\n00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.580\nI'm gonna jump in there even though I'm\nnot a qualified and trained backup expert.\n\n298\n00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:36.240\nI'm gonna do this.\n\n299\n00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.240\nRight.\n>> Whatever I've gotta do.\n\n300\n00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.310\n>> And Mike went ahead and\njust jumped right in and did it and\n\n301\n00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.140\nhe did a great job.\n\n302\n00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.770\nSo wanna thank him for that.\n\n303\n00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.320\nAll right, we did record that right?\n\n304\n00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.152\nEverybody got that?\n\n305\n00:14:44.152 --> 00:14:44.664\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n306\n00:14:44.664 --> 00:14:45.710\n>> That is there, right?\n\n307\n00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:46.920\nSo you guys will see that.\n\n308\n00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.760\nAll right, so\nlet's continue our conversation.\n\n309\n00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.310\nYeah, we're talking about recovery, right?\n\n310\n00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.630\nRecovery capabilities, backup,\n\n311\n00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.430\nrestore, talked about incremental\ndifferential, talked about full back ups.\n\n312\n00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:56.920\nWhat about recovery sites, right?\n\n313\n00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.100\nNot just about backing up the data.\n\n314\n00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.270\nWhat if we actually gotta go\nsomewhere else in order to operate?\n\n315\n00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:05.160\nWanna talk about things like cold sites,\nwarm sites, hot sites.\n\n316\n00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:10.140\nMobile sites, redundant sites,\ntalk about different kinds\n\n317\n00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:15.320\nof recovery capability that exist beyond\nthe boundary of our physical data center.\n\n318\n00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.720\nWe also have to incorporate\ncloud into that by the way.\n\n319\n00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:21.780\nBecause now we can fail into the cloud,\nfail through the cloud,\n\n320\n00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.690\nfail out of the cloud as\npart of disaster recovery.\n\n321\n00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:25.910\nThis is actually kind of interesting and\n\n322\n00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.000\ndifferent compared to\nwhat we've had before.\n\n323\n00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.629\nSo let's start with a cold site.\n\n324\n00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:31.420\nCold side.\n\n325\n00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.520\nPretty straightforward, you walk in to\na building that really is nothing, but\n\n326\n00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.440\na shell.\n\n327\n00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.110\nRight?\nSo the idea is you've got a floor,\n\n328\n00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:39.710\nyou've got walls, you've got a ceiling.\n\n329\n00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.090\nYou've got basic wiring there so\nyou have electricity.\n\n330\n00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:43.090\nThere are utilities.\n\n331\n00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:44.380\nYou have HVAC.\n\n332\n00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.289\nBut you don't have Internet, probably,\nyou've gotta bring in telcos, you're gonna\n\n333\n00:15:47.289 --> 00:15:49.838\nhave to bring in vendors that will then\nbring in circuits and provision them.\n\n334\n00:15:49.838 --> 00:15:53.148\nYou probably don't have any equipment\nthere, there's no furniture,\n\n335\n00:15:53.148 --> 00:15:56.525\nit's really just literally an empty\noffice, if you think of it that way.\n\n336\n00:15:56.525 --> 00:16:00.830\nAnd other than the basics of lighting and\nprobably electrical, and of course heating\n\n337\n00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:05.440\nand cooling, and maybe water, if you have\na bathroom somewhere, that's about it.\n\n338\n00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.420\nIt's gonna take awhile to\nget that all built out.\n\n339\n00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.820\nYou gotta ship equipment in,\nyou've gotta set up and create a network,\n\n340\n00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:13.110\nyou've gotta bring in external\nnetwork connectivity,\n\n341\n00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:15.150\nyou're gonna have to\nload data into systems.\n\n342\n00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:18.890\nWe're talking about days, maybe even weeks\nbefore you can get a cold site stood up,\n\n343\n00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.010\nand really then have a recoverable option.\n\n344\n00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.390\nSo this is not something\nthat happens right away,\n\n345\n00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.470\nthis is something you fell over to\nwith several weeks of lead time, or\n\n346\n00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:31.050\nseveral weeks of off line\ntime being anticipated right?\n\n347\n00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.232\nBut it is an option, and it is option\nthat you do wanna be aware of.\n\n348\n00:16:34.232 --> 00:16:37.800\nWe may have a warm site, a warm site\nis gonna be a step up from a cold site.\n\n349\n00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.370\nSo you've already probably stored\nfurniture at the warm site.\n\n350\n00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:46.480\nYou may even have desks laid out, kind of\nset up, in theory, so people can walk in,\n\n351\n00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.190\nand at least have a place to sit and\nput their stuff.\n\n352\n00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.850\nYou may have computers there,\nyou probably have telephones there, but\n\n353\n00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.620\nthey may not all be wired up.\n\n354\n00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:57.840\nThey may be kind of just in boxes, you\nmay have to unbox everything, put it out,\n\n355\n00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.500\nthey may be sitting on the desks.\n\n356\n00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.510\nThey may even be wired up in theory, but\n\n357\n00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.520\nthey are not loaded with\nthe most recent data.\n\n358\n00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.120\nThey have to be networked up,\nprobably and set up.\n\n359\n00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.900\nSo you may be talking about\na couple of days or 24 hours or\n\n360\n00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:12.610\nsomething like that to lay it out,\nload all the systems up,\n\n361\n00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.845\nget the most recent data in there so\nthat people can connect.\n\n362\n00:17:15.845 --> 00:17:19.555\nBut you do have internet provisioning,\nyou do have all your circuits there.\n\n363\n00:17:19.555 --> 00:17:22.125\nAll that stuff's probably\nalready been preset and\n\n364\n00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:25.185\nit's just being maintained in kind of\na dormant state until you need it.\n\n365\n00:17:25.185 --> 00:17:27.385\nAnd then when we talk about a hot site,\n\n366\n00:17:27.385 --> 00:17:30.285\nwe're talking about a site that is\neffectively already up and running,\n\n367\n00:17:30.285 --> 00:17:34.065\nall the provisioning is done, computers\nare all networked, everything is running.\n\n368\n00:17:34.065 --> 00:17:37.305\nYou can get out to the internet,\nyour voice traffic is flowing, so\n\n369\n00:17:37.305 --> 00:17:39.280\nyou've got all that kind of stuff set up.\n\n370\n00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.300\nYou may have to load in the most\nrecent transactional data\n\n371\n00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.320\nfrom maybe the last backup cycle.\n\n372\n00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:49.080\nSo maybe it's 15 minutes if that's\nyour RPO, maybe it's 24 hours,\n\n373\n00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:52.450\ndon't know what that would be, would\ndepend, obviously, on your organization.\n\n374\n00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:57.660\nBut on a hot site, you effectively are\ngonna have almost real time capabilities.\n\n375\n00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.300\nWe're talking about couple of hours\nto bring a hot site online, if that.\n\n376\n00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.511\nReally, it's just a matter of\ngetting the most recent data loaded.\n\n377\n00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:06.080\nData is probably in the system and\navailable, but\n\n378\n00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:09.490\nit's just may not be the most recent data,\njust wanna be aware of that.\n\n379\n00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.320\nWe have what's known as a redundant site,\nor a mirrored site.\n\n380\n00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.000\nThis is a real time secondary location\nthat is synchronized in real time, or\n\n381\n00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.600\nalmost near real time with your primary\nlocation, you can fail over to it and\n\n382\n00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.710\nit's fully operational.\n\n383\n00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:27.560\nYou've probably got staff there that's\nmaintaining it on a regular basis.\n\n384\n00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:31.750\nWe may miss a small window of a few\nminutes of transactional data\n\n385\n00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:33.610\nduring a fail over with a mirrored site,\n\n386\n00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:38.570\ndepending on the technology involved,\nmeaning if you have true redundancy,\n\n387\n00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:44.400\ntrue redundant site mirroring with active\nactive capabilities, you miss nothing.\n\n388\n00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.850\nEverything is being written to\nboth systems simultaneously.\n\n389\n00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:51.110\nBut if you have an active passive failover\nsolution, where one is the primary,\n\n390\n00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.930\nthe other, while it's being written to,\nthere's a small delay for\n\n391\n00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.390\ntransactional logging and\nfor journaling and\n\n392\n00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:01.180\nthings like that to take place across the\nwire, again, we go back to that RPO value.\n\n393\n00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.070\nThat RPO value may be a minute, you may be\nbuffering data and sending it out every\n\n394\n00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:08.950\nminute back to the secondary site\nto make sure that its synchronized.\n\n395\n00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:12.370\nIf we failed over, in other words,\nyou could lose maybe 30 seconds to\n\n396\n00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:16.080\na minute of data during the fail over\nwhile you're going live in the other site.\n\n397\n00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.800\nBut in general, it's typically seen as\nbeing a redundant, real time capability.\n\n398\n00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.100\nBoth sites are hot, both sites are live.\n\n399\n00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.950\nThe reality is we could operate out\nof either one pretty much without any\n\n400\n00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.480\ntrouble, and if any, very minimal, or\n\n401\n00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.510\nalmost no noticeable loss of continuity\nfrom the customer's perspective.\n\n402\n00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.860\nSo we do just wanna understand\nthe difference between these.\n\n403\n00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.930\nObviously redundant setters offer little\nto no down time, so synchronized mirrored\n\n404\n00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:41.310\nsites are gonna be very valuable, but\nthey're incredibly expensive to maintain.\n\n405\n00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.000\nEverything has to be the same.\n\n406\n00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.200\nSo I'll tell you two quick stories.\n\n407\n00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.380\nOne about the, hey, let me store the\nbackup tapes someplace really secure and\n\n408\n00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.230\nwhat happens when you fail over, and\n\n409\n00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:55.205\nsomething goes horribly,\nhorribly wrong with a redundant center.\n\n410\n00:19:55.205 --> 00:19:58.085\nI can laugh about these stories\nbecause they didn't happen to me,\n\n411\n00:19:58.085 --> 00:20:00.785\nso they're just fun to talk about.\n\n412\n00:20:00.785 --> 00:20:04.118\nSo, one of my customers comes\nto me several years ago,\n\n413\n00:20:04.118 --> 00:20:07.135\nwe're in the middle of us doing\nsome work for them on site, and\n\n414\n00:20:07.135 --> 00:20:09.575\nwe're getting ready to do an audit for\nthem, a pre audit.\n\n415\n00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:10.855\nAnd so, we're going through the checklist.\n\n416\n00:20:10.855 --> 00:20:13.455\nWe always send a checklist saying\nthis is the kind of stuff we need,\n\n417\n00:20:13.455 --> 00:20:16.260\nwant you to make sure you're prepared to\ntalk about these things when we show up.\n\n418\n00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:20.785\nSo we show up, and we wanna go through\nthe backup and recovery solutions,\n\n419\n00:20:20.785 --> 00:20:23.670\ncuz that's one of the key things\nthat auditors are gonna look at.\n\n420\n00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.810\nAnd so we sit down and say okay, hey,\nwalk us through what your backup plan is.\n\n421\n00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.590\nAre you doing full backups every night,\n\n422\n00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:33.080\ndoing backups,\nrather full plus incremental differential.\n\n423\n00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.730\nHow's this working, where are you\nbacking up to, how does it go,\n\n424\n00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:37.830\nare the backups on site or\nare they off site.\n\n425\n00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.214\nThe whole story, right,\nwe want to see everything.\n\n426\n00:20:39.214 --> 00:20:42.038\nSo we're talking to the customer,\nwe're sitting in the room,\n\n427\n00:20:42.038 --> 00:20:45.439\ngot a couple of the C level executives\nin the meeting, and the network admin,\n\n428\n00:20:45.439 --> 00:20:48.083\nthe guy who's in charge is\nwalking us through everything.\n\n429\n00:20:48.083 --> 00:20:51.533\nAnd it's all going well really, asking\nsome questions, getting the right answers,\n\n430\n00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:53.120\nmaking some notes, no big deal.\n\n431\n00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.310\nEverybody's just having coffee,\nwe're talking, and then he says,\n\n432\n00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.248\nthe network admin says something about\nokay, yeah, and so we do the tape backup.\n\n433\n00:20:59.248 --> 00:21:02.150\nSo that kinda catches my attention,\nyou're doing tape, okay that's fine,\n\n434\n00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.120\nno big deal but now we gotta worry\nabout where you're storing the tapes.\n\n435\n00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.510\nAre they being stored locally on site,\nif so, how are they being stored?\n\n436\n00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:12.600\nAre they secure, are they in a fireproof,\nfire resistant solution so\n\n437\n00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.720\nif there's a fire they'll\nstill be recoverable?\n\n438\n00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.440\nYou have to worry about\nthose kinds of things.\n\n439\n00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.050\nAre they being sent off site,\nso using a bonded vendor?\n\n440\n00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:22.020\nHow do you get them back,\nwhat's the SLA recovery?\n\n441\n00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:24.340\nThese are now questions that\nhave to start being asked.\n\n442\n00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:25.650\nAnd so I go through that in my mind,\n\n443\n00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.645\nI'm thinking all right,\nI gotta go through this, and\n\n444\n00:21:27.645 --> 00:21:32.390\n[LAUGH] Before I can even get two\nwords out of my mouth, he goes from,\n\n445\n00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:36.020\nyeah we use tapes to yeah, oh, but\ndon't worry we store them securely.\n\n446\n00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:42.470\nOr, no, actually I store them securely,\nwhich is incredibly scary for me to hear.\n\n447\n00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.710\nBecause you don't wanna hear I am storing\nsomething securely coming out of the mouth\n\n448\n00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.136\nof a single individual\nbecause of job rotation.\n\n449\n00:21:48.136 --> 00:21:52.640\nNeed to know, distributed,\nsolutions in terms of making\n\n450\n00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.490\nsure people were doing different\nthings on the duel key solution.\n\n451\n00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.300\nSo we have different people looking\nat different aspects of this\n\n452\n00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.140\nand controlling it.\n\n453\n00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.890\nAll the stuff we've talked about with you,\nright,\n\n454\n00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:05.640\njust goes out the window the minute I hear\nhim use the possessive pronoun I, right?\n\n455\n00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.470\nBecause he's saying, I do this,\nwhich means, I know for\n\n456\n00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:09.570\na fact that nobody else is involved.\n\n457\n00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:13.410\nAnd more importantly, I know for a fact,\nthat not only is nobody else involved,\n\n458\n00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:17.390\nbut he's probably not doing\nsomething that he's supposed to do,\n\n459\n00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:20.400\nI store these tapes securely so\nyou don't have to worry about them.\n\n460\n00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.895\nI said okay, no problem,\nwhat does that mean?\n\n461\n00:22:23.895 --> 00:22:28.066\nI should never have asked\nthe obvious question, here's why,\n\n462\n00:22:28.066 --> 00:22:31.370\nwell what I do is we run\nthe backup every night, and\n\n463\n00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:35.322\nthen when I leave I take the tape\nwith me and I put it in my car.\n\n464\n00:22:35.322 --> 00:22:37.882\nOkay, good.\n\n465\n00:22:37.882 --> 00:22:40.445\nSo oh yeah, then I drive home, right,\n\n466\n00:22:40.445 --> 00:22:44.418\nhe's telling me this with\na deadpan expression on his face.\n\n467\n00:22:44.418 --> 00:22:46.994\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I drive home,\n\n468\n00:22:46.994 --> 00:22:50.690\nI park my car in my driveway.\n\n469\n00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:53.330\nI don't live in a great neighborhood,\nis what he tells me.\n\n470\n00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:57.250\nI park, seriously, he really, he says\nI don't live in a great neighborhood\n\n471\n00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:00.040\nI don't have,\nI'm not in one of those gated communities.\n\n472\n00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.670\nI live in an area, it's okay,\nbut it's not great.\n\n473\n00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.200\nI don't have any lighting outside,\nand he goes into great detail.\n\n474\n00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.461\nI don't have any lighting outside, I just\nkind of leave the car in the driveway.\n\n475\n00:23:07.461 --> 00:23:13.317\nAnd I put the tape in the car and most\nof the time, I can't make this stuff up.\n\n476\n00:23:13.317 --> 00:23:14.869\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Most of the time,\n\n477\n00:23:14.869 --> 00:23:18.550\nI put the tape in the glove compartment,\nso I remember to put it in.\n\n478\n00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.300\nOccasionally I forget and I leave it\non the seat, but it's in the car,\n\n479\n00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.240\nand I do remember to lock the car.\n\n480\n00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.360\nSo it's in my driveway.\n\n481\n00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:32.280\nOkay, so then when I come out in\nthe morning I drive back to work and\n\n482\n00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.980\na lot the times I'm a little late for\nwork, so\n\n483\n00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.940\nI don't remember to take the tape\nout of the glove compartment.\n\n484\n00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.138\nSo I leave it in the glove compartment,\ntypically.\n\n485\n00:23:40.138 --> 00:23:42.054\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Occasionally I'll remember to take\n\n486\n00:23:42.054 --> 00:23:45.408\nit in, but normally it takes like two or\nthree days before I get enough tapes\n\n487\n00:23:45.408 --> 00:23:47.930\nin there that I remember I\ngotta bring the tapes back in.\n\n488\n00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.295\nAnd then eventually I take them back in.\n\n489\n00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:52.961\n>> [LAUGH] I'm crying over here.\n\n490\n00:23:52.961 --> 00:23:55.296\n>> So, it gets better.\n\n491\n00:23:55.296 --> 00:23:58.836\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, remember I'm sitting in the room.\n\n492\n00:23:58.836 --> 00:24:02.632\nWith the C level executives from\nthis company couple of them anyway.\n\n493\n00:24:02.632 --> 00:24:03.190\nRight.\n\n494\n00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.653\nAnd he says all this in deadpan and\nbasically, I'm paraphrasing,\n\n495\n00:24:06.653 --> 00:24:09.430\nbasically this was the conversation.\n\n496\n00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.910\nThe absolute abject look of horror and\n\n497\n00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:16.750\nshock that passed across the face of\nthese C level executives is priceless.\n\n498\n00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:17.951\nI wish I would have taken a picture.\n\n499\n00:24:17.951 --> 00:24:22.862\nBut aside from that because they just\nrealized that, a, their world is about\n\n500\n00:24:22.862 --> 00:24:26.944\nto change irrevocably, b,\nthey're probably already fired,\n\n501\n00:24:26.944 --> 00:24:31.628\nthey just don't know it and, c,\nthey're never going to work in this town\n\n502\n00:24:31.628 --> 00:24:36.314\nagain when this gets out, right,\nbecause they've basically allowed,\n\n503\n00:24:36.314 --> 00:24:40.850\nright, like the most horrendous\nbreach of protocol you could possibly\n\n504\n00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:45.920\nimagine to occur, and they had no\nknowledge it was occurring, number one.\n\n505\n00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.480\nNumber two,\nwe're not just talking about like oh,\n\n506\n00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.580\nwe'll take a bunch of\nfiles that are backed up.\n\n507\n00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.230\nThis is like everything the company owns.\n\n508\n00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:53.120\nThis is all the proprietary\ncorporate data.\n\n509\n00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.930\nThis is their main backups.\n\n510\n00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:58.230\nThis is stuff that if it got out,\ncould lead to lawsuits, right.\n\n511\n00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.420\nLet's put it that way.\n\n512\n00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.970\nSo this is a significant liability.\n\n513\n00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.100\nAnd they're probably thinking\nI'm too young to go to jail.\n\n514\n00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:06.760\nI have a family, I can't do this.\n\n515\n00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.290\nSo this is a significant challenge.\n\n516\n00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:15.250\nSo we kind of talk him off the ledge, and\nwe walk him down the path of understanding\n\n517\n00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:20.290\nthat what he's doing is, let's just\nsay well, certainly he means well,\n\n518\n00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:24.790\nit's not going to happen any longer and if\nhe does stay employed going forward, we're\n\n519\n00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.250\ngoing to make sure that he changes his\nmind and he does something differently.\n\n520\n00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:29.820\nSo that was the hey, let me back up and\n\n521\n00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.360\nput the tapes in the glove\ncompartment story.\n\n522\n00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.700\nSo that stopped happening\nafter that obviously.\n\n523\n00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:41.580\nThe other story was about, I actually\nforget what the other story was about.\n\n524\n00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.140\nWhat was the other story that\nI said I was gonna tell you?\n\n525\n00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.710\n>> Let's see. It was >> I was gonna tell\nyou about the backup tapes in the glove\n\n526\n00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.410\ncompartment and there was one other one.\n\n527\n00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:49.260\nI forget what the other one was.\n\n528\n00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:51.220\n>> Gosh, I was laughing so\nhard at that one that I forgot.\n\n529\n00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:51.780\n>> I don't remember.\n\n530\n00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.360\nAnyway, it was probably equally as funny.\n\n531\n00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.280\nIf I remember, I'll tell ya' but\nin the meantime we're gonna keep,\n\n532\n00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.230\nI don't remember what it was so,\n\n533\n00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.770\nwe'll keep talking if it comes up in\nconversation I will tell you what it was\n\n534\n00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:00.370\nor what it is.\n\n535\n00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:02.010\n>> Somebody in a chat room\nfill us while we go on.\n\n536\n00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.360\n>> If you remember, there were two, I\ncan't remember what the other one was for\n\n537\n00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.200\nsome reason.\n\n538\n00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.260\nBut anyway, talked about all\nthese different kind of sites and\n\n539\n00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.230\nhow we were recover.\n\n540\n00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.140\nYou know, mobile sites are also kind of\ninteresting, I mentioned them quickly,\n\n541\n00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.880\nwe didn't really preview them on the list.\n\n542\n00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.510\nA mobile site is a site that effectively\ncan be trucked in and it's usually one of\n\n543\n00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:21.870\nthese big shipping containers maybe on\na 30 foot or 54 foot container brought\n\n544\n00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:26.230\nin on an 18 wheeler semi truck, they back\nit up, they drop the legs, they park it.\n\n545\n00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:30.076\nIt's got on board power generators,\nit's got the hook ups for 110, 220.\n\n546\n00:26:30.076 --> 00:26:33.035\nYou basically roll this thing in,\nit's got all the switching gear and\n\n547\n00:26:33.035 --> 00:26:34.150\nnetworking gear as well.\n\n548\n00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.961\nAnd you actually then can\nhook everything up and\n\n549\n00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:39.300\nin fact just run the network if you\nneed to directly from these containers.\n\n550\n00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:43.690\nYou saw a lot of these in New York after\n911 downtown in the Manhattan area,\n\n551\n00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:49.260\nrunning aspects of network solutions for\nvarious companies during the recovery\n\n552\n00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:54.690\nperiod, during super storm Sandy up\nnorth and the northeast as well.\n\n553\n00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.630\nThese were prevalent right after\nyou saw them in South Florida.\n\n554\n00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:01.990\nAfter hurricane Andrew you see them after\nmajor storm events all over the place\n\n555\n00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.240\nin New Orleans, right after Katrina.\n\n556\n00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.840\nSo these are not something\nthat you would not see but\n\n557\n00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.370\nyou would typically see\nthem in disaster areas and\n\n558\n00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:13.090\nthey usually show up after these\nmassive events have taken place and\n\n559\n00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:17.300\nwe have to restore continuity in these\nareas until we can rebuild infrastructure.\n\n560\n00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.810\nSo you tend to see them running and\nthey tend to be out there.\n\n561\n00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.690\nIf you ever go to carnivals for\nany reason or like a fair, and\n\n562\n00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.870\nyou see that they have the,\nlike, the big power generator\n\n563\n00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:28.480\nsolutions that they truck in and\nhook everything up to for the ride.\n\n564\n00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.630\nThey look kinda like that.\n\n565\n00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:31.600\nThey're on the back of flatbed trucks.\n\n566\n00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.062\nBut they're enclosed, typically,\nand they don't just to power.\n\n567\n00:27:34.062 --> 00:27:37.265\nThey actually have networking capabilities\nas well so they have poor switching\n\n568\n00:27:37.265 --> 00:27:41.065\nfunctionality and poor routing\nfunctionality and things of that nature.\n\n569\n00:27:41.065 --> 00:27:43.755\nCISCO has a few of these where\nthey actually roll them out.\n\n570\n00:27:43.755 --> 00:27:47.362\nI think they make them in RVs actually\nbecause they're totally portable.\n\n571\n00:27:47.362 --> 00:27:50.452\nAnd they can actually not only roll\nthem out and hook up all the power and\n\n572\n00:27:50.452 --> 00:27:53.742\neverything but they can actually run\nbackbone areas for the network and\n\n573\n00:27:53.742 --> 00:27:57.272\nthe network off these recovery\ncapability vehicles as well.\n\n574\n00:27:57.272 --> 00:27:59.870\nI've seen them at a few conferences and\nthey are actually really cool,\n\n575\n00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.830\nprobably about several million\ndollars worth of switching and\n\n576\n00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.990\nrouting gear sitting in an RV,\nthat's kind of interesting.\n\n577\n00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.576\nPuts a whole new spin on\nthe concept of vacation, right?\n\n578\n00:28:08.576 --> 00:28:09.159\n>> Absolutely.\n\n579\n00:28:09.159 --> 00:28:10.880\n[LAUGH]\n>> So you also want to think about,\n\n580\n00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.154\ncan you imagine Chevy Chase driving\none of those down the road.\n\n581\n00:28:13.154 --> 00:28:15.160\n>> [LAUGH] That's what I was thinking.\n\n582\n00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.120\n>> Several million dollars in the backbone\nfor the internet in the back and\n\n583\n00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.640\nhe's chasing Cindy Brinkley\nin the Ferrari, right?\n\n584\n00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.950\nReciprocal agreements, right?\n\n585\n00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:27.520\nHosting agreements that effectively allow\nus to be able to partner with a business\n\n586\n00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.780\nand say hey you help us, we'll help you.\n\n587\n00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.900\nThese are common,\nthey're common in government for instance,\n\n588\n00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.030\ngovernment agencies typically will have\nreciprocal hosting agreements to allow\n\n589\n00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:39.330\neach other to host each other's workers\nand to failover if there's a problem.\n\n590\n00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:41.880\nSo you see it in government,\nyou see it in the military a lot.\n\n591\n00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.450\nYou don't typically see it\nin private sector as much\n\n592\n00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:47.320\njust because it's a little bit\nhard to enforce in the sense that\n\n593\n00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.300\nyou have two companies with the best\nof intentions agree to help each other.\n\n594\n00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.280\nBut then there's a disaster,\nit's kinda like, yeah, everybody for\n\n595\n00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.280\nthemselves, right?\n\n596\n00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.610\nYeah, it was nice in theory\nwhen we didn't really mean\n\n597\n00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:58.690\nanything that was gonna happen.\n\n598\n00:28:58.690 --> 00:28:59.320\nWe were gonna do it but\n\n599\n00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.090\nnow that it's here, I gotta kinda\nmake sure that my stuff's good.\n\n600\n00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.930\nRight?\nSo we may or may not be able to help you.\n\n601\n00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:05.330\nSo you wanna think about that.\n\n602\n00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.780\nObviously things and concerns around\noutsourcing take place here as well.\n\n603\n00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.660\nCan we outsource recovery capabilities?\n\n604\n00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:13.515\nThis is where that cloud conversation\nthat I mentioned may come in.\n\n605\n00:29:13.515 --> 00:29:17.935\nToday, we may be running off prem in\nthe cloud for our primary capabilities.\n\n606\n00:29:17.935 --> 00:29:21.335\nThat cloud vendor effectively has\nbeen transferred the risk, and\n\n607\n00:29:21.335 --> 00:29:24.225\naccepted it for payment of managing DR and\n\n608\n00:29:24.225 --> 00:29:28.425\nBCP on our behalf because now we're not\nthe ones pulling the levers, they are.\n\n609\n00:29:28.425 --> 00:29:31.095\nSo they may fail us over\nto another data center\n\n610\n00:29:31.095 --> 00:29:34.795\nin their cloud network as\npart of a DR DCP event.\n\n611\n00:29:34.795 --> 00:29:37.210\nSo we're failing from\none location to another.\n\n612\n00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:42.090\nThey may say to us hey, we're down and\nwe're gonna take care of it.\n\n613\n00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.960\nWe have an SLA and we'll bring you\nback up within 30 minutes over here.\n\n614\n00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:50.240\nWe may have a different provider that\nwe fail over to, that mirrors our\n\n615\n00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.850\ninfrastructure if something goes wrong,\nso we can fail to another provider.\n\n616\n00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:59.060\nOr we can fail out of the Cloud back to on\nprem, as a fail-safe solution if the Cloud\n\n617\n00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:03.360\nprovider is down for more than two hours,\nor whatever the necessary window is.\n\n618\n00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.920\nWe may bring that solution back on prem,\nand\n\n619\n00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.425\nrun it until we actually can\nreestablish connectivity.\n\n620\n00:30:08.425 --> 00:30:11.830\nSo these are the different ways that\nwe see the Cloud emerging today.\n\n621\n00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:15.380\nFailing into, failing through,\nand failing out of the Cloud,\n\n622\n00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:19.860\ncuz we may fail out of the on prem into\nthe cloud if we have a problem locally.\n\n623\n00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:25.470\nImagine you were running a data center in\nNew Orleans, right, in the Ninth Ward and\n\n624\n00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:29.330\nKatrina happened and everything was now,\nbasically, under 10 feet of water, you\n\n625\n00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:34.040\nwould have to fail over not just out of\nthat area, but out of that state, right?\n\n626\n00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.958\nBecause you couldn't run\nanything in that area.\n\n627\n00:30:35.958 --> 00:30:38.990\nYou would have had flown over to Dallas or\nwherever you would of gone.\n\n628\n00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:43.260\nIf you were using a cloud solution and all\nyour infrastructure was now at the bottom\n\n629\n00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:47.420\nof your basement in your\norganization was all under water\n\n630\n00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:51.225\nyou could have failed over into\nCloud as a solution for DR.\n\n631\n00:30:51.225 --> 00:30:53.555\nThat may or may not have appropriate\nat that moment in time, but\n\n632\n00:30:53.555 --> 00:30:56.085\nI'm just pointing out that would have\nbeen one way you could see failing into\n\n633\n00:30:56.085 --> 00:30:59.415\nthe Cloud as being appropriate so\njust things to consider.\n\n634\n00:30:59.415 --> 00:31:02.305\nAlso wanna be thinking about\nkeeping spare parts around, right,\n\n635\n00:31:02.305 --> 00:31:05.295\nmaking sure we have extra spare parts and\nthings of that nature.\n\n636\n00:31:05.295 --> 00:31:10.090\nWanna think about things like clustered\nsolutions, where we can have a whole bunch\n\n637\n00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:13.680\nof different systems running\ntogether kind of in parallel.\n\n638\n00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.160\nAnd if one fails, we have the opportunity\nto then go in and use others.\n\n639\n00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.320\nRight, and so, the idea would be\nthey can pick up the slack in effect\n\n640\n00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.270\nas part of that discussion and part of\nthat solution with regards to failover.\n\n641\n00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.160\nSo wanna be thinking about\nthe value of clusters and\n\n642\n00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:28.880\nwhat clusters may be able to do for\nus as well.\n\n643\n00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.100\nYou know, we do have some more\nto talk about in this area.\n\n644\n00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.160\nBut we're going to take a small break,\nI think.\n\n645\n00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.700\nWe're gonna let Mike wrap us\nup on this one, come back.\n\n646\n00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.370\nWe're gonna actually not preview\nthat discussion on rate, but\n\n647\n00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.805\nactually have it with you\nin our upcoming episode.\n\n648\n00:31:40.805 --> 00:31:41.830\n>> [LAUGH] Very good, Adam.\n\n649\n00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.740\nAll right, well great,\ngreat information there.\n\n650\n00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:48.380\nTalking about our recovery strategies as\nwell as a couple of great stories for us.\n\n651\n00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:49.360\nI love that.\n>> At least one good story.I\n\n652\n00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.230\nforgot what the other one was.\n\n653\n00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:51.660\n>> We'll figure out what the other\none was in a few minutes.\n\n654\n00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.400\nSo all right ladies and gentlemen I\nhope that you enjoyed watching that.\n\n655\n00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.740\nRemember if you want to sit in\none of Adam's classes live,\n\n656\n00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:01.940\nand who wouldn't right, shoot us\nan email here at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n657\n00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.840\nSigning off for now I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n658\n00:32:03.840 -->

--> 00:00:17.790\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.750\nToday we are doing our CISSP content.\n\n5\n00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.880\nAnd specifically, we're gonna be looking\nat implementing recovery strategies.\n\n6\n00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.780\nWe're actually continuing\nour conversation, so\n\n7\n00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.540\nif you missed the previous episode, make\nsure you go back and watch that one first.\n\n8\n00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.810\nSo, implementing recovery strategies and\nwe'll just dive right in,\n\n9\n00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.300\nand here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.330\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.020\n>> Good, good.\nSo here at Story Time TV\n\n12\n00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.567\nwe're gonna continue our conversation\nabout horrific IT stories.\n\n13\n00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:45.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm only kidding.\n\n14\n00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.365\nWe're going to continue our conversation\nwith regards to disaster recovery,\n\n15\n00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:51.180\nwith regards to business continuity plan.\n\n16\n00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.630\nWe're definitely going to\ntalk about those things.\n\n17\n00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.220\nWe're going to first get a little bit more\ninto some of the recovery strategies and\n\n18\n00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.980\nthings that we have been talking about.\n\n19\n00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.160\nWe left off talking in our last episode\nabout the need for a focus plan.\n\n20\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.180\nWe had talked through some\nof the things we would do.\n\n21\n00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.330\nBackups, for instance.\n\n22\n00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.790\nHow we'd do full incremental differential.\n\n23\n00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.600\nWe had talked about the ideas of\nclustering, the ideas of understanding and\n\n24\n00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.070\nidentifying redundancies being important.\n\n25\n00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.230\nSo things like power supply should be\nmade redundant, network cards, hardware,\n\n26\n00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.070\nsoftware.\n\n27\n00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.590\nAll that should have\nredundancy built into it.\n\n28\n00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.190\nWe should be thinking about drives and\ndata storage, as we talked about as well.\n\n29\n00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.610\nWhat if a drive fails, do we have more\ndrives like that, could we get more?\n\n30\n00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.160\nIf we can't get more of those, what do we\ndo with the drives that are remaining?\n\n31\n00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.190\nHow are we gonna fix them and\ndeal with them?\n\n32\n00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.910\nWhat if we're using SSD drives today and\nthey fail?\n\n33\n00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.090\nAnd remember,\nSSD drive is kinda interesting.\n\n34\n00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:44.143\nThey fail, but they fail for\na different reason and\n\n35\n00:01:44.143 --> 00:01:48.294\nin a different way in effect, than a hard\ndrive that's a non-SSD drive does.\n\n36\n00:01:48.294 --> 00:01:51.075\nNon-SSD drives have moving parts and\neffectively,\n\n37\n00:01:51.075 --> 00:01:54.812\nas a result of that, they fail\nultimately because of wear and tear.\n\n38\n00:01:54.812 --> 00:01:58.622\nSSD drives are really gonna\nhave no moving parts at all.\n\n39\n00:01:58.622 --> 00:02:02.062\nThey are just being powered on and\noff in terms and powering up and\n\n40\n00:02:02.062 --> 00:02:03.072\ndown the storage.\n\n41\n00:02:03.072 --> 00:02:05.862\nThey have a certain number of\npower cycles built into them,\n\n42\n00:02:05.862 --> 00:02:06.990\nin other words, in theory.\n\n43\n00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.000\nAnd the life cycle of that SSD drive,\nis based on turn on,\n\n44\n00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.940\nturn off, as opposed to spinning platters\nat 15,000 RPMs, or something like that.\n\n45\n00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.390\nDo you ever stop and ponder by the way,\njust how fast a hard drive is spinning?\n\n46\n00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.970\nI mean, if you think about what the\ntachometer looks like in a sports car, And\n\n47\n00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.010\nthe fact that it's 7000 RPM, you're\ngoing well over a hundred miles an hour.\n\n48\n00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.380\nSo if you double that, and you think\nthat out of 15,000 RPM spin ratio, that\n\n49\n00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.540\nplatter is moving fast enough to not only\ndecapitate you and anything it touches,\n\n50\n00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.930\nbut effectively to slice through a\nconcrete wall if it was to just be let go.\n\n51\n00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.070\nIt's gotta be spinning at several\nhundred miles an hour inside that case.\n\n52\n00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.885\nAnd yet we not only put our hands on\ntop of it on a regular basis, but\n\n53\n00:02:48.885 --> 00:02:51.525\nwe rest it on our laps\nwhen we use a laptop.\n\n54\n00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:53.405\nIt never fails to amaze me.\n\n55\n00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:55.455\n>> Not any more I don't.\n\n56\n00:02:55.455 --> 00:02:57.815\n>> Not without an iron truss or something.\n\n57\n00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:01.665\nIt never fails to amaze me\nthat people really just do\n\n58\n00:03:01.665 --> 00:03:04.905\nnot understand the implications\nof the toys that they play with.\n\n59\n00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:08.635\nWhen you think about the logic of that,\nan average hard drive that's not SSD,\n\n60\n00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:14.440\neven a 7200 rpm drive is spinning\nat over a 100 miles an hour and yet\n\n61\n00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.310\nwe put that stuff with in\nstriking distance of our\n\n62\n00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.590\nbodies which are not made to resist 100\nmile an hour impacts on a regular basis.\n\n63\n00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.890\nAmazing, absolutely amazing.\n\n64\n00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.010\nSo here at IT Pro Safety TV,\n\n65\n00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.660\nwe're going to offer you tips on how\nto withstand that kind of a problem.\n\n66\n00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.220\nSo we want to be thinking about that\nbecause if drives fail we have to have\n\n67\n00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.320\nthem on the shelf and have to\nobviously be able to swap them out.\n\n68\n00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.990\nWhat about storage, where we put stuff?\n\n69\n00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.250\nWhat about a storage area network versus\na network attached storage device?\n\n70\n00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.180\nOne is basically a large box of discs\ncentrally attached to the network\n\n71\n00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.160\nwith a network cable.\n\n72\n00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.300\nThe other is an entire network\nof storage capabilities.\n\n73\n00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.400\nAnd it's still ultimately just a big\nbox of disks attached to the network,\n\n74\n00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.770\nthe SAN is, but it's a lot more\ncomplicated than a NAS device is.\n\n75\n00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.880\nSo we want to understand\nwe may need switching,\n\n76\n00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.990\nwe may need special network\nconnections to use a SAN,\n\n77\n00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.300\nwhereas with a NAS we really just\nplug it into a network cable, right?\n\n78\n00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.340\nAn IEEE.802.fillintheblank,\nethernet standard, somebody?\n\n79\n00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.950\n>> 3.\n>> 802.3, right.\n\n80\n00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.300\nSo we're most likely using just an 802.3\ncopper wire cable to plug into a NAS.\n\n81\n00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.080\nWhereas with a storage solution like\na SAN, we're probably using fiber channel.\n\n82\n00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.020\nWe need fiber cabling,\nwe need fiber channel interconnects,\n\n83\n00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.710\nfiber channel switches,\nwe need fiber channel HBAs.\n\n84\n00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.183\nHost bus adapters,\nhardware adapters on the back-end,\n\n85\n00:04:30.183 --> 00:04:31.570\nas well as on the storage side.\n\n86\n00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.420\nSo we need a lot more device and\n\n87\n00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.590\narchitecture capabilities to be\nable to use a SAN versus a NAS.\n\n88\n00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.660\nSo, just want to be thinking about that.\n\n89\n00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.108\nWe also need to be thinking\ntalking about RAID,\n\n90\n00:04:41.108 --> 00:04:45.460\nthe Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks\nor RAIT, one you don't often hear about\n\n91\n00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.990\nunless you listen to Bonnie,\nthe singer on a regular basis.\n\n92\n00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.330\nIn which case you probably\ndo hear about Raitt.\n\n93\n00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.030\nRAIT is going to be the Redundant Array\nof Inexpensive Tapes.\n\n94\n00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.940\nSomething that's kind of gone\nthe way of older technology.\n\n95\n00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.180\nWe still have tape arrays out there but\n\n96\n00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.840\nthe reality is that we can build\na RAID solution, either using discs,\n\n97\n00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.920\nkind of a hard drive based solution,\nor using a tape solution.\n\n98\n00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.462\nDepending on the kinds\nof systems we build.\n\n99\n00:05:08.462 --> 00:05:11.680\nWe're gonna focus on RAID,\nRedundant Array of Independent Disks, and\n\n100\n00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.440\ntalk about some of the RAID levels.\n\n101\n00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.560\nAnd we're going to actually take a look at\na nice little handy summary chart we've\n\n102\n00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.420\nput together for you.\n\n103\n00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:19.630\nSo that way we can walk\nthrough the RAID levels and\n\n104\n00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:21.210\nhelp you to understand what they are.\n\n105\n00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.390\nSo when we speak about RAID,\nwhat we're thinking about,\n\n106\n00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.000\nas you can see on\nthe screen in front of you,\n\n107\n00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.710\nis going to be a solution that allows us\nto effectively take at least two disks,\n\n108\n00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.370\nmaybe more than two, it just depends\non the nature of the RAID solution.\n\n109\n00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.670\nUsually at least two discs, and then use\nthose discs in some way to provide either\n\n110\n00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.710\ntotal redundancy and recoverability, or\nat a minimum, allow us to store data.\n\n111\n00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.070\nBut it may not always be stored in\na way that then can be recovered.\n\n112\n00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.900\nSo we have to just think about that and\nunderstand the difference there.\n\n113\n00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.290\nSo we're gonna start with RAID level zero,\nyou can see at the top of list there.\n\n114\n00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.360\nRAID level zero writes files in stripes,\nwe call it disk striping generically,\n\n115\n00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.640\nwrites files in stripes across one or\nmore drives, we are gonna actually\n\n116\n00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.390\nhave usually at least two drives\nas part of the stripe set.\n\n117\n00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.225\nSo you're going to talk about\na RAID 0 being at least two drives,\n\n118\n00:06:10.225 --> 00:06:13.895\nbut we're gonna have multiple drives\nin the stripe set and we're gonna write\n\n119\n00:06:13.895 --> 00:06:18.055\nthe data across those drives,\nin 64 kilobit stripes traditionally.\n\n120\n00:06:18.055 --> 00:06:21.025\nAnd we're then going to effectively,\nmuch like painting a fence, or\n\n121\n00:06:21.025 --> 00:06:24.685\npainting a line, the Tom Sawyer and\nHuckleberry Finn analogy.\n\n122\n00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.985\nWax on, wax off.\n\n123\n00:06:27.985 --> 00:06:28.670\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n124\n00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.320\nwe're gonna basically do one\nof these wax on, wax off.\n\n125\n00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.260\nSo we're gonna be going ahead and\n\n126\n00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.540\nwe're gonna be striping the data in\n64 kilobit chunks across the drives.\n\n127\n00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.640\nIf there's three drives\nin the RAID 0 stripe set,\n\n128\n00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.830\nwe're gonna have three\ndives that we write across.\n\n129\n00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.200\nThe drives are gonna be linked together\nlogically by the raid software or\n\n130\n00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.010\nraid controller.\n\n131\n00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.260\nHowever we implement that,\nit can be software or hardware based.\n\n132\n00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:50.500\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n133\n00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.400\nwe're gonna be able to put that\ninformation on those drives.\n\n134\n00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.020\nNow, the value of that, obviously,\nis so we can spread out our storage.\n\n135\n00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.170\nThe downside is,\nif anyone of those drives fails,\n\n136\n00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.460\nbecause we don't have\nany parity information.\n\n137\n00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.440\nWe have no way, in other words,\n\n138\n00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.360\nof recovering the information from\nthe surviving members of the RAID array\n\n139\n00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.260\nbecause we're not writing that\ninformation to the drive.\n\n140\n00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.150\nWe're just writing the actual data bits.\n\n141\n00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.700\nThen effectively,\nwe've lost that capability and\n\n142\n00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.930\nthe data is gone unless\nwe have a backup of it.\n\n143\n00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.800\nSo RAID 0, well, it is a raid level.\n\n144\n00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.920\nIt does not provide any recovered ability\nfor the data, if the data is lost because\n\n145\n00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.690\nof a dry failure in the array,\nwanna make sure we are aware of that.\n\n146\n00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.030\nRAID level one is commonly\nreferred to as disk mirroring.\n\n147\n00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.250\nWe are writing the data to both\nmembers of the mirror set.\n\n148\n00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.650\nSo we have two drives in the RAID 1 array.\n\n149\n00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.750\nWe write to both simultaneously and\nby doing that,\n\n150\n00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.820\nif one of the two drives were to fail,\nwe can simply flip over.\n\n151\n00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.340\nWe may have to go in and\ndo what's called breaking the mirror.\n\n152\n00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:50.295\nThere's different ways we do it depending\non whether, again it's a software or\n\n153\n00:07:50.295 --> 00:07:52.303\nhardware based RAID controller,\nthat we're using.\n\n154\n00:07:52.303 --> 00:07:55.601\nBut ultimately the data's gonna\nsurvive on the other disk and\n\n155\n00:07:55.601 --> 00:07:59.726\nat most we may have a very small period\nof downtime while we essentially access\n\n156\n00:07:59.726 --> 00:08:01.829\nthe drive to effectively get the data.\n\n157\n00:08:01.829 --> 00:08:04.455\nBut the data's there and\nwe can recover it with no trouble.\n\n158\n00:08:04.455 --> 00:08:09.246\nNow we may add an additional component to\nRAID level one, called RAID level one or\n\n159\n00:08:09.246 --> 00:08:11.520\ndisk mirroring with duplexing.\n\n160\n00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.860\nIf we do duplexing,\n\n161\n00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.415\nwe are now going to essentially\nhave a secondary disk controller.\n\n162\n00:08:17.415 --> 00:08:19.313\nAdd it to the misk, add it to the misk.\n\n163\n00:08:19.313 --> 00:08:22.276\n>> The misk.\n>> The misk, add it to the mix, right?\n\n164\n00:08:22.276 --> 00:08:26.003\nThe mix that we're talking about here\nis the hardware access that the drive\n\n165\n00:08:26.003 --> 00:08:30.086\ncontroller is gonna be the interface that\nthe hard drive is going to be interactive\n\n166\n00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:32.725\nwith from the mother\nboard of the computer.\n\n167\n00:08:32.725 --> 00:08:36.835\nAnd if the controller itself fails, or the\nribbon that is linking the hard drive to\n\n168\n00:08:36.835 --> 00:08:40.695\nthe controller interface on the board\nfails, either way, if that goes down,\n\n169\n00:08:40.695 --> 00:08:41.980\nwe have a drive mirror.\n\n170\n00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.880\nThe drives themselves are fine, but\n\n171\n00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.530\nthe controller that lets\nus read the data is gone.\n\n172\n00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.960\nWe are not gonna be able to get to\nthe data until we replace the controller.\n\n173\n00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.613\nSo again, if it's a hardware controller\nthat is built into the motherboard.\n\n174\n00:08:53.613 --> 00:08:59.230\nOr if it is a RAID to RAID card an actual\ncard controller that we load up.\n\n175\n00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.483\nRemember the old Adaptec controllers,\nfor instance, right?\n\n176\n00:09:01.483 --> 00:09:04.050\nYou had SCSI Adaptec controllers\nyou may have put in.\n\n177\n00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.830\nThese would have been cards you would have\nloaded into an expansion bay on the PC,\n\n178\n00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:08.920\non the motherboard.\n\n179\n00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.840\nAnd would have acted as\nthe drive controller,\n\n180\n00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.580\nespecially if they were scuzzy drives.\n\n181\n00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.380\nSo as a result of that, we may just\nsimply load up another controller, and\n\n182\n00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.650\nnow we have a RAID 1 plus duplex scenario.\n\n183\n00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.800\nSo that's obviously gonna be good for us.\n\n184\n00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.259\nSo RAID 3 and 4, sometimes we do talk\nabout different RAID technologies,\n\n185\n00:09:24.259 --> 00:09:25.456\nthey're not as popular.\n\n186\n00:09:25.456 --> 00:09:27.944\nYou don't often hear people\ntalking about RAID 4 as much,\n\n187\n00:09:27.944 --> 00:09:30.030\nbut RAID 3 people tend to talk about.\n\n188\n00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:33.130\nRAID 3 and 4 are basically going\nto be striping like RAID 0,\n\n189\n00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:34.820\nbut striping with parity.\n\n190\n00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.121\nBut unlike striping with parity in RAID 5,\nwhich we'll come to in a minute.\n\n191\n00:09:38.121 --> 00:09:43.204\nWhich is going to effectively dedicate\nthat striping parity thought process.\n\n192\n00:09:43.204 --> 00:09:47.270\nBy dropping it into different sections on\ndifferent drives, like splitting it up,\n\n193\n00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.310\nif you will.\n\n194\n00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:50.770\nIn RAID 3 we're gonna have\na dedicated parity drive.\n\n195\n00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.533\nAnd so, what we do is effectively we\nwrite all the data across the stripes in\n\n196\n00:09:54.533 --> 00:09:55.384\nthe RAID array.\n\n197\n00:09:55.384 --> 00:09:59.676\nSo, let's say we have, hypothetically,\nfour drives in the RAID 3 array,\n\n198\n00:09:59.676 --> 00:10:03.580\nwe're gonna have a stripe that\ngoes across three of those drives.\n\n199\n00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.531\nSo, let's say a,b, and\nc are the first three.\n\n200\n00:10:05.531 --> 00:10:07.690\nWe're gonna stripe the data across those.\n\n201\n00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:11.090\nOn the fourth drive, drive d,\nwe are effectively gonna do nothing but\n\n202\n00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.780\nput parity information\non that physical drive.\n\n203\n00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:16.395\nThat's dedicated for\nparity storage in other words.\n\n204\n00:10:16.395 --> 00:10:19.262\nAnd if we have a failure in one\nof the drives in the array,\n\n205\n00:10:19.262 --> 00:10:22.504\ndrive a let's say hypothetically\nfails breaking the stripe.\n\n206\n00:10:22.504 --> 00:10:24.062\nWe simply go to the parity drive and\n\n207\n00:10:24.062 --> 00:10:27.031\nreconstitute the information when\nwe restore the actual drive.\n\n208\n00:10:27.031 --> 00:10:31.361\nWe put a new physical RAID or new\nphysical drive a back in the RAID array.\n\n209\n00:10:31.361 --> 00:10:34.515\nAnd then, we repopulate\nthe data from the parity drive,\n\n210\n00:10:34.515 --> 00:10:38.273\nthe physical drive that's actually\ndedicated To parity storage.\n\n211\n00:10:38.273 --> 00:10:40.260\nIn RAID 5 we take a slightly\ndifferent approach.\n\n212\n00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.670\nWe do striping with parity,\nbut the stripe of the data and\n\n213\n00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.990\nthe parity information are both\nstriped across the drive in effect.\n\n214\n00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.880\nSo in RAID 5, we have, let's say\nhypothetically three drives a, b and c.\n\n215\n00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.900\nAnd we put data across a, b and c,\nwe also put parity data across a, b and c.\n\n216\n00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.760\nSo a will maintain data, but it will also\nhave parity information from b and c.\n\n217\n00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.530\nB will maintain part of the data stripe,\nunder its parity information from a and c.\n\n218\n00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.650\nC will maintain data, but it will also\nhave parity information from a and b.\n\n219\n00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:16.334\nIf we say that hypothetically\ndrive b were to fail, what would\n\n220\n00:11:16.334 --> 00:11:21.482\nhappen is the parity information\nfrom drive a which has both b and c.\n\n221\n00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:25.690\nAnd drive c which has both a and\nb on it, will be used to reconstitute\n\n222\n00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.240\nthe information that was in\nthe data stripe for drive b.\n\n223\n00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.470\nWhen we physically replace drive b and\nput it back in, in effect, and\n\n224\n00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:33.260\nhook it back up.\n\n225\n00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.730\nSo we're able to reconstitute\nthe data either way.\n\n226\n00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.743\nThe key difference is, RAID 3 uses\ndedicated parity drive storage.\n\n227\n00:11:39.743 --> 00:11:40.296\nRAID 5,\n\n228\n00:11:40.296 --> 00:11:44.801\nstores parity in line in the data stripes\nacross all the members of the array.\n\n229\n00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:47.638\nIt's just a matter of how we get to\nthe parity data, in other words.\n\n230\n00:11:47.638 --> 00:11:51.640\nRAID 6 again, one that you may or\nnot hear about, it may not be as popular.\n\n231\n00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:55.460\nIt's basically an extension of RAID 5,\nit does two sets of parity information.\n\n232\n00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:00.520\nSo it uses dual parity configuration\nsets affect what RAIDS 6 provides to us.\n\n233\n00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.494\nWe then have RAID 0 and or\nRAID 0 +1 and/or RAID 1+0,\n\n234\n00:12:04.494 --> 00:12:06.721\ncommon referred to as RAID 10.\n\n235\n00:12:06.721 --> 00:12:08.490\nYou configure this as effectively,\n\n236\n00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:12.436\ngoing to be mirroring plus striping cuz\nthat's effectively what RAID 10 does.\n\n237\n00:12:12.436 --> 00:12:17.186\nSo we do the mirror plus the stripe and\nthen RAID 15 is gonna mirror the parody\n\n238\n00:12:17.186 --> 00:12:21.074\nsets and effectively it's like\nRAID 1 plus RAID 5 together.\n\n239\n00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:25.700\nSo it's RAID 1 which is data mirroring\nplus RAID 5 which is parody striping.\n\n240\n00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.260\nSo effectively we're mirroring and\n\n241\n00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.634\ndoing the mirror of the parody\nsets when we do RAID 15.\n\n242\n00:12:29.634 --> 00:12:33.390\nSo these are all of our\ndifferent RAID solutions.\n\n243\n00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:37.000\nWe want to make sure we're aware of RAID,\nhow it works, what it is, what it does.\n\n244\n00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.022\nIt provides capabilities for us in\nmost cases to not just store data but\n\n245\n00:12:41.022 --> 00:12:44.645\nalso to recover data if there is\na significant loss in some way.\n\n246\n00:12:44.645 --> 00:12:48.753\nEspecially, with things like mirroring or\nversions of RAID that may mirroring,\n\n247\n00:12:48.753 --> 00:12:49.835\nRAID 1 or RAID 10.\n\n248\n00:12:49.835 --> 00:12:53.446\nSo that's obviously gonna give us some\nvery good capabilities for redundancy,\n\n249\n00:12:53.446 --> 00:12:56.430\nas well as reliability and\nresiliency, very important.\n\n250\n00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.820\nHow do we not just make data resilient,\nbut how do we staff for\n\n251\n00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:01.450\nresiliency as well, this is something\nelse we have to think about.\n\n252\n00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:05.166\nWe have to cross train, we have to make\nsure people are going to understand how to\n\n253\n00:13:05.166 --> 00:13:07.939\nuse the technology that the primary\nperson does in a pinch,\n\n254\n00:13:07.939 --> 00:13:09.456\nin case there's an emergency.\n\n255\n00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:13.161\nI often talk to my customers about the\nfact that, when we think about staffing\n\n256\n00:13:13.161 --> 00:13:16.869\nfor resiliency, it's not just about do\nwe have two people that are trained.\n\n257\n00:13:16.869 --> 00:13:20.792\nBut do we have one person that's\nthe primary that's then documented what\n\n258\n00:13:20.792 --> 00:13:21.304\nthey do.\n\n259\n00:13:21.304 --> 00:13:24.205\nSo that even if we don't have\na person that's trained or we do but\n\n260\n00:13:24.205 --> 00:13:27.294\nmaybe they're not trained very well,\nthey don't do it every day.\n\n261\n00:13:27.294 --> 00:13:30.432\nIs there documentation that they can\nlook at if they run into a problem,\n\n262\n00:13:30.432 --> 00:13:33.200\nthey can read and\neffectively figure out what to do.\n\n263\n00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.390\nThis is all part of staffing for\nresilience.\n\n264\n00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:38.760\nWe may not have the luxury of hiring\nmultiple people to do the same job role.\n\n265\n00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.540\nToday's market the reality is\nthat's probably not gonna happen.\n\n266\n00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.510\nBut what we have is probably several\ntalented IT professionals that do multiple\n\n267\n00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:46.290\nthings.\n\n268\n00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.110\nSo we have to make sure that as many\npeople as possible know what's going on.\n\n269\n00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.430\nKnow how it's happening and can do as much\nof that as possible as often as necessary.\n\n270\n00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.410\nAnd good documentation is really gonna\nbe the key to that, necessarily.\n\n271\n00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:00.230\nWe also want to think\nabout disaster recovery.\n\n272\n00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:01.629\nThis is continuity, a little bit.\n\n273\n00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:05.138\nDR, disaster recovery,\nit's all about restoring services and\n\n274\n00:14:05.138 --> 00:14:09.300\nstabilizing the environment after\nthe immediate disaster has taken place.\n\n275\n00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:14.294\nSo it's what we do to effectively\nstabilize the environment when a disaster\n\n276\n00:14:14.294 --> 00:14:15.313\nhas occurred.\n\n277\n00:14:15.313 --> 00:14:19.783\nA disaster is going to be qualified as an\nevent that takes us past the MTD barrier,\n\n278\n00:14:19.783 --> 00:14:22.219\nthe Maximum Tolerable Downtime barrier and\n\n279\n00:14:22.219 --> 00:14:26.020\nnegatively impacts our ability\nto provide goods and services.\n\n280\n00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:29.691\nIt could be something as simple as your\ninternet service provide loses the ability\n\n281\n00:14:29.691 --> 00:14:33.322\nto give you connection, I mean that could\nbe something that's just very basic.\n\n282\n00:14:33.322 --> 00:14:35.125\nIt doesn't involve\nthe building burning down.\n\n283\n00:14:35.125 --> 00:14:38.090\nIt doesn't involve an act of God or\nsome sort of weather event.\n\n284\n00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.726\nIt just involves loss of service.\n\n285\n00:14:39.726 --> 00:14:43.803\nBut that can be enough to take your\nbusiness offline if you're a company that\n\n286\n00:14:43.803 --> 00:14:45.217\ndoes business on the web.\n\n287\n00:14:45.217 --> 00:14:48.620\nAnd you have no access to the web,\nthat's a disaster in your world.\n\n288\n00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.380\nImagine Amazon losing\naccess to the Internet.\n\n289\n00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.606\nRight, I mean I think\nthey own the Internet.\n\n290\n00:14:52.606 --> 00:14:53.605\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I don't think that could\n\n291\n00:14:53.605 --> 00:14:54.200\nactually happen.\n\n292\n00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.610\nBecause them and Google, between\nthe two of them they own everything.\n\n293\n00:14:56.610 --> 00:15:00.570\nBut I think you the reality is, imagine,\nif Amazon were to go offline and\n\n294\n00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:06.450\nhad no way of getting to be able\nto transact buy and sell orders.\n\n295\n00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.160\nImagine how much money would be lost,\nright!\n\n296\n00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.897\nI mean that would actually be\na significant amount of money.\n\n297\n00:15:12.897 --> 00:15:16.079\nAnd they would be counting that probably\nevery second, in the sense that,\n\n298\n00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:19.020\nliterally every second and\nI'm sure they have it down to the second.\n\n299\n00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:22.550\nI'm sure they know how much revenue is\nbeing generated across their system\n\n300\n00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.120\non a per second basis.\n\n301\n00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.460\nSo I'm sure they can measure that and\n\n302\n00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.280\nsay, we've lost this amount of potential\nrevenue as a result of being offline for\n\n303\n00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.530\nthis number of minutes or\nwhatever that is.\n\n304\n00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.588\nBut imagine being the person that\nhas to call Amazon and tell them,\n\n305\n00:15:34.588 --> 00:15:36.017\nyou can't fix their problem.\n\n306\n00:15:36.017 --> 00:15:38.244\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> It's gonna take like a day cuz the flux\n\n307\n00:15:38.244 --> 00:15:41.570\ncapacitor is broken and you gotta\nget a new one, or whatever it is.\n\n308\n00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.381\nI mean, can you imagine what\nthat conversation would be like.\n\n309\n00:15:44.381 --> 00:15:46.092\nThat would be like,\nto be a fly on the wall,\n\n310\n00:15:46.092 --> 00:15:49.102\nthat would be like the cool let's be\na fly on the wall for that converstion.\n\n311\n00:15:49.102 --> 00:15:49.697\n>> Right.\n\n312\n00:15:49.697 --> 00:15:52.668\n>> How many zeros are going to be at\nthe end of that disaster recovery report.\n\n313\n00:15:52.668 --> 00:15:53.665\nSo-\n>> I don't know if I can count that high.\n\n314\n00:15:53.665 --> 00:15:54.872\n>> Yeah, I don't know if I\ncan count that high either.\n\n315\n00:15:54.872 --> 00:15:59.251\nSo DR, disaster recovery is all about\nwhat happens when we cross that barrier.\n\n316\n00:15:59.251 --> 00:16:01.208\nThe maximum tolerable downtime barrier.\n\n317\n00:16:01.208 --> 00:16:04.541\nWe have to now figure out what to do,\nto stabilize our systems and\n\n318\n00:16:04.541 --> 00:16:06.948\nstart to think about how\nto get back to normal so\n\n319\n00:16:06.948 --> 00:16:10.340\nthat's what DR is all about,\nwanna make sure we know that.\n\n320\n00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.760\nWe need to have plans right,\nwe can't just wing this thing.\n\n321\n00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.590\nWe can't just say, yep, we've been offline\nfor two hours, we don't know how long,\n\n322\n00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:19.940\nI'm thinking half of you should go home,\nhalf of you should stay, but\n\n323\n00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.450\nI'm not really sure which Why don't you\nguys work it out amongst yourselves.\n\n324\n00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.850\nWhoever is left, just kind of wander in\nevery so often and tell me you're here,\n\n325\n00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.360\nand if you need something.\n\n326\n00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.160\nGo out for a while.\n\n327\n00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.820\nGo get a coffee, and\nmaybe take your cellphone with you,\n\n328\n00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.520\nbecause it will probably be\nimportant if I can call you and\n\n329\n00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.250\nlet you know if I need you to\ncome back as things turn on.\n\n330\n00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.190\nAnd you all just kind of hang out here,\nand if everybody is gonna leave at\n\n331\n00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:43.415\nonce and we don't coordinate, then\nsomebody should just lock the door, right?\n\n332\n00:16:43.415 --> 00:16:44.600\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> That's not a plan,\n\n333\n00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.710\nthat's just not a plan.\n\n334\n00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.070\nThat may work, but that's not a plan.\n\n335\n00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.850\nThe plan should have activation and\nrecovery procedures.\n\n336\n00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.520\nWe should have costing involved, like we\nwere just talking about, down to the, for\n\n337\n00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.840\nAmazon down to the second,\nhow much money we're losing.\n\n338\n00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.800\nWe should understand what required\ndocumentation needs to be available,\n\n339\n00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.410\nwhat software, what hardware, what\npeople skills, what contact information.\n\n340\n00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.860\nHere's one that kills people you know, if\nyou don't update your contact information,\n\n341\n00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.690\nyour call trees, and you have a disaster\nand you have to call people in, and\n\n342\n00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.714\nyou have their old cell phone numbers,\nyou got their old whatever.\n\n343\n00:17:14.714 --> 00:17:16.890\nYou're not getting those people.\n\n344\n00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:19.670\nSo you have to go through that cycle and\nthink through the logic of,\n\n345\n00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.790\nhow do I keep that information fresh,\naccurate and up to date?\n\n346\n00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.170\nThis is really important.\n\n347\n00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.530\nWhat level of detail, in other words,\ndo I need in the plan?\n\n348\n00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:31.650\nWe actually, in my organization,\ngo through and I can tell you\n\n349\n00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:37.390\nthat probably five or six times a month\nI see new call lists coming out because\n\n350\n00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:41.520\nsomebody's made a change to their, either\ntheir number, their primary or secondary.\n\n351\n00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.660\nWe've hired somebody,\nsomebody's changed position, so\n\n352\n00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.350\ntherefore as a result,\ntheir contact info has changed.\n\n353\n00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.200\nThis is just our internal call tree.\n\n354\n00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.480\nThis is not even the one that\nincludes our vendors from DR.\n\n355\n00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.330\nThis is just the one internally.\n\n356\n00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.450\nIf I want to talk to one\nof my team members, so\n\n357\n00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.900\nI know how to get a hold of them.\n\n358\n00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.500\nYou have to also incorporate your\nvendors into your DR list, and\n\n359\n00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.640\nyour call tree list.\n\n360\n00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.470\nBecause nothing is worse than and\n\n361\n00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:07.260\nI've had this happen,\ntalk about funny conversations, right?\n\n362\n00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.960\nSo I have a customer that calls me up,\n\n363\n00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.470\nit's about 2 o'clock in the morning, I'm\non the West Coast of the US on business.\n\n364\n00:18:14.470 --> 00:18:17.350\nSo it's 2 o'clock, it was 3 o'clock\nin the morning out there, so\n\n365\n00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:19.170\n6 o'clock in the morning back East.\n\n366\n00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:23.160\nI've got a phone call from them and\nI don't recognize the number but you know\n\n367\n00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.350\nnormally that time in the morning, people\nare not calling unless something's wrong.\n\n368\n00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:27.400\nSo, I pick up the phone.\n\n369\n00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.680\nHey, what's going on?\n\n370\n00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.210\nYeah, hey, this is George.\n\n371\n00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:31.780\nOkay, George, nice to talk to you.\n\n372\n00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.850\nIt's three in the morning where I am.\n\n373\n00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.830\nThis better be good, right?\n\n374\n00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.800\nSo, what's going on?\n\n375\n00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.310\nA major system outage,\nhe goes through the whole thing.\n\n376\n00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:41.030\nAnd, we're having a problem.\n\n377\n00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.990\nI said well yeah, I can tell that from the\nlast five minutes but what's the problem?\n\n378\n00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.740\nYou've already explained\neverything to me and went on,\n\n379\n00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.350\nI'm assuming that's what the issue is.\n\n380\n00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.840\nSo why are you calling me, it's not\nlike I'm gonna be able to help you.\n\n381\n00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.790\nWe're having a problem,\nI said okay whats the problem?\n\n382\n00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:56.550\nOur problem is that your vendor contact\ninfo, you, meaning you know me.\n\n383\n00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.940\nWe have yours,\ncuz I happen to have you in my cell phone.\n\n384\n00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:01.975\nProblem is, you're the only vendor's\ncontact info that we can get to,\n\n385\n00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:05.520\n[LAUGH] because all the other\nvendor call lists are stored in one\n\n386\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.610\nof the systems that was\naffected by the outage.\n\n387\n00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.645\nAnd nobody has a copy of it.\n\n388\n00:19:10.645 --> 00:19:14.270\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Wow, is all I can be thinking.\n\n389\n00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.720\nI would never say that to my customer,\n\n390\n00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:20.780\nbecause that would be just,\nwell, that wouldn't be right.\n\n391\n00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.230\nLet me put it that way.\n\n392\n00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.480\nIt would not be nice.\n\n393\n00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.940\nBut I'm thinking in my own mind,\nwow, I don't know what else to say.\n\n394\n00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.055\nYou mean to tell me you're running a huge,\n\n395\n00:19:31.055 --> 00:19:35.665\nhuge company and your IT staff,\nwhich I know is a good staff, right,\n\n396\n00:19:35.665 --> 00:19:40.045\nthat nobody has contact info for\nyour vendors to deal with this issue\n\n397\n00:19:40.045 --> 00:19:43.695\nbecause it's electronically stored in one\nof the systems that is now compromised.\n\n398\n00:19:43.695 --> 00:19:47.185\nI don't even wanna begin to think\nabout how that conversation plays out,\n\n399\n00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:48.685\nwhen this all gets said and done.\n\n400\n00:19:48.685 --> 00:19:50.435\nI just, it doesn't end well, right.\n\n401\n00:19:50.435 --> 00:19:53.605\nSo, you gotta make sure you\nhave the most common sense,\n\n402\n00:19:53.605 --> 00:19:55.500\nthe most basic things figured out.\n\n403\n00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.980\nSomebody's got to write\nthat stuff down and\n\n404\n00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.260\nyou've got to have multiple copies of it.\n\n405\n00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.110\nIt's got to be in different places.\n\n406\n00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:05.920\nIt can't be stored electronically on\na contact list in a Blackberry or\n\n407\n00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:06.840\non a phone, whatever.\n\n408\n00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.340\nIf that contact list is fed by\na system that goes offline,\n\n409\n00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.860\nbecause then you're not going to be\nable to get to your contacts, right?\n\n410\n00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.620\nSo you've got to think about these things\nto make sure that you understand them.\n\n411\n00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:17.480\nPlanning in other words is more than just\nwriting something down and saying, okay,\n\n412\n00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.750\nI think we're good.\n\n413\n00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.010\nIt's about repetition.\n\n414\n00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.780\nIt's about going through the planning,\nit's about reviewing.\n\n415\n00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:25.480\nIt's about figuring out that, hey,\nnobody knows how to find that vendor.\n\n416\n00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.405\nAnd as a result, we gotta write that down.\n\n417\n00:20:27.405 --> 00:20:29.665\nAnd then such as vendor contact info.\n\n418\n00:20:29.665 --> 00:20:30.895\nIt's account numbers.\n\n419\n00:20:30.895 --> 00:20:31.945\nIt's passwords, right?\n\n420\n00:20:31.945 --> 00:20:32.975\nIt's user names.\n\n421\n00:20:32.975 --> 00:20:35.794\nBecause if you call a vendor up and\nsay, hey, we've had an outage.\n\n422\n00:20:35.794 --> 00:20:40.137\nWe fail over our DNS records so that\nthey replicate to our alternate site so\n\n423\n00:20:40.137 --> 00:20:42.905\nthat they're now pointing over there.\n\n424\n00:20:42.905 --> 00:20:46.105\nGoDaddy is not talking to you if you\ndon't have the account password and\n\n425\n00:20:46.105 --> 00:20:47.610\nthe user information.\n\n426\n00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:51.940\nYou know you can call up and say I'm Mike\nRodrick and by the way I work with Adam.\n\n427\n00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.730\nYou know Adam,\nhe's the guy that pays the bills.\n\n428\n00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.290\nHe said I should call you.\n\n429\n00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:57.290\nReally Mike, that's fascinating,\nMike, I'm going to hang up now,\n\n430\n00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:58.460\nI don't want you to take\nthat the wrong way.\n\n431\n00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.910\nI actually have to take a call\nfrom somebody who I can help.\n\n432\n00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:05.040\nRight, so I'm going to hang up on you and\nplease send Adam our regards, please tell\n\n433\n00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.240\nhim we said hello, because that's\nabout the extent of that conversation.\n\n434\n00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.010\nYou're not going to get anywhere, so it's\nnot just the number because you can go out\n\n435\n00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:16.300\nto the internet from your smartphone and\nyou can Google for the contact info for\n\n436\n00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.670\nGoDaddy, but if you don't have\nyour account information, right,\n\n437\n00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:21.570\nthat's a problem,\nyou have to have the written down.\n\n438\n00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.049\nSo these kind of things are things\nyou also have to be thinking about.\n\n439\n00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:29.630\nWhat about, not just the fail of\nthe order, not just the servers,\n\n440\n00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:32.970\nnot just the contact info, but\nwhat about secession planning?\n\n441\n00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:37.700\nWhat about if somebody is going to be\neither, for some reason, hopefully, god\n\n442\n00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.650\nforbid, not somebody has hurt or killed\nbut what if somebody is just unavailable\n\n443\n00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:44.430\nand you need to now know who the next\nperson in the chain of command is?\n\n444\n00:21:44.430 --> 00:21:45.610\nHave you walked through that scenario,\n\n445\n00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.720\ndo you understand how to\ndeal with that issue.\n\n446\n00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.420\nThat could also be a problem, right?\n\n447\n00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.150\nWho's in charge, right?\n\n448\n00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:56.090\nWe don't want to have, remember Al Haig,\nwhen President Reagan was shot, right?\n\n449\n00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.905\nComes out,\nthankfully President Reagan survived.\n\n450\n00:21:58.905 --> 00:22:05.015\nBut when he was shot, and at that point,\nAl Haig was not the person in charge.\n\n451\n00:22:05.015 --> 00:22:06.975\nBut came out for a period of time,\nmade the famous announcement,\n\n452\n00:22:06.975 --> 00:22:07.900\nI'm in charge, right?\n\n453\n00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.815\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Rest assured, everything is okay,\n\n454\n00:22:09.815 --> 00:22:10.595\nI'm in charge.\n\n455\n00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:12.675\nThat was a bit of a oops.\n\n456\n00:22:12.675 --> 00:22:15.320\nI really didn't mean to jump over\nthe chain of command, right?\n\n457\n00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.555\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We do have this thing called a vice\n\n458\n00:22:16.555 --> 00:22:17.415\npresident.\n\n459\n00:22:17.415 --> 00:22:19.595\nMaybe important for\nhim to make a statement,\n\n460\n00:22:19.595 --> 00:22:21.970\npotentially take over\nleadership of the country.\n\n461\n00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:25.160\nNot you, cuz you're not\nthe person we elected, right?\n\n462\n00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.680\nSo, you wanna be thinking\nabout those things.\n\n463\n00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.130\nMake sure we know who's in charge.\n\n464\n00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.300\nHow to get a hold of them.\n\n465\n00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:34.930\nI still to this day,\nI am no longer in direct contact and\n\n466\n00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.130\ndirect control of them infrastructure\nof our company on a daily basis.\n\n467\n00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.580\nI no longer fulfill that role.\n\n468\n00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.030\nAlthough, I have been in that role more or\nless for\n\n469\n00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.510\nmost of the time that our\ncompany has been open.\n\n470\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.120\nI don't handle hands on day\nto day management anymore.\n\n471\n00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:50.040\nI'm still that back stop for\nour system engineers and\n\n472\n00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.090\nour facility managers that do that.\n\n473\n00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:55.340\nBut I'm much more of a kind of\na higher level consultant for\n\n474\n00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.270\nthem if they have a technical\nproblem these days.\n\n475\n00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.160\nI don't get the phone call,\nin other words, at two in the morning,\n\n476\n00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.325\nif things don't work anymore.\n\n477\n00:23:00.325 --> 00:23:02.480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> At least not on a regular basis anyway.\n\n478\n00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.060\nBut until very recently, even though\nwe had outsourced to the cloud,\n\n479\n00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.970\nif something wasn't working I would still\nget phone calls at all hours day and\n\n480\n00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:12.700\nnight saying hey by the way\nthis is not happening or\n\n481\n00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.320\nthis is an issue and what do we do, who\ndo we talk to, how do we deal with this?\n\n482\n00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.950\nSo it is important to know who's gonna be\non call and who's gonna pick up the phone\n\n483\n00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.800\nand who's gonna be able to give\nyou that institutional knowledge.\n\n484\n00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.840\nI get those phone calls because I've\nbeen with the company since we opened.\n\n485\n00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.020\nThere's nobody that's been around\nlonger than me other than the owner of\n\n486\n00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:34.830\nthe company who founded our little\nhappy slice of the world here,\n\n487\n00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.280\nright with regards to the company\nI work for, not ITPro.TV.\n\n488\n00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.535\nSo when we think about that,\nright they're not calling the owner,\n\n489\n00:23:41.535 --> 00:23:45.075\nthey're calling me because all the teams\nknow that if nobody else knows,\n\n490\n00:23:45.075 --> 00:23:49.071\nAdam probably knows cuz he's been here\nlong enough that he's probably seen it, so\n\n491\n00:23:49.071 --> 00:23:51.557\nhe probably knows what it is and\nknows how to fix it.\n\n492\n00:23:51.557 --> 00:23:54.062\nThat may or may not be the case,\nby the way, but\n\n493\n00:23:54.062 --> 00:23:57.927\nthat is something that often comes up so\nyou do want to think about that.\n\n494\n00:23:57.927 --> 00:23:59.291\nSo, it is important to know who to call,\n\n495\n00:23:59.291 --> 00:24:01.110\nright, it's important to\nkinda fail through that.\n\n496\n00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:03.070\nWhat if we have multiple locations?\n\n497\n00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.360\nHow do we deal with disaster recovery and\nplanning for them?\n\n498\n00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.190\nIs it the same for every location?\n\n499\n00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:08.190\nIs it different?\n\n500\n00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:10.700\nAnd these are things we'd wanna be\naware off and be thinking about.\n\n501\n00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.410\nWho do we actually communicate with?\n\n502\n00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.000\nDo we communicate with stakeholders?\n\n503\n00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.380\nDo we communicate up and down the chain?\n\n504\n00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.180\nAre we authorized to give out certain\ninformation to certain individuals,\n\n505\n00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.104\nmay be not to others.\n\n506\n00:24:20.104 --> 00:24:23.610\nDo I have people calling me again\nin these disaster scenarios,\n\n507\n00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:25.630\nnot just from companies, my own company,\n\n508\n00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:31.040\nbut from external companies I have\nrelationships with as a consultant.\n\n509\n00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.880\nAnd I'm under NDA to be able to talk\nabout their technology with them but\n\n510\n00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:35.800\nnobody else.\n\n511\n00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.780\nAnd if I don't know the person\non the other end of the phone,\n\n512\n00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:41.030\nbecause I don't deal with them normally,\nI can't talk to them.\n\n513\n00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:41.880\nI just don't know who they are.\n\n514\n00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.390\nThey may not be representing the company.\n\n515\n00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:46.550\nThey may be trying to socially\nengineer information out of me.\n\n516\n00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:48.990\nSo, when I get a strange\nphone call from a vendor or\n\n517\n00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:52.000\na customer, unless I have\na personal relationship with them,\n\n518\n00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.710\nunless it's somebody I know,\nthat I've done business with.\n\n519\n00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:58.570\nIt's George from company Y, and\nI know George, and I deal with George all\n\n520\n00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.600\nthe time, I'm not talking to somebody\nthat just randomly calls up and\n\n521\n00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.270\nsays, I represent so and so,\nthey told me to call you.\n\n522\n00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.390\nWe're having this problem.\n\n523\n00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:07.080\nMy first response is, that's nice.\n\n524\n00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:07.870\nYou have my number.\n\n525\n00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.110\nI don't care what's happening.\n\n526\n00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:12.600\nFind so and so and get them on the phone\nand explain to them and apologize to them.\n\n527\n00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.030\nIf it's legitimately\nthat this is who you are.\n\n528\n00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:17.670\nThat I'm just following the procedure\nthat we've agreed upon, and\n\n529\n00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:18.610\nI'm not going to talk to you.\n\n530\n00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.630\nYou have to have them call me, unless\nthey're standing in the room with you,\n\n531\n00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:24.720\nin which case, put your phone on\nspeaker and let me talk to them, but\n\n532\n00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.190\nother than that I'm not gonna talk to you.\n\n533\n00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:29.440\nI don't wanna be rude but I can't help\nyou cuz I don't know who you are.\n\n534\n00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.400\nAnd that's important you have to\nunderstand and think about that as well.\n\n535\n00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.420\nWe have to test these policies,\nthese plans, on a regular basis.\n\n536\n00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.430\nWe have to be relentless\nwith testing them.\n\n537\n00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.620\nWe wanna go through and talk about the\ndifferent testing strategies that exist,\n\n538\n00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.320\nso let's just quickly\nenumerate what they are.\n\n539\n00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.110\nWe have what's known as\na check list check or\n\n540\n00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.450\na desk check sometimes\nreferred to either way.\n\n541\n00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:53.640\nThis is where you basically read a copy of\nthe DR plan, you read your portion of it.\n\n542\n00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.950\nYou gotta check off a box or\nsign that you read it.\n\n543\n00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.215\nBut you're Just sitting at your desk,\n\n544\n00:25:57.215 --> 00:25:59.335\nyou're isolated,\nnobody else is there with you.\n\n545\n00:25:59.335 --> 00:26:01.405\nYou're not discussing\nthe plan with anybody,\n\n546\n00:26:01.405 --> 00:26:03.045\nyou're just doing like a dry read.\n\n547\n00:26:03.045 --> 00:26:05.475\nYou're saying yep, plan looks good,\nmy stuff's in there,\n\n548\n00:26:05.475 --> 00:26:06.505\nlooks like it's up to date.\n\n549\n00:26:06.505 --> 00:26:07.745\nI don't know about anybody else's,\n\n550\n00:26:07.745 --> 00:26:11.322\nI'm really just signing off on mine, and\nyou sign off that you read the plan.\n\n551\n00:26:11.322 --> 00:26:12.792\nThat's the extent of the test.\n\n552\n00:26:12.792 --> 00:26:13.682\nThat's okay.\n\n553\n00:26:13.682 --> 00:26:15.062\nIt's valuable at one level.\n\n554\n00:26:15.062 --> 00:26:18.642\nThe stuff you're responsible for\nhas been vetted but it's not really a good\n\n555\n00:26:18.642 --> 00:26:22.312\noverall testing of the plan holistically\nthroughout the entire organization.\n\n556\n00:26:22.312 --> 00:26:24.632\nWe may have what's known\nas a tabletop exercise or\n\n557\n00:26:24.632 --> 00:26:26.692\nsometimes called\na structured walk through.\n\n558\n00:26:26.692 --> 00:26:30.092\nThis is where we put everybody in a room,\nso it's kind of like a WebEx or\n\n559\n00:26:30.092 --> 00:26:31.952\na video conference or a meeting.\n\n560\n00:26:31.952 --> 00:26:32.802\nYou may attend remotely or\n\n561\n00:26:32.802 --> 00:26:36.230\nyou may be there in person, and we're all\ngonna go through the elements of the plan.\n\n562\n00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.460\nWe're gonna talk through it together so\nthere is now exchange of ideas and\n\n563\n00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.870\ndialogue, but\nwe're not actually doing anything.\n\n564\n00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.790\nWe're not simulating any of\nthe events that are gonna happen.\n\n565\n00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.570\nWe're not shutting off systems.\n\n566\n00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:48.910\nWe're not doing real validation or\nverification.\n\n567\n00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:53.120\nWe're simply verbally talking through\nthe plan, it's the next level of testing\n\n568\n00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.330\nstrategy simulation, this could be\ndone today using virtual environments.\n\n569\n00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:02.060\nIt may be done doing a war games scenario\nwhere we actually put everybody in a room.\n\n570\n00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.540\nAnd we do actually have a facilitator, and\n\n571\n00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:09.645\nwe walk through a scenario-based playback\nof what a typical DR event may be.\n\n572\n00:27:09.645 --> 00:27:11.595\nSo everybody's in the room in their roles.\n\n573\n00:27:11.595 --> 00:27:13.725\nThey're all acting as if\nthings are happening.\n\n574\n00:27:13.725 --> 00:27:15.875\nThey're reacting to what\nthey're told is happening.\n\n575\n00:27:15.875 --> 00:27:18.295\nThey're taking the steps they would\nnormally take, in other words, but\n\n576\n00:27:18.295 --> 00:27:19.185\nit's all fake, right?\n\n577\n00:27:19.185 --> 00:27:21.497\nIt's all what we call Hollywood magic,\nright?\n\n578\n00:27:21.497 --> 00:27:23.057\nSo that's simulation.\n\n579\n00:27:23.057 --> 00:27:26.087\nParallel testing is where we\nactually are going to go ahead, and\n\n580\n00:27:26.087 --> 00:27:30.687\nwe're going to run the fail over system,\nas well as the real system in parallel.\n\n581\n00:27:30.687 --> 00:27:34.827\nWe may shut down portions of the system\nand fail over portions to the DR,\n\n582\n00:27:34.827 --> 00:27:38.287\nto the parallel recovery site\nto see what will happen.\n\n583\n00:27:38.287 --> 00:27:41.257\nBut we're not fully interrupting and\nshutting down everything.\n\n584\n00:27:41.257 --> 00:27:44.400\nSo this is like a limited\ninterruption test, if you will.\n\n585\n00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.930\nFull interrupt or full scale is where\nwe're actually gonna go through and\n\n586\n00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.860\nload and shut everything off fail it all\nover, and then try to fail it back and\n\n587\n00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.070\nsee what happens.\n\n588\n00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.940\nBanks have to do this at least once a year\nby regulation within the United States for\n\n589\n00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.920\ninstance, healthcare providers have to\ndo this once a year as well typically\n\n590\n00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.640\nbecause of regulation within in the US,\nso they have to go through and\n\n591\n00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:06.940\ndo full interruption or\nfull scale examinations, other DR plants.\n\n592\n00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.800\nWanna make sure, that we understand the\nfive different test strategies that exist.\n\n593\n00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.200\nJust one more time quickly.\n\n594\n00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.190\nDesk check, or checklist test,\n\n595\n00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:17.810\nit's referred to either way, tabletop,\nand/or structured walkthrough.\n\n596\n00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:19.600\nAgain, you hear that\nreferred to either way.\n\n597\n00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.440\nSimulation simulation,\nparallel and full interruption\n\n598\n00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.870\nare sometimes called full scale tests,\nwanna make sure we're familiar with these.\n\n599\n00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:31.070\nRemember, keeping in mind that\nwe have to constantly update and\n\n600\n00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:34.820\nmaintain the details of the plan\nis also very important.\n\n601\n00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.610\nWe just wanna quickly wrap up\nwith a thought process of BCP.\n\n602\n00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.660\nWe've talked about DR after recovery,\n\n603\n00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.250\nwe wanna just talk about\nbusiness continuity for a minute.\n\n604\n00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:46.970\nBusiness continuity planning, BCP,\nIs the twin brother of the DRP, or\n\n605\n00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.770\ntwin sister of DRP, or\nhowever you like to frame that\n\n606\n00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:54.300\nwhere DR is all about making sure we can\nstabilize after the immediate event and\n\n607\n00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.490\ncreate some sort of you know secure\nenvironment to begin recovering from.\n\n608\n00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:03.470\nBCP is all about that recovery process\nextended, till we get back to normal.\n\n609\n00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:07.780\nSo we talk about DR as being\nthe stabilizer after the event, and\n\n610\n00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.810\nBCP about what we do to go home.\n\n611\n00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.560\nGoing home means, getting back to normal.\n\n612\n00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.640\nGetting everything back to the way it was.\n\n613\n00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.510\nWe often have different teams\nthat do both of these activities.\n\n614\n00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:19.950\nSo you'll have a team that does DR,\nand they stabilize the environment,\n\n615\n00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:22.670\nwhile another team is then\ngonna go into BCP recovery.\n\n616\n00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:25.050\nAnd it's actually gonna start\nto restore services, and\n\n617\n00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:28.570\ndo all of the things that are necessary\nthere in order to be able to effectively\n\n618\n00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:31.370\nbring back the systems,\nand bring them online.\n\n619\n00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:33.650\nWe wanna make sure that\nwe use the BCP plan.\n\n620\n00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:35.370\nWe do have a plan for that as well.\n\n621\n00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:37.780\nAnd the key there is that we have\nto do something known as a BIA,\n\n622\n00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.000\na business impact analyses.\n\n623\n00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.030\nAnd what we have to do with a BIA\nis look at all the services,\n\n624\n00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.120\nall the things we do in the organization.\n\n625\n00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.700\nWe have to prioritize them and\nunderstand how important they are.\n\n626\n00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.630\nSo if I said to you,\nhey can you survive email?\n\n627\n00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:54.920\nYou may say to me well, absolutely no,\nwe need email to do our business.\n\n628\n00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.120\nSo we rank and\nprioritize our importance as deserved.\n\n629\n00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.350\nWill then figure out what\nthe top level services are,\n\n630\n00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.140\nthe middle level, the low level\nkin of ranking in priority order.\n\n631\n00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.770\nHow important everything is from most\nto least and that becomes our list of\n\n632\n00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:11.340\nservices that we manage against\nwhen we have to do a BCP event.\n\n633\n00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.420\nWhen we have to go through and\nactually start to recover services.\n\n634\n00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.230\nHere is the interesting thing with BCP,\nwe are going to use the input of the BIA,\n\n635\n00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.630\nthe Business Impact Analysis\nto identify critical services.\n\n636\n00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.980\nDo you think Quick quiz for you right?\n\n637\n00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.030\nDo you think we should restore\nthe most critical service,\n\n638\n00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.870\nemail hypothetically the most critical.\n\n639\n00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.320\nShould we restore that most\ncritical service first\n\n640\n00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:35.000\ncoming out of a disaster as we're looking\nto stabilize and get back to normal?\n\n641\n00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.220\nOr should we restore the least\ncritical service, let's say file and\n\n642\n00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.270\nprint is the least critical service,\nright?\n\n643\n00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.140\nShould we restore the most critical first,\nor\n\n644\n00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.760\nthe least critical first,\nwhat do you think?\n\n645\n00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.760\n>> I would go with the least critical.\n\n646\n00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:46.340\n>> Least critical.\n\n647\n00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.690\n>> I would wanna test my methods and\n\n648\n00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:50.470\nmake sure that we were able to get\nsomething back up and running first.\n\n649\n00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:51.820\n>> Absolutely, and most important,\n\n650\n00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:53.405\nand Mike's 100%\n>> Incorrect.\n\n651\n00:30:53.405 --> 00:30:56.565\nAnd most importantly about that thought\nprocess is, not only do we wanna test,\n\n652\n00:30:56.565 --> 00:30:58.915\nnot only do we wanna make sure it's good,\nand we can do that, but\n\n653\n00:30:58.915 --> 00:31:02.335\nwhat if we restored our most critical\nservice, and we found out that there was\n\n654\n00:31:02.335 --> 00:31:05.365\nstill a problem, and we have not\ntotally stabilized the environment?\n\n655\n00:31:05.365 --> 00:31:07.485\nWe in effect would've just blown it up,\nand\n\n656\n00:31:07.485 --> 00:31:11.340\nruined any chance that we can recover\nit in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n657\n00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.820\nSo that is going to be a huge\nliability and risk for us.\n\n658\n00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.710\nWe do want to make sure when we are\nthinking about BCP, we are thinking about\n\n659\n00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:23.260\nthe idea that we actually have to recover\nin reverse order from least to most,\n\n660\n00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.910\nas Mike helped us understand and pointed\nout with regards to service priority.\n\n661\n00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:31.870\nWhat drives that priority ranking of\nservices is our business impact analysis.\n\n662\n00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:32.457\nVery good.\n\n663\n00:31:32.457 --> 00:31:34.220\n>> All right Adam, great look there.\n\n664\n00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:35.260\nLot of information.\n\n665\n00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:39.300\nLooking at disaster recovery as well\nas some fault tolerance capabilities.\n\n666\n00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.610\nAnd again, talk about planning and\nmaking sure that everything is\n\n667\n00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.950\nlaid out ahead of time because during\nthe event, during the disaster or\n\n668\n00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:50.090\nwhatever it is, that's not when we\nare making those clear rational decisions.\n\n669\n00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:52.640\nAnd the importance of keeping\nit up to date, testing it.\n\n670\n00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.180\nRight?\n\n671\n00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:57.240\nYou don't want to be the one that doesn't\nhave a hard copy of that vendor list\n\n672\n00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.800\noffsite, and to have to call Adam on the\nWest Coast at 3 o'clock in the morning,\n\n673\n00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.170\nhoping he might know one\nof your vendors for you.\n\n674\n00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.250\nSo, appreciate that.\n\n675\n00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.932\nAnd remember, if you guys want to\nsit in one of Adam's classes live,\n\n676\n00:32:08.932 --> 00:32:12.434\nall you gotta do is shoot us\nan email here at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n677\n00:32:12.434 --> 00:32:14.470\nSigning off I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n678\n00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:15.310\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n679\n00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.685\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n680\n00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:22.670\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

--> 00:00:17.550\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.574\nToday we're doing our CISSP content.\n\n5\n00:00:20.574 --> 00:00:25.129\nAnd specifically in this episode we're\ngoing to be getting into physical\n\n6\n00:00:25.129 --> 00:00:27.820\nsecurity as well as personnel security.\n\n7\n00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.109\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.330\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.020\n>> I'm feeling rather secure this\nmorning and a little personal, so\n\n10\n00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.860\nwe'll see how that goes.\n\n11\n00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.532\nWhen we talk about both physical and\npersonnel security, what we're thinking\n\n12\n00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:43.006\nabout is how do we safe guard information,\nhow do we safeguard resources.\n\n13\n00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:46.471\nBut how do we also safeguard the most\nimportant resource, the individuals that\n\n14\n00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:50.390\nwork for us, when they're traveling,\nwhen they're outside the organization?\n\n15\n00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.780\nThese are kind of things that\nwe also have to think about.\n\n16\n00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.290\nSo if we start from, okay let's take\na breath and actually speak English.\n\n17\n00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.330\nSo if we start from\nthe assumption that the main goal,\n\n18\n00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.360\nthe primary goal of security is\nto provide both confidentiality,\n\n19\n00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.490\nas we've often talked about,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n20\n00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.153\nWhen we're thinking about\nsafeguarding those things,\n\n21\n00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:16.981\nwe're thinking about protection mechanisms\nthat affect whether they're gonna\n\n22\n00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:19.213\nallow us to do so\nin a way that's not obtrusive.\n\n23\n00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:21.300\nWe don't want to get in the way\nof people doing their jobs.\n\n24\n00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.976\nI want to do so\n\n25\n00:01:21.976 --> 00:01:25.421\nin a way that allows people to\naccess information when necessary.\n\n26\n00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:29.111\nBut we also wanna make a clear statement\nat the same time that we are attempting to\n\n27\n00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:32.400\nsecure something, and\npeople need to pay attention to that.\n\n28\n00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.347\nWe think about physical security, we've\ntalked in different episodes before about\n\n29\n00:01:36.347 --> 00:01:39.877\nthings like having guards in the lobby,\nhaving closed circuit TV cameras.\n\n30\n00:01:39.877 --> 00:01:44.137\nPutting up a sign that says area under\nsurveillance, or do not trespass,\n\n31\n00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:48.930\nhaving a fence, these are all things\nthat are examples of physical security.\n\n32\n00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.886\nSo the essential components\nof security are still there.\n\n33\n00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:56.046\nWhen we add the word physical in front\nof it, we just want to make sure that we\n\n34\n00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:59.021\nare using mechanisms that focus us and,\ntherefore,\n\n35\n00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:03.600\nour ability to provide protection,\nto provide security in these key areas.\n\n36\n00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.355\nWhen we think about a physical system,\nthink about the parts that make it up,\n\n37\n00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:11.320\nit may be hard sometimes to envision how\nwe're ultimately gonna offer protection\n\n38\n00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.030\nand security to this particular item.\n\n39\n00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.908\nSo for instance, if we were to think\nabout the laptop that I'm using,\n\n40\n00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:21.014\nthat I'm presenting off of,\nMike has one here as well.\n\n41\n00:02:21.014 --> 00:02:22.640\nWe have two on the podiums with us.\n\n42\n00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.857\nIf we think about the security of\nthese two computers in the studio that\n\n43\n00:02:25.857 --> 00:02:28.583\nwe're in talking to you and\nultimately within the building\n\n44\n00:02:28.583 --> 00:02:31.665\nthe studio is in within the area\nthat the building is built in.\n\n45\n00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:35.491\nWe have to think about different\nlevels of security, different rings or\n\n46\n00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:39.819\nconcentric circles in theory that form\na defensive perimeter for the laptops that\n\n47\n00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.017\nare on the podium, in the room, out beyond\nthe room in the rest of the building,\n\n48\n00:02:44.017 --> 00:02:46.993\nand out in the building to\nthe various outside, right.\n\n49\n00:02:46.993 --> 00:02:48.620\nAnd we call this defense in depth.\n\n50\n00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.564\nWe think about the different\nlayers of defense.\n\n51\n00:02:50.564 --> 00:02:55.054\nAnd how we ultimately are interacting\nthrough those layers to provide a security\n\n52\n00:02:55.054 --> 00:02:59.874\nbarrier, multiple barriers that will allow\nus to effectively protect and ultimately\n\n53\n00:02:59.874 --> 00:03:04.828\nprovide confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability protections to the systems at\n\n54\n00:03:04.828 --> 00:03:09.370\nthe heart of it, in this case the laptops,\nand the data that they contain.\n\n55\n00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.760\nIf we create multiple boundaries,\nmultiple borders or security perimeters\n\n56\n00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.980\naround these devices, we are more likely\nto keep out bad actors and prevent them\n\n57\n00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.200\nfrom getting to our data than if we simply\nrely on only one protective mechanism.\n\n58\n00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.300\nSo for instance, if all we did was\nphysically constrain the laptops by using\n\n59\n00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.440\nsome sort of locking mechanism and locking\nthem to the podium here in front of us,\n\n60\n00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.210\nMike and\nI could safely walk out of the room and\n\n61\n00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.890\nprobably know that nobody would\nactually walk off with the laptops.\n\n62\n00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.990\nThey probably would be hard\npressed to steal them.\n\n63\n00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.747\nBut what if they came up and\nplugged in a USB device and\n\n64\n00:03:42.747 --> 00:03:45.954\ncopied data off the laptops cuz\nwe left the USB ports active?\n\n65\n00:03:45.954 --> 00:03:50.326\nWhat if they came up and\nthey were able to somehow insert\n\n66\n00:03:50.326 --> 00:03:54.808\nsomething into the system\nthat loaded malware into it?\n\n67\n00:03:54.808 --> 00:03:56.352\nOr perhaps remotely controlled and\n\n68\n00:03:56.352 --> 00:03:59.859\nremotely connected to the system without\neven physically interacting with it.\n\n69\n00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.424\nBut if we left the firewall in a state\nthat would allow inbound connections to\n\n70\n00:04:03.424 --> 00:04:06.153\ntake place and somebody was\nable to connect to the system,\n\n71\n00:04:06.153 --> 00:04:09.609\nmaybe remotely they could connect and\nnot even need to worry about being in\n\n72\n00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.910\nthe room, let alone in the building,\nor even in the area, right?\n\n73\n00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.920\nThey could be anywhere.\n\n74\n00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.580\nSo my point is that all these defensive\nmechanisms have to kind of line up\n\n75\n00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.950\nin order to to add multiple\nlayers of protection.\n\n76\n00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.480\nBut the key there is that\nthey have to be additive.\n\n77\n00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.680\nIt's not enough just to say I've\ndone something so I'm protected.\n\n78\n00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.460\nWe have to do multiple things,\nin other words,\n\n79\n00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.250\nbecause protection is really gonna to\nbe an interlocking set of controls\n\n80\n00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.200\nthat have to ultimately add up\nto a protective solution for us.\n\n81\n00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.820\nSo we want to be thinking about that.\n\n82\n00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.580\nWe've talked a lot about access\ncontrol in prior episodes.\n\n83\n00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.470\nAccess control plays a part in this.\n\n84\n00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.440\nHave to think about whether or\n\n85\n00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.030\nnot we're going to allow individuals\nto gain entry into the system.\n\n86\n00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.070\nWill they be able to come into\nthe studio and then get to the laptops?\n\n87\n00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.730\nThe answer is maybe,\ndepends on what kinds of controls we have.\n\n88\n00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.330\nDo we have locks on the doors?\n\n89\n00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.290\nDo we have cameras that will allow us to\nsee who's out there and buzz people in?\n\n90\n00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.660\nDo we have signs on\nthe doors that say no entry,\n\n91\n00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.270\nauthorized people only, or whatever?\n\n92\n00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.760\nMay do a variety of things so\nwe want to think about that.\n\n93\n00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.480\nWe may use different kinds of cards,\n\n94\n00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.420\nsmart cards that allow us to swipe in if\nwe have a badging solution on the door.\n\n95\n00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.450\nWe may have what's called a mag stripe or\njust a magnetic stripe card.\n\n96\n00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.990\nThat's the kinda card that most\nof us are probably familiar with.\n\n97\n00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.370\nYour credit cards effectively, and your\ndriver's license, depending on what state\n\n98\n00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.330\nyour driver's license is issued in,\nis gonna look like this.\n\n99\n00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.057\nYou take your card out of your pocket,\nflip it over, there's a magnetic stripe of\n\n100\n00:05:27.057 --> 00:05:30.912\na thin magnetic tape on the back\nthat holds some information in it.\n\n101\n00:05:30.912 --> 00:05:32.514\nYou swipe it through a reader, and\n\n102\n00:05:32.514 --> 00:05:35.841\nthe information is transferred to\nthe reader and is read from the card.\n\n103\n00:05:35.841 --> 00:05:38.545\nAnd then based on the information\nyou provide, the card may or\n\n104\n00:05:38.545 --> 00:05:40.880\nmay not authorize some\nactivity to take place.\n\n105\n00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.710\nWe have what's known as a prox card or\na proximity card.\n\n106\n00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.430\nThis is gonna be a card that is\ngonna have a chip embedded in it.\n\n107\n00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.444\nBut it is typically not powered itself.\n\n108\n00:05:48.444 --> 00:05:49.940\nIt is read from the reader.\n\n109\n00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.100\nSo the reader provides power\nto the chip in the card.\n\n110\n00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.907\nBut when the card gets within\na couple of feet of the reader,\n\n111\n00:05:55.907 --> 00:05:59.556\nthere may be an antenna in the card that\nwill actually allow us to power up and to\n\n112\n00:05:59.556 --> 00:06:03.790\nsend and receive signals, in effect would\nthen allow us to exchange information.\n\n113\n00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.920\nIt really just depends on\nthe nature of the card.\n\n114\n00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.359\nBut prox cards, you can tell people\nare using prox cards, where if they have\n\n115\n00:06:09.359 --> 00:06:12.850\na wallet, they take it out and wave it\nat the reader on the door sometimes, And\n\n116\n00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.232\nthen the door opens, that's cuz they\nhave a prox card inside the wallet.\n\n117\n00:06:16.232 --> 00:06:19.770\nOr they may, if they have the lanyard and\nkind of the card is sitting in their\n\n118\n00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.194\npocket, right, they often walk by,\nand they kinda do one of these, and\n\n119\n00:06:23.194 --> 00:06:24.561\nget up close to the reader,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n120\n00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:26.279\n>> Or they just walk by the reader like\n\n121\n00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.956\nthis but they have it inside their\npocket somewhere, but the door opens,\n\n122\n00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:31.735\nbecause within about a foot or two,\n\n123\n00:06:31.735 --> 00:06:35.026\nthose proximity cards power up\nwhen they get close to the reader.\n\n124\n00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:38.370\nAnd they're then able to exchange\ninformation, send it back and forth.\n\n125\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.340\nWe may have smart cards with chips\nthat are embedded in the card\n\n126\n00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.540\nthat you stick into a reader directly.\n\n127\n00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.470\nThis would be the chip and\n\n128\n00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.020\nPIN technology that's inserted into\nnew credit cards these days, right?\n\n129\n00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.810\nSo if your credit card has an actual\nchip on the front of it or\n\n130\n00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:56.130\nsomewhere in it, then that would be\nsomething that you would actually see.\n\n131\n00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.330\nWe probably can show you\nan example of one of those.\n\n132\n00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.931\nSo you can see that that\nsilver area right there,\n\n133\n00:07:01.931 --> 00:07:04.990\nthat's the chip that's\nactually embedded in the card.\n\n134\n00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:08.638\nAnd so a smart card would have a chip\nlike that, and you can insert it in.\n\n135\n00:07:08.638 --> 00:07:12.420\nI don't have my Microsoft ID with me,\nor I would show you that.\n\n136\n00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.940\nThat also has a chip embedded in it as\nwell, but the idea is basically the same.\n\n137\n00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:21.128\nThat chip embedded in my credit card\nactually is going to be a smart card like\n\n138\n00:07:21.128 --> 00:07:25.526\nchip that stores information in there and\nallows us to actually see what it is.\n\n139\n00:07:25.526 --> 00:07:29.426\nAnd where we can then use it in any reader\nthat's going to be able to effectively\n\n140\n00:07:29.426 --> 00:07:31.715\ninteract with that information, right?\n\n141\n00:07:31.715 --> 00:07:32.995\nSo it's the same general idea.\n\n142\n00:07:32.995 --> 00:07:35.215\nThat's what we're thinking about and\nwe're talking about.\n\n143\n00:07:35.215 --> 00:07:37.575\nWe may be using things\nlike closed circuit TVs.\n\n144\n00:07:37.575 --> 00:07:38.710\nWe talked about monitoring.\n\n145\n00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.874\nAnd one of the things you often have in\nremote solutions is we will typically have\n\n146\n00:07:42.874 --> 00:07:46.541\nthe ability to be able to have\nan external camera outside somewhere and\n\n147\n00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:49.044\na monitor se we can see\nyou standing at the door.\n\n148\n00:07:49.044 --> 00:07:50.431\nYou'll buzz people in, right,\n\n149\n00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:53.164\nwithout allowing them to actually\nget in without our knowledge.\n\n150\n00:07:53.164 --> 00:07:55.022\nI've talked about man\ntraps before as well.\n\n151\n00:07:55.022 --> 00:07:58.427\nMan traps are kinda fun Only\nif you're controlling the door\n\n152\n00:07:58.427 --> 00:08:01.501\nrelease on the other side,\notherwise, not so much.\n\n153\n00:08:01.501 --> 00:08:05.500\nBut man traps are where you walk into,\neffectively, a box.\n\n154\n00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.910\nAnd the box is a gateway between two\nareas, an unsecured and secure area.\n\n155\n00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.060\nMuch like a DMZ but\n\n156\n00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.290\nit's actually like a physical DMZ,\nif you think about the logic of it.\n\n157\n00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.010\nYou walk through the doorway\nfrom the unsecured side.\n\n158\n00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.540\nYou go into a box that effectively is\na portion of a room or whatever it is,\n\n159\n00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.340\na hallway,\nthat's just been security perimetered off.\n\n160\n00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.680\nThere may be a guard\ninside that checks you in,\n\n161\n00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.390\nthere may not be, you just may be\nwalking through a pass through portal.\n\n162\n00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.310\nThere is some sort of activity that goes\non, either somebody looks at you and\n\n163\n00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.140\nscans you, you swipe a card,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n164\n00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:35.980\nBut however that's done,\n\n165\n00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.810\nthe first door that leads back to\nthe unsecured area must close and\n\n166\n00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:44.390\nlock securely before the external door, in\nother words, must close and lock securely,\n\n167\n00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.070\nbefore the internal door lets you into\nthe internal secure area opens up.\n\n168\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.810\nThat's what a man trap is.\n\n169\n00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.370\nSo you see these in\nbanks a lot these days.\n\n170\n00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.930\nBanks are using them where you will\neffectively walk through the lobby.\n\n171\n00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.700\nAnd you're walking through,\nit's usually a clear box.\n\n172\n00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.860\nYou may not even realize you're walking\nthrough it unless you happen to look.\n\n173\n00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.710\nBut it's made of bulletproof glass.\n\n174\n00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.640\nAnd there's a reason for that.\n\n175\n00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.260\nBecause if they stick somebody inside\nthere they don't want to get out,\n\n176\n00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.710\nit's usually cuz they have a gun cuz\nthey're trying to hold up the bank.\n\n177\n00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.360\nSo you walk through this portal.\n\n178\n00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.040\nAnd the reason for it, ultimately, is that\nif somebody does try to hold up the bank,\n\n179\n00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.890\nas they're trying to escape,\nthey basically get stuck in the box.\n\n180\n00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.750\nThen the police come along and you'll\ncapture them, but they can't get out.\n\n181\n00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.750\nThey just can't shoot their way out and\nthey can't break out, typically.\n\n182\n00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.380\nWe also see these a lot,\nbelieve it or not, in hospitals,\n\n183\n00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.290\non maternity floors where the babies are.\n\n184\n00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:33.370\nBecause unfortunately, there have been\nrashes of baby thefts over the years.\n\n185\n00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.957\nAnd as a result of that,\nthey're doing the man traps,\n\n186\n00:09:35.957 --> 00:09:37.680\nthey're also doing the baby LoJack.\n\n187\n00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.070\nWhere they actually, and\nwe did this when my kids were born,\n\n188\n00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.290\nit's kinda cool,\nthey put a band on the parent, right?\n\n189\n00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.380\nSo you get a little arm band that\nidentifies you and the mother and\n\n190\n00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.170\nthe father have it.\n\n191\n00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.410\nAnd they band the baby with\na little band that matches.\n\n192\n00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:51.210\nBut they also have a little\ntransceiver on it.\n\n193\n00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:54.037\nSo if the baby gets taken for\nsome reason, and all the other\n\n194\n00:09:54.037 --> 00:09:57.857\nsecurity mechanisms fail, they can track\nthe baby anywhere in the hospital.\n\n195\n00:09:57.857 --> 00:10:01.402\nBecause they have the wireless sensors\nthat read the tag that can tell you where\n\n196\n00:10:01.402 --> 00:10:02.340\nthe child is.\n\n197\n00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.275\nSo it's actually kinda cool\nbecause they match your bands.\n\n198\n00:10:04.275 --> 00:10:05.495\nYou walk through a man trap.\n\n199\n00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:07.875\nThey match your bands up and\nregister you and say,\n\n200\n00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:09.245\nwell do you have a child that's here?\n\n201\n00:10:09.245 --> 00:10:12.115\nAnd they don't let you in if you don't\nactually have a registered child.\n\n202\n00:10:12.115 --> 00:10:13.935\nSo it's kind of interesting\nhow they do these things.\n\n203\n00:10:13.935 --> 00:10:16.950\nBut they're adapting those security\ntechnologies to, obviously,\n\n204\n00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.555\nplaces where they need them.\n\n205\n00:10:18.555 --> 00:10:21.245\nSo things like surveillance,\ndeterrence, assessment.\n\n206\n00:10:21.245 --> 00:10:23.245\nThese are all things that\nclosed circuit TVs and\n\n207\n00:10:23.245 --> 00:10:25.385\nthese kind of technologies\ncan actually provide for us.\n\n208\n00:10:25.385 --> 00:10:26.935\nSo we want to think about that.\n\n209\n00:10:26.935 --> 00:10:28.284\nWhat about external monitoring?\n\n210\n00:10:28.284 --> 00:10:30.794\nThings that take place\non the outer perimeter,\n\n211\n00:10:30.794 --> 00:10:32.685\nsuch as infrared sensors, right?\n\n212\n00:10:32.685 --> 00:10:36.718\nSo we may have low light sensors where\nwe can set up a sensor net or a mesh or\n\n213\n00:10:36.718 --> 00:10:38.750\na web of interlocking light beams.\n\n214\n00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.260\nIf you cross the beam,\nthen the alarm goes off.\n\n215\n00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.757\nAnd they have microwave relays\nthat are being used, again,\n\n216\n00:10:45.757 --> 00:10:51.768\nsending out basically signals across a\nbeam that are invisible to the human eye.\n\n217\n00:10:51.768 --> 00:10:54.990\nAnd so you walk through that beam and\neffectively break that plane.\n\n218\n00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.900\nSo they can use microwaves to do this,\ninfrared.\n\n219\n00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:59.730\nWe can use all sorts of different things.\n\n220\n00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.470\nYou may have coaxial\nstrain sensitive cabling.\n\n221\n00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.290\nEffectively what that means is you\nhave a fence that's got some sort of\n\n222\n00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.230\nmesh running through it.\n\n223\n00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.090\nIf you cut through the fence,\nyou effectively set off the alarm.\n\n224\n00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.600\nBecause the interwoven\nmesh is the alarm system.\n\n225\n00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.930\nIt's the alarm matrix or grid.\n\n226\n00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:17.740\nAnd when you cut through the fence, you\ncut the contacts and set off the alarm.\n\n227\n00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.660\nWe also have motion sensitive lighting,\nlighting that comes on when we move,\n\n228\n00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.300\nthings like that.\n\n229\n00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.305\nWe have cameras that track motion.\n\n230\n00:11:23.305 --> 00:11:24.135\nNight vision, so\n\n231\n00:11:24.135 --> 00:11:28.995\nthey can see people moving around in low\nlight scenarios, monitoring, displays.\n\n232\n00:11:28.995 --> 00:11:31.735\nSo we have heads up displays that\nlet us see large volumes of areas.\n\n233\n00:11:31.735 --> 00:11:33.425\nWe talked about guards,\nwe talked about alarms.\n\n234\n00:11:33.425 --> 00:11:36.085\nThese are all ways in which we\ncan monitor electronically.\n\n235\n00:11:36.085 --> 00:11:39.525\nBut also, not just electronically,\nbut internally versus externally,\n\n236\n00:11:39.525 --> 00:11:40.655\nis what we're thinking about.\n\n237\n00:11:40.655 --> 00:11:43.165\nAnd these are typically\nexternal monitor solutions.\n\n238\n00:11:43.165 --> 00:11:45.870\nBut some of them could be approached and\nused for internal.\n\n239\n00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.250\nYou have things like infrared light beams,\n\n240\n00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.790\ncan be used internally as well as\nexternally in some situations.\n\n241\n00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:56.470\nMay have acoustic sensors, may have card\nreaders, we may have passive infrared\n\n242\n00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.650\ntechnology that's used inside buildings,\nthings like that.\n\n243\n00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.600\nSo this is where you have like a sensor\non the door, or a sensor in the room and\n\n244\n00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.500\nyou walk in, the lights go on,\nthe door opens, that kind of thing.\n\n245\n00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.120\nThat's passive infrared technology.\n\n246\n00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.640\nIt just reads the factor are there and\nit opens up for you.\n\n247\n00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.736\nYou may have badge control, automatic\nrequest exits,what are calledl rec\n\n248\n00:12:14.736 --> 00:12:18.810\nsystems, where again, you may have\nthe sensor that you walk up to.\n\n249\n00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.422\nWhen the system is active,\nit automatically lets you out.\n\n250\n00:12:21.422 --> 00:12:24.087\nYou may have to hit a button\nthat will release a mag lock or\n\n251\n00:12:24.087 --> 00:12:25.637\nsomething like that to get out.\n\n252\n00:12:25.637 --> 00:12:27.825\nThere's different ways\nthese systems may work.\n\n253\n00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:31.871\nBut these are all monitoring systems that\nwould allow us to physically secure areas.\n\n254\n00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:35.605\nThings like doors, we've talked about,\nwindows, we've talked about turnstiles.\n\n255\n00:12:35.605 --> 00:12:38.640\nWe've talked about man traps,\nlocks, keys, safes.\n\n256\n00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.470\nThere are all examples of\nphysical security solutions\n\n257\n00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.990\nthat we may choose to implement.\n\n258\n00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:46.250\nWhen we think about physical\nsecurity inside of an organization,\n\n259\n00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.830\nthere's a lot of different\napproaches in other words, right?\n\n260\n00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.000\nIt doesn't have to be complex.\n\n261\n00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.480\nIt doesn't have to be expensive.\n\n262\n00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.890\nIt just has to work.\n\n263\n00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.510\nAnd the more complex we make it sometimes,\nthe harder it is to get it to work.\n\n264\n00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.780\nThe reality is, a guard sitting at a desk\nasking people to sign in when they walk\n\n265\n00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.450\ninto a lobby,\nis an incredibly effective and\n\n266\n00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.650\nrelatively cost efficient mechanism for\nphysical control.\n\n267\n00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.855\nHaving an automated building system\nthat has the touch screen for\n\n268\n00:13:10.855 --> 00:13:15.218\ntyping in the person you want to see and\nsending the request to them.\n\n269\n00:13:15.218 --> 00:13:19.004\nAnd it automatically unlocks the elevator\nand tells you where to go, and\n\n270\n00:13:19.004 --> 00:13:20.095\nall that stuff.\n\n271\n00:13:20.095 --> 00:13:24.791\nThat's all cool, but the reality is, just\none good EMP device, it's all gone, right?\n\n272\n00:13:24.791 --> 00:13:26.970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I mean, it's just all a smoking ruin.\n\n273\n00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:29.210\nSo the reality is it\nmay be overly complex.\n\n274\n00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.882\nIt works really well.\n\n275\n00:13:29.882 --> 00:13:34.679\nI have a customer, for instance, one of\nmy big customers in the Caribbean that\n\n276\n00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:39.830\nhas the only LEED building certified that\nI know of in their country right now.\n\n277\n00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:40.860\nReally cool technology,\n\n278\n00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.250\nthey've got all whiz bang stuff,\nall sorts of bells and whistles.\n\n279\n00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.530\nAnd I love going to visit\nthem when I'm there.\n\n280\n00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:50.320\nBecause you walk in, building's fully\nautomated, so you walk up to the desk.\n\n281\n00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.461\nThey do have guards and stuff there.\n\n282\n00:13:51.461 --> 00:13:55.240\nBut you walk up, you tell them who you're\nthere to see, they say, okay no problem,\n\n283\n00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.106\nthey notify them.\n\n284\n00:13:56.106 --> 00:14:00.280\nAnd then when the person comes down\nthey'll tell you, okay elevator five.\n\n285\n00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:01.360\nWhy five?\n\n286\n00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.680\nBecause elevators are programmed\nautomatically and\n\n287\n00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.690\nmanaged in the building based on power and\nload.\n\n288\n00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.670\nThere's a computer that does all this, so\n\n289\n00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.770\nbased on who you're going to see,\nwhat floor they're on, and\n\n290\n00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:13.730\nwhere everybody else is in the elevator\nchain as they're going up and down.\n\n291\n00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:17.200\nThey tell you what elevator to use\ncuz that's the optimized elevator for\n\n292\n00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.830\nyou based on power management,\nkind of an interesting concept really.\n\n293\n00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.970\nIt's kinda cool, they lock out floors\nyou're not allowed to get to as a guest,\n\n294\n00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.320\nso they don't let you\nget off anywhere else.\n\n295\n00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.670\nSo they totally control the system, which\nis neat, but it's a lot of technology.\n\n296\n00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.640\nWhat if something goes wrong?\n\n297\n00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.870\nWhat if you're in the elevator and\n\n298\n00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:34.460\nthe computer decides to\ngo take a coffee break?\n\n299\n00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.210\nI don't know, I mean, that could happen.\n\n300\n00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.280\nIt is Windows, it could theoretically\ndecide it wants to have a break.\n\n301\n00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:40.870\nWho knows what?\n\n302\n00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.800\nI'm just pointing out, reality is\nwhen that kind of stuff is working,\n\n303\n00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.390\nit works really well.\n\n304\n00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:50.180\nBut when that kind of stuff doesn't work,\nmaybe it's not working so well.\n\n305\n00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:54.660\nSo my question as security professional\nis always, what's my fallback, right?\n\n306\n00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.542\nIf I can't auto assign elevators and\nlock out floors,\n\n307\n00:14:57.542 --> 00:15:01.063\nare the elevators gonna open on\nevery floor as they pick people up?\n\n308\n00:15:01.063 --> 00:15:04.735\nIf the system isn't working, can somebody\nwho's supposed to go floor five get off on\n\n309\n00:15:04.735 --> 00:15:07.540\nfloor two and go see something\nthey're not supposed to see?\n\n310\n00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.349\nIf the answer is yes,\nI better have a guard that's riding up and\n\n311\n00:15:10.349 --> 00:15:12.743\ndown that elevator,\nasking me where you're going.\n\n312\n00:15:12.743 --> 00:15:16.060\nAnd making sure you don't get off on\na floor you're not authorized to see.\n\n313\n00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.580\nI better be writing down on a piece of\npaper what floor you're going to and\n\n314\n00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.180\nmake you give that to the guard\nbefore you get on the elevator.\n\n315\n00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.550\nThat's a manual process,\nit's time intensive, but guess what?\n\n316\n00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.040\nPencils and\npapers don't tend to break very often.\n\n317\n00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.500\nPencils do, I shouldn't say that,\nright, but pens and pencils and\n\n318\n00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.060\npapers are gonna be really\ngood analog technology.\n\n319\n00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.481\nSometimes the old fashioned works really\nwell is what I'm suggesting to you.\n\n320\n00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:44.887\nAnd what we often overlook, as security\nprofessionals in the modern world,\n\n321\n00:15:44.887 --> 00:15:49.357\nwith all the whiz bang technology that we\nuse, is that there may be a simpler and\n\n322\n00:15:49.357 --> 00:15:51.426\neasier way to get to the same place.\n\n323\n00:15:51.426 --> 00:15:55.472\nIt may not be as sexy, it may not be\nas cool, it may not be as exciting But\n\n324\n00:15:55.472 --> 00:15:57.267\nit's gonna work really well.\n\n325\n00:15:57.267 --> 00:16:01.607\nAnd sometimes really well is whats\nmost important, not sexy, cool, and\n\n326\n00:16:01.607 --> 00:16:06.790\nexciting and wow look at us we have the\nlatest technology and aren't we the best.\n\n327\n00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:10.130\nYeah, you're the best until your\ntechnology doesn't work and then you may\n\n328\n00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.650\nnot be because maybe somebody's gonna come\nand take all your stuff away from you.\n\n329\n00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:16.686\nSo you always wanna be thinking,\nwhat can I do if something doesn't work?\n\n330\n00:16:16.686 --> 00:16:21.192\nThat's the CISSP, incredibly valuable set\nof skills you wanna have in your mind and\n\n331\n00:16:21.192 --> 00:16:23.220\nunderstand how to deploy it.\n\n332\n00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.846\nWe talked a little bit about personnel\nsecurity being the focus of this\n\n333\n00:16:25.846 --> 00:16:26.910\nepisode, as well.\n\n334\n00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.970\nSo I wanna talk about some things\nthat relate to personal security.\n\n335\n00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:32.930\nWe talked before about some of the obvious\nthings, take your badge off when\n\n336\n00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:37.170\nyou go outside the office,\ndon't wear logowear outside the office.\n\n337\n00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:41.830\nYou can wear your cool socks, that is\nacceptable but don't wear your logowear.\n\n338\n00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.790\nBut when you travel, think about this,\nshould you take your laptop with you,\n\n339\n00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.080\nyour mobile device with\nyou when you travel?\n\n340\n00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.865\nA lot of people say, well yeah, I'm going\non a business trip that's the whole point.\n\n341\n00:16:50.865 --> 00:16:54.731\nBut what if you're going to a country\nwhere that information may be suspect and\n\n342\n00:16:54.731 --> 00:16:56.380\nthat device may be compromised.\n\n343\n00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:00.930\nSo, for instance, when people travel over\nseas to certain countries they are told in\n\n344\n00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.180\nno uncertain terms depending on\nwhich organization they may work for\n\n345\n00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.170\nthat they cannot take anything with\nthem that will expose any information.\n\n346\n00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.670\nNow, whatever they take with them,\n\n347\n00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:12.750\nis going to effectively be assumed to\nbe compromised when they come back.\n\n348\n00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.260\nWe call them burn devices.\n\n349\n00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.433\nAnd effectively, you're given a loaner\nlaptop that's got nothing on it.\n\n350\n00:17:17.433 --> 00:17:19.250\nAnd it's basically a clean load.\n\n351\n00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.580\nAnd when you come back,\nwe sanitize that device.\n\n352\n00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.080\nWe don't let you hook\nit up to the network.\n\n353\n00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.590\nWe take the hard drive, and\neffectively we wipe it.\n\n354\n00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:28.640\nAnd we do a complete scan on the box\nbecause we assume in certain\n\n355\n00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.810\nparts of the world that your devices\nare going to be the target of espionage.\n\n356\n00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:37.190\nGovernment and or non-government entities\nare gonna try to hack into your system and\n\n357\n00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.510\ntake stuff from you.\n\n358\n00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.480\nDo you leave your laptop in the hotel\nwhen you go to a business meeting?\n\n359\n00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.400\nWhen you travel?\n\n360\n00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.020\nSomething pretty obvious,\nbut a lot of us may do that.\n\n361\n00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.070\nIf you do that,\n\n362\n00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:49.290\nhow do you know what's going on with\nthat machine when you're not there?\n\n363\n00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:50.810\nYou don't know.\nSomebody could come in.\n\n364\n00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:52.343\nCould implant malware on it.\n\n365\n00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:54.750\nCould take the hard drive out,\ncopy it, put it back.\n\n366\n00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.372\nYou don't know.\n\n367\n00:17:55.372 --> 00:17:56.880\nYou have no way of knowing.\n\n368\n00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.958\nOh, I hide it in my luggage\nis what people tell me.\n\n369\n00:17:58.958 --> 00:18:00.420\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, I hide it in my luggage cuz you\n\n370\n00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.020\nknow the thief that breaks in is not smart\nenough to go open your luggage and go.\n\n371\n00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.860\nHuh, let me see if Adam\nleft his laptop here.\n\n372\n00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.050\nI came all this way, he didn't leave\nit on the desk, I'm gonna leave.\n\n373\n00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.490\nI can't believe he did that.\n\n374\n00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.070\nHow rude he knew I was coming.\n\n375\n00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.680\nAnd he knew I was here to steal it and\nhe put it away.\n\n376\n00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.649\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> How desensitive, or\n\n377\n00:18:16.649 --> 00:18:19.080\nhow sensitive am I suppose to be?\n\n378\n00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.930\nSo the reality is people gonna\ngo to that much trouble,\n\n379\n00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:26.022\nthey're gonna go look in your bag,\nI hear that from people.\n\n380\n00:18:26.022 --> 00:18:29.090\nI'm like, if that's the world you live in.\n\n381\n00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:29.860\n>> Makes you feel good.\n\n382\n00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.620\n>> Be you, but\n\n383\n00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.330\nI don't wanna be you in the same place\nyou're being you at the same time you are.\n\n384\n00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.360\nSo make sure you don't take things\nthat are obviously gonna be a problem.\n\n385\n00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.740\nYou should go through your bags.\n\n386\n00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.160\nTake everything out that's gonna\npresent a challenge for you.\n\n387\n00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.980\nMake sure you don't take\nthat stuff with you.\n\n388\n00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:47.110\nWhen I travel, I don't take all\nthe credit cards, all the business cards,\n\n389\n00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:49.710\nall the junk that I carry around\nwith me when I'm at home.\n\n390\n00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.360\nI take just a couple of things.\n\n391\n00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.040\nI mean, I take basically a computer,\n\n392\n00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.530\nthe same computer I work on if I'm\ngoing places that I know I can trust.\n\n393\n00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.880\nIf I'm going to places that I\nknow I'm gonna have a problem,\n\n394\n00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.530\nI borrow a loaner computer that\nis essentially a clean machine.\n\n395\n00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:06.960\nAnd I don't access any secure\ndevices when I'm there.\n\n396\n00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.240\nI don't access any secure\nwebsites when I'm there.\n\n397\n00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.034\nYou also have a thing about what\ninformation you're pulling down through\n\n398\n00:19:12.034 --> 00:19:13.395\nthe Cloud, in the same scenarios.\n\n399\n00:19:13.395 --> 00:19:16.247\nBecause if it's gonna be taken from\nyou on the machine,I promise you,\n\n400\n00:19:16.247 --> 00:19:19.536\nyou connecting to it in the Cloud, they're\ngonna look at that traffic, as well.\n\n401\n00:19:19.536 --> 00:19:22.020\nPeople say, oh but it's encrypted,\noh but it's secure!\n\n402\n00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:23.080\nIt's this, it's that!\n\n403\n00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.909\nYeah, I'm sure it all is but if we're\ntalking about a government trying to get\n\n404\n00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:29.810\ninformation from you,\nas opposed to a private entity, and\n\n405\n00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.814\nin some of these countries, you have to\nworry about the government spying on you,\n\n406\n00:19:33.814 --> 00:19:36.018\nnot just the private\nentities spying on you,\n\n407\n00:19:36.018 --> 00:19:39.190\nthat government has resources\nthat most people don't.\n\n408\n00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.010\nThat government may be able to\nread your encrypted traffic.\n\n409\n00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.910\nAnd if you take the chance of\naccessing it while you're there,\n\n410\n00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.550\nthey're gonna record it, at a minimum.\n\n411\n00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:49.242\nWhether they can read it or\nnot is really irrelevant.\n\n412\n00:19:49.242 --> 00:19:50.480\nThey're gonna have a copy of it,\n\n413\n00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.580\nwhat they do with it at that point is\nreally up to them and you don't know.\n\n414\n00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:57.030\nDon't do anything in other words\nthat you don't want people to see.\n\n415\n00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.860\nIt's one of the most important\nthings we can tell people about.\n\n416\n00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:02.140\nTrain them on when they are traveling,\n\n417\n00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.450\nwe also have to train them that if they\nget into duress, if something goes wrong,\n\n418\n00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:08.480\nthey have to have a way to contact us and\nlet us know there's a problem.\n\n419\n00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.710\nWe have to make sure they understand what\nthe procedures and the policies are for\n\n420\n00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.090\ntravelling, in other words, and\n\n421\n00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.780\nthat if there is a concern we have\na list of numbers they go down.\n\n422\n00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.390\nIf they're in a foreign country, they know\nhow to contact an embassy, somebody's\n\n423\n00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:24.740\naware of where they are, what their\nagenda and their travel arrangements are.\n\n424\n00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.400\nThey don't show up somewhere, we have\nto work backwards and figure out why.\n\n425\n00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.030\nAnd these are important things we\ndon't often stop and think about.\n\n426\n00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.620\nBut you have to really consider them.\n\n427\n00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:37.020\nAnd you have to train your people that are\ngoing into the field about these things.\n\n428\n00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.850\nThey walk out the door and go,\nall right, I've got a trip.\n\n429\n00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.221\nI'll be back in two weeks, see you later.\n\n430\n00:20:40.221 --> 00:20:41.802\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Somebody's got to know where\n\n431\n00:20:41.802 --> 00:20:42.800\nthey're going.\n\n432\n00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.910\nSomebody's got to know what they're doing.\n\n433\n00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:44.870\nWhat's their agenda.\n\n434\n00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.600\nAnd what's their kind of their schedule.\n\n435\n00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.480\nMaking sure we can keep\ntabs on our people,\n\n436\n00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.960\nin other words, is one of the ways\nwe provide for security for them.\n\n437\n00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.940\nWe may not send them out in\nthe field with a bodyguard but\n\n438\n00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.350\nwe have to make sure we know\nwhere they are at all times.\n\n439\n00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.280\nWhen I did do some work for\nMicrosoft, when I was in the field,\n\n440\n00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.650\nI was traveling and\nI was in India, for instance.\n\n441\n00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.370\nI was traveling with some very high\nlevel executives from Microsoft,\n\n442\n00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:11.020\nsenior VPs from the company and they had\nhandlers and all this kinda stuff and\n\n443\n00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.930\npeople were always around them keeping\nthem on task and doing whatever, but there\n\n444\n00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:19.710\nwere multiple people in that organization\nthat knew our agenda, our itinerary.\n\n445\n00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:22.180\nKnew everything we were doing down\nto the minute where we were for\n\n446\n00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.390\nthe entire time we were on that trip,\nnot because I was so important,\n\n447\n00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.410\nthey probably could have\ncared less about me.\n\n448\n00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:30.000\nBut because they wanted to know where\ntheir people were at all times.\n\n449\n00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.730\nAnd if something went wrong, if we had to\ncontact somebody, somebody had to contact\n\n450\n00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:37.620\nus, whatever, they knew exactly where\nwe were and what we were doing.\n\n451\n00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.591\nWhat meeting we were at, who we were\nmeeting with, who they could contact\n\n452\n00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:45.753\nto get ahold of us at any given moment\nin our day throughout the multi-day trip\n\n453\n00:21:45.753 --> 00:21:49.551\nwhere I was in five different places\ninside India over several weeks.\n\n454\n00:21:49.551 --> 00:21:50.294\nThat kind of thing.\n\n455\n00:21:50.294 --> 00:21:52.725\nSo it's very important to\nhave that level of detail,\n\n456\n00:21:52.725 --> 00:21:56.650\nto have that level of understanding of\nwhat people are doing and where they are.\n\n457\n00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:58.970\nAgree ahead of time, in other words,\non what that will be.\n\n458\n00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:01.930\nMake sure that people are trained\non contact procedures,\n\n459\n00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:06.960\nmake sure they understand how to securely\nsafeguard information, make sure that they\n\n460\n00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.590\nunderstand something as simple\nas not calling 911 overseas.\n\n461\n00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:16.645\nI mean, the reality is we have a 911\nthought process, an emergency services\n\n462\n00:22:16.645 --> 00:22:21.720\nstuff process, in almost every country\nin the world, but it's not always 911,\n\n463\n00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.990\nand so if you're used to growing up\nin America, in the United States, and\n\n464\n00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.840\nyou call 911 for emergency services,\nwhat do you do when you're in Mexico?\n\n465\n00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.800\nWhat do you if you're in Bolivia or\nBrazil, or you're in, I don't know,\n\n466\n00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.540\nBotswana, or you're in Canada?\n\n467\n00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.000\nI mean, it may be the same but\n\n468\n00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.130\nit may be a different combination\nof numbers, you have to know.\n\n469\n00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.530\nAnd it's this kind of stuff that you have\nto think about training people and giving\n\n470\n00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.760\nthem the awareness of, because you don't\nwant somebody Googling on the phone and\n\n471\n00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.530\ntrying to figure out how to call\nthe equivalent emergency services\n\n472\n00:22:49.530 --> 00:22:52.530\nwhen there's a problem, you want them\nto just be able to get what they need.\n\n473\n00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.080\nSo making sure that people\nare trained on these things\n\n474\n00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.766\nis part of personal security, as well.\n\n475\n00:22:56.766 --> 00:23:02.060\nAs CISSPs,\nwe wanna make sure that we are thinking\n\n476\n00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:05.725\nabout how to safeguard and remember this\ncomes back to the code of ethics for us.\n\n477\n00:23:05.725 --> 00:23:09.650\nWanna make sure we're safeguarding\nnot just information but also life.\n\n478\n00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.050\nLife safety is very,\nvery critical, very important.\n\n479\n00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:16.180\nThe most precious resource that\na company has is its people.\n\n480\n00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.070\nI should work for Hallmark.\n\n481\n00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.818\nThat was beautiful.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n482\n00:23:17.818 --> 00:23:18.665\n>> That would make a great card.\n\n483\n00:23:18.665 --> 00:23:19.675\n>> Absolutely beautiful.\n\n484\n00:23:19.675 --> 00:23:20.371\n>> Be a great card.\n\n485\n00:23:20.371 --> 00:23:21.775\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, it's very important,\n\n486\n00:23:21.775 --> 00:23:23.134\nall kidding aside, it's very important.\n\n487\n00:23:23.134 --> 00:23:24.551\nIt is part of the code of ethics.\n\n488\n00:23:24.551 --> 00:23:26.651\nSafeguard life as well as property.\n\n489\n00:23:26.651 --> 00:23:27.604\nBoth are very important.\n\n490\n00:23:27.604 --> 00:23:28.869\nLife is more so.\n\n491\n00:23:28.869 --> 00:23:31.530\nI wanna be clear about that,\nbut both important.\n\n492\n00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:35.220\nSo we have to focus on both and\ntrain our people on both as CISSPs.\n\n493\n00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:35.890\n>> Very good Adam.\n\n494\n00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:36.830\nGreat information there.\n\n495\n00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:41.011\nGonna look at physical security\nas well as personnel security.\n\n496\n00:23:41.011 --> 00:23:42.720\nWell, obviously, very important.\n\n497\n00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.710\nAll right Adam, remember if you guys\nwanna sit in one of Adam's classes live,\n\n498\n00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.834\nall you gotta do is shoot an email\nto us here, SeeAdam@itpro.tv,\n\n499\n00:23:49.834 --> 00:23:53.840\nthat's gonna do it for this one,\nsigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n500\n00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.780\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n501\n00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.120\n>> And we'll see you next time.\n\n502\n00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:56.890\n>> Take care

00:00:17.780\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.180\nToday we're doing our CISSP content,\nand specifically,\n\n5\n00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.910\nwe're gonna be looking at\nthe software development security.\n\n6\n00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.960\nNow security has obviously been a theme\nthroughout all of these episodes,\n\n7\n00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.170\nand we've talked a little\nbit about software security.\n\n8\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.801\nBut in this one, we're gonna focus\non the development lifecycle, right?\n\n9\n00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:37.225\nIt's very important that security\nis thought of, not at the end,\n\n10\n00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:41.706\nnot as an afterthought, but throughout the\nentire software development life cycle.\n\n11\n00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:45.625\nAnd there's several models that are in\nuse when people are developing software,\n\n12\n00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:48.210\nto make sure that's well, it's secure.\n\n13\n00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.740\nAnd here to help us work our way\nthrough all of that is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.700\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n15\n00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.230\n>> Good good.\n\n16\n00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.360\nHappy New Year everybody.\n\n17\n00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.500\n>> Happy New Year.\n\n18\n00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.325\n>> Hope everybody had a happy and\nhealthy one.\n\n19\n00:00:57.325 --> 00:00:58.390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n20\n00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.880\nto kick the year off we're gonna talk\nabout some really cool and exciting stuff.\n\n21\n00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.410\nWe're gonna talk about\nhow we understand and\n\n22\n00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.690\nreally apply security within the SDLC,\nwithin the development life cycle.\n\n23\n00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.630\nWe often have talked about it.\n\n24\n00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.610\nWe continue to think about as security\nprofessionals the need to be able to focus\n\n25\n00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.710\non security, in multiple stages right,\nwithin the developing life cycle within\n\n26\n00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.470\nthe life cycle of the system,\nwhatever you may think of that as.\n\n27\n00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.640\nAnd we will often talk about the fact we\nneed to secure early and secure often.\n\n28\n00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.390\nThis is really how we,\nas security professionals, need to be\n\n29\n00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.590\nthinking about security, need to be\nconsidering it, need to be focusing on it.\n\n30\n00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.370\nFrom a perspective of\nwhere we kick in security,\n\n31\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.710\nhow it comes into the system,\nhow we see it emerging in the life cycle,\n\n32\n00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.100\nhow we track it, where we see it\ninterjected if you will, and then manage.\n\n33\n00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.054\nThe CISSP needs to be thinking about this\nat all levels of an organizational thought\n\n34\n00:01:44.054 --> 00:01:46.493\nprocess, all levels of\na system thought process.\n\n35\n00:01:46.493 --> 00:01:51.339\nIt's our job as the CISSP to ensure\nthat security is not only thought about\n\n36\n00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:53.621\nwhenever and wherever possible.\n\n37\n00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:56.867\nBut it's always present,\nit's always there,\n\n38\n00:01:56.867 --> 00:02:01.074\nit's always something that we\nare bringing to the forefront.\n\n39\n00:02:01.074 --> 00:02:06.001\nLet me try that again, the forefront\neither through our actions, our words,\n\n40\n00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:11.378\nand/or strategically, as we look to manage\nthrough the organization with policy,\n\n41\n00:02:11.378 --> 00:02:14.980\nwith procedure,\nwith operational thought processes.\n\n42\n00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.120\nAnd we look to our teams to help guide and\nimplement the strategies that the business\n\n43\n00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.515\nneeds, we really have to be thinking\nabout the impact of security,\n\n44\n00:02:22.515 --> 00:02:27.598\nthinking about how we manage security\ndown through the organization as a CISSP.\n\n45\n00:02:27.598 --> 00:02:30.650\nSo the though process around\ndevelopment life cycle management,\n\n46\n00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.450\nthe thought process around security\nwithin the SDLC, whether it's a system or\n\n47\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.740\nsoftware development life cycle,\nSDLC can refer to different life cycles.\n\n48\n00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.480\nAs an acronym generically.\n\n49\n00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.300\nRegardless of what it is,\nas early as possible in the lifecycle,\n\n50\n00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.990\nas often as possible throughout\nthe lifecycle is where we wanna see\n\n51\n00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.130\nthe focus on security emerging and\n\n52\n00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.410\nthe focus on security continuing to be as\nprevalent as possible with our discussion.\n\n53\n00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.410\nSo beginning from that perspective\nis where we really wanna\n\n54\n00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.080\nstart our conversations\nthis morning as we really\n\n55\n00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.610\nthink about getting started with you\nas we look at how we're gonna integrate\n\n56\n00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.490\nthe thought process around development\nlife cycles within the security framework.\n\n57\n00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.450\nIt's all about the CISSPs understanding\nof how to create a secure environment and\n\n58\n00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.790\nhow to push that secure environment\nforward at every possible opportunity.\n\n59\n00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.320\nWe define the phases of\ndevelopment by using an SDLC.\n\n60\n00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.520\nA development life cycle.\n\n61\n00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.790\nWe have to select the model that's most\nappropriate and you heard Mike mention\n\n62\n00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.960\nin the intro that there may be\nseveral different SDLC models.\n\n63\n00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.390\nThere could be the waterfall.\n\n64\n00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.740\nThere could be the spiral model.\n\n65\n00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.590\nThere may be iterative\nmodels that we look at.\n\n66\n00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.010\nJust in time development, rapid\napplication development, there's all these\n\n67\n00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.750\ndifferent models that exist out there and\nwe'll highlight some of them.\n\n68\n00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.160\nWe'll talk about what some of them are.\n\n69\n00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.650\nSome of the more popular ones, obviously,\n\n70\n00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.890\nare important to at least\nhave passing knowledge of.\n\n71\n00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.720\nBut whether you focus on this as a primary\narea within your organizational expertise,\n\n72\n00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.400\nin other words, what you may do\nalready as a CISSP candidate,\n\n73\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.080\nwhat you may do already as\na security practitioner, or\n\n74\n00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.040\nthis is new to you and\nthis is something you don't do very often.\n\n75\n00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.800\nMost security professionals that either,\nI know as peers or colleagues, or\n\n76\n00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.740\nthat I come across just in my daily\nactivities, talking to customers,\n\n77\n00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.500\ninteracting with students and\nprofessionals, reality is,\n\n78\n00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.830\na lot of them have passing knowledge of\nthe topical discussions we're gonna have.\n\n79\n00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.240\nBut really aren't experts in this area.\n\n80\n00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.840\nThey just don't spend a lot of\ntime focusing their efforts and\n\n81\n00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.050\ntheir thought process on how to\nsecure the development of a system or\n\n82\n00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.380\na software product from the ground up.\n\n83\n00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.670\nThey take it and run with it once its\nbeen created in effect at the output,\n\n84\n00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.140\nat the back end of that product and\nthey manage it.\n\n85\n00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.450\nAnd that's where most of us probably,\nreality would normally show us\n\n86\n00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.550\nthat most of us probably operate at\nthat particular area of the life cycle.\n\n87\n00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.320\nThe very end of it,\nthe output in other words.\n\n88\n00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.540\nBut, it's important for us to know that\nat every step along the way as we begin\n\n89\n00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.270\nthat journey, there's opportunities for\nus to in some way interject, or\n\n90\n00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.225\nin somewhat insert,\nnot only our thought process.\n\n91\n00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:56.165\nBut also our knowledge and\nour ability to understand how to manage,\n\n92\n00:04:56.165 --> 00:04:58.205\nand therefore focus on security.\n\n93\n00:04:58.205 --> 00:05:00.695\nAnd it's important for us to be thinking\nabout how we do those things and\n\n94\n00:05:00.695 --> 00:05:02.165\nwhat those things may look like.\n\n95\n00:05:02.165 --> 00:05:03.355\nThe generic phases,\n\n96\n00:05:03.355 --> 00:05:07.365\nthe generic thought process around an SDLC\ncould be carved up and explained or\n\n97\n00:05:07.365 --> 00:05:10.960\ndiscussed, more or less along the lines\nof what I'm gonna mention to you now.\n\n98\n00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.430\nThere's some disagreement in terms of\nwhat the overall thought processes around\n\n99\n00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.680\nan SDLC may look like.\n\n100\n00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.260\nIn other words, there are standard models\nyou can look at but there's not a hard,\n\n101\n00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.500\nfast rule that says every SDLC is\ngonna look this way no matter what.\n\n102\n00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.080\nEvery SDLC is made up of these five or\nsix or seven phases, no matter what.\n\n103\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.990\nBut generically you will find that these\nphases or at least allusions to them or\n\n104\n00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.750\ngonna be referenced in pretty much\nevery SDLC that you will see out there.\n\n105\n00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.630\nSo, at a high level,\n\n106\n00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.060\nproject initiation and planning,\nvery important to think about that.\n\n107\n00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.020\nWhere do we start from?\n\n108\n00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.870\nIn other words,\nhow do we start our journey?\n\n109\n00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.690\nHow do we lay out,\ndo business requirements analysis and\n\n110\n00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.390\nlay out overall the needs of the project?\n\n111\n00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.580\nWhat are we gonna address?\n\n112\n00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.850\nAnd kind of, what is going to be\nthe measure of success ultimately by\n\n113\n00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:55.230\nunderstanding what our\nfunctional requirements will be.\n\n114\n00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.500\nAnd how we gather them\nfrom our stakeholders.\n\n115\n00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.650\nFunction requirements definition\ngoes into project initiation and\n\n116\n00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.130\nplanning part of that.\n\n117\n00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.060\nSystem design specifications.\n\n118\n00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.870\nHow are we gonna design?\n\n119\n00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.530\nWhat does this system have to do?\n\n120\n00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.566\nThese are all things that we think\nabout as we do requirements analysis,\n\n121\n00:06:09.566 --> 00:06:10.723\nrequirements gathering.\n\n122\n00:06:10.723 --> 00:06:12.724\nAnd we start to begin\nto have the dialogue or\n\n123\n00:06:12.724 --> 00:06:16.395\ndialogues with stakeholders about what\ntheir needs are and how we're going to\n\n124\n00:06:16.395 --> 00:06:20.030\ndesign a system that will help us to\nmeet them in some meaningful way.\n\n125\n00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.340\nDevelopment and implementation.\n\n126\n00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.950\nHow do we take all that information we've\ngathered across project initiation and\n\n127\n00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.060\nplanning, function requirements\ndefinition, systems design specification.\n\n128\n00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.701\nHow do we get all that together and\n\n129\n00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:34.461\nhow do we use that to start\nto actually build something.\n\n130\n00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:38.136\nAnd ultimately, move towards\nimplementation where we're gonna be\n\n131\n00:06:38.136 --> 00:06:40.856\nable to not only have a POC,\na Proof of Concept, and\n\n132\n00:06:40.856 --> 00:06:44.491\nmaybe some sort of generic system\nthat we can use and test and tweak.\n\n133\n00:06:44.491 --> 00:06:48.212\nBut ultimately produce something that will\nbe a finalized product, document that,\n\n134\n00:06:48.212 --> 00:06:51.840\ndocumentation's gonna be very important\nalong the way, we're gonna test that.\n\n135\n00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.620\nWe have to make sure that\nwhat we deliver ultimately\n\n136\n00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.550\nnot only stands up to all the expectations\nof the customer, but meets or\n\n137\n00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.050\nexceeds all the functional requirements\nand specifications that the customer and\n\n138\n00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:04.890\nthe stakeholders have given us and\nsaid, this is what you need to do.\n\n139\n00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.260\nAnd so we're gonna do all that through\ndevelopment and implementation,\n\n140\n00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.850\nand then ultimately take that finished\nproduct once we've documented or\n\n141\n00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.590\nonce we've standardized it.\n\n142\n00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.640\nTested it, made sure that it works\nthe right way,and we've certified it,\n\n143\n00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.220\naccredited it, and we'll talk about what\nthose terms are as we go through this.\n\n144\n00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.250\nAnd then ultimately\ntransition to production.\n\n145\n00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.360\nHow do we ultimately put that out there,\ngive that effectively to the organization?\n\n146\n00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.080\nBack to the stakeholders that have\nasked for it, have paid for it,\n\n147\n00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.850\nultimately have waited patiently for it.\n\n148\n00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:32.676\nAnd how do we then,\nhopefully patiently, right [LAUGH]?\n\n149\n00:07:32.676 --> 00:07:35.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then how do we operate that system\n\n150\n00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.360\nor that software, whatever it may be,\nover the lifecycle,\n\n151\n00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.960\nwhatever the lifecycle has actually\nbeen specified that it will be?\n\n152\n00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.630\nSo we really start with project\ninitiation and planning.\n\n153\n00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.860\nWe moved through function\nrequirement definitions.\n\n154\n00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.180\nWe moved through system\ndesign specifications.\n\n155\n00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.906\nWe did development and\nimplementation, documentation and\n\n156\n00:07:50.906 --> 00:07:54.226\ntesting are done along the way and\nultimately transition to production.\n\n157\n00:07:54.226 --> 00:07:57.565\nMeaning the shift from hey we're testing,\nwe're building,\n\n158\n00:07:57.565 --> 00:07:59.962\nwe're figuring it out\nto hey we got it right.\n\n159\n00:07:59.962 --> 00:08:01.262\nI've drawn a line in the sand.\n\n160\n00:08:01.262 --> 00:08:02.667\nState quotas are signed off.\n\n161\n00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:06.070\nThey've accepted responsibility for\nrunning the system as delivered.\n\n162\n00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.110\nCertification, accreditation\nin other words.\n\n163\n00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.890\nAnd now, were transitioning to production.\n\n164\n00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.275\nAnd we're gonna now hand that over\nto the stakeholders to the business.\n\n165\n00:08:13.275 --> 00:08:17.475\nAnd effectively, allow them to then\ntake ownership and start to operate, and\n\n166\n00:08:17.475 --> 00:08:19.965\nover that life cycle maintain that system.\n\n167\n00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:23.825\nThat can be a life cycle that\nstructures days, weeks, months, years.\n\n168\n00:08:23.825 --> 00:08:26.025\nIn many cases,\nit will most likely be years.\n\n169\n00:08:26.025 --> 00:08:28.855\nWe don't make significant investments\nin product development and\n\n170\n00:08:28.855 --> 00:08:30.525\nthe life cycle to secure those products.\n\n171\n00:08:30.525 --> 00:08:34.105\nUnless we are willing to operate them for\na significant period of time.\n\n172\n00:08:34.105 --> 00:08:37.170\nBut every project has to have\na life cycle associated with it.\n\n173\n00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:40.790\nMeaning every product ultimately that we\ndeliver has to have some sort of endpoint\n\n174\n00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:41.820\nenvision for it.\n\n175\n00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:43.810\nSo we know three years,\nfive years down the road,\n\n176\n00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.080\nwhatever it is, that we're either\ngonna be updating that system.\n\n177\n00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.690\nChanging it's overall look, feel, and\nfunction, to make it more relevant to\n\n178\n00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.230\nthe organization,\nextending it's functionality.\n\n179\n00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.080\nIn order words,\nextending its lifecycle, and or\n\n180\n00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.220\nwe're gonna end that lifecycle\nat a period of time.\n\n181\n00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.260\nAgain, whenever that may be down\nthe road in order to effectively bring\n\n182\n00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:08.120\nthat particular to a close, a logically,\nfunctionally, with the appropriate\n\n183\n00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.230\ncontrols and decommissioning\ncontrols in place to do so.\n\n184\n00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.120\nAnd then perhaps, bring something\non behind the scenes that will\n\n185\n00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.490\neither take on that function in a new and\ninnovative way.\n\n186\n00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:18.600\nWe could look at, for instance,\n\n187\n00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.810\nthe transition from non-cloud\nto cloud-related services.\n\n188\n00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.390\nAnd how to move a system into the cloud\n\n189\n00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:27.150\nmay involve that actually\ndecommissioning elements of it.\n\n190\n00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:30.840\nThat were old and really not made for\nthe cloud in any meaningful way and\n\n191\n00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.520\nreproducing that system\nwith new functionality, but\n\n192\n00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.040\nallowing it to be linked to the cloud.\n\n193\n00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.220\nAnd this is something we're\nseeing time and time again.\n\n194\n00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.090\nWith the move to cloud CITRIX system and\nservice delivery today.\n\n195\n00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.980\nSo that's one example of worthy\ncommissioning may imply new services,\n\n196\n00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.440\nnew systems being brought online.\n\n197\n00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.982\nWith a reintroduction of that service or\nsystem, but with an updated look and\n\n198\n00:09:50.982 --> 00:09:55.090\nfeel security posture and functionality,\nor they simply decommission that system or\n\n199\n00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.540\nservice and no longer need it because\nwe're no longer offering that.\n\n200\n00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.420\nWe may look at something like\nan older mainframe system that did\n\n201\n00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.360\nproduction management.\n\n202\n00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.410\nOr perhaps did data management for us on\na platform that's going out of service and\n\n203\n00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.350\nwe no longer need to offer that\nservice within the organization.\n\n204\n00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:14.110\nWe're gonna decommission totally the data\nand the systems associated with it,\n\n205\n00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.810\nand we're simply gonna end of life them.\n\n206\n00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:19.470\nAnd the EOL marker, the End of\nLIfe marker is the end point for\n\n207\n00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.290\nthat service functionality or\nthat system functionality.\n\n208\n00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.020\nAnd we then, once we decommission\nproperly, walk away from that, strip down\n\n209\n00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.390\nthe systems, get rid of the data, safely\ndiscard it, whatever we may need to do.\n\n210\n00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.750\nBut once that decommissioning\nhas happened, the SDLC for\n\n211\n00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.210\nthat particular product or\nservice has been completed.\n\n212\n00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.540\nThe end marker for\nend of life has been reached and\n\n213\n00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.040\nwe no longer need to worry\nabout what that may look like.\n\n214\n00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.130\nSo, wanna be thinking about these phases,\n\n215\n00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.070\nwanna be thinking about\nhow they're gonna operate.\n\n216\n00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.240\nThe trick to doing this from\na security practitioner,\n\n217\n00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.150\nsecurity manager perspective for\nyou, as CISSP candidates.\n\n218\n00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:56.700\nThe trick to doing this and\ndoing it well is to understand\n\n219\n00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:01.670\nthe expectations that you have to meet at\nevery level, at every phase of the SDLC.\n\n220\n00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.690\nHave them well documented.\n\n221\n00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.180\nMake sure you have a road map, in other\nwords, that explains where you are.\n\n222\n00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.960\nWhere you are coming from and\n\n223\n00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.310\nwhere you need to go in order to be\nable to move from one phase to the next.\n\n224\n00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.820\nThe trick on other words is clear and\naccurate documentation, and clear and\n\n225\n00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:20.470\naccurate planning to move through cycles\nas opposed to a lack of understand.\n\n226\n00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:23.210\nA lack of clarity that can\nlead to confusion, but\n\n227\n00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.400\nalso potentially lead to a compromise.\n\n228\n00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.340\nYou may inadvertently without realizing it\nor thinking you're doing something else.\n\n229\n00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.980\nMove through a phase and\n\n230\n00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.440\nbecause you haven't clearly documented\nwhat the phase transition point.\n\n231\n00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.260\nThe success metric or\nmetrics will be to move out of that phase.\n\n232\n00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.820\nWe don't clearly understand them,\n\n233\n00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.450\nyou may move through that phase\nwithout hitting all the key marketers.\n\n234\n00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.220\nYou need to hit to ensure success and\nin doing.\n\n235\n00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.830\nSo you may actually build in an insecure\nsystem or insecure solution into\n\n236\n00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:54.580\nthat system in such a way their defects\nthe overall outcome, number one.\n\n237\n00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.550\nBut number two may impact confidentiality,\nintegrity, and or availability, right?\n\n238\n00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.490\nThe three key information, security,\nmanagement pillars that we build all of\n\n239\n00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.170\nour discussions around, and have talked\nabout throughout all of our time together.\n\n240\n00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.750\nAcross the width, breadth and\n\n241\n00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:12.276\ndepth of the CIS's knowledge, we've been\nhelping you to better understand, right?\n\n242\n00:12:12.276 --> 00:12:15.520\nEveryone of the domains, every one\nof the eight areas of knowledge you\n\n243\n00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.200\nhave to master as a CISSP to be\nsuccessful is built around understanding\n\n244\n00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.410\nof confidentiality, integrity and/or\navailability in some form, mixing and\n\n245\n00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.640\nmatching along the way, to understand\nhow these three things play into and\n\n246\n00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.690\nare impacted by our discussions, right?\n\n247\n00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.900\nWe have to keep them in mind,\nin other words, in everything we do.\n\n248\n00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.450\nAnd if we're not focusing on them,\nas part of the SDLC conversation,\n\n249\n00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:39.130\nwe're not doing our job\neffectively as the CISSP.\n\n250\n00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:44.270\nSo ensuring clear accurate documentation,\nclear accurate understanding,\n\n251\n00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.980\nof what it is we're trying to accomplish.\n\n252\n00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.140\nIt's gonna be central,\n\n253\n00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.570\nit's gonna be critical to our\nability to create that success path.\n\n254\n00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.180\nIn project management,\nwe talk about Critical Path Management,\n\n255\n00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.250\nwhat's called CPM.\n\n256\n00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.560\nThose of you that have an understanding\nof project management.\n\n257\n00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.740\nHopefully, you've heard of this and\nunderstand what it is.\n\n258\n00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.510\nAnd use it on a regular basis when\nyou create a project timeline.\n\n259\n00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.550\nYou create your statements of work,\nyou create your work breakdown schedule.\n\n260\n00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:05.660\nAll of that stuff, right.\n\n261\n00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.490\nSo when we talk about CPM,\nCritical Path Management.\n\n262\n00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:12.650\nIt's the idea of understanding how to get\nfrom where you start to where you finish\n\n263\n00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.990\nwith the least amount of resistance\nalong the way but maximizing success.\n\n264\n00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.590\nI'm making it overly\nsimplistic when I explain it.\n\n265\n00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.010\nThere's more to it than that.\n\n266\n00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.190\nJoin us for a discussion on PMP in\nanother episode sometime later.\n\n267\n00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:25.510\nBut the reality is, right?\n\n268\n00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.780\nWhen you think about\nCPM Critical Path Management.\n\n269\n00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.040\nAbout how it applies as a generic concept\nto what we're talking about within\n\n270\n00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.030\nsecurity and\nsecurity development lifecycles.\n\n271\n00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:37.950\nIt's actually a very appropriate way to\nthink about how to do this end to end.\n\n272\n00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.840\nBecause it's about defining clearly\nwhat those markers are that can\n\n273\n00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.370\ncreate either success or\nfailure at every phase.\n\n274\n00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:46.740\nAnd understanding that we've\npassed through them and\n\n275\n00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.430\nwe've documented that we've done so\nauthoritatively in order to move forward.\n\n276\n00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.400\nOr we are struggling to get through one or\nmore of them, and we have to stop and\n\n277\n00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.790\nfigure out what the problem is.\n\n278\n00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:58.140\nWe may have to engage in either some\nsort of trade-off conversation or\n\n279\n00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.615\nnegotiation with stakeholders,\nin order to figure out how to retrench,\n\n280\n00:14:01.615 --> 00:14:06.250\nre-document in effect what our new,\nquote unquote, solutions are gonna be.\n\n281\n00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:09.640\nBecause maybe we're not gonna be able\nto hit the mark that we have set for\n\n282\n00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.490\nourselves because there's a problem.\n\n283\n00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.930\nFor instance,\nwe may run into a resource issue.\n\n284\n00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:18.400\nMay run into a time issue, a money issue,\na person issue or a requirements issue.\n\n285\n00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.970\nThe requirements may no longer be\naligned with what the customer or\n\n286\n00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.350\nstakeholder wanted because\nthey've changed their mind.\n\n287\n00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.390\nAnd any one or all of these\nthings can happen along the way.\n\n288\n00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:30.330\nAnd so we have to understand that\nthere may be points in the SDLC\n\n289\n00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:33.250\nwhere it may be appropriate, and\nindeed, it may be necessary.\n\n290\n00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.280\nFor us to stop and to have\na conversation with a stakeholder or\n\n291\n00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.540\nwith a group of stakeholders validating.\n\n292\n00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.880\nWhere we are by reporting\nout on our progress, but\n\n293\n00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.370\nalso validating that\nthe customer's still engaged.\n\n294\n00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.070\nThat the stakeholder's still\nwhere we need them to be and\n\n295\n00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.500\nthat our agreement in the beginning\nof this process still holds true.\n\n296\n00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.070\nAnd it's very important to do this, right.\n\n297\n00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.970\nThis is that, hey, what do you wanna do\ntonight, conversation that you may have\n\n298\n00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:59.650\nwith a significant other spouse or\nsomebody in your life.\n\n299\n00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.405\nIn the real world, outside of\nsecurity that you engage in, right.\n\n300\n00:15:02.405 --> 00:15:04.770\nWhen you say to somebody hey,\nwhat are you looking to do tonight.\n\n301\n00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:05.760\nIf you want to go out and see a movie.\n\n302\n00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.280\nDo you want to go have dinner, drinks.\n\n303\n00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.340\nWhat are you in the mood for,\nin other words, right.\n\n304\n00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.740\nYou 're validating with\nthem on a generic level.\n\n305\n00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.680\nWhat it is that they\nare interested in accomplishing.\n\n306\n00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.080\nIf you have the generic\nconversation with somebody.\n\n307\n00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.220\nYou get generic answers.\n\n308\n00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.620\nIf you say to them specifically, hey I was\nthinking, I wanna go out and do dinner and\n\n309\n00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:22.420\na movie tonight.\n\n310\n00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.010\nIs that gonna work for you?\n\n311\n00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:26.810\nYour asking them to be very specific and\nfocused on a solution, right?\n\n312\n00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:30.110\nAnd when we do requirements gathering,\nwe're asking the stake holder or\n\n313\n00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.760\nthe customer to focused on a solution.\n\n314\n00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.570\nWe are asking them to partner with us.\n\n315\n00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.390\nAnd to be focused on what it\nis they want to accomplish.\n\n316\n00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:40.680\nWe've talked about the fact that we have\nto align this with business requirements.\n\n317\n00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.910\nAnd the stakeholder\nrepresents the business,\n\n318\n00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:45.840\nthe customer represents the business,\nthe organization.\n\n319\n00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.500\nAnd we have to align with\ntheir thought processes.\n\n320\n00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.685\nIn order to create something of value for\nthe organization.\n\n321\n00:15:51.685 --> 00:15:54.683\nIt's up to the CISSP to\nvalidate that alignment and\n\n322\n00:15:54.683 --> 00:15:58.516\nto ensure that the Project Manager,\nthat the Business Analyst,\n\n323\n00:15:58.516 --> 00:16:03.412\nthe people that may do the requirements\ngathering as we've discussed, that the.\n\n324\n00:16:03.412 --> 00:16:06.067\nUnderstand that they have\ncaptured those requirements, and\n\n325\n00:16:06.067 --> 00:16:07.349\nhave aligned them properly.\n\n326\n00:16:07.349 --> 00:16:11.374\nThere's nothing worse than starting\na project, going down the road of starting\n\n327\n00:16:11.374 --> 00:16:15.572\nto develop something securely, to find\nout halfway, quarter way, eight of a way,\n\n328\n00:16:15.572 --> 00:16:19.713\nthree quarters of the way through, that\nwhat you're doing is not what the customer\n\n329\n00:16:19.713 --> 00:16:23.350\nhas asked you to do, wants you to do,\nor is expecting you to do.\n\n330\n00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.580\nAnd we've all had those epiphany moments,\nright?\n\n331\n00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.380\nWhere we've been told at some point,\nhey, why are we doing X\n\n332\n00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:34.230\nwhen we should be over here doing X plus\nor Y plus or whatever, but not X, right?\n\n333\n00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.490\nAnd that's a critical concern.\n\n334\n00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.780\nBecause that can lead to not only wasted\ntime and effort, resources misallocated,\n\n335\n00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.710\nmisrepresented, misused, but\nit can lead to an insecure solution or\n\n336\n00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.350\nthe state of something can\nbe left in an insecure way.\n\n337\n00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:50.900\nBecause we have partially done something,\nbut we have not finished it and\n\n338\n00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:52.970\nnow we've been told by the way,\nwhat you've done is no good.\n\n339\n00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.710\nNot only do you have to unwind that,\nbut you have to go back and\n\n340\n00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.520\ndo something different and that can\nlead to all sorts of complications.\n\n341\n00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.940\nSo, you wanna be very clear, very focused,\nvery aware of the need to be\n\n342\n00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:08.040\nnot only aligned here, but to have\nclear understanding, documentation.\n\n343\n00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.800\nAnd checking for\nrelevancy of that documentation.\n\n344\n00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.250\nAt every phase is gonna be a crucial\nstep in the success metric, or\n\n345\n00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:18.590\nsuccess cycle that the CISSP\nneeds to engage in, with SDLC.\n\n346\n00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:21.950\nSo projection initiation and planning,\nwe've talked about that, right?\n\n347\n00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:25.270\nAligning project objectives,\ntalked about scoping strategies,\n\n348\n00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.090\nother factors were all discussed here.\n\n349\n00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:30.590\nFunctional requirements and\ndefinition, comprehensive analysis,\n\n350\n00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.715\nmaking sure systems will meet end\nuser needs is what we're doing here.\n\n351\n00:17:33.715 --> 00:17:36.480\nWe've talked a lot about these\nthings in other discussions.\n\n352\n00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.610\nWe've talked about them from various\nperspectives in the system, and\n\n353\n00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:43.270\ntalked about the importance of not\nonly requirements gathering but\n\n354\n00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.800\nfunctional requirements definition and\ngetting those right.\n\n355\n00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.310\nSystem design specifications,\ndesigning system and\n\n356\n00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:52.230\nsoftware, establishing the data\ninput flow and output requirements,\n\n357\n00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.450\ndesigning security\nfeatures in to the system.\n\n358\n00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.830\nThese are all things that will\nhappen in these particular areas.\n\n359\n00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:01.390\nDevelopment and implementation,\nall about generation of source code or\n\n360\n00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.970\nbuilding of a prototype if we're talking\nabout a system as opposed to software.\n\n361\n00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:09.130\nWe're focusing SDLC conversation on\nsoftware development in this particular\n\n362\n00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.110\nconversation.\n\n363\n00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.330\nSo the S is for software but I just\nkeep reminding you because I want you to\n\n364\n00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.420\nknow that the S could equally and easily\nbe for system development lifecycle.\n\n365\n00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.820\nSDLC is generic in that respect and it\ncan be equally applied to either one, but\n\n366\n00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.480\nwe are focusing on software\nin this discussion, so\n\n367\n00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.930\nI just wanna keep you aware of that.\n\n368\n00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:29.500\nDeveloping testing scenarios and\ntest cases, conducting unit and\n\n369\n00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.840\nintegration testing, documenting for\nmaintenance purposes,\n\n370\n00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.175\nall these things will happen in\ndevelopment and implementation.\n\n371\n00:18:35.175 --> 00:18:38.070\nWith regards to the software\nproject we're involved in,\n\n372\n00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.910\nwhen we think about doing all this we\nhave to think about acceptance and what\n\n373\n00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:45.795\nthe acceptance requirement is going to be\nfor the stakeholder, for the customer.\n\n374\n00:18:45.795 --> 00:18:50.170\nIn effect, how are we gonna hand that\nproject or that output to somebody and\n\n375\n00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:54.210\nsay hey this is what you asked for,\nhere's effectively what we have for you.\n\n376\n00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.900\nAnd please take a look at it.\n\n377\n00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.460\nPlease come back and tell us whether\nthat meets your expectations.\n\n378\n00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.900\nAnd if so, we need to agree, both of us,\n\n379\n00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.770\nyou as stakeholder and/or customer,\nme as the provider of the solution.\n\n380\n00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:07.540\nWe need to agree that we both\naccomplished our tasks, and\n\n381\n00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.850\nwe have to then decide what we\nare going to do going forward.\n\n382\n00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.530\nMeaning put this product into,\n\n383\n00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:14.850\nultimately operational,\ncapabilities have to be turned on.\n\n384\n00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:17.080\nWe have to operate and\nmaintain the system.\n\n385\n00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.020\nAd then over time,\nwe have to decommission it.\n\n386\n00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.680\nSo we have to move through the remaining\nareas of that life cycle but\n\n387\n00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.470\nwe have to agree that we have effectively\nhit the mark in order to do that.\n\n388\n00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.030\nAnd, so acceptance becomes very important.\n\n389\n00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:32.860\nIndependent group testing is usually\ndone to ensure acceptance, meaning\n\n390\n00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:38.180\nwe bring in somebody or some function\nthat will allow the system to be tested.\n\n391\n00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:41.640\nTesting is a critical step on the path\ntowards being able to release the system,\n\n392\n00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.410\nensuring that all the pieces, as well as\nthe implementation of all those pieces\n\n393\n00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.600\ntogether, is gonna actually meet\nthe expectations of the client.\n\n394\n00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.390\nOr of the customer.\n\n395\n00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:50.950\nSo wanna be thinking about that.\n\n396\n00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.560\nTesting and evaluation controls\nhave to be implemented,\n\n397\n00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.540\nit's part of acceptance\nas we talked about.\n\n398\n00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.810\nWe should be testing with known data,\nknown good data in the system to ensure\n\n399\n00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:02.020\nthat we understand what\nthe system will do.\n\n400\n00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.130\nHow it will behave.\n\n401\n00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:04.960\nWhat the functionality\nof the system will be.\n\n402\n00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.610\nWe should never use live\nproduction data for testing.\n\n403\n00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:11.350\nWe need to make a copy of that data\nmove it into a testing environment and\n\n404\n00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.540\nthen test it under\ncontrolled circumstances.\n\n405\n00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.267\nIf we test a lie then production, and\nsomething goes wrong, we may actually\n\n406\n00:20:17.267 --> 00:20:21.113\nnegatively impact not only stability\nof production systems, we may actually\n\n407\n00:20:21.113 --> 00:20:25.090\ninadvertently compromise confidentiality\nor the integrity of those systems.\n\n408\n00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:26.840\nAnd that could lead to\ncatastrophic failures.\n\n409\n00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:30.490\nSo we always wanna test in a In\nan isolated environment, we may use,\n\n410\n00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.310\nand you should use, production data.\n\n411\n00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:36.920\nBut we should copy that data into\nan isolated, secure, non-production\n\n412\n00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.850\nenvironment and then as a result of that,\ndon't you like when somebody just randomly\n\n413\n00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:44.610\nreaches off to the side and goes,\nhello right off to the side of the screen.\n\n414\n00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:46.330\nI wasn't planning on going that\nfar out when I reached but\n\n415\n00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:47.650\nit was just one of those things.\n\n416\n00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.530\nSo we should always make sure that we\nuse that, we call that sanitize that.\n\n417\n00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:53.100\nRight?\nThe idea of taking data\n\n418\n00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.410\nthat's coming out of live\nproduction environment,\n\n419\n00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.690\ncleaning it up to ensure there's no\ninformation that could be compromised.\n\n420\n00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:03.061\nWe've talked a lot about the importance of\ndata loss prevention, of DLP technologies.\n\n421\n00:21:03.061 --> 00:21:07.230\nOf IRM information rights management,\nof privacy overall,\n\n422\n00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.190\nof privacy protection,\nthings like tokenization,\n\n423\n00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:13.510\nobfuscation are terms that would come\nto mind here, want to think about.\n\n424\n00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.635\nSo we would take that data,\nwe would secure it.\n\n425\n00:21:15.635 --> 00:21:19.529\nWe would make sure that the data being\nused in the non-production secure testing\n\n426\n00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:21.175\nenvironment is protected.\n\n427\n00:21:21.175 --> 00:21:23.015\nBut it has to have the integrity and\n\n428\n00:21:23.015 --> 00:21:26.085\nthe availability requirements of\nthe live data associated with it.\n\n429\n00:21:26.085 --> 00:21:28.345\nAnd it has to look and\nfeel like live data.\n\n430\n00:21:28.345 --> 00:21:30.912\nSo we just want to make sure we're\nsanitizing it and securing it, but\n\n431\n00:21:30.912 --> 00:21:32.569\nwe also want to make sure it's functional.\n\n432\n00:21:32.569 --> 00:21:35.749\nIt will give us accurate representation\nof what the data implies and\n\n433\n00:21:35.749 --> 00:21:39.602\ntherefore the system functionality will\neffectively represent itself the way it\n\n434\n00:21:39.602 --> 00:21:41.020\nwould in live environments.\n\n435\n00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.365\nSo we wanna be thinking about that.\n\n436\n00:21:42.365 --> 00:21:44.310\nWe've talked about certification and\naccreditation.\n\n437\n00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:45.660\nI mentioned those terms.\n\n438\n00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.480\nWanna make sure we understand the process.\n\n439\n00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.860\nAnd I believed we've discussed\nthis in one of our prior episodes.\n\n440\n00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.160\nWanna go over it again.\n\n441\n00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.740\nCertification is the idea\nof taking a system and\n\n442\n00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:59.460\nensuring that that system effectively\nhas been delivered to spec.\n\n443\n00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.210\nIn other words,\nthe customer said I want X, Y and Z.\n\n444\n00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.720\nAnd we effectively have delivered X,\nY and Z in that system.\n\n445\n00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.850\nSo we are certifying that\nthe system effectively\n\n446\n00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:13.770\nhas delivered the functionality that\nthe customer, the stakeholders asked for.\n\n447\n00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:15.518\nIt's what certification is all about.\n\n448\n00:22:15.518 --> 00:22:18.830\nSo we can present that certification\ndocument along with the system,\n\n449\n00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.810\nthe software, whatever it is that\nwe're certifying to the customer,\n\n450\n00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:22.582\nto the stakeholder.\n\n451\n00:22:22.582 --> 00:22:26.950\nAnd effectively say hey,\nby the way, here's your solution,\n\n452\n00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.540\nhere's documentation that validates\nthe we're effectively on target.\n\n453\n00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.770\nWe are certifying we've done the things\nyou've asked for, all your requirements\n\n454\n00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:38.115\nfunctional, requirements have been met and\nthis the documentation to that end.\n\n455\n00:22:38.115 --> 00:22:41.990\nCertification's all about validating for\nthe stakeholder that the system has met\n\n456\n00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:46.280\nthe design requirements and is being\ndelivered according to those requirements.\n\n457\n00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.850\nAccreditation is all about\nthe stakeholder accepting the risk,\n\n458\n00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:55.110\nthe liability, of taking that system\nas delivered, as certified, and\n\n459\n00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:58.220\nthen managing it effectively and\nputting it into production.\n\n460\n00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:02.150\nSo if it's a software solution it's\nabout the customer taking that software,\n\n461\n00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:03.880\nturning it on and operating it.\n\n462\n00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.830\nIf it's a piece of hardware, it's about\nthe customer taking that hardware,\n\n463\n00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:10.810\nputting it into production, operating it,\nmaintaining it over it's lifecycle.\n\n464\n00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:14.461\nSo accreditation Is all about\nthe process of being able to,\n\n465\n00:23:14.461 --> 00:23:18.696\nas the owner of the system,\naccept responsibility for the system and\n\n466\n00:23:18.696 --> 00:23:23.078\nensuring that the system will be operated,\nall bumps and warts aside,\n\n467\n00:23:23.078 --> 00:23:26.532\neverything associated with\nit is gonna be acceptable.\n\n468\n00:23:26.532 --> 00:23:30.109\nAnd the risks, hopefully all of them are\ndocumented, or at least all of them that\n\n469\n00:23:30.109 --> 00:23:33.475\nwe understand and know are documented,\ncuz we do know there is such a thing as\n\n470\n00:23:33.475 --> 00:23:36.472\nresidual risk and there is such a thing\nas unknown risk in a system and\n\n471\n00:23:36.472 --> 00:23:39.630\nyou want to make sure you aware of\nthose terms and what they mean.\n\n472\n00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:43.470\nBut all the risks that we can identify,\nthat we are aware of are documented and\n\n473\n00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:46.435\nthe owner of that system, stakeholder\nthat represents the organization,\n\n474\n00:23:46.435 --> 00:23:49.480\nhas agreed to sign off and\naccept that system as delivered.\n\n475\n00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.530\nThis is what accreditation is all about.\n\n476\n00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.300\nCertification, accreditation\nis really a government,\n\n477\n00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:56.002\nmilitary kind of thought process.\n\n478\n00:23:56.002 --> 00:23:58.219\nWe don't tend to see this very\nmuch in the private sector.\n\n479\n00:23:58.219 --> 00:24:00.348\nIt does occur, there are organizations and\n\n480\n00:24:00.348 --> 00:24:03.350\nbusinesses where this general\nthought process is followed.\n\n481\n00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:06.752\nBut this is not something that in the\nmajority of the private sector you would\n\n482\n00:24:06.752 --> 00:24:07.402\ncome across.\n\n483\n00:24:07.402 --> 00:24:10.547\nSo you may or may not have ever seen or\nbeen involved with this process, and\n\n484\n00:24:10.547 --> 00:24:11.220\nthat's okay.\n\n485\n00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.530\nThere's nothing wrong with that.\n\n486\n00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.530\nNever been involved with certification or\naccreditation, no big deal.\n\n487\n00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:19.840\nIf you've heard about it, but never seen\nit, it's not that big of a deal at all.\n\n488\n00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.310\nBut it is important to\nunderstand generically\n\n489\n00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:26.220\nwhat the concept represents just so\nif you're asked about it, in other words,\n\n490\n00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.560\nif you ever hear a question being asked\nabout it, somebody wants to know about it,\n\n491\n00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:33.150\nyou can knowledgeably and intelligently\nexplain it to them, interact with them,\n\n492\n00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.970\nhelp them to walk through the process.\n\n493\n00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:39.130\nAnd as a CISSP, remember,\none of our primary focuses in the business\n\n494\n00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:42.702\nis to provide guidance and\nto provide that voice of experience,\n\n495\n00:24:42.702 --> 00:24:46.390\nthat knowledgeable viewpoint or vantage\npoint that the business can rely on.\n\n496\n00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:49.500\nAnd so we may be asked to\nprovide guidance in this area.\n\n497\n00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.880\nSomebody may say to us, hey,\nwe're partnering with an organization\n\n498\n00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.640\nthat has this new requirement that\nwe haven't really dealt with before.\n\n499\n00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.750\nThey're asking us to certify and\naccredit our solution.\n\n500\n00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:00.000\nDo you understand what that is?\n\n501\n00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.360\nAnd Mike, as the CISSP,\nmay say yes or no, right?\n\n502\n00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.240\nOr I, as the CISSP, may say yes or no.\n\n503\n00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.850\nWe have to remember,\ngive guidance where we can.\n\n504\n00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:12.230\nBut, most importantly, we have to give\nguidance where we can add value and\n\n505\n00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:16.111\nwe can be knowledgeable, and we're not\njust effectively faking it to make it.\n\n506\n00:25:16.111 --> 00:25:17.729\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> As somebody told me during the break,\n\n507\n00:25:17.729 --> 00:25:18.690\nI love that thought process.\n\n508\n00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:21.560\nHad a long conversation with somebody\n\n509\n00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.770\nabout the idea of faking\nit until you make it.\n\n510\n00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.850\nAnd this idea, and actually it was based\non a Ted Talk that we actually took\n\n511\n00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:30.500\na look at, which was really interesting,\nabout this idea of how you can effectively\n\n512\n00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:35.140\nbecome good at something by doing it\nrepetitively, to really understand it and\n\n513\n00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:38.060\neffectively get better at it\nevery time through iteration.\n\n514\n00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.880\nThat's important and that's a thought\nprocess you wanna think about and,\n\n515\n00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.130\nas you become a professional in this area,\npractice over time.\n\n516\n00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:48.160\nBut what you don't wanna do\nis give somebody guidance or\n\n517\n00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.430\noffer them the benefit of your experience\nwhen there is nothing to back that up.\n\n518\n00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:56.005\nAnd my point is, you don't wanna fake\nit with regards to something like this\n\n519\n00:25:56.005 --> 00:25:59.065\nbecause if you say to an organization,\na stakeholder that's looking for\n\n520\n00:25:59.065 --> 00:26:02.595\nyour opinion, as a professional,\nas somebody who should understand this,\n\n521\n00:26:02.595 --> 00:26:05.225\noh yeah, I know what that is, let me just\ntell you, it's this, this, and this.\n\n522\n00:26:05.225 --> 00:26:06.480\nDo it this way and you're fine.\n\n523\n00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.162\nAnd you don't really understand it,\nand let me be clear,\n\n524\n00:26:09.162 --> 00:26:12.777\nunderstanding it is not the definition\nthat you read the Wikipedia entry and,\n\n525\n00:26:12.777 --> 00:26:15.211\ntherefore, you think you\nnow are an expert at that.\n\n526\n00:26:15.211 --> 00:26:17.235\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You've seen those commercials, right,\n\n527\n00:26:17.235 --> 00:26:19.363\nyou stay smart,\nI forget what hotel chain does that.\n\n528\n00:26:19.363 --> 00:26:20.468\n>> Yeah, Holiday Inn Express.\n\n529\n00:26:20.468 --> 00:26:21.540\n>> Yeah, whatever it is.\n\n530\n00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.560\nI stayed at the such and\nsuch last night, I can do this, right.\n\n531\n00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.280\nYeah, I've never done brain surgery before\nbut I stayed smart so I can do this.\n\n532\n00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.870\nThat's not how CISSPs operate,\nright, just to be clear.\n\n533\n00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:35.200\nWe don't want you to give\nguidance to somebody, an entity,\n\n534\n00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.840\nan organization,\nif you are not comfortable doing so.\n\n535\n00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.100\nRemember the ideas of due care and\ndue diligence.\n\n536\n00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:43.000\nAlso remember the code of ethics that\nwe've talked about several times.\n\n537\n00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.470\nIt's your responsibility, and you sign off\nand agree to uphold the code of ethics\n\n538\n00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.410\nbefore you will become\ncertified as a CISSP, formally.\n\n539\n00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:54.090\nIt's part of the application process\nwhere you effectively specify, yes,\n\n540\n00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.062\nI've met the requirements.\n\n541\n00:26:55.062 --> 00:26:58.962\nExperiential, exam-based, I've passed\nthe exam, I've done the experience thing,\n\n542\n00:26:58.962 --> 00:27:01.830\nI have five years of experience,\ncommutatively, in two or\n\n543\n00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.550\nmore of the domains required.\n\n544\n00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:08.950\nI've sent my applications in, I have my\napplication fee, I've done all that stuff.\n\n545\n00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.960\nI have my recommendations, or the people\nthat are willing to vouch for me.\n\n546\n00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.747\nAll that's done.\n\n547\n00:27:12.747 --> 00:27:15.705\nBut you also have to sign off\non upholding the code of ethics.\n\n548\n00:27:15.705 --> 00:27:18.795\nAnd it very clearly says,\nyou will provide guidance to, and\n\n549\n00:27:18.795 --> 00:27:23.285\nuphold the requirements of, not only\nyour organization, but the industry and\n\n550\n00:27:23.285 --> 00:27:27.555\nthe community that we all service as part\nof being CISSPs in good standing at large.\n\n551\n00:27:27.555 --> 00:27:30.935\nAnd you will do so with honor,\nwith integrity, and with good intention.\n\n552\n00:27:30.935 --> 00:27:35.350\nAnd the idea is that you should not\nknowingly ever provide false guidance or\n\n553\n00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:37.350\nin any way provide misdirection.\n\n554\n00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.300\nI'm not suggesting you would.\n\n555\n00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:42.180\nBut what I'm implying is that if you speak\nto something authoritatively in the eyes\n\n556\n00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:46.000\nof your customers, your stakeholders, and\nyou're not actually knowledgeable and\n\n557\n00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.560\nauthoritative as a result,\nyou may not mean to,\n\n558\n00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.780\nyou may have the best\nof intentions at heart.\n\n559\n00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.520\nBut, ultimately, by doing that,\n\n560\n00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.500\nbecause they think of you\nas the voice of experience,\n\n561\n00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.390\nthey look to you as being the expert,\nif you give them incorrect information,\n\n562\n00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.290\neven if you did it by accident, and\nI'm sure it wouldn't be on purpose,\n\n563\n00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.910\nI'm sure it would by accident\nwithout meaning to, but\n\n564\n00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:08.550\nif you do that, you still have effectively\ngotten to the same place, right?\n\n565\n00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:10.300\nYou've given them incorrect guidance,\nyou've given them,\n\n566\n00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:13.650\nunfortunately, information that may or\nmay not be accurate, and\n\n567\n00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.570\nyou have not done the things\nyou've been asked to do and\n\n568\n00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.130\nindeed said you would do by\nupholding the code of ethics.\n\n569\n00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:22.220\nSo, acting honorably, acting justly,\nthose are important things to consider.\n\n570\n00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:26.970\nDue care and due diligence are important\nby laws and watch words for us as CISSPs.\n\n571\n00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.900\nYou have to remember that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n572\n00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.390\nSo this idea of being able\nto understand certification,\n\n573\n00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:34.370\naccreditation is also gonna\nbe very important for you.\n\n574\n00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.280\nAgain, just as a thought process,\njust as a general overview, so\n\n575\n00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.340\nyou can help somebody work through that,\nif necessary.\n\n576\n00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.030\nWhen we think about transition to\nproduction, we often call that\n\n577\n00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:47.370\nimplementation, by the way,\nin case you hear it referred to that way..\n\n578\n00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.440\nWe're thinking about getting accreditation\nand certification out of the way.\n\n579\n00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.320\nWe're training new users, very important\nto think about training and awareness.\n\n580\n00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.840\nAnd part of that, how do we train users,\nhow do they use the system, how do we\n\n581\n00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.680\ndocument what we've done, how do we make\nsure we communicate that effectively?\n\n582\n00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.152\nThis is all part of the transition to\nproduction or implementation cycle.\n\n583\n00:29:04.152 --> 00:29:06.900\nWe wanna make sure we're thinking\nabout that along with implementing\n\n584\n00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.872\nthe system, obviously.\n\n585\n00:29:07.872 --> 00:29:12.150\nRevisions and system replacement may\nhappen, as I indicated, over time.\n\n586\n00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:16.300\nAnd if we are updating the current system,\nthat revision process is going to\n\n587\n00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.820\nkick off a new SDLC or, at least,\nit should if you do this the right way.\n\n588\n00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.100\nAnd a new SDLC should be implemented\nevery time we make a change.\n\n589\n00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:25.830\nBecause even though it may be a minor\nchange, you may literally just be\n\n590\n00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:29.350\nimplementing a quick fix,\nsome sort of an update, a security patch,\n\n591\n00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:33.600\nnew functionality, whatever it is,\nyou are effectively modifying the system.\n\n592\n00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:37.830\nAnd we'll talk about, and have talked\nabout, change management and configuration\n\n593\n00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:41.055\nmanagement, and the importance of\nthose to the overall security process.\n\n594\n00:29:41.055 --> 00:29:44.050\nWe'll remind you of those again\nas we continue our conservations\n\n595\n00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:46.430\nin this knowledge area and\nin some upcoming episodes.\n\n596\n00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:47.810\nBut it's really important for\n\n597\n00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:51.975\nyou to understand that any time you make\na change, you have to effectively go back\n\n598\n00:29:51.975 --> 00:29:56.605\nthrough that SDLC process, kick it off,\nwalk through all the phases again.\n\n599\n00:29:56.605 --> 00:30:00.285\nSome of them may be a lot shorter, may be\nmuch more constrained, because you may\n\n600\n00:30:00.285 --> 00:30:04.250\nnot have to do very wide and very broad\nfunctional requirements gathering and\n\n601\n00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.400\nbusiness analysis to\nunderstand the requirements.\n\n602\n00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.720\nYou may have one simple requirement,\nimplement this particular change.\n\n603\n00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:13.440\nBut you still have to document, you still\nhave to test, you still have to implement,\n\n604\n00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.680\nyou still have to operate,\nyou still have to manage and\n\n605\n00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.700\nultimately decommission,\nover that life cycle, that change.\n\n606\n00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.410\nYou have to integrate it\ninto the existing system.\n\n607\n00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:25.050\nSo revision and system replacement\nneeds to kick off its own SDLC, and\n\n608\n00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.690\nyou wanna make sure\nyou're aware of that and\n\n609\n00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:30.690\nthinking about that to understand how\nthat ultimately comes to fruition.\n\n610\n00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:32.870\nAs we wrap up our\nconversation in this area,\n\n611\n00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:36.100\nat least initially to get started,\nwe also just wanna point out to you and\n\n612\n00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.400\nthink about the fact, as I mentioned,\nthere are several different ways,\n\n613\n00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.370\napproaches we can jump into,\nto carry out the SDLC.\n\n614\n00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:46.150\nThere are what are known as capability\nmaturity models for software development.\n\n615\n00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.230\nWe generically call them CMMs,\ncapability maturity models.\n\n616\n00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.830\nThere is a software\ncapability maturity model.\n\n617\n00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:54.270\nThere are different maturity\nmodels that exist out there.\n\n618\n00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:57.820\nThe generic idea of a capability maturity\nmodel is the idea of going through\n\n619\n00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:02.400\na phased or stepped and very well\ndocumented set of phases to move from\n\n620\n00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:08.000\na less well understood, less mature, less\ndocumented state in the organization or\n\n621\n00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.310\nthe system, or in this case, in software,\n\n622\n00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:15.590\nthrough very distinctly defined\nphases towards a more documented,\n\n623\n00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:19.950\nmore understood, better, more mature\nphase towards the end of that life cycle.\n\n624\n00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.610\nWe move up, in other words,\ntypically, in maturity.\n\n625\n00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:30.050\nAnd so we go from a very immature or a\nlack of maturity, a very misunderstood or\n\n626\n00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:34.555\nvery lack of understanding, very lack of\nunderstanding, that's a technical term.\n\n627\n00:31:34.555 --> 00:31:35.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not a lot of understanding in\n\n628\n00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:36.820\nthe system.\n\n629\n00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:40.270\nIn other words, not well documented,\nnot well understood, not very mature,\n\n630\n00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:45.620\nto a more graded thought process up over\ntime towards a higher level of maturity,\n\n631\n00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.790\nultimately, higher level of understanding.\n\n632\n00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:52.200\nBetter management process is implemented,\nprocedures are implemented, things\n\n633\n00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.270\nare audited, they are validated, they\nare checked, they are well documented,\n\n634\n00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:58.680\nthis is the progression we make as we move\nthrough our capability maturity model.\n\n635\n00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.240\nWe just wanna be thinking about that.\n\n636\n00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.430\nThere's also ISO standards\nthat may be valuable here.\n\n637\n00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.881\nWe've mentioned several ISO\nstandards along the way.\n\n638\n00:32:05.881 --> 00:32:10.716\nISO 90,000 and 3, 9,0,0,0,0,3, 2014 is\n\n639\n00:32:10.716 --> 00:32:16.450\nappropriate to most software development\nand software quality management.\n\n640\n00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:17.435\nWe talk about that TQM,\n\n641\n00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:20.772\ntotal quality management,\nwith regards to the ISO standard.\n\n642\n00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:25.172\nSo ISO 90003,\n2014 is the current update on that.\n\n643\n00:32:25.172 --> 00:32:29.242\nSo that's gonna be a TQM solution that\nhelps us focus on total quality management\n\n644\n00:32:29.242 --> 00:32:33.776\nand allows us to understand how to do so\nfrom a standardized internationally\n\n645\n00:32:33.776 --> 00:32:35.856\napproved, or\nat least internationally accepted,\n\n646\n00:32:35.856 --> 00:32:39.426\nway of doing things across borders,\nacross organizations.\n\n647\n00:32:39.426 --> 00:32:42.026\nWe thought about operation and\nmaintenance as a cycle area as well,\n\n648\n00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:43.216\nwe've talked about that.\n\n649\n00:32:43.216 --> 00:32:46.792\nTurning on the system, getting it out\nthere, monitoring for performance,\n\n650\n00:32:46.792 --> 00:32:50.422\nensuring continuity of operations,\ndetection and defects of weaknesses and\n\n651\n00:32:50.422 --> 00:32:53.563\nthen documenting those so\nwe can go back and fix them over time.\n\n652\n00:32:53.563 --> 00:32:55.693\nThis is where the rubber meets the road so\nto speak,\n\n653\n00:32:55.693 --> 00:32:59.596\nwhere we actually turn the system on and\noperate and manage it accordingly.\n\n654\n00:32:59.596 --> 00:33:00.536\n>> Very good.\nAll right Adam,\n\n655\n00:33:00.536 --> 00:33:03.386\na lot of great information on\nsoftware development security.\n\n656\n00:33:03.386 --> 00:33:05.516\nAnd I know we got a lot more to go.\n\n657\n00:33:05.516 --> 00:33:06.846\nSo a good look at some of those models,\nthough.\n\n658\n00:33:06.846 --> 00:33:10.126\nI love that phrase,\nsecurity early and often.\n\n659\n00:33:10.126 --> 00:33:12.196\nI think it's really what\nwe wanna keep in mind.\n\n660\n00:33:12.196 --> 00:33:15.576\nSo, remember, if you guys want to\nattend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n661\n00:33:15.576 --> 00:33:19.496\nshoot us an e-mail here\nat

--> 00:00:16.450\n>> Exciting.\n\n4\n00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.970\n>> I'm your host Mike Roerick,\ntoday we're doing our CISSP content And\n\n5\n00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.280\nspecifically we've been looking\nat software development security.\n\n6\n00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.330\nThis is gonna be a part two.\n\n7\n00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.970\nWe've already been discussing it,\nobviously in part one.\n\n8\n00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.960\nSo if you missed that one go back and\nwatch that one.\n\n9\n00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.735\nWe're gonna continue on with, again,\nsoftware development security.\n\n10\n00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:36.800\nAnd as always, here to help us\nwith this is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.690\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n12\n00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.250\n>> Good.\nGood.\n\n13\n00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.390\nPart one equals part two.\n\n14\n00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.416\nThat's Mike math by the way.\n\n15\n00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:42.430\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In case you were wondering about that.\n\n16\n00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.450\nSo we're going to continue our\nconversations as we were discussing and\n\n17\n00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.880\nMike led us down the path to move towards.\n\n18\n00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.750\nYou know, we've been talking\nabout secure lifecycles and\n\n19\n00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.340\nSDLCs and the reasons why and\nthe importance of understanding how to\n\n20\n00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.260\nbuild security in at every level,\nat every phase of development.\n\n21\n00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.220\nIt's very, very important.\n\n22\n00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.160\nI mentioned secure early and secure often.\n\n23\n00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.040\nMike liked that one a lot.\n\n24\n00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.500\nHe's actually getting that printed on his\n\n25\n00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.203\nbusiness cards-\n\n26\n00:01:06.203 --> 00:01:07.038\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Going forward.\n\n27\n00:01:07.038 --> 00:01:10.430\nIt'll say Mike Rodrick, Edutainer,\nsecure early secure often.\n\n28\n00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.520\n>> I've already got my tatoo design.\n\n29\n00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.515\n>> He's got it all set up.\n\n30\n00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:18.250\nSo, thinking about the idea that we need\nto and it's just, it's a catchy phrase so\n\n31\n00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.500\nI don't know, all kidding aside.\n\n32\n00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.660\nIt helps us to understand what the thought\nprocess of the CISSP needs to be,\n\n33\n00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.310\nwhich is always be thinking security,\nright?\n\n34\n00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.860\nAnother good catch phrase\nwe can rely on there.\n\n35\n00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.590\nSecure early, secure often,\nalways be thinking security,\n\n36\n00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.300\nbecause these are important things.\n\n37\n00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.080\nOne of the most important things we can\ndo, we've talked about the need for\n\n38\n00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.420\ndocumentation, how good it needs to be,\nhow important it is.\n\n39\n00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.530\nOne of the most important things we\ncan do is document exactly that,\n\n40\n00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.080\nwhat we're doing at every\nstep in the life cycle.\n\n41\n00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.550\nAnd to that end, to that effect,\nthe outcome of documentation Is really\n\n42\n00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.490\nkind of paired with two thought processes,\nchange and configuration management.\n\n43\n00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.720\nI've mentioned them already in the prior\nepisodes as we were setting up and\n\n44\n00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.740\ntalking through the phases of the SVLC,\nmentioned how important they are.\n\n45\n00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.470\nMention the reasons why we need to\nbe thinking about change management.\n\n46\n00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.560\nChange management should kick in,\nshould be a part of everything we do.\n\n47\n00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.190\nJust like security should kick in,\n\n48\n00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.930\nbe a part of everything we do from\nthe beginning of our development efforts.\n\n49\n00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.340\nIf we are thinking about change and change\nmanagement at every step in the SDLC,\n\n50\n00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.160\nthen what we're gonna do is we're\ngonna have better documentation,\n\n51\n00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.940\nbecause we're gonna be\nconstantly assessing and\n\n52\n00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.440\nlooking at the current state of\nsomething is, whatever it is.\n\n53\n00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.940\nAnd we're going to look at what we're\ndoing to affect that current state.\n\n54\n00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.450\nChange management is\nall about understanding\n\n55\n00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.740\nthat something exists in a state,\nwhatever that state is today.\n\n56\n00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.930\nAnd as we impact that something,\nthrough an add, a modification, a revoke,\n\n57\n00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.050\nan update, whatever it may be, anything\nthat in any way alters that current state,\n\n58\n00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.880\nthat known good state as\nwe often talk about it.\n\n59\n00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.350\nThen change management has to come along,\nkick in, and\n\n60\n00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.810\nbe apart of that thought process.\n\n61\n00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.400\nNow, you may be sitting there thinking and\nsaying to yourself, well Adam,\n\n62\n00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.970\nthat's good.\n\n63\n00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.090\nBut the reality is, if we're developing\nsomething that's brand new and\n\n64\n00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.190\nit doesn't exist today.\n\n65\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.250\nThen why is change management important?\n\n66\n00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.860\nMaybe I don't have anything that exists.\n\n67\n00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.960\nMaybe I don't have to worry about that.\n\n68\n00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.820\nWell you still do, right, because\nthe reality is even though you don't have\n\n69\n00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.240\nanything that exists today,\nyou have other things, right,\n\n70\n00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.110\nthat are going to be impacted\nby the thing you're working on.\n\n71\n00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.040\nAnd SDLCs, development life cycles,\nare not just about developing the product,\n\n72\n00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.130\nthe good, the service, the system,\nthe software that you're working on.\n\n73\n00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.410\nBut it's about ultimately\nintegrating those things,\n\n74\n00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.840\nwhatever that is, into the existing\nsystem, the existing service,\n\n75\n00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.930\nthe existing offering or\nsoftware that you have.\n\n76\n00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.980\nAnd you have those in your systems.\n\n77\n00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.010\nThere is something there today.\n\n78\n00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.250\nIt may not be something that directly\nrelates to what we're gonna do with SDLC,\n\n79\n00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.140\nbut unless we can validate it\nbeyond any reasonable doubt,\n\n80\n00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.520\nthat it will not impact in any way what\nthe current state of the system is.\n\n81\n00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.420\nThe impact or the change that that\nSDLC that you're working through\n\n82\n00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.650\nwill have on the current system\nhas to be accounted for.\n\n83\n00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.940\nAnd this is what change\nmanagement is all about.\n\n84\n00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.820\nIt's about, obviously, generically,\nthe idea of change, but\n\n85\n00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.180\nin this regard, in this circumstance with\nspecificity related to this conversation.\n\n86\n00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.130\nIt's about not only what you're doing,\nbut the impact of what\n\n87\n00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.080\nyou're doing on the existing things\nthat are already up and running.\n\n88\n00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.580\nThat are in your system,\nthat make up and affect your work.\n\n89\n00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.850\nSo it's about what changes\nyou're going to introduce, and\n\n90\n00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.640\nwhat impact those changes\nare going to have.\n\n91\n00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.845\nWe've spoken before about\nthe butterfly effect.\n\n92\n00:04:27.845 --> 00:04:30.060\nAbout the idea of intended consequence.\n\n93\n00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.310\nAbout the idea of unmanaged and\nundocumented change.\n\n94\n00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.130\nAnd the negative specificity that that\ncan have and that can bring in to.\n\n95\n00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.080\nAnd the vulnerability Abilities and\nthe threats and\n\n96\n00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.040\nthe risks that that can implement or\nintroduce into your organization.\n\n97\n00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.170\nEither looked for or\nunlooked for, intended or\n\n98\n00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.970\nunintended, unintended consequences\nare still consequences, right.\n\n99\n00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.780\nAnd even though we didn't mean to\ndo something, if the outcome is,\n\n100\n00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.810\nhey, that happened, then guess what,\nyou're still responsible.\n\n101\n00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.130\nSo, at the end of the day,\nwhether you do it on purpose or not,\n\n102\n00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.440\nyou still as a CISSP are responsible for\nunderstanding how to manage that outcome.\n\n103\n00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.590\nDue care and due diligence.\n\n104\n00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.260\nWe never get away from those terms.\n\n105\n00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.810\nWe never move away from risk.\n\n106\n00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.050\nWe never move away from the ideas that\nthese systems that are under our care\n\n107\n00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.840\nare feeding our management have\nto be monitored continuously,\n\n108\n00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.000\nhave to be audited regularly,\nhave to be validated on an ongoing basis.\n\n109\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.280\nAnd that anything that\nimpacts them negatively or\n\n110\n00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.960\nimpacts them positively, either way,\nit has to documented and accounted for.\n\n111\n00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.825\nSo very, very important,\nit's a thought process, right?\n\n112\n00:05:27.825 --> 00:05:28.481\n>> Very good, yes.\n\n113\n00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:29.670\n>> So yeah, so something to consider.\n\n114\n00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:30.552\nI'm glad Mike agrees.\n\n115\n00:05:30.552 --> 00:05:32.386\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Cuz if he said no I'd be done,\n\n116\n00:05:32.386 --> 00:05:35.210\nId' have to thrown in the towel,\njust walk out of here, throw down the mic,\n\n117\n00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.902\nwe'd be out of here,\nwe'd be on to something else.\n\n118\n00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:39.270\nWe could talk about espresso,\nhow to make a good espresso.\n\n119\n00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.787\nIt always a favorite topic\nof mine as you well know.\n\n120\n00:05:39.787 --> 00:05:41.093\n>> And you do make some good espresso.\n\n121\n00:05:41.093 --> 00:05:41.795\n>> I do, I do.\n\n122\n00:05:41.795 --> 00:05:43.720\nSo think about change management.\n\n123\n00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.850\nIt's very, very important.\n\n124\n00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.300\nRight?\nSo successful change management.\n\n125\n00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.980\nWhat does that require,\nwhat does that entail.\n\n126\n00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:49.980\nIt entails a couple of things.\n\n127\n00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.320\nFirst, awareness of current state, right?\n\n128\n00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.790\nWhat it is, the as is in other words,\n\n129\n00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.590\nthat we are thinking about, the current\nstate of affairs must be well documented.\n\n130\n00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.840\nIf we don't know what we're doing today,\n\n131\n00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.750\nif we don't know what\nthe system is capable of,\n\n132\n00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.480\nwe don't understand what is going on,\nhow can we possibly understand what\n\n133\n00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.370\nchange is happening in the impact of that\nchange, good, bad, or indifferent, right.\n\n134\n00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:10.570\nCuz change could be good.\n\n135\n00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.300\nIt could be negative.\n\n136\n00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.600\nIt could also be value neutral.\n\n137\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.520\nAnd in fact, we could make a change but\nnothing really happens.\n\n138\n00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.860\nIt just keeps going and everything's okay.\n\n139\n00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.460\nBut the reality is,\nwhether change is good, bad, or\n\n140\n00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.710\nvalue neutral,\nthe reality of that situation is if\n\n141\n00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.900\nwe don't understand what the modern\ncurrent state documented as is state is,\n\n142\n00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.660\nwe have no idea how to measure change and\nno idea how to measure impact change.\n\n143\n00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.910\nSo it's our responsibility to understand\nthe current states of our systems.\n\n144\n00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:35.840\nVery important.\n\n145\n00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.510\nSo, we have to understand\neffectively what that is.\n\n146\n00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.850\nWe have to communicate that effectively.\n\n147\n00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.710\nWe have to document that effectively.\n\n148\n00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.680\nThis implies continuous monitoring,\n\n149\n00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.340\nimplies auditability of all\ntransactions in the system.\n\n150\n00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.170\nIt implies traceability of all\ntransactions in the system.\n\n151\n00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.090\nIt implies visibility to everything\nthat's going on in the system.\n\n152\n00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.680\nAll these things are part\nof a well thought through,\n\n153\n00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.980\nultimately a mature change\nmanagement process.\n\n154\n00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.500\nYou can take, and\nI often will talk to customers and\n\n155\n00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.570\nstudents about this in classes or\nwhen I'm having meetings with them.\n\n156\n00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.010\nIt's very easy, and\nI don't often say something is easy,\n\n157\n00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.670\nbecause most things are not, at least\nnot when you get into the details.\n\n158\n00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.460\nAnd often on the surface\nthey may seem that way,\n\n159\n00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.370\nbut reality is we often find as\nwe get good at something and\n\n160\n00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.310\nwe really understand how to do it well,\nthat it's not easy.\n\n161\n00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:21.850\nIt may look easy, but\nit's really not that easy.\n\n162\n00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:26.810\nBut understanding whether you have a good\ngrasp of change and change management\n\n163\n00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.110\nin you organization, is actually a fairly\nstraightforward and easy thought process.\n\n164\n00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.150\nNot managing change, let me be clear.\n\n165\n00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.770\nManaging change is complicated.\n\n166\n00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.720\nBut understanding whether you\nare doing that effectively\n\n167\n00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:41.300\nin your organization is actually\nfairly straight forward and easy.\n\n168\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.120\nIt's a fairly simple litmus test.\n\n169\n00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.990\nA litmus test,\n\n170\n00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:47.940\ngenerically, is a test that we can\nuse to validate an assumption, right?\n\n171\n00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.645\nIf we think about saying yes,\nthis is like this or like that.\n\n172\n00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:54.465\nWe can use a litmus test,\na validation test to see whether or\n\n173\n00:07:54.465 --> 00:07:56.525\nnot that statement is true or false.\n\n174\n00:07:56.525 --> 00:07:59.772\nWe can understand whether we have\na good handle on change using a fairly\n\n175\n00:07:59.772 --> 00:08:01.765\nstraightforward and simple litmus test.\n\n176\n00:08:01.765 --> 00:08:04.144\nIf our documentation Is good, for\n\n177\n00:08:04.144 --> 00:08:08.005\ndocumentation speaks to our\nability to manage change.\n\n178\n00:08:08.005 --> 00:08:12.506\nWe should be able to look at, understand,\nand see evidence of a well formed, robust,\n\n179\n00:08:12.506 --> 00:08:16.140\nand mature change management\nprocess in the organization.\n\n180\n00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.560\nIf we have a well documented,\nwell thought out, well operating or\n\n181\n00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.810\ngood, and well implemented\nchange management process,\n\n182\n00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:29.150\nthen no change should be allowed to occur\nwithout running through that process,\n\n183\n00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:31.512\nwithout documentation,\nand without approval.\n\n184\n00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:34.280\nAnd if change has not been approved,\nit should never be implemented.\n\n185\n00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.360\nIf we can look to that process and\nwe can look to that system, and\n\n186\n00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:41.650\nit's working, then we know that change\nmanagement has been implemented correctly.\n\n187\n00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.970\nWe don't know whether it's actually\nfunctioning as well as it could.\n\n188\n00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.860\nWe need to do more due diligence.\n\n189\n00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.110\nWe need to investigate to establish that.\n\n190\n00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.676\nBut what we can tell on the surface\nis that there is a well-documented,\n\n191\n00:08:53.676 --> 00:08:57.450\nwell-understood, and\nimplemented process that speaks to change,\n\n192\n00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.590\nthe impact of change, the management\nof change in the organization.\n\n193\n00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:01.790\nRemember, when we come in and\n\n194\n00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:05.480\ndo auditing work, this is one of the key\nthings we look for as a security auditor,\n\n195\n00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.070\nwe're gonna ask you what kind of change\nmanagement process do you have in place?\n\n196\n00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.170\nIs it well documented?\n\n197\n00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.380\nCan you explain it to me?\n\n198\n00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.122\nCan you show it to me?\n\n199\n00:09:12.122 --> 00:09:15.350\nI wanna see evidence of the last five\nchanges that went through the process.\n\n200\n00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.190\nShow me your change log,\nis something an auditor may ask you.\n\n201\n00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.820\nShow me your forward schedule of change,\n\n202\n00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.790\nyour FSC, which is effectively\na projected change management schedule\n\n203\n00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.500\nthat goes into your next change\nmanagement window or release cycle.\n\n204\n00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.530\nIt's going to effectively be up on\na board somewhere in theory as a calendar\n\n205\n00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.500\nthat you're managing as.\n\n206\n00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.710\nNow, that may be a virtual board,\nit may be in SharePoint as a calendar,\n\n207\n00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.710\nit may be up on a white board\nin a project manager's office,\n\n208\n00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.740\nI don't care where it is,\nbut I wanna see it.\n\n209\n00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.230\nYou can show me a printed\ncalendar as a page and say,\n\n210\n00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:46.310\nwell here's the next 30 days of\nchange schedule that we have and\n\n211\n00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.530\nthis is what we've done,\nthis is what we're gonna do.\n\n212\n00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.890\nI'll say, great that's awesome.\n\n213\n00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.170\nIf you can't show me that I'm\ngonna question whether or\n\n214\n00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.620\nnot change management's\neffective in the organization.\n\n215\n00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.660\nIf you don't understand what that is when\nI ask you, I'm gonna question whether\n\n216\n00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.940\nchange management's effectively\nimplemented in the organization.\n\n217\n00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.110\nNow a lot of people ask me, say,\nwell, Adam, how do we know all that?\n\n218\n00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.400\nHow do we do know where change lives?\n\n219\n00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.280\nWho manages change?\n\n220\n00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.130\nWe're not really sure.\n\n221\n00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.620\nWe think we're doing, we think\nwe're good at it but I don't know.\n\n222\n00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:14.650\nAs a security practitioner, as a security\nprofessional, as somebody that does this,\n\n223\n00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.830\nchange is important.\n\n224\n00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.260\nI get it, I know what you're saying.\n\n225\n00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.850\nIt's central to my world, but\n\n226\n00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.780\nhonestly I'm not the one who\nmanages it in the organization.\n\n227\n00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.370\nI have this conversation all the time with\ncustomers, all the time with students.\n\n228\n00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.950\nI am not responsible for\nit even though I know how important it is.\n\n229\n00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.600\nAnd the people that are,\nI don't really understand very well.\n\n230\n00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.630\nI don't interact with them.\n\n231\n00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:33.895\nI don't have a lot to do with them.\n\n232\n00:10:33.895 --> 00:10:37.414\nI'm kind of divorced, I'm separated\nfrom that whole process, and so,\n\n233\n00:10:37.414 --> 00:10:38.510\nhow do I know, right?\n\n234\n00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.450\nAnd it's a valid question,\nhow do you know?\n\n235\n00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.100\nWhat you're asking in effect\nis where is my litmus test?\n\n236\n00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.110\nShow me how to validate, right?\n\n237\n00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.630\nYou're telling me it's easy, but\nshow me what I can do to figure it out.\n\n238\n00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.860\nSo what I often talk to people about\nwhen they ask that question is,\n\n239\n00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.910\nwhere do you go to find\nchange in the organization?\n\n240\n00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:56.930\nRight, because if you know where to look,\nand not change itself, but\n\n241\n00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:59.710\nwhere is change being managed is\nreally what we're focusing on.\n\n242\n00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:02.490\nWhere do we go to find where change is and\nwhere it's being managed?\n\n243\n00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.741\nIf you go to where change lives,\nthen you can find out what's there, right?\n\n244\n00:11:05.741 --> 00:11:09.597\nYou knock on the door and a change manager\nanswers the door, pokes out their head and\n\n245\n00:11:09.597 --> 00:11:10.930\nsays, hello, how are you?\n\n246\n00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.290\nI'm here to manage change.\n\n247\n00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:18.020\nIf they say that to you, then that's what\nyou're looking for virtually to validate.\n\n248\n00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.180\nSo the question really is where\ndo I go to manage change or\n\n249\n00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.710\nwhere do I go to see change being\nmanaged in the organization?\n\n250\n00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:25.160\nThe answer again can be\nfairly straightforward or\n\n251\n00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.180\ncan be incredibly obtuse and complex.\n\n252\n00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:30.040\nLet's go to the fairly\nstraightforward version for a moment.\n\n253\n00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.697\nMost organizations that are good at\nchange management, again most not all,\n\n254\n00:11:33.697 --> 00:11:35.170\nnothing is 100%, right?\n\n255\n00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.370\nBut most will have a PMO,\na project management office, and\n\n256\n00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.670\nthey will have a well-defined\norganizational entity\n\n257\n00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:46.890\nthat is responsible for project management\nand all of that that goes with it.\n\n258\n00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.140\nBut change management is the key\ncomponent of project management.\n\n259\n00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.400\nAnd so where you often go and find\nchange living change being managed and\n\n260\n00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.280\nchange being dealt with in an organization\nthat's mature is through the PMO,\n\n261\n00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.050\nthrough the project management office.\n\n262\n00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:07.440\nAnd if you have an established PMO and, or\nyou have RMOs, risk management officers,\n\n263\n00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.970\na chief risk officer, CRM, or\nsomething like chief risk manager or\n\n264\n00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.960\nchief risk officer, CRO, they're called\ndifferent things in organizations today.\n\n265\n00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.810\nBut we're seeing more and more that at\nthe sea level of organizations that\n\n266\n00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:23.400\nreally understand change and understand\nrisk, that this is an established and\n\n267\n00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.440\nnow well-documented role\nthat is being carved out and\n\n268\n00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:30.650\nbeing dedicated as a resource,\nmanagement of change, management of risk.\n\n269\n00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:33.790\nSo you may have a chief risk officer,\nyou may have a chief risk manager.\n\n270\n00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.140\nYou may have a chief change officer or\nchange manager.\n\n271\n00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.770\nThese are roles that exist and\nthey typically are tied to a PMO.\n\n272\n00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.670\nThen they report up under a CIO,\na CTO, a CSO,\n\n273\n00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:48.060\na CISO laterally, they may be part of\nthat team, they may stand separately.\n\n274\n00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.690\nBut ultimately you will see change in\nthe organization in those spheres, and\n\n275\n00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:55.120\nif you find them, that's where you\ntypically can go to look for change.\n\n276\n00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.940\nAnother place to look today,\nbelieve it or not,\n\n277\n00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.860\nis something that has become more\ncommon today, is something that\n\n278\n00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:03.890\nwe're hearing a lot about as a framework\nin an area, something called DevOps.\n\n279\n00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.710\nYou may have heard of DevOps,\nshort for development operations or\n\n280\n00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:10.260\ndevelopment slash operations,\nthe marrying of development,\n\n281\n00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.540\nSDLC kind of thought processes,\nsoftware and\n\n282\n00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.470\nsystem development, with operational\ncapabilities and capacity.\n\n283\n00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:23.580\nDevOps is an acronym or a slang shortening\nof that for general consumption.\n\n284\n00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.320\nWhen we think about DevOps as\na framework and a thought process,\n\n285\n00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.020\nwe think about the ideas\nof marrying development and\n\n286\n00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:33.050\noperational capabilities together, and\nthen pursuing that thought process.\n\n287\n00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:37.420\nReally focused highly on automation and\ncentral management,\n\n288\n00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.850\nand control of systems and processing, and\n\n289\n00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.430\nprovisioning, and DevOps is really\nall about that thought process.\n\n290\n00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.060\nTechnology like containerization and\nvirtualization plays a big part,\n\n291\n00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.150\nas does scripting and work flow\nautomation within the DevOps world today.\n\n292\n00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:54.620\nBut DevOps is highly\nhyper-focused on change and\n\n293\n00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.130\nchange management as well, because you\ncan't do DevOps correctly today if\n\n294\n00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.800\nyou don't understand change management.\n\n295\n00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.810\nAnd so if you see DevOps emerging\nin your world and you see\n\n296\n00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.700\na thought process around pursuing a DevOps\nframework or a DevOps thought process,\n\n297\n00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:12.070\nyou are seeing change management emerging\nin the organization, perhaps under\n\n298\n00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:15.150\na different name, under a different guise,\nbut ultimately seeing it there as well.\n\n299\n00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.820\nAnd that's something you have just to be\naware of and to be thinking about, and\n\n300\n00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.920\nto be thinking about the ability to\nbe able to communicate effectively,\n\n301\n00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.140\nmanage to a schedule, understand risk and\n\n302\n00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.800\nmanage through change is really\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n303\n00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.000\nAnd seeing how that emerges in\nthe organization, and linking it back to\n\n304\n00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.650\nthe thought process of the SDLC is\ngonna be very important for you.\n\n305\n00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.126\nRemember we're thinking about mile-wide,\n\n306\n00:14:34.126 --> 00:14:37.680\ninch-deep knowledge, and we're spending\na lot of time talking about change.\n\n307\n00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.199\nAnd it's a theme, like risk,\n\n308\n00:14:39.199 --> 00:14:43.350\nthat we've talked about in several places\nacross different knowledge areas within\n\n309\n00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:46.637\nmultiple episodes across the CISSP\nconversation we're having.\n\n310\n00:14:46.637 --> 00:14:50.057\nThat should give you some indication\nof the importance of the idea, but\n\n311\n00:14:50.057 --> 00:14:53.603\nperhaps not an indication of the\nspecificity of that idea in any one area.\n\n312\n00:14:53.603 --> 00:14:58.003\nBut what I'm trying to communicate to you\nwithout being too obtuse about it is your\n\n313\n00:14:58.003 --> 00:15:01.660\nchange, change management, risk,\nthese are important themes.\n\n314\n00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.259\nThese are themes that we can ask lots\nof questions about from different\n\n315\n00:15:05.259 --> 00:15:06.606\nperspectives on an exam.\n\n316\n00:15:06.606 --> 00:15:10.936\nAnd these are questions that we can talk\nabout as CISSPs in the organization,\n\n317\n00:15:10.936 --> 00:15:14.873\nat multiple levels with different\naudiences for different reasons.\n\n318\n00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:17.125\nYou need to be prepared to\nhave those conversations.\n\n319\n00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:20.429\nYou need to be prepared to answer those\nquestions when they emerge in order to be\n\n320\n00:15:20.429 --> 00:15:21.320\nsuccessful.\n\n321\n00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:25.790\nIt's very important for you and important\nfor your candidacy as a CISSP candidate in\n\n322\n00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:30.190\norder to be successful to move on to\nbecome a CISSP, and ultimately over time\n\n323\n00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.250\nto take your skills and\nput them into practice in the real world.\n\n324\n00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.906\nAs we continue our conversations,\nchange management,\n\n325\n00:15:35.906 --> 00:15:37.515\nDevOps, all those things are important but\n\n326\n00:15:37.515 --> 00:15:39.990\nenforcing security controls within\nthe development environment.\n\n327\n00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:44.140\nAnd thinking about how we do that\nwith regards to the discussion round,\n\n328\n00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.190\nwhat kinda methodologies we may use,\nwhat are the models in other words,\n\n329\n00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:49.470\nthat represent the SDLCs\nwe've been talking about.\n\n330\n00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.801\nWe mentioned some, but it's a good\nidea to bring them back up again and\n\n331\n00:15:51.801 --> 00:15:52.837\njust quickly go through them.\n\n332\n00:15:52.837 --> 00:15:55.350\nMike's kindly volunteered to\nwalk us through those models.\n\n333\n00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:58.788\nHe's gonna now, I'm gonna sit down for\na couple minutes, rest my My feet,\n\n334\n00:15:58.788 --> 00:16:01.546\nI got my cool socks on so\nI wanna give those a break real quick.\n\n335\n00:16:01.546 --> 00:16:02.796\nWe didn't get a shot of\nthe cool socks by the way.\n\n336\n00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:03.470\n>> We didn't?\n\n337\n00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:04.660\n>> No, you got to see the cool socks.\n\n338\n00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.910\nSo cool socks, it's kind of hard to see\nbut I'm doing a, rocking a pink and\n\n339\n00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.520\ngrey with a little brown\nstripe in there today.\n\n340\n00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.125\nSo kind of a cool little thing with\nthe pink highlights on the bottom.\n\n341\n00:16:14.125 --> 00:16:14.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right so\n\n342\n00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.770\nstarting off the new\nyear with a cool sock.\n\n343\n00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:20.760\nSo we wanna think about those, and make\nsure we're aware not only of the cool sock\n\n344\n00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.090\noptions, cuz those are very important for\nwell-dressed CISSPs this year as well, but\n\n345\n00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.520\nwhat the options are from\nthe perspective of understanding,\n\n346\n00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.250\nwhat models that we have to focus on.\n\n347\n00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.540\nThings like waterfall,\nthings like the iterative life cycle,\n\n348\n00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.170\nsuch as rad or jad,\nright, jit, just in time.\n\n349\n00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.950\nThese are all models that\nmay be important to us.\n\n350\n00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.930\nSo structured programming developments,\nspiral method,\n\n351\n00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.830\nclean room, these are all\nexamples of system models, or\n\n352\n00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.950\ndevelopment models that follow\na waterfall like methodology.\n\n353\n00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.480\nVery clearly defined steps within a phase.\n\n354\n00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.050\nVery clear transition from phase to phase.\n\n355\n00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:56.960\nOutput of one phase becomes input for\nthe next.\n\n356\n00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.480\nThis is really what we're thinking about.\n\n357\n00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.905\nAnd we have to have clear documentation,\nas we move through these kinds of models.\n\n358\n00:17:02.905 --> 00:17:05.455\nWhen we think about iterative development,\nmodels.\n\n359\n00:17:05.455 --> 00:17:09.295\nWe think about models that are going\nto effectively cycle through\n\n360\n00:17:09.295 --> 00:17:13.325\nsome sort of a process and\nthen come back and loop back around, and\n\n361\n00:17:13.325 --> 00:17:15.845\ntake multiple passes at\nsomething to get it right.\n\n362\n00:17:15.845 --> 00:17:19.285\nThings like prototyping, is a good example\nof an iterative development model.\n\n363\n00:17:19.285 --> 00:17:22.575\nWhere we build a prototype,\nwe may adjust it based on feedback,\n\n364\n00:17:22.575 --> 00:17:26.305\ngo through multiple feedback sessions\nadjusting as we go, iteratively,\n\n365\n00:17:26.305 --> 00:17:29.600\nin other words, spiraling around or\ngoing through multiple cycles.\n\n366\n00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:32.900\nAnd then eventually we get to a finish\nline where we feel comfortable,\n\n367\n00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:36.890\nwe release that, and then perhaps you'll\ngo through that process multiple times as\n\n368\n00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.300\nwe continue to update.\n\n369\n00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.450\nSo thinking about prototyping,\na good example of iterative development.\n\n370\n00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:46.240\nI mentioned rad, I mentioned jad,\nrapid application, joint application or\n\n371\n00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.610\njoint analysis development.\n\n372\n00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.120\nThese are rad and jad.\n\n373\n00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.190\nExploratory model,\nmodified prototyping model,\n\n374\n00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:55.090\nthese are all examples of\niterative development models.\n\n375\n00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.873\nWhat I spend a huge amount of time\nunderstanding the model types or\n\n376\n00:17:58.873 --> 00:18:01.970\nI spend a huge amount of time\nbeing able to define them all.\n\n377\n00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.595\nIf we're not spending a huge\namount of time doing that for you,\n\n378\n00:18:04.595 --> 00:18:08.720\nit's probably not worth your investment of\ntime to do that, but what I would suggest\n\n379\n00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.640\nis that it would be helpful to have\nan example, a working example of one or\n\n380\n00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.430\ntwo in the category of iterative,\nin the category of a waterfall like model.\n\n381\n00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.150\nMeaning, if I said to you, hey of\nthe list that you see on the screen,\n\n382\n00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:23.900\nwhat are two examples of\niterative development models,\n\n383\n00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.140\nit would be good to be able\nto pick out the examples.\n\n384\n00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:29.150\nAnd know that they align themselves\nwith iterative as opposed to\n\n385\n00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.480\nwith a waterfall model.\n\n386\n00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.820\nBut aside from that,\nwould I spend a lot of time investing and\n\n387\n00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.640\nknowing the difference between jad and\nrad from a definition standpoint?\n\n388\n00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.820\nNot unless you wanna become\na software development engineer.\n\n389\n00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.460\nIn which case I would definitely want to\nknow those, but you're gonna go beyond\n\n390\n00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:45.450\nthe knowledge we're giving you here, and\ndo a lot more, to become good at that.\n\n391\n00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.870\nAnd that's gonna be more than mile wide,\ninch deep, so just be aware of that and\n\n392\n00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:49.470\nthink through that.\n\n393\n00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.180\nSo a lot of other models\nthat exist out there,\n\n394\n00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:55.080\nkeeping in mind that the model\nthat's the most appropriate for\n\n395\n00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.060\nthe decisions you're making about\nhow to develop that system,\n\n396\n00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.270\nis the one that matches the expectations\nof the stakeholders and\n\n397\n00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:05.520\ngives you the clearest path and the most\nlikely capability to be successful.\n\n398\n00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.620\nAnd that model choice may change\nprogram to program, project to project,\n\n399\n00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.150\nsystem to system, so be aware of\nthe fact that it's not gonna be oh,\n\n400\n00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.510\nI always do waterfall no matter what.\n\n401\n00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.140\nI always do agile no matter what.\n\n402\n00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:19.460\nYour shop may be that way, and you may be\nset up, and that may be the framework,\n\n403\n00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.470\nthat your company uses to do\ndevelopment through project management.\n\n404\n00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:27.330\nAnd that's fine, but that means that\nyou've adjusted your STLC to marry it\n\n405\n00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:31.100\nto the needs of that framework, and that\nframework supports the requirements that\n\n406\n00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.680\nyou are pushing towards and\nthe way in which you gather them.\n\n407\n00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.580\nBut that doesn't mean it's the only\nframework out there that exists,\n\n408\n00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.140\nit also doesn't mean it's\nthe necessarily the best one.\n\n409\n00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.740\nIt means it's the one you've settled on.\n\n410\n00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.660\nAnd it may be the best one at the time,\nbut\n\n411\n00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.640\nthere are certain projects that may\nbenefit from a different model.\n\n412\n00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.840\nAnd that's up to you to decide.\n\n413\n00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.550\nAnd there's no right and wrong, but I do\nwanna point out to you that I talked to\n\n414\n00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:54.940\na lot of customers that say, oh, we're\nagile, bottom line, that's all we do.\n\n415\n00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.200\nWe're this or we're that.\n\n416\n00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:59.130\nWe do agile scrum,\nwhich is just a derivative of agile.\n\n417\n00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.510\nOr we do waterfall, straight waterfall.\n\n418\n00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.730\nWe do spiral.\n\n419\n00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:04.520\nWe do clean room.\n\n420\n00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.480\nWhatever it is.\n\n421\n00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.235\nThere's many, many methods.\n\n422\n00:20:07.235 --> 00:20:10.160\nAdd car, whatever it may be.\n\n423\n00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:15.080\nPoint is, whatever you choose, if that's\nwhat you choose to do in the organization,\n\n424\n00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:19.840\ngreat, but what I hate to hear is that's\nall we do and that's our methodology,\n\n425\n00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.790\nperiod, end of sentence.\n\n426\n00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.230\nBecause not every project fits\nneatly into that methodology box.\n\n427\n00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.660\nAnd there are certain projects that may\nnot really work as well in that box.\n\n428\n00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.240\nAnd you just have to be aware of that.\n\n429\n00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.130\nIt's, again,\nup to you from a perspective of offering\n\n430\n00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.420\nbest possible guidance from a security\nstandpoint to remind the organization that\n\n431\n00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.760\nwhile you have established methodologies,\nyou wanna follow them unless there's\n\n432\n00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:44.940\na compelling reason to the contrary, that\nsometimes there may be compelling reasons.\n\n433\n00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.860\nYou should at least entertain them,\nat least be aware of them.\n\n434\n00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.680\nYou may choose, after full disclosure,\nnot to go down the path of change, and\n\n435\n00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.690\nthat's fine.\n\n436\n00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.750\nBut at least document the risks and\nassociate them with the project,\n\n437\n00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.750\nunderstand them for what they are and\nthen make an educated decision.\n\n438\n00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.040\nNow I know that's easy\nto say in conversation,\n\n439\n00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.630\nI know it's hard to do in reality.\n\n440\n00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:06.820\nAnd I get that and I'm not suggesting for\na minute that you should be the one\n\n441\n00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:11.180\nthat forces the uncomfortable conversation\nto occur every time, just for the sake of\n\n442\n00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:14.960\nplanting your flag in the ground and\nsaying I'm a good CISSP, I did my job.\n\n443\n00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.090\nThat's not what being a good\nCISSP is about by itself.\n\n444\n00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:22.190\nIt's part of a larger thought process,\nlarger dynamic, about how to relate\n\n445\n00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:26.370\nthe needs of the organization to\nthe realities of the security protections\n\n446\n00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:29.191\nthat we have to try to provide\nat every step in the process,\n\n447\n00:21:29.191 --> 00:21:32.100\nright, confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n448\n00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:36.400\nIf it's a marginal protection add or\nvalue add by changing methodologies,\n\n449\n00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.040\nit's probably not worth your time and\ntrouble.\n\n450\n00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:42.440\nBut if there is significant investment in\ntime and effort that will be required, but\n\n451\n00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.980\nthe value that you're going to bring\nis going to equal or exceed that,\n\n452\n00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.160\nit's worth at least acknowledging that,\nand having the dialogue,\n\n453\n00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:52.895\nor having the conversation,\nthe dialogue inside the organization\n\n454\n00:21:52.895 --> 00:21:57.005\nto assess whether a change in\nfocus could actually be positive.\n\n455\n00:21:57.005 --> 00:21:59.925\nAnd that's all I'm suggesting,\nI'm not suggesting you have to do it, I'm\n\n456\n00:21:59.925 --> 00:22:04.065\nsimply suggesting that stopping and taking\nthe time to engage, the dialogue and\n\n457\n00:22:04.065 --> 00:22:06.975\nmake sure it's happening, is really what\nthe most important thought process is.\n\n458\n00:22:06.975 --> 00:22:08.670\nSo think about that.\n\n459\n00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:12.100\nYou may be able to combine models, you may\nbe able to change the thought process for\n\n460\n00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.870\none project, go back to it for another.\n\n461\n00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.280\nThere's a lot of approaches to CISSP may\nthrow on the table, and bring to bear.\n\n462\n00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:21.190\nWhen we think about developing\nsoftware and we think about an SDLC,\n\n463\n00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:23.140\nwe don't just think about\ndeveloping the software itself, but\n\n464\n00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.740\nwe think about what that\nsoftware will do when it's used,\n\n465\n00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.370\nwhat kind of systems will it ultimately\nbe connected to, as we talked about.\n\n466\n00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.080\nAnd database management is often one\nof those things that comes up in this\n\n467\n00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.780\ndialogue, because databases typically not\nonly have to be developed and have to be\n\n468\n00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.590\nmaintained and secured, but they interact\nwith different application front ends and\n\n469\n00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:44.510\ndifferent software platforms because they\ntypically are the backend repositories for\n\n470\n00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.880\nmost of the data that these software\nsystems that we build are gonna need and\n\n471\n00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.280\nor use and\nare gonna be able to communicate.\n\n472\n00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.470\nAnd so database management\nfrom a security standpoint,\n\n473\n00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.670\nbecomes a very important\nthought process as well.\n\n474\n00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:58.640\nSo the DBMS the database management\nsystem or structure is important for\n\n475\n00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.315\nus to at least have some\npassing knowledge of.\n\n476\n00:23:00.315 --> 00:23:04.150\nWe wanna think about the fact that the\nDBMS is gonna be a suite of applications\n\n477\n00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:09.275\nor programs that ultimately allows us\nto be able to manage the database,\n\n478\n00:23:09.275 --> 00:23:12.215\nmanage all the constituent parts and\ncomponents of it, the security,\n\n479\n00:23:12.215 --> 00:23:16.295\nthe implementation of the data model,\nthe software that is gonna implement\n\n480\n00:23:16.295 --> 00:23:20.092\nthe database itself, and the management\nfront end that allows us to control it.\n\n481\n00:23:20.092 --> 00:23:23.802\nSet up access control, set up backups,\nset up all the capabilities and\n\n482\n00:23:23.802 --> 00:23:26.052\nfunctionalities we need in\norder to be able to do this,\n\n483\n00:23:26.052 --> 00:23:28.932\nit stores, maintains and\nprovides access to data\n\n484\n00:23:28.932 --> 00:23:31.902\nusing the ability to typically drive\nthat through querying of some kinds.\n\n485\n00:23:31.902 --> 00:23:34.260\nSo we have a query language\nassociated with it as well,\n\n486\n00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:37.957\nwhether it's a structured query language\nor it's a different kind of query language\n\n487\n00:23:37.957 --> 00:23:40.132\nthere's lots of different\nlanguages out there.\n\n488\n00:23:40.132 --> 00:23:42.132\nBut we ultimately wanna know and\nthink through those.\n\n489\n00:23:42.132 --> 00:23:45.282\nSo, the database engine itself,\nthe hardware platform,\n\n490\n00:23:45.282 --> 00:23:48.936\nthe application software, and\nthe users are all elements of a DBMS,\n\n491\n00:23:48.936 --> 00:23:51.588\nall elements of the database\nmanagement system.\n\n492\n00:23:51.588 --> 00:23:55.054\nWanna know those elements, wanna identify\nwhat they are again, four of them,\n\n493\n00:23:55.054 --> 00:23:56.047\nno particular order.\n\n494\n00:23:56.047 --> 00:23:59.682\nThe database engine itself The hardware\nplatform the database will run on,\n\n495\n00:23:59.682 --> 00:24:03.432\napplication software and then the users\nthat are gonna actually interact with\n\n496\n00:24:03.432 --> 00:24:07.260\nthe system are typically the four elements\nof the DBMS that we often talk about.\n\n497\n00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.000\nWe have different database models\nwe also wanna be aware of.\n\n498\n00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.700\nThe hierarchical database model was\nthe oldest one that typically is out there\n\n499\n00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.320\nyou will come across,\nyou probably are all familiar with it.\n\n500\n00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.120\nIt is gonna store data in\na series of records that have\n\n501\n00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.080\nvalues associated with\nthem in their field and\n\n502\n00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.310\nthen link them through parent child\nrelationships in some sort of a tree.\n\n503\n00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:30.160\nAs a hierarchy, this one we're\nvery commonly associated with.\n\n504\n00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.940\nLDAP for instance is implemented\nas a directory service\n\n505\n00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.710\nsimply using a hierarchical\ndatabase model more often than not.\n\n506\n00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:38.000\nSo just want to be aware of that and\nthink about that.\n\n507\n00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.330\nNetwork database model another model\nthat exists out there from a management\n\n508\n00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.330\nperspective.\n\n509\n00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:45.190\nRepresents the data typically in\nthe form of a network of records.\n\n510\n00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.240\nSo not the network IE,\nthe network we communicate across, but\n\n511\n00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:52.270\nnetwork as in a association, a collection\nof records that are effectively\n\n512\n00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:55.780\njoined together in some way\nthat are related to each other.\n\n513\n00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.830\nRecords are the equivalent of\nthe roads in the relational model and\n\n514\n00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:02.650\nthe record type or sets of records\nin that model so want to think about\n\n515\n00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:06.510\nthe network database model not as\ncommon not something we often will see.\n\n516\n00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.510\nYou may see this in healthcare systems for\ninstance.\n\n517\n00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.400\nOne of the places you may\nsee a model like that.\n\n518\n00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.840\nWe have relational\ndatabase models as well.\n\n519\n00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.380\nThese are based on the idea of being\nable to extract data, be able to\n\n520\n00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.640\nprovide data through extraction so we can\nsee the relationships associated with it.\n\n521\n00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.340\nThis is a common model that\nmost of us are familiar with\n\n522\n00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.530\nof we use modern data bases today.\n\n523\n00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.397\nIf you've ever done any work\nwith Access as a database or\n\n524\n00:25:30.397 --> 00:25:34.545\nMicrosoft SQL or Oracle or IBM's DB2 or\nInformix or any of these big databases,\n\n525\n00:25:34.545 --> 00:25:37.111\nEnterprise level databases,\nthings like that.\n\n526\n00:25:37.111 --> 00:25:41.316\nIf you have had any training on them,\nif you ever used them for anything, if you\n\n527\n00:25:41.316 --> 00:25:45.521\ninteract with them, if you use Excel to be\nable to pull data out of a database and\n\n528\n00:25:45.521 --> 00:25:49.985\ndo analysis on it through pivot tables and\nthings like that and you create tables and\n\n529\n00:25:49.985 --> 00:25:52.982\nthe relationships between\nthem in order to drive that,\n\n530\n00:25:52.982 --> 00:25:55.260\nyou've used a relational model before.\n\n531\n00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:57.720\nAnd you've seen this,\nyou've interacted with it.\n\n532\n00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.600\nMicrosoft Access, predicated on\nthe idea of relational model.\n\n533\n00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.950\nTables are available to us, tables or\nrelations or what they're called.\n\n534\n00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.000\nWe have integrity rules,\n\n535\n00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.160\nwe have data manipulation agents that\ngo into making up the relational model.\n\n536\n00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.410\nSo these are the working parts,\nthe working elements of this model.\n\n537\n00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:16.120\nWhen we think about a data\ntable inside of the database.\n\n538\n00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.640\nAnd I love talking about databases and\n\n539\n00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.970\ntables but lot of people just\naren't very comfortable with it.\n\n540\n00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.020\nThey don't understand a lot about it.\n\n541\n00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.990\nThey think they know, but\nit's a dark scary area.\n\n542\n00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:28.110\nYou look in the table, it looks weird,\nthere's a lot of strange code in there.\n\n543\n00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.569\nThey don't understand all the data and\nhow to interact with it.\n\n544\n00:26:30.569 --> 00:26:33.180\nSo a lot of times we'll say,\nbetter left to the professionals.\n\n545\n00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:36.980\nLet the DBAs, the database analysts or\nadministrators, deal with that.\n\n546\n00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:37.900\nAnd you're absolutely right.\n\n547\n00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.140\nIf they're experts at that,\nthat's what they should do.\n\n548\n00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.360\nBut again, as the CISP we have to have\nworking knowledge of these thing.\n\n549\n00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.790\nAt least enough to understand what\nwe can and cannot do comfortably.\n\n550\n00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.980\nAnd the ability to then make\na determination, say hey, you know what,\n\n551\n00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.410\nMike's the DBA expert.\n\n552\n00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:51.730\nLet me give this job to Mike.\n\n553\n00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.870\nMike's gonna come in query our data for\nus.\n\n554\n00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.443\nHelp us understand the structure\nof the data table.\n\n555\n00:26:56.443 --> 00:26:59.000\nUnderstand the moving parts,\nthe attributed of a table and\n\n556\n00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.160\nthen he's gonna help us\nunderstand how to secure them.\n\n557\n00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.780\nI'm gonna help manage\nthat process as a CISSP.\n\n558\n00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:07.310\nI'm gonna give Mike some guidance and\ndirection.\n\n559\n00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:10.410\nMike's gonna give me the facts in\nother words, say hey, this or that,\n\n560\n00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:12.480\nthis is what's going on,\nthis is what's here.\n\n561\n00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.590\nNow I need some policy,\n\n562\n00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:18.450\nstrategic guidance out of my role to tell\nme what the business subjectives are.\n\n563\n00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:21.650\nHow secure do you wanna make this thing,\nwho should be able to see it, who should\n\n564\n00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:26.110\ninteract with it, how could we query data,\nwhat should we show when query data should\n\n565\n00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:30.240\nwe obfuscate, should we tokenize, do we\nsupport that function in the database?\n\n566\n00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.520\nWe may or may not.\n\n567\n00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.260\nCan we encrypt data fields in a table?\n\n568\n00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.820\nGet asked that all the time as well.\n\n569\n00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.460\nActually, we just had\na interesting conversation with\n\n570\n00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.550\na customer of mine that's looking to\ndo some System Center work, right?\n\n571\n00:27:40.550 --> 00:27:42.750\nAnd System Center's\na really popular program.\n\n572\n00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:46.070\nLot of people use it, or generically\nuse programs like System Center,\n\n573\n00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.340\nfor systems management\nacross the enterprise.\n\n574\n00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:52.110\nYou could be using HP Openview, or\nIBM Tivoli, whatever you may use,\n\n575\n00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:52.670\nit doesn't matter.\n\n576\n00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:56.060\nBut programs like that,\nasset management programs, generically.\n\n577\n00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:59.980\nAnd they ask me, specifically,\nhey do we support field manipulation and\n\n578\n00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:04.630\ndo we support, more importantly,\nencryption of individual data tables and,\n\n579\n00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.670\nmore importantly,\nfields within them for System Center.\n\n580\n00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.910\nAnd specifically for\nSystem Center Config Manager.\n\n581\n00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:11.870\nWithin that particular thought process.\n\n582\n00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:13.750\nAnd so we had a conversation about that.\n\n583\n00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.830\nAnd the problem is we may or may not,\ndepending on the databases that are used.\n\n584\n00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.330\nIn this case, obviously,\nMicrosoft SQL, used to implement.\n\n585\n00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.480\nBut generically, we may or\nmay not support that.\n\n586\n00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.830\nSo we have to be thinking about that,\nright?\n\n587\n00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.530\nWanna think about the fact that\nattributes are gonna be important for\n\n588\n00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:29.980\nus to understand with regards to database\nmanagement and a relational model.\n\n589\n00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.470\nAn attribute is gonna correspond\nto a column in a table.\n\n590\n00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.890\nWe think about table structure,\n\n591\n00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:37.250\nwe often refer to attributes\nas being the columnar values.\n\n592\n00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:40.900\nWhere we think about the tuple of\na table corresponding to a row.\n\n593\n00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.326\nAnd so we wanna be able to think about\ncolumns and rows in the table, but we also\n\n594\n00:28:44.326 --> 00:28:48.370\nwanna call them by their appropriate\nnames in the relational database model.\n\n595\n00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.150\nAttributes equal columns.\n\n596\n00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:52.360\nTuples, T-U-P-L-E, tuple.\n\n597\n00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:52.990\nIt's fun to say.\n\n598\n00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.650\nSay it with me Mike.\n\n599\n00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:54.390\n>> Tuple.\n>> Tuple, tuple.\n\n600\n00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:55.120\nRight?\nTuple.\n\n601\n00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.650\nA tuple equals a row.\n\n602\n00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:59.160\nWanna make sure we understand\nattributes equal columns.\n\n603\n00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.110\nTuples equal rows.\n\n604\n00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.530\nThat is important for you to know.\n\n605\n00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:05.380\nIf you are going to be answering questions\nin some point in the future, primary keys,\n\n606\n00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:08.060\nwe often hear about those and know what\nthose, hopefully know, what those are.\n\n607\n00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:11.710\nPrimary key is gonna be the guaranteed\nmethod of pinpointing an individual tuple,\n\n608\n00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:12.760\nin other words IE.\n\n609\n00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.290\nIt's the only way to properly and\n\n610\n00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:18.450\nauthoritatively reference a row in\nthe table and specify that that is the row\n\n611\n00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:21.640\nwhere the specificity that we\nneed to identify that row.\n\n612\n00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.750\nIt's what our primary key guarantees for\nus.\n\n613\n00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:29.520\nThat's used effectively to identify what\ndata we need to key off of in effect for\n\n614\n00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.590\nspecify in that particular table.\n\n615\n00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:35.840\nAnd then a foreign key simply represents\nthe relation of the table that we\n\n616\n00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:40.787\nare identifying a primary key into another\ntable somewhere else and how we join those\n\n617\n00:29:40.787 --> 00:29:45.612\ntables and refer to that row in the other\ntable by specifying we have a foreign key.\n\n618\n00:29:45.612 --> 00:29:48.779\nWhich is effectively the value\nthat represents our resource or\n\n619\n00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:50.460\na reference rather to an entity.\n\n620\n00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.220\nI'm just reading you\nthe formal definition.\n\n621\n00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.680\nA value, let me try that again.\n\n622\n00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.460\nForeign key, value that represents a\nreference to an entry in some other table.\n\n623\n00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.580\nWhat we mean by that effectively is that\nwe when use a foreign key in table b we\n\n624\n00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:03.710\nare effectively referencing\nan entry in table a.\n\n625\n00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:07.080\nAnd we are using the foreign key\nto reference that from table a.\n\n626\n00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.740\nTable A would have a primary key\nassociated with its reference,\n\n627\n00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.060\nthe row that we need.\n\n628\n00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.850\nThe foreign key would reference table a,\nbut from table b, in effect,\n\n629\n00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:17.000\nwe wanna make sure we understand\nhow these things connect together.\n\n630\n00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.090\nSo, wanna have a good sense,\ngood understanding of that.\n\n631\n00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.780\nWe've mentioned SQL,\nwe've mentioned structure query languages,\n\n632\n00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.900\ngenerically, as a way to communicate\nwith databases within the DBMS.\n\n633\n00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.090\nThe main components of databases\nthat often are gonna use\n\n634\n00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:33.150\nstructure query language will be schemas,\ntables, and views.\n\n635\n00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.270\nAnd we just wanna understand, generically\nthat a schema is the blueprint,\n\n636\n00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.830\nthe design document and in effect,\nif you wanna think of it as\n\n637\n00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:43.380\nthe plan that lays out the database and\ntells us how it's going to be structured.\n\n638\n00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:45.400\nTables are where we actually store data.\n\n639\n00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.780\nGenerically, they're holding containers.\n\n640\n00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.950\nAnd views are gonna be how we\nactually interact with data.\n\n641\n00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:53.000\nThey're the way in which we see\nas end users what the data is and\n\n642\n00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.660\nhow it's represented to us based\non the schemas, the structure and\n\n643\n00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.670\nbased on the tables, the holding\ncontainers where data actually lives.\n\n644\n00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:04.240\nData may be very varied and\nvery broad in the table,\n\n645\n00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:07.330\nwe may only see very small select group\nof that data in a view because we\n\n646\n00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:11.640\nare constraining, in effect filtering down\nthat view from a security standpoint or\n\n647\n00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:15.830\na management standpoint in order to allow\nthe user to interact with data they need,\n\n648\n00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.260\nbut not see data they\nshould not be exposed to.\n\n649\n00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.930\nRemember confidentiality and integrity\nhave to be enforced through these kind of\n\n650\n00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:24.750\nmechanisms and\na view of constrained interface is\n\n651\n00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:28.670\na good way to think about enforcing\nconfidentiality and integrity controls.\n\n652\n00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:31.858\nWe have a bunch of different languages\nthat exist within the database and\n\n653\n00:31:31.858 --> 00:31:35.571\nthe database management system but SQL\ngenerically, structure quarry language,\n\n654\n00:31:35.571 --> 00:31:38.568\nis gonna be a real important thought\nprocess for you to think about.\n\n655\n00:31:38.568 --> 00:31:39.355\n>> All right Adam, and\n\n656\n00:31:39.355 --> 00:31:43.250\nthere's some other database models we\nhave to at least be familiar with, right?\n\n657\n00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.580\n>> There are absolutely, so object\noriented database models, for instance.\n\n658\n00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:48.710\nWe store data as objects within the model.\n\n659\n00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:49.480\nIt's a relatively new one.\n\n660\n00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.440\nIt's one you probably have heard of.\n\n661\n00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.550\nYou may have heard of object\noriented programming,\n\n662\n00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.990\nfor instance,\nwhich plays off this general idea.\n\n663\n00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:56.710\nWe also have data based\ninterface languages.\n\n664\n00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.620\nHow do we actually interact with the data?\n\n665\n00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:00.630\nWhat are the languages we use to do that?\n\n666\n00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:03.850\nThings like ODBC which is probably\nfairly common and probably,\n\n667\n00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.600\nI would think, well known to most of you.\n\n668\n00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:10.700\nEven though you may not necessarily think\nof it as a database interface language.\n\n669\n00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.540\nBut we often think of it as just\na way we connect to databases and\n\n670\n00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.070\nhow we pull data across.\n\n671\n00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:18.870\nBut ODBC is actually a language we\nuse to interface with database.\n\n672\n00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:22.580\nJDBC, the Java equivalent,\nJava Database Connectivity also,\n\n673\n00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:26.450\nXML, OLE DB,\nwhich is one that's kind of an oldie but\n\n674\n00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:31.590\na goodie, object linking and embedding,\nand also ADO, ActiveX Data Objects,\n\n675\n00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:35.410\nwhich is a Microsoft proprietary one but,\nusually is used in Microsoft systems.\n\n676\n00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.980\nThese are all database interfaces, so\nwe also have to think about APIs when\n\n677\n00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.300\nwe think about database\nmanagement systems as well.\n\n678\n00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.410\nNew application programming interfaces,\n\n679\n00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:47.190\nhow do we effectively from a vendor\nperspective, are we given the rights and\n\n680\n00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:50.780\nthe access to interact with their\nsoftware, in this case their database, and\n\n681\n00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.470\npull data out of and\ninteract with it at the application level.\n\n682\n00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:56.990\nThis is how we write code effectively\nthat links to the database.\n\n683\n00:32:56.990 --> 00:33:00.660\nAnd allows us to access functionality in\nfeatures through the vendor's interface.\n\n684\n00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.340\nSo APIs also become very\nimportant we think about DBMSs.\n\n685\n00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.160\n>> All right, Adam,\nagain a lot of great information there,\n\n686\n00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:08.560\nand I know we've got more to go.\n\n687\n00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.180\nBut we're gonna have to call it\non this one, we are out of time.\n\n688\n00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:15.810\nGreat look at change management, we looked\nat some of our development models and\n\n689\n00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:18.980\nin the end there, a really good\nlook at database management and\n\n690\n00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.010\nwhat we need to be familiar with there.\n\n691\n00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:23.800\nSo remember, if you guys want to\nattend one of Adam's classes live,\n\n692\n00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:28.500\njust shoot us an email\nhere at SeeAdam@itpro.tv.\n\n693\n00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.540\nSigning off for now, I'm Mike Roderick.\n\n694\n00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.215\n>> I'm a Tuple.\n\n695\n00:33:31.215 --> 00:33:32.770\n>> [LAUGH] And we'll see you next time.\n\n696\n00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:34.319\n>> Take

00:00:17.570\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.280\nToday we're doing our CISSP content.\n\n5\n00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.730\nSpecifically we're getting back into the\nworld of software development security.\n\n6\n00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.500\nWe've already done a couple\nepisodes on this, so\n\n7\n00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.350\nif you've missed those,\nmake sure you go back and watch them.\n\n8\n00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.170\nWe are now into part three.\n\n9\n00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.330\nAnd here to help us with that is Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.830\nHow you doing this morning Adam?\n\n11\n00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.800\n>> I'm good.\nI'm good.\n\n12\n00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.463\nA little dry, cuz of some of the dry\nheat we're talking about, but\n\n13\n00:00:37.463 --> 00:00:38.170\nI'm good, nonetheless.\n\n14\n00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And ready.\n\n15\n00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.870\nI'm excited.\n\n16\n00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.490\nI am ready to continue discussing\ndatabase, services, system,\n\n17\n00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.860\nsecurity, SDLCs, etc, etc, etc.\n\n18\n00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.770\nOh no, before I forget, let me do this.\n\n19\n00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.060\nSo I look bigger than I really am just for\na second.\n\n20\n00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.080\nOkay, all right.\n\n21\n00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.190\nCuz you grow in status\nwhen you become a CISSP,\n\n22\n00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.010\nit's very important to think about that.\n\n23\n00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.350\nAll right, so we think and\n\n24\n00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.730\nwe have been talking about the ideas\nbehind how to not only create and\n\n25\n00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.050\nusing STLC, but what database management\nis all about, what a DBMS is.\n\n26\n00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.320\nWe can't leave behind or\n\n27\n00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.810\nnot think about the ideas associated with\nthe DBMS from the perspective of the data.\n\n28\n00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.550\nWe talk a lot about the languages,\nthe control elements,\n\n29\n00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.070\nthe elements that make up for DBMS,\nwe have that whole conversation.\n\n30\n00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.600\nWe talked about attributes, tuples, we\ntalked about the ways in which a database\n\n31\n00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.480\nmanagement system can be valuable to us\nin terms of the structure it provides.\n\n32\n00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.720\nBut we have to think about the data\nthat is contained within and\n\n33\n00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.460\nwhat the DBMS is focused on.\n\n34\n00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.740\nSo metadata becomes very important for\nthe conversation,\n\n35\n00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.510\nanother element that we wanna think about.\n\n36\n00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.420\nMetadata generically\ndescribed is data about data.\n\n37\n00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.090\nInformation about information.\n\n38\n00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.435\nI often refer to it as stuff about stuff.\n\n39\n00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:45.050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Generically it's the idea\n\n40\n00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.080\nof being able to think about not the data\nitself exclusively cuz that is important.\n\n41\n00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.200\nWe wanna think about that.\n\n42\n00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.950\nBut it's the descriptive data\nabout the data that lives in\n\n43\n00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.500\nthe database the meta data\nis really focused on.\n\n44\n00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.990\nAnd that in and of itself is very\nimportant because we have confidentiality\n\n45\n00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.420\nas well as integrity issues and\nconcerns associated with meta data.\n\n46\n00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.780\nIf we give out too much information in\nother words in the meta data, we may\n\n47\n00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.940\ninadvertently expose the meaning and\ntherefore the confidentiality of the data,\n\n48\n00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.890\neven though we don't\nnecessarily set out to do that.\n\n49\n00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.480\nAnd that's something to consider and\nfor us to be aware of.\n\n50\n00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.080\nMetadata also is becoming\nvery important today\n\n51\n00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.920\nas we see cloud services continuing\nto emerge and become very prevalent.\n\n52\n00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.070\nThe internet of things and convergence\nof all these related terms that we often\n\n53\n00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.020\ntalk about, metadata sits at\nthe heart of all these technologies.\n\n54\n00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.516\nIf we don't have an understanding of data\nand cannot describe it accurately and\n\n55\n00:02:34.516 --> 00:02:37.870\neffectively, it comes very hard for\nus to understand the value of it.\n\n56\n00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.890\nTo manage in and also to implement it, but\n\n57\n00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.030\nin addition to manager rest\nassociated with it and\n\n58\n00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.690\nso meta data is one of those elements that\noften is kind of flying under the radar.\n\n59\n00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.640\nWe don't always think about it.\n\n60\n00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.240\nWe don't always talk about it but\nit's super critical to what we do,\n\n61\n00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.030\nin terms of providing confidentiality and\nintegrity and availability.\n\n62\n00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.580\nAnd the constraints associated with them.\n\n63\n00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.080\nSo, be thinking about that.\n\n64\n00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.990\nFrom the perspective of control elements\nwithin the DBMS, within the database\n\n65\n00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.050\nmanagement system, we have to think\nabout the four, DBMS shoulds.\n\n66\n00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.070\nRight, and when I talk about the four\nDBMS shoulds is the idea of,\n\n67\n00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.960\nwhat are the effective DBMS\ncontrols that we provide.\n\n68\n00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.560\nWhat are the database management\nsystem control elements,\n\n69\n00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.890\ndatabase management systems and\nother should do the following.\n\n70\n00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.280\nThey should provide for identification or\nshould use and provide for identification.\n\n71\n00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.550\nAuthorization, authentication and\nother forms of access control meeting\n\n72\n00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.223\nimplementing multiple factors of access\ncontrol as we've often talked about.\n\n73\n00:03:34.223 --> 00:03:36.710\nRemember, a dual or a multi factor system\n\n74\n00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.718\nis gonna be much more secure than\na single factor authentication solution.\n\n75\n00:03:40.718 --> 00:03:43.580\nOr a single factor\naccess control solution.\n\n76\n00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.280\nSo we wanna think about identification,\nauthentication, and\n\n77\n00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.850\nauthorization, the standard\nthought process and\n\n78\n00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.110\nstandard flow we go through with\nregards to identity management.\n\n79\n00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.530\nWe've had numerous conversations\nIt's about this and\n\n80\n00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.360\ndatabase management system controls\nshould follow that same path.\n\n81\n00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.500\nWhen we think about being able to access\ndata, interact with it, use it, we think\n\n82\n00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.740\nabout locking controls and lock controls\nin a database are also very important.\n\n83\n00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.940\nLock controls you use when read,\nwrite access has to be given to a specific\n\n84\n00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.070\nrow of data or integrated into\nthe system that allowed for\n\n85\n00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.600\na certain row of data\nto be exclusively used.\n\n86\n00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.050\nAnd to then effectively,\nin either a relational or\n\n87\n00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.810\nobject oriented database\nmanagement system,\n\n88\n00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.220\nto effectively be presented to\nthe application, to the interface for use.\n\n89\n00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.330\nAnd we have to log that data open and\nlog access to the data for\n\n90\n00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.740\nthe application that's\naccessing it in the row, or\n\n91\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.050\nthe specific rows of data\nwhen they're being used.\n\n92\n00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.740\nSo we have to think about locking\ncontrols and what locking controls are,\n\n93\n00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.150\nand we have to think about\nsomething known as the acid test.\n\n94\n00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.980\nThe ACID test is going to be\na very important thought process\n\n95\n00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.580\nwith regards to relational and\nor object oriented data bases.\n\n96\n00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.380\nThis is the idea of being able to\nwalk through a four step process.\n\n97\n00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.770\nACID is an acronym A-C-I-D\nthat represents atomicity,\n\n98\n00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.840\nconsistency, isolation, and durability.\n\n99\n00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.340\nAnd I'll repeat those terms and\ndefine what they are.\n\n100\n00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.810\nBut the ACID test generically is the test\nthat is perform to get all transaction in\n\n101\n00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:06.750\nthe system.\n\n102\n00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.360\nAnd a transaction, if is what we called\nwell formed, must roll through and\n\n103\n00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.910\neffectively hit all four stages of\nthe acid test in order to be committed and\n\n104\n00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.440\nto be seen as something that\nis valid within the system.\n\n105\n00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.160\nA well formed transaction,\nin other words, passes the acid test.\n\n106\n00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.585\nSo the acid test starts with atomicity.\n\n107\n00:05:24.585 --> 00:05:27.380\nAtomicity is all about all or none.\n\n108\n00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.090\nMeaning we either commit the entire\ntransaction or we commit none of it.\n\n109\n00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.850\nIn other words,\n\n110\n00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.980\nwhen we think about atomicity, we're think\nabout getting a transaction right and\n\n111\n00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.640\nbeing able to commit it based on\nit being successfully completed or\n\n112\n00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.225\nhaving to roll it back, because nothing\ncan be done unless it is successful.\n\n113\n00:05:43.225 --> 00:05:47.225\nTherefore the data must always go from one\nknown state through another known state,\n\n114\n00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:50.485\nperhaps several known states,\nto its completed resting state,\n\n115\n00:05:50.485 --> 00:05:53.315\nwhich is transformed based\non the transaction or\n\n116\n00:05:53.315 --> 00:05:55.013\nwhatever it is we're\nlooking to accomplish.\n\n117\n00:05:55.013 --> 00:05:57.575\nSo atomicity is all about all or none.\n\n118\n00:05:57.575 --> 00:05:58.265\nConsistency.\n\n119\n00:05:58.265 --> 00:05:59.785\nChange is maintained consistency.\n\n120\n00:05:59.785 --> 00:06:01.100\nAgain, known state.\n\n121\n00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.940\nMoving data from one known state to\nanother is what consistency is all about.\n\n122\n00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.370\nIsolation, pending transactions\nare invisible to others.\n\n123\n00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.600\nMeaning while transaction is in process\nit is not shown in the database is being\n\n124\n00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.400\ncomplete.\n\n125\n00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.130\nIt is not affecting other data and it is\nnot going to show up in any other system\n\n126\n00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.050\nanywhere until we consider it complete,\nmark it as such, and commit it.\n\n127\n00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.820\nAnd then durability.\n\n128\n00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.780\nWhen you say you're done, it is done.\n\n129\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.130\nIn other words, durability is\ncommitting of the transaction and\n\n130\n00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.040\nwriting that transaction into the system\nin a way that it will not be undone.\n\n131\n00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.460\nIt is considered to be\npart of the dataset now.\n\n132\n00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.140\nThe ACID test effectively equals\nall changes to data being invisible\n\n133\n00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.199\nuntil they are done.\n\n134\n00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.340\nAll chain is to data being\ninvisible until they are done.\n\n135\n00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.258\nThat is what the ACID\ntest effectively equals.\n\n136\n00:06:46.258 --> 00:06:49.980\nUnderstanding the ACID test as\na way to create integrity but\n\n137\n00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.710\nalso ensure availability and\nconsistency of data.\n\n138\n00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.100\nwithin a data base management\nsystem is an important subtle, but\n\n139\n00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.700\nvery important point for you as the CISSP.\n\n140\n00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.650\nWe don't very often stop and\nthink about how data bases work and\n\n141\n00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.570\nit's very rare that we stop and\nactually consider, hey, you know,\n\n142\n00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.435\nI'm in the middle of\ndoing that transaction.\n\n143\n00:07:06.435 --> 00:07:07.665\nWhat does that actually mean?\n\n144\n00:07:07.665 --> 00:07:09.525\nAnd is that data in flux?\n\n145\n00:07:09.525 --> 00:07:13.335\nAnd the answer is, in theory, yes it's\nin flux, but it's in flux in such a way\n\n146\n00:07:13.335 --> 00:07:16.395\nthat we never violate the integrity and\nconfidentiality and\n\n147\n00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:19.595\navailability constraints of\nthe data while we're processing it.\n\n148\n00:07:19.595 --> 00:07:21.195\nSo, for instance, when you go and\n\n149\n00:07:21.195 --> 00:07:24.035\nyou think about this logically in the real\nworld for a minute, when you go and\n\n150\n00:07:24.035 --> 00:07:26.860\ncarry out an electronic\ntransaction of some kind.\n\n151\n00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.665\nYou're buying something online,\nhypothetically, and\n\n152\n00:07:28.665 --> 00:07:30.260\nyour using either a credit card.\n\n153\n00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.210\nOr a debit card,\n\n154\n00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.190\nlet's say a debit card tied to your\nbank account just to keep it simple.\n\n155\n00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.340\nAnd if you look at the balance on\nyour bank account online before that\n\n156\n00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.910\ntransaction and just for simple round\nnumbers, let's say of a $100 and, right?\n\n157\n00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.170\nPrior to payday, been a long holiday,\nmight not have a lot of money left.\n\n158\n00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.840\nSo you have a $100.\n\n159\n00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.220\nYou're going to buy something\nthat will cost $10, so\n\n160\n00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.440\nin theory, you're going to\nsubtract $10 from that amount and\n\n161\n00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.830\nwind up with $90,\ncall this simple math, monkey math.\n\n162\n00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:56.707\n>> I like this kind of math.\n\n163\n00:07:56.707 --> 00:07:59.910\n>> Simple math, very simple,\n100- 10 equals?\n\n164\n00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:04.328\nSo, when we think about that, and\nwe're saying the starting balance is 100,\n\n165\n00:08:04.328 --> 00:08:08.042\nThe asset model would imply that\nthe balance in that database, which\n\n166\n00:08:08.042 --> 00:08:12.140\neffectively is a table that has values\nentered into it for your bank record,\n\n167\n00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:16.730\nyour effective customer record at the bank\nis stored in a database somewhere.\n\n168\n00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:21.340\nAnd it is in a row in a table that says\ncustomer name, and customer balance, and\n\n169\n00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.620\ncustomer ID and\nall that stuff associated with it.\n\n170\n00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.490\nThat information in the row of\ndata that effectively is yours and\n\n171\n00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.160\nthe column that says your balance,\ncurrent balance, shows 100.\n\n172\n00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.430\nThat balance should not change\naccording to the asset change\n\n173\n00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:38.170\nuntil the transaction from the vendor\nhas been successfully completed, and\n\n174\n00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.250\nhas effectively been committed to their\ndatabase and then they're able to batch\n\n175\n00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.520\nprocess that transaction back to\nthe bank and pull the money out.\n\n176\n00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.690\nLet's assume hypothetically for purposes\nof our conversation that the minute that\n\n177\n00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.360\nthe vendor, the person that you're buying\nfrom online the electronic transaction\n\n178\n00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.110\nrather or it's this complete that the\nmoney magically comes out of the account.\n\n179\n00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.620\nIn other words, the final step in that\nprocess is process is marking that\n\n180\n00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.826\ntransaction complete, money is removed.\n\n181\n00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:08.760\nSo the asset model, the asset test would\nimply that the balance should stay\n\n182\n00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.710\nat 100 until the vendor specifies that\nthe transaction has been successfully\n\n183\n00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:16.600\ncompleted in which case at that point\nthe balance should be deducted by ten and\n\n184\n00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.770\nwe should see a change to 90.\n\n185\n00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.940\nAnd this would be an example\nof the asset model at work.\n\n186\n00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.760\nBecause if the balance changes prior to\nthat, then something's wrong in the system\n\n187\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.320\nand the model is not being used to\nvalidate the transaction properly.\n\n188\n00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.360\nBecause, remember,\n\n189\n00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.190\nall changes should be kept effectively\nhidden until the transaction's successful.\n\n190\n00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:37.120\nAnd so we could use that as just\na very simple way of explaining and\n\n191\n00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.990\nunderstanding the impact of the acid\nmodel as a real valuable kind of\n\n192\n00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:46.030\ntangible hey give me a working example\nof this in the real world kind of sense.\n\n193\n00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.980\nIt doesn't exactly work that way because\nmost vendors don't pull data or pull money\n\n194\n00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:53.030\nrather out of a bank immediately\nupon completion of the transaction.\n\n195\n00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.420\nThey do what's called batch processing.\n\n196\n00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.860\nThey tend to process that 10 hours,\n24 hours, 12 hours later whatever it is at\n\n197\n00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.660\nthe end of their business cycle when they\nclose their books they will then go and\n\n198\n00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:05.620\nrequest that money from the vendor\nduring their business process.\n\n199\n00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.110\nBut at some point after that\ntransaction the money will come out and\n\n200\n00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.420\nwhat they tell you is, it may take up to\n24, maybe 48 hours for that to happen, but\n\n201\n00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.010\nat some point during that\nprocessing cycle it will.\n\n202\n00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.030\nWhen it completes and\nthe money is removed,\n\n203\n00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.080\nthe transaction is effectively\ndone from the bank's perspective.\n\n204\n00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.640\nBut the transaction from the vendor's\nperspective is also not complete until\n\n205\n00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.700\nthey get the money.\n\n206\n00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.390\nAnd so they will not ship your goods or\n\n207\n00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.960\nprovide your services until they\nactually have your money in hand.\n\n208\n00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.950\nAnd so this is part of the whole\nchain of events that occurs\n\n209\n00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.590\naround processing of this information.\n\n210\n00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:36.940\nSo, wanna be thinking about this.\n\n211\n00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.850\nThis is one of those things that happens\nbehind the scenes you may not realize, but\n\n212\n00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:41.010\nyou do wanna be aware of.\n\n213\n00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:44.010\nWe also have other database management\nsystem access controls that\n\n214\n00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.750\nwe've talked about before but\nwe also wanna kinda keep in our mind.\n\n215\n00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.590\nThings like view based access controls,\nI mentioned constrained views and a menu,\n\n216\n00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.500\nfor instance, or a constrained view\nof data not showing all the rows,\n\n217\n00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.450\nall the columns, but\nonly certain amounts of that.\n\n218\n00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.480\nBased on your capabilities and\nyour authentication and\n\n219\n00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.190\nauthorization to see the data,\nthat would be a view based access control.\n\n220\n00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.160\nWe can grant and revoke access controls\non demand, so we have that capability.\n\n221\n00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.180\nWe have the ability to do metadata and\nuse metadata for controls,\n\n222\n00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:14.370\nso metadata controls stipulating what you\ndo and don't see again are also important,\n\n223\n00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.220\nwanna think about that.\n\n224\n00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.240\nAlso data contamination controls.\n\n225\n00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.090\nIf data is compromised, how do we manage\nthat and how do we effectively secure that\n\n226\n00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:26.200\ndata and keep it out of the live\nproduction databases so it doesn't further\n\n227\n00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.170\nthat complication or that contamination\nthrough the rest of the system.\n\n228\n00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.910\nThese are all different kinds of\ncontrol elements that may be applied.\n\n229\n00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.790\nWe have to also think about OLTP,\nOnline Transaction Processing.\n\n230\n00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:37.200\nAnd what OLTP brings to the table.\n\n231\n00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.320\nIt's effectively the data processing\nsystem that I was just mentioning\n\n232\n00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.470\nwith regards to how a vendor will walk\nthrough an electronic transaction and\n\n233\n00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:46.350\nallow us to then effectively\ngain access to data and\n\n234\n00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:50.510\ninteract with it in such a way that we can\ndo that against live production databases.\n\n235\n00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:55.240\nThe security concerns associated with OLTP\nare several and we wanna be aware of them.\n\n236\n00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.060\nConcurrency and atomicity are the two\nthat really rise to the top of the list.\n\n237\n00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.850\nWe've already talked about atomicity,\n\n238\n00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.950\nwe've already talked about the idea\nof concurrency in the ACID model.\n\n239\n00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.110\nIf you remember as we went through and\nwe talked about these, the idea of, and\n\n240\n00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.050\nit's probably a good place for\nus to ask you a little bit about these and\n\n241\n00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.110\nask you to reach back and\nremember quickly.\n\n242\n00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.260\nI know we just talked about them,\nbut we defined for\n\n243\n00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.140\nyou what the four elements\nof the acid test are.\n\n244\n00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.890\nThe automaticity and\nconsistency of the first two.\n\n245\n00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.130\nAutomaticity is the idea of all or none.\n\n246\n00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:26.300\nConsistency is, changes have to be\nmaintained in a consistent state.\n\n247\n00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.690\nData, in other words, has to imply or\n\n248\n00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.070\ndata we should have the thought process\nof the idea associated with data,\n\n249\n00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.460\nthat it's always gonna maintain\nitself in a consistent state.\n\n250\n00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.850\nAnd that changes applied to\nthe system should never be applied\n\n251\n00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.990\nunless we know that data moves from\none consistent state to another.\n\n252\n00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.340\nSo wanna be thinking about that and\nknowing that the committing of data and\n\n253\n00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.580\nthe consistency of data in\nthe model are really key security\n\n254\n00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.270\nfactors with regards to online transaction\nprocessing, with regards to OLTP.\n\n255\n00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.590\nWe have to also think about\nknowledge discovery and\n\n256\n00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:55.870\nhow we do knowledge discovery.\n\n257\n00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.120\nWith databases what we call ADD.\n\n258\n00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:02.180\nKnowledge discovery in databases is\na concept that's important to us.\n\n259\n00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:06.030\nIt's not just a matter of sitting down at\nthe database and writing out a quick query\n\n260\n00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.590\nor asking a question using some\nkeystrokes and getting data back.\n\n261\n00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.900\nIt may be that, but there's usually\na lot more associated with that.\n\n262\n00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:16.260\nThere are rules, there are application\ninterfaces, APIs that are used,\n\n263\n00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:20.100\nthere are transactional processes that\nhave to be followed in order to gain\n\n264\n00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.490\naccess to data, and all of this is part\nof the knowledge discovery process.\n\n265\n00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.740\nIf we could just sit down at\na database with a common front end And\n\n266\n00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.870\ngo and query the database without\nany rules or restrictions.\n\n267\n00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.630\nThen we're gonna get some\nvery interesting data back.\n\n268\n00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.630\nAnd we may do that in\nthat in a non-production\n\n269\n00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.380\ntest environment to validate\nthe security controls and\n\n270\n00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.840\nfigure out what the expectations\nare of the stakeholders and the users.\n\n271\n00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.870\nCheck for functionality, things like that.\n\n272\n00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.730\nLook for vulnerabilities and weaknesses.\n\n273\n00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:48.810\nBut in a production database,\nthere should be structure.\n\n274\n00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:53.260\nThere should be controls in place or\nImplemented in the system\n\n275\n00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:57.230\nto prevent unrestricted querying and\nunrestricted data retrieval from a query,\n\n276\n00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:02.210\nand so security controls should be things\nlike routinely verifying decisions,\n\n277\n00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.500\nprotecting the data and the knowledge\nthat is required from the data,\n\n278\n00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:08.240\nwe should have information\nrights management controls.\n\n279\n00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.540\nData loss prevention controls in place.\n\n280\n00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.500\nWe should be doing boundary validation and\ninput checking.\n\n281\n00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.320\nWe should be doing all sorts of things\nthat we've talked about already\n\n282\n00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.160\nto imply that the security controls\nalong with access controls and\n\n283\n00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.570\nconstraining access to certain areas.\n\n284\n00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.710\nObfuscation, tokenization, all the things\nwe've discussed should be in place.\n\n285\n00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.200\nThese are all security controls\nthat would be brought to bear.\n\n286\n00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.300\nAnd by doing these things, or\nby combining them together in one form or\n\n287\n00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.960\nanother, they will effectively\nallow us to be able to hopefully,\n\n288\n00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.890\nachieve some modicum of control, and\nachieve some sort of elemental control\n\n289\n00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.690\nthat speaks to the need to be able to\nrestrict access, but also to implement and\n\n290\n00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.740\nrefine confidentiality integrity and\navailability rules as part of that.\n\n291\n00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.670\nWe also have to think about\nweb application environments.\n\n292\n00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.500\nHow do we design and develop data?\n\n293\n00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.490\nNot only for use internally, but more and\n\n294\n00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.690\nmore we're exposing data\nacross the web today.\n\n295\n00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:58.830\nAnd how do we do those things?\n\n296\n00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:03.020\nBeing able to go out and take a look\nat the controls that are in place and\n\n297\n00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.420\nthe best practices and recommended\nguidance for that is gonna be important,\n\n298\n00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.880\nmost attacks that occur\nagainst databases today and\n\n299\n00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:14.580\nmost attacks that occur against data in\ngeneral with regards to accessible data\n\n300\n00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.780\nthat occur across our enterprise are\ncoming though the application level and\n\n301\n00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.290\nbecause we're associating more and\nmore applications and\n\n302\n00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:26.130\nservices with the cloud or with the web\ntoday, we have effectively a dual concern.\n\n303\n00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:29.990\nWe have the application level security\nconcern that is already built into,\n\n304\n00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.980\nbaked into our data.\n\n305\n00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:35.620\nAnd now, we have the web access or web\ncontrol mechanisms and concerns we have\n\n306\n00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:40.080\nthere, paired with application security\nthat combine together to really form\n\n307\n00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.270\na very big problem, a conundrum for\nus as security professionals.\n\n308\n00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.190\nThat's a fun word, conundrum, right?\n\n309\n00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.600\nThat's an SAT vocabulary word, by the way.\n\n310\n00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.774\nYou get extra points for\nthat in Scrabble, also.\n\n311\n00:15:50.774 --> 00:15:55.036\nA conundrum or a problem, right, because\nthe idea is that we pair application level\n\n312\n00:15:55.036 --> 00:15:58.161\nvulnerabilities, with web\napplication vulnerabilities,\n\n313\n00:15:58.161 --> 00:16:02.020\nwe are opening up an entirely new area\nthat we have to focus on and be aware of.\n\n314\n00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.075\nAnd so factors that make websites\nvulnerable are very important for\n\n315\n00:16:05.075 --> 00:16:05.940\nus to think about.\n\n316\n00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.170\nProbably wanna think about and\nwe have looked at before.\n\n317\n00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:09.481\nAnd we're gonna take out and\n\n318\n00:16:09.481 --> 00:16:12.927\nshow you again one of the many websites\nthat are out there for us to focus on.\n\n319\n00:16:12.927 --> 00:16:16.582\nBut one that's really super important, you\ncan see it on the screen in front of you,\n\n320\n00:16:16.582 --> 00:16:17.213\nis the OWASP.\n\n321\n00:16:17.213 --> 00:16:22.344\nThe [COUGH] excuse me,\nOWASP project, the website.\n\n322\n00:16:22.344 --> 00:16:24.150\nCan we zoom in just a little\nbit while we're doing this?\n\n323\n00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.410\nJust so that people can see cuz\nI'm having trouble seeing it and\n\n324\n00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:28.125\nI'm assuming they probably\ncan't see it as well.\n\n325\n00:16:28.125 --> 00:16:31.160\nThe Open Web Application\nSecurity Project's website,\n\n326\n00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.150\nwe've talked about this in\nsome of our prior episodes.\n\n327\n00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.698\nVery important as a resource for\nyou as a CISSP.\n\n328\n00:16:35.698 --> 00:16:39.008\nIf we could scroll just to the right\na little bit, up on the masthead there you\n\n329\n00:16:39.008 --> 00:16:41.928\ncan see, don't click on it but\nwe're just gonna show the people.\n\n330\n00:16:41.928 --> 00:16:44.602\nThere is the Top 10 project\nwe've been out to there,\n\n331\n00:16:44.602 --> 00:16:47.710\nthat's a top 10 web application\nvulnerabilities list.\n\n332\n00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.520\nWanna remind you of that,\ncertainly wanna take a look at that.\n\n333\n00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.350\nOff to the right there, in the next column\nover, we have Development Guidance.\n\n334\n00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.410\nAnd then off to the right again,\nnext column over the top,\n\n335\n00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:57.940\nwe have Testing Guidance.\n\n336\n00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:02.370\nThese are additional project areas\nthat OWASP has that they have put out\n\n337\n00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.090\nthat will give us development guidance for\n\n338\n00:17:04.090 --> 00:17:06.820\nsecure web APIs and\nsecure development on the web.\n\n339\n00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:10.600\nAnd then secure testing of web APIs and\nweb code.\n\n340\n00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.460\nAnd so, paired with the top 10, along\nwith these additional guidance areas,\n\n341\n00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.040\nit would be a very valuable and\nbeneficial resource.\n\n342\n00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.000\nLet's just delve into the Testing Guide\nreal quick, just click on that link.\n\n343\n00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.910\nLet's just show everybody\nout there what they'll see.\n\n344\n00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.423\nWhen you go to the OWASP Testing Project,\nas you get with all their projects,\n\n345\n00:17:27.423 --> 00:17:28.514\nyou get a landing page.\n\n346\n00:17:28.514 --> 00:17:32.580\nAnd if you scroll down just a little bit,\nyou'll see they have kind of an overview.\n\n347\n00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.550\nTesting Guide version 4 is announced\nthere, you could see it's available.\n\n348\n00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:40.610\nAnd there is a link for it,\nyou can access the guide.\n\n349\n00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.256\nI think you can see down\nthere you can buy it.\n\n350\n00:17:42.256 --> 00:17:45.339\nThere, if you scroll down just a little\nbit you'll see that they have some\n\n351\n00:17:45.339 --> 00:17:46.343\ninformation about it.\n\n352\n00:17:46.343 --> 00:17:49.210\nAnd you can take a look at it there and\nyou can see what it is.\n\n353\n00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:50.540\nAnd so that's the most current version.\n\n354\n00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.040\nWe don't have to go into it, people can\nsee just generically what it is and\n\n355\n00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.208\nkinda how to get there.\n\n356\n00:17:54.208 --> 00:17:56.230\nAnd you could see that you\ncan obviously download that,\n\n357\n00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.510\ntake a look at it,\nand/or interact with it if necessary.\n\n358\n00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:04.630\nThe Testing Guide I believe you actually\nhave to buy from them if I'm not mistaken.\n\n359\n00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.175\n>> It says where you can\ndownload the guide here.\n\n360\n00:18:06.175 --> 00:18:07.297\n>> You can get it and/or buy it.\n\n361\n00:18:07.297 --> 00:18:10.810\nI think you can make a contribution\nto OWASP if you want to to get it.\n\n362\n00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.060\nBut you could see you can\ndownload it there as well.\n\n363\n00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.460\nAnd it's obviously got a lot of guidance\nin there, a lot of valuable information\n\n364\n00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.760\nfor you on how to do different testing,\nor how to engage in different\n\n365\n00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.675\ntesting solutions for web application\nsecurity testing, you can see there.\n\n366\n00:18:23.675 --> 00:18:26.214\nAnd there's a whole capability\nthere that they go through,\n\n367\n00:18:26.214 --> 00:18:27.968\na whole set of solutions they go through.\n\n368\n00:18:27.968 --> 00:18:31.542\nIdentity management testing,\nauthentication testing,\n\n369\n00:18:31.542 --> 00:18:35.690\nauthorization testing,\nsession management, input validation.\n\n370\n00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.890\nThere's all sorts of stuff you\ncould take a look at there,\n\n371\n00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:40.290\naligned with the control\nelements associated with it.\n\n372\n00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.630\nSo, it's obviously going to be very\nvaluable for you to take a look at, right?\n\n373\n00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:47.300\nAnd so, very helpful for\nus to think about.\n\n374\n00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.060\nIn addition, we also wanna take a look and\njust remind you quickly about the NIST\n\n375\n00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.940\nwebsite as well since we're out\nhere talking about guidance,\n\n376\n00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.600\nand we're talking about testing in\nparticular, and secure development.\n\n377\n00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.690\nWe've been out to the NIST comprehensive\ndocumentation site before.\n\n378\n00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:04.590\nAnd there are different categories,\nas we've reminded you of, for\n\n379\n00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.270\nspecial publications.\n\n380\n00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.610\nWhat Mike's gonna do is do a little search\noff to the left there, type in the word,\n\n381\n00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.630\ntesting, for us, and\nI believe we have that there.\n\n382\n00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.453\nHe's gonna search, and when he does that,\n\n383\n00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:17.175\nif we could zoom in a little to see\nwhat comes up, and scroll over.\n\n384\n00:19:17.175 --> 00:19:20.281\nWhat we can do is, we can look at\nall the different SP publications,\n\n385\n00:19:20.281 --> 00:19:23.671\nspecial publications that are available\nthere with regards to testing.\n\n386\n00:19:23.671 --> 00:19:26.965\n800-142 comes up near the top there.\n\n387\n00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:31.710\n800, I think that's\n85A-1 is there as well.\n\n388\n00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.290\nThere is a draft NIST document,\n\n389\n00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:39.150\n8074 Volume 2 Supplemental Information\non testing guidance.\n\n390\n00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:41.300\nThere's Volume 1 listed there below.\n\n391\n00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:45.359\nSo we can see different NIST documents\nthat may be valuable and/or helpful for\n\n392\n00:19:45.359 --> 00:19:45.919\ntesting.\n\n393\n00:19:45.919 --> 00:19:49.661\n800-53A R1 for\nsome of the risk management and\n\n394\n00:19:49.661 --> 00:19:52.830\ncontrol elements associated with testing.\n\n395\n00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.440\nSo there's lots of different guidance\nthat you could find there on the NIST\n\n396\n00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.510\nwebsite as well.\n\n397\n00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:00.546\nSo you wanna be aware of these things,\nagain, keeping in mind\n\n398\n00:20:00.546 --> 00:20:04.739\nthat from a CISSP perspective\nit's not as important to say hey,\n\n399\n00:20:04.739 --> 00:20:08.174\nI know the five NIST documents\nspecific to testing.\n\n400\n00:20:08.174 --> 00:20:11.133\nI've got those in my mind I can\nanswer that question if it comes up.\n\n401\n00:20:11.133 --> 00:20:12.630\nIt's probably not going to come up.\n\n402\n00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.036\nWhat is gonna come up is the idea that\nthere are multiple resources out there for\n\n403\n00:20:17.036 --> 00:20:17.586\na CISSP.\n\n404\n00:20:17.586 --> 00:20:20.988\nAnd knowledge of them and awareness of\nthem is important in the real world,\n\n405\n00:20:20.988 --> 00:20:24.220\nas well as to apply that knowledge,\nif necessary, on the exam.\n\n406\n00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.690\nIn other words, I would not worry about\nwhat the NIST standards are specific to\n\n407\n00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:28.730\nsecurity testing.\n\n408\n00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:33.250\nI would not worry about the fact,\nnot only NIST but also OWASP has direct\n\n409\n00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:37.690\nguidance in market around best practices\nfor security testing, and what that is.\n\n410\n00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:40.010\nIt's not a secure coding exam, right?\n\n411\n00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:45.050\nWhat this is,\nis a CISSP exam about security management,\n\n412\n00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:50.020\nand security management from a broad\nperspective across multiple domains.\n\n413\n00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.100\nSecurity and testing and\nweb services and web application and\n\n414\n00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.800\nsoftware development being one small\narea of a much larger picture.\n\n415\n00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.450\nSo it's important to understand\nthe generic concepts.\n\n416\n00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.961\nBut it's also important to\nhave real world expertise and\n\n417\n00:21:01.961 --> 00:21:05.218\ntools available to you when you apply\nthose concepts out beyond the exam.\n\n418\n00:21:05.218 --> 00:21:08.360\nWe try to give you a balance of both\nas we talk through the information, and\n\n419\n00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.707\nwant you to be aware of what you can rely\non out there as you build that additional\n\n420\n00:21:11.707 --> 00:21:13.110\nknowledge over time.\n\n421\n00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:16.569\nSo keeping in mind factors that make\nwebsites vulnerable are gonna be very\n\n422\n00:21:16.569 --> 00:21:20.026\nimportant to you, keeping in mind that\nthe more attractive a website is,\n\n423\n00:21:20.026 --> 00:21:22.590\nthe more services it offers,\nthe more things it does,\n\n424\n00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.807\nit may raise that profile and\npeople may look to attack it over time.\n\n425\n00:21:25.807 --> 00:21:28.086\nAnd you wanna be aware of that and\nthink about that.\n\n426\n00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:30.818\nIf you have something of great\nvalue that you're securing, and\n\n427\n00:21:30.818 --> 00:21:33.095\nyou're allowing people to\nget to it through the web,\n\n428\n00:21:33.095 --> 00:21:35.470\nare your access controls\nas good as they can be?\n\n429\n00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.490\nIs your monitoring as good as it can be?\n\n430\n00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.960\nIs your ability to protect against known\nvulnerabilities as good as it could be,\n\n431\n00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.925\nin other words patch management\nif you've been doing that.\n\n432\n00:21:42.925 --> 00:21:45.130\nAre you're doing continuous monitoring?\n\n433\n00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:46.370\nAre you base lining?\n\n434\n00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:49.520\nAre you doing random penetration and\nvulnerability assessments?\n\n435\n00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.150\nThese are all methodologies\nwe've talked about in prior,\n\n436\n00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:54.470\nnot only prior episodes but prior areas.\n\n437\n00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.217\nAnd in some cases extensively across\nmultiple areas and multiple episodes.\n\n438\n00:21:58.217 --> 00:22:01.309\nAnd linking that together in this area\nis gonna also be very important for\n\n439\n00:22:01.309 --> 00:22:03.500\nyou to think about and be concerned about.\n\n440\n00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.050\nHave you basically stripped down the web\nsite or the web hosting site and\n\n441\n00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:11.575\nthe software and the services running\non it by effectively getting rid of all\n\n442\n00:22:11.575 --> 00:22:14.130\nnon-secure elements and\nelements that don't belong there?\n\n443\n00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.780\nHave you hardened, in other words, what\nthe host is that's hosting the website?\n\n444\n00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.900\nHave you gone through and\nchecked the proprietary code of the APIs?\n\n445\n00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.094\nThese are all things\nwe'd wanna think about.\n\n446\n00:22:23.094 --> 00:22:25.125\nDo you have session lockouts in place, so\n\n447\n00:22:25.125 --> 00:22:29.570\nthat timeout values are being used to log\nout users that are not actively engaged?\n\n448\n00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:31.680\nAre you using single session keys so\n\n449\n00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.690\nthat replay attacks cannot be\npropagated against the site?\n\n450\n00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:36.090\nThese are all things we discussed and,\n\n451\n00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.920\nagain, important things for\nyou to be aware of and to think about.\n\n452\n00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.010\nThe general security of websites and\nthe ability to understand them and\n\n453\n00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.900\nsecure them is gonna be\na central focal point for you.\n\n454\n00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.970\nBecause more and more of our services\nare migrating to the web today.\n\n455\n00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:52.240\nAnd remember we may use open source\nsoftware, we may use proprietary software,\n\n456\n00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.390\nhard to say what we're gonna use.\n\n457\n00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:54.980\nWe want to be thinking about that.\n\n458\n00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:58.310\nIf we have enough people looking at\nthe system, enough people examining it,\n\n459\n00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.960\nenough people focusing on it, we're gonna\ntend to find more of the vulnerabilities,\n\n460\n00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.730\nthe threats, and the concerns, and\nbe able to mitigate them in some way.\n\n461\n00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.790\nAnd when we think about\nthe thought process behind that,\n\n462\n00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:13.350\ncontinuous monitoring,\nrandom testing of various interfaces,\n\n463\n00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:17.220\nproduction level testing as well\nas testing outside of production,\n\n464\n00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.570\nchange management,\nconfiguration management.\n\n465\n00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:22.310\nAll the things we've been talking\nabout are gonna be very important for\n\n466\n00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.370\nus to consider and to be aware of.\n\n467\n00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:29.490\nRemember, software by itself is not going\nto give us an advantage or a disadvantage.\n\n468\n00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:33.870\nIt's how we configure it, how we manage\nit, and the interaction of that software\n\n469\n00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:37.490\nand the management capabilities with\nthe hardware, the systems we run it on,\n\n470\n00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:41.200\nthat ultimately lead to either\ncompromise or success in security.\n\n471\n00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.540\nAn application on its own,\nsitting in a box,\n\n472\n00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.870\nnot installed anywhere, is not gonna\npresent any vulnerability to you.\n\n473\n00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:49.970\nIt's when you roll it out, install it, and\nconfigure it, and how you do those things,\n\n474\n00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.570\nthat really then leads us to have\nthe conversation about whether or\n\n475\n00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.920\nnot there's compromise and\nwhat that compromise may look like.\n\n476\n00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.384\nSo wanna be aware of that.\n\n477\n00:23:56.384 --> 00:24:00.609\nWe also have to think about programming\nlanguages and how we provide interaction,\n\n478\n00:24:00.609 --> 00:24:03.927\nand the instructions that allow us\nto interact with and modify and\n\n479\n00:24:03.927 --> 00:24:06.140\neffectively consume and use data.\n\n480\n00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.962\nIt's not just about setting a system up,\n\n481\n00:24:07.962 --> 00:24:10.210\nnot just about developing\nthe software securely.\n\n482\n00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.190\nNot just about configuring it properly.\n\n483\n00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.853\nNot just about exposing it to the web.\n\n484\n00:24:13.853 --> 00:24:16.230\nIt's the actual instructional information.\n\n485\n00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:19.250\nThe operational language if you will,\nwhich is programmatic language,\n\n486\n00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.630\nthat allows us to understand how\nto interact with the system.\n\n487\n00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.620\nThat also has to be examined,\nit's also important.\n\n488\n00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.010\nWe have different,\nwhat we call generations of languages.\n\n489\n00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:29.190\nYou know how many generations of\nlanguages there are by the way?\n\n490\n00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.940\nHave any idea?\n\n491\n00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:30.650\n>> No, I do not.\n\n492\n00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:31.150\n>> Neither do I.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n493\n00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:31.970\n>> Thought you, I was hoping\n\n494\n00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:32.500\nyou would know.\n\n495\n00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.460\nI'm thinking, I'm thinking it's.\n\n496\n00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.475\nI'm thinking it's this.\n\n497\n00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:37.825\nI'm gonna guess and say it is.\n\n498\n00:24:37.825 --> 00:24:39.425\nMike doesn't know but it really is five.\n\n499\n00:24:39.425 --> 00:24:40.120\nHe doesn't know that.\n\n500\n00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.825\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But there are multiple generations of\n\n501\n00:24:41.825 --> 00:24:43.345\nlanguages, all kidding aside right?\n\n502\n00:24:43.345 --> 00:24:45.965\nWe have five generations\nwe often talk about, and so\n\n503\n00:24:45.965 --> 00:24:47.315\nI want to run them\nthrough quickly with you.\n\n504\n00:24:47.315 --> 00:24:48.615\nMake sure you know what they are.\n\n505\n00:24:48.615 --> 00:24:52.740\nWe call these first gen,\nsecond gen, third gen, etc.\n\n506\n00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.940\nSo, first generation to fifth generation\nis all what we gonna talk about.\n\n507\n00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.500\nFirst generation programming language\nare referred to as machine languages.\n\n508\n00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:04.225\nThis are gonna be very simple instructions\nexecuted directly in or by the CPU, so\n\n509\n00:25:04.225 --> 00:25:06.035\nthey're gonna be very, very basic.\n\n510\n00:25:06.035 --> 00:25:08.465\nWe don't see them directly,\nwe don't interact with them directly.\n\n511\n00:25:08.465 --> 00:25:11.475\nTypically, they're buried far\ndown in the system operationally.\n\n512\n00:25:11.475 --> 00:25:15.195\nAnd this is how the CPU executes\ninformation or instruction sets directly,\n\n513\n00:25:15.195 --> 00:25:18.045\nthrough what's called a first\ngeneration or machine language.\n\n514\n00:25:18.045 --> 00:25:21.405\nSecond generation languages\nare called assembly languages.\n\n515\n00:25:21.405 --> 00:25:24.660\nThese use symbols as abbreviations for\nmajor instructions.\n\n516\n00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.810\nSo, assembly languages, again,\nwe don't tend to interact with directly.\n\n517\n00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:30.850\nThey are running in our systems, but we\ndon't tend to interact with them directly.\n\n518\n00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.230\nThey are going to be used by the system,\nbut\n\n519\n00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.560\ntypically not with our\ndirect intervention.\n\n520\n00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.580\nThird generation languages are what\nwe call high level languages.\n\n521\n00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.860\nThese use meaningful words,\n\n522\n00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:44.800\ngenerally things like English type\nsyntax that are gonna be the commands.\n\n523\n00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:48.540\nSo we begin to see languages that we\ncan understand, we can interact with,\n\n524\n00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.100\nwe can actually interpret and\npotentially read and\n\n525\n00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.640\npotentially even have\na sense of what they do.\n\n526\n00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.270\nIf you were to look at machine or assembly\nlanguage, first or second generation\n\n527\n00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:00.330\nlanguages, you could see them, but\nyou really won't understand them.\n\n528\n00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:04.070\nThey're not gonna be in a form that\nis readily understood by humans.\n\n529\n00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.340\nAnd that begs the question, well if\nyou don't understand them, smart guy,\n\n530\n00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:08.280\nhow do you write them and\nhow do you program them?\n\n531\n00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.070\nWe do understand them.\n\n532\n00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:11.680\nWe do have the capability to do so.\n\n533\n00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.400\nWe have to use special\nprogram interfaces and\n\n534\n00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.530\nthings that are called interpreters and\ncompilers to be able to work with them and\n\n535\n00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.740\nget them ready to be able to be\neffectively used by the system.\n\n536\n00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.240\nRemember, we're effectively\nwriting the code so\n\n537\n00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.150\nthe machine itself can interpret it,\nnot so humans can interpret it.\n\n538\n00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.400\nAnd as we translate from human\nfriendly to machine friendly,\n\n539\n00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.250\nwe effectively lose the capability for\nus to see the language and\n\n540\n00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:35.730\ninteract with the directly in\na way that make sense to us.\n\n541\n00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:36.740\nBut that's not what's important.\n\n542\n00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.000\nIt's important for the machine\nto understand and interpret it.\n\n543\n00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.580\nSo we wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n544\n00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:43.960\nWe have fourth generation languages, what\nthey're referred to as very high level.\n\n545\n00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.122\nThey build on that English like\nfunctionality, English like syntax and\n\n546\n00:26:48.122 --> 00:26:49.220\nthat capability.\n\n547\n00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.830\nAnd then we have what are called fifth\ngeneration languages or natural languages.\n\n548\n00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.030\nThis is the highest level programming\nlanguage that's available to us.\n\n549\n00:26:56.030 --> 00:27:00.240\nWe eliminate the need for\nas much programmatic solution as possible.\n\n550\n00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:03.590\nWe'll try to eliminate the need for as\nmuch of the hey, you have to sit down and\n\n551\n00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:06.230\nspend years of learning a language\nto get proficient at it.\n\n552\n00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:08.720\nThought process with fifth\ngeneration languages.\n\n553\n00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:10.680\nIt should be relatively straightforward.\n\n554\n00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.340\nShould be almost English like.\n\n555\n00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:17.360\nAlmost the same way in which English or\na language, whatever language you choose.\n\n556\n00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.500\nDoesn't have to be English, but\nusing English as an example.\n\n557\n00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.590\nHow it functions, so for\ninstance, a language like XML.\n\n558\n00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:27.340\nIf you are familiar with XML at all,\nif you look at XML code,\n\n559\n00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:30.090\nXML is relatively English like.\n\n560\n00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:34.110\nAnd it's going to be very high\nlevel/natural level language because it\n\n561\n00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.960\nwill allow somebody who writes code in\nthat language to do so with minimal\n\n562\n00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:42.680\nadditional training and minimal necessary\nneed to learn the language directly.\n\n563\n00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.320\nBut rather can look at a lot\nof the code and syntax and\n\n564\n00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.820\nfigure out what those commands do.\n\n565\n00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:51.800\nI'm not suggesting for a minute that even\nwith fifth generation actual languages\n\n566\n00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.090\nthat you don't need training to be\ngood at them, to be proficient them,\n\n567\n00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.070\nto understand how to use them properly.\n\n568\n00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:59.990\nWhat I'm suggesting is the amount\nof training required to understand\n\n569\n00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:04.260\nthe language is severely restricted and\nminimal compared to some of the lower\n\n570\n00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.970\nlevel languages that effectively,\nliterally, you're learning an entire\n\n571\n00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:12.180\nlanguage and how to use that language from\nthe ground up in order to write quote.\n\n572\n00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:15.460\nThink about learning something like\nCobol or Fortran or Pascal and\n\n573\n00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.160\nif you don't know what those are,\nyou are way too young to be sitting for\n\n574\n00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.160\nthis certification so, come back in a few\nyears, right, when you're a little grayer.\n\n575\n00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.560\nIn the beard and long in the tooth, but\nno, if you don't know what those languages\n\n576\n00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.860\nare, all kidding aside, they're older\nprogramming languages you may or\n\n577\n00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.730\nmay not have come across them,\nthey're not very prevalent today.\n\n578\n00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.470\nBut they are older languages that would\nhave been prevalent in the 1980s,\n\n579\n00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:38.310\n1990s, into the early part of the 2000s.\n\n580\n00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:41.430\nThey still are around today,\nthey still are used, but\n\n581\n00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.990\nthey're not something you spend\na lot of time learning how to use.\n\n582\n00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:47.040\nThey're older languages,\nthey fall into these older categories.\n\n583\n00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.990\nYou had to spend a long time learning\nhow to write code in those languages,\n\n584\n00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:52.720\neffectively learning a new\nlanguage to speak and\n\n585\n00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.380\ninteract with, to write code in Cobalt,\nPascal or Fortran or\n\n586\n00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:00.030\none of those older languages took a\nsignificant investment in time and energy.\n\n587\n00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.670\nTo learn a newer language like PowerShell,\nto learn scripting, or\n\n588\n00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:07.560\nto learn Power CLI on the VM\nware environment in ESXI,\n\n589\n00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:11.010\nwhich is PowerShell married to\nthe CLI scripting environment.\n\n590\n00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:12.570\nOr to learn eXML or\n\n591\n00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:16.550\nsomething like that, it's a lot less of\nan investment in time and resources today.\n\n592\n00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.400\nSo just be aware generically\nthe idea of progression\n\n593\n00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.760\nof the languages through the various\nphases or through the generations.\n\n594\n00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.860\nThe closer we get to\nthe fifth generation we get,\n\n595\n00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.650\nthe more like a natural language it is,\nthe less investment in time we need to\n\n596\n00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.450\nspend learning the eccentricities\nof the language.\n\n597\n00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:34.620\nThe more we can focus on learning\nthe basic rules and then going out and\n\n598\n00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.370\nusing those rules to apply\nour knowledge to program and\n\n599\n00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.830\nwrite the code to create\nthe functionality that we need.\n\n600\n00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.150\nThat's effectively what\nthe thought process is there.\n\n601\n00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:45.240\nWe also have to think about individual\nlanguages and the specificity around them.\n\n602\n00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.660\nThings like Java and the Java security\nlayers, the Java security model for\n\n603\n00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.410\ninstance is a good example for us.\n\n604\n00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:53.290\nYeah, how do we implement\nsecurity in Java?\n\n605\n00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.720\nThis is something most people really don't\nunderstand that well and don't really get.\n\n606\n00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.541\nAnd I'm not suggesting for\na minute you should go out and\n\n607\n00:29:58.541 --> 00:29:59.410\nbecome an expert in this.\n\n608\n00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:03.000\nI'm just pointing out that this is one\nexample of a programmatic language,\n\n609\n00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.370\na database access language in terms\nof Java database connectivity.\n\n610\n00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.390\nInstead of ODBC, JDBC, and\n\n611\n00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.410\nJava overall in the Java language and\nfunctionality provides,\n\n612\n00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:15.740\nis something that you would wanna have\nworking knowledge of as a programmer,\n\n613\n00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.370\nto be able to create secure code if\nyou're gonna use Java and rely on Java.\n\n614\n00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:21.870\nIf you don't,\nyou're gonna rely on somebody who does.\n\n615\n00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:25.860\nSo as a CISSP, we may not be\na secure application developer but\n\n616\n00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.120\nwe may have somebody on our team\nthat does know how to do that.\n\n617\n00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.460\nWe're gonna manage through\nthem to implement security,\n\n618\n00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.020\nhopefully through that kind of a model.\n\n619\n00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:33.700\nSo you wanna be thinking about that and\n\n620\n00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.530\nwanna understand the different things\nassociated with that and how that works.\n\n621\n00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.790\nObject oriented technology and\nprogramming as well.\n\n622\n00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:41.750\nAnother good example of where security and\n\n623\n00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.200\nunderstanding the security\nmodel becomes important.\n\n624\n00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.560\nWe have to think about encapsulation or\ninheritance with regards to object\n\n625\n00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.930\noriented programming and understanding\nhow those things come together.\n\n626\n00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:54.500\nEncapsulation is the idea that\na class defines only the data it needs\n\n627\n00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.730\nto be concerned with.\n\n628\n00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.540\nSo a class is gonna effectively stipulate\nand define what it needs to focus on,\n\n629\n00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.530\nand encapsulation is all about that idea.\n\n630\n00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:06.085\nWhen an instance of that class is run,\nthe code effectively is not gonna be\n\n631\n00:31:06.085 --> 00:31:09.585\nable to access any other data\nunless it has been defined and\n\n632\n00:31:09.585 --> 00:31:12.415\nis part of that thought process,\nso that's encapsulation.\n\n633\n00:31:12.415 --> 00:31:16.855\nInheritance is the concept of data classes\nmaking it possible to define subclasses.\n\n634\n00:31:16.855 --> 00:31:21.625\nIn other words, I could say that I\nam a parent and the child class or\n\n635\n00:31:21.625 --> 00:31:24.910\nclasses that come below me will\ninherit certain things from me.\n\n636\n00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.370\nRight, so if you think about this\nlogically in the real world.\n\n637\n00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.540\nIf you are a parent, if you have children,\nyou and your spouse,\n\n638\n00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.150\nif you got together and\nhad a child biologically,\n\n639\n00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.540\nthe child would generically inherent\ncertain traits from one or both of you.\n\n640\n00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.740\nMaybe eye color, maybe hair color.\n\n641\n00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.980\nThings like that.\n\n642\n00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:44.220\nYou or your spouse may be recessive or\nmay be dominant for certain genes.\n\n643\n00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.870\nSo your child may have blue\neyes even though you don't.\n\n644\n00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:47.030\nYou know, maybe that kind of thing.\n\n645\n00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:50.345\nThis is the whole pundit square thing\nthat we do with genetics, right?\n\n646\n00:31:50.345 --> 00:31:52.920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So the idea, remember fruit flies?\n\n647\n00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.280\nRemember that whole thing?\n\n648\n00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.470\n>> Fruit fly experiments.\n\n649\n00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.890\n>> Yeah, it was cool stuff, right?\n\n650\n00:31:56.890 --> 00:31:58.650\nSo, pundit squares in\ngenetics in fruit flies.\n\n651\n00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.101\nSo, inheritance is the same thing.\n\n652\n00:32:00.101 --> 00:32:03.448\nIt works the same way whether we're\ntalking about grouping fruit flies for\n\n653\n00:32:03.448 --> 00:32:06.903\ncharacteristics, looking at inherited\ndominant and recessive genes, and\n\n654\n00:32:06.903 --> 00:32:10.730\ntracking them from parent to child, or\nwe're talking about inheriting code.\n\n655\n00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.674\nCapabilities from a parent\nclass down to a subclass.\n\n656\n00:32:13.674 --> 00:32:16.412\nIt's the same concept, and so\nin object oriented programming,\n\n657\n00:32:16.412 --> 00:32:18.550\nwe think about encapsulation inheritance.\n\n658\n00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:19.980\nAnd wanna think about those things.\n\n659\n00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.890\nWe also wanna think about polymorphism and\n\n660\n00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:25.840\npolyinstantiation, another\nvery important set of terms.\n\n661\n00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:29.340\nAnd you're gonna actually help me to\ndefine polymorphism and polyinstantiation.\n\n662\n00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.360\nSo Mike's gonna play\na very crucial role here.\n\n663\n00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.603\nI'm gonna focus on Mike for a minute.\n\n664\n00:32:32.603 --> 00:32:33.810\nLet's go to a wide shot so\nwe can see Mike.\n\n665\n00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:35.475\n>> There we go, there we go.\n>> So what we wanna do is we wanna be\n\n666\n00:32:35.475 --> 00:32:39.130\nable to, Mike's gonna play the part of\nthe dog in this particular conversation.\n\n667\n00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:40.680\nI'm gonna play the part of the cat.\n\n668\n00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:41.860\nI don't happen to like cats very much.\n\n669\n00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:42.744\nYou can be the cat if you would like.\n\n670\n00:32:42.744 --> 00:32:43.406\n>> No, no.\n\n671\n00:32:43.406 --> 00:32:44.463\n>> All right, so you can be the dog.\n\n672\n00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:45.229\nI'm not a cat person.\n\n673\n00:32:45.229 --> 00:32:46.564\nI'm a dog person, I'm not a cat person.\n\n674\n00:32:46.564 --> 00:32:47.504\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n675\n00:32:47.504 --> 00:32:50.290\nwe're gonna talk about polymorphism for\njust a minute.\n\n676\n00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.980\nThe way to define polymorphism\nspecifically is to\n\n677\n00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:57.500\nunderstand that the idea of polymorphism,\nand cats and dogs help is illustrate this,\n\n678\n00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.820\nis that different objects may respond\nto a command in different ways.\n\n679\n00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.530\nAnd so if we think about a dog and a cat.\n\n680\n00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.120\nAnd magically and mythically,\nlet's assume for just a second,\n\n681\n00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.220\nthat we say that both the cat and the dog,\nwhen they hear the command speak,\n\n682\n00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:14.820\nwill be able to not speak words, but will\nbe able to respond to the speak command\n\n683\n00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:17.710\ngiven the natural way that they would\nnormally interpret that, right?\n\n684\n00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:20.730\nSo what we normally think\nof is that a dog would go.\n\n685\n00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:21.410\n>> Woof.\n\n686\n00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.780\n>> And a cat would go, meow, right?\n\n687\n00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:27.370\nAnd so when we say speak to a dog,\nwe get woof.\n\n688\n00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.880\nAnd when we say speak to a cat,\nwe get meow.\n\n689\n00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.090\nThat's polymorphous.\n\n690\n00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:34.420\nYou issue one command but different\nobjects interpret that command and\n\n691\n00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:35.690\nrespond differently.\n\n692\n00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:37.930\nThis is the idea of polymorphism.\n\n693\n00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:42.070\nThe idea of polyinstantiation\nis that different objects,\n\n694\n00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:45.540\nor versions of an object can be\ncreated by changing their attributes.\n\n695\n00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.030\nSo if we think about generically\ncreating an animal and\n\n696\n00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.230\nwe say that one animal will be a dog.\n\n697\n00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:51.560\nOne animal will be a cat.\n\n698\n00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.490\nWe change certain attributes,\nprimarily in the case of dogs and\n\n699\n00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.265\ncats it will be personality, right?\n\n700\n00:33:56.265 --> 00:33:58.780\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Clearly the cat's antisocial, right.\n\n701\n00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.600\nIn need of a little help,\nright, to be more social.\n\n702\n00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.810\nDogs, not so much so, right.\n\n703\n00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:05.560\nThey typically tend to be a little\nbit more social than cats, at least\n\n704\n00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.750\nthat's urban myth and legend around\nthem anyway, but they are both animals.\n\n705\n00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.550\nNow I know, yes, they're different classes\nof animals, they're different types,\n\n706\n00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.410\nI get all that, but just generically,\nwe just think about the fact that we could\n\n707\n00:34:15.410 --> 00:34:20.180\nsay they're both animals, and that we've\nchanged one trait, one very important,\n\n708\n00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:23.830\nin this case, attribute of the animal\nto create two different versions.\n\n709\n00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.590\nThat attribute is personality, right?\n\n710\n00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.870\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe've had polyinstantiation.\n\n711\n00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:32.000\nWe've effectively created two\nversions of an animal, but\n\n712\n00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.310\nchanged an important attribute\nin order to do so, and\n\n713\n00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:36.890\nas a result they effectively\nare different from one another.\n\n714\n00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:40.340\nEven though they initially start\nout as coming from the same place.\n\n715\n00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.370\nThat's the idea of polyinstantiation and\npolymorphism.\n\n716\n00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:46.980\nVery important concepts as well with\nregards to object oriented technology and\n\n717\n00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.350\nprogramming right.\n\n718\n00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:51.434\n>> All right Adam we get a lot of\ngreat information there on software\n\n719\n00:34:51.434 --> 00:34:52.640\ndevelopment security.\n\n720\n00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:56.090\nYou look at all kinds of really important\ninformation we have to go over.\n\n721\n00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:58.190\nAnd great examples with dogs and cats.\n\n722\n00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:00.091\nI hope I, I fulfilled the role of dog.\n\n723\n00:35:00.091 --> 00:35:01.792\n>> You were awesome as the dog, Mike.\n\n724\n00:35:01.792 --> 00:35:03.073\nLet's hear it from Mike, by the way.\n\n725\n00:35:03.073 --> 00:35:05.040\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Round of applause everybody for Mike.\n\n726\n00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:05.898\nGolden Globe Nomination for the dog.\n\n727\n00:35:05.898 --> 00:35:06.704\n>> There you go, I'll take my bow.\n\n728\n00:35:06.704 --> 00:35:07.958\n>> Okay, there you go.\n\n729\n00:35:07.958 --> 00:35:11.405\n>> I had a good look at the languages and\nthere are five generations that we've gone\n\n730\n00:35:11.405 -->

--> 00:00:17.790\nI'm your host Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.530\nToday we're doing our CISSP contents\nspecifically we've been talking about\n\n5\n00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.510\nsoftware development security,\nthis is part four.\n\n6\n00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.420\nWe've gone through a lot of information so\nfar, and\n\n7\n00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.400\nin this one we're gonna take a look\nat kinda the, I don't wanna say\n\n8\n00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.310\nthe other side, but we're gonna\nlook at malicious software, right?\n\n9\n00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.750\nWith all of our testing and all of our\nsecurity that we try to put in place,\n\n10\n00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.720\nthe bad guys are doing the same thing, and\n\n11\n00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.190\nthey're trying to figure out\nways to break it and get in.\n\n12\n00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.980\nSo we've gotta be able to deal with what\nhappens when something goes wrong, and\n\n13\n00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.110\nhere to help us with that the one,\nthe only Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.220\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n15\n00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.760\n>> Good, good.\n\n16\n00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.685\nJust call me Boots.\n\n17\n00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:51.925\n[LAUGH]\n>> We'll call you Boots.\n\n18\n00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:52.980\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n19\n00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.900\nSo we're gonna continue our conversations\nwith regards to malicious software.\n\n20\n00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.530\nYou know, the first thing we gonna do\nwhen talk about malicious software\n\n21\n00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.070\nis define what malicious software,\nwhat’s commonly called Malware is.\n\n22\n00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.190\nAnd so, we'll begin with that.\n\n23\n00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.190\nMalware is gonna be any kind of software\nthat can compromise programs and\n\n24\n00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.940\ndata and make them no longer either\navailable or make them operate in a way\n\n25\n00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.590\nthey were not designed to do,\ntypically breaching confidentiality,\n\n26\n00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.520\npotentially affecting integrity, and\nof course affecting availability.\n\n27\n00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.600\nSo, wanna keep in mind that malware\ncan exist in multiple formats.\n\n28\n00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.430\nWe see it across multiple\nsystems in different ways.\n\n29\n00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.870\nIt could be a virus, it could be a Trojan,\nit could be spyware,\n\n30\n00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.360\nit could be adware,\nit can be all sorts of different stuff.\n\n31\n00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.150\nWe group all of that stuff generically\ntogether typically, worms, viruses,\n\n32\n00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.220\nTrojans, adware, spyware, etc.,\ninto the broad category of malware.\n\n33\n00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.980\nUnwanted for,\n\n34\n00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.695\nunlooked for software that's designed to\nact in some way maliciously, act in a way\n\n35\n00:01:47.695 --> 00:01:52.005\nthat it was not designed to show us it\nwould do before it infected our systems.\n\n36\n00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:55.325\nIf we knew flat out, somebody came to\nyou and said hey, here's this piece of\n\n37\n00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:58.065\nsoftware, install this and by the way,\nit's gonna wipe everything out on your\n\n38\n00:01:58.065 --> 00:02:02.160\nhard drive, hopefully, most of you would\nnot think that that was a good idea.\n\n39\n00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.970\nI would not take that challenge on.\n\n40\n00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.020\n>> Can I get a copy of that?\n\n41\n00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.170\n>> Mike's requesting a copy of that.\n\n42\n00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.560\nWe're gonna provide that to\nMike live in real time here.\n\n43\n00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.340\nJust when I send you that file make\nsure you click on it and open it.\n\n44\n00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.690\nSo the idea with malware is that it can\nbe a lot of different things right.\n\n45\n00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.990\nIt can be a link that we send to somebody.\n\n46\n00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.750\nNot the malware itself but\nthe access to the malware.\n\n47\n00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.200\nIn other words, the vector that\ndelivers it could be a link and\n\n48\n00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.700\nsomebody clicks on it in email.\n\n49\n00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.380\nRight.\nIt could be coming from a phishing attack\n\n50\n00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.840\nor something like that, in other words.\n\n51\n00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.822\nIt could be a software program that\nis installed as seemingly harmlessly,\n\n52\n00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:33.950\nit could be what purports to be\na screen saver or something like that.\n\n53\n00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.980\nWhatever it is.\n\n54\n00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.770\nAnd then we install that and\nindeed it legitimately does that.\n\n55\n00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.260\nBut the software does other stuff as well.\n\n56\n00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.040\nThis would be a Trojan typically\nthat has some sort of hidden\n\n57\n00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.480\nfunctionality within it.\n\n58\n00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.800\nIt could be something that is designed\nspecifically just to be a virus and\n\n59\n00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.250\nis what it says it effectively is\nif we had identify it as such.\n\n60\n00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.706\nProblem is we may not know that it's\na virus cuz we may not understand that\n\n61\n00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:57.117\nthe software that's been installed\nin our system is bad, is malware.\n\n62\n00:02:57.117 --> 00:03:01.342\nSo viruses are probably by far and away\nthe largest class malware, but we do have\n\n63\n00:03:01.342 --> 00:03:05.970\nto understand that malware can take\nmany forms, many guises, in other words.\n\n64\n00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.230\nLet's discuss what viruses and worms are.\n\n65\n00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.560\nWe need to make sure we understand\nthe definition of each.\n\n66\n00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.455\nIt is an important, a distinctive,\nand a subtle definition.\n\n67\n00:03:13.455 --> 00:03:16.670\nBut one that that is gonna be very\ncritical for you to be successful with.\n\n68\n00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.890\nA virus, much like a virus in\nthe real world, a flu virus or\n\n69\n00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.090\nsomething like that or\nwhatever you may catch is gonna spread but\n\n70\n00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.450\nit's gonna spread by effectively\nleveraging the host.\n\n71\n00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.050\nSomething's gonna help it to spread.\n\n72\n00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.220\nYou get sick and you cough on others and\nthen the virus is airborne,\n\n73\n00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.750\nit will potentially\ninfect those around you.\n\n74\n00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.510\nIf you get sick and the virus is in your\nblood, or in your saliva or something and\n\n75\n00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.880\nyou take a sip out of a glass and\nshare the glass with somebody,\n\n76\n00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.415\nthere's virus because of\nthe saliva you leave behind.\n\n77\n00:03:45.415 --> 00:03:46.965\nThen, obviously, you may get sick as well.\n\n78\n00:03:46.965 --> 00:03:48.065\nYou cut yourself.\n\n79\n00:03:48.065 --> 00:03:49.475\nSomebody's exposed to your blood.\n\n80\n00:03:49.475 --> 00:03:50.605\nYou may get sick that way, right?\n\n81\n00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:53.005\nSo there's different ways\nviruses are transmitted, but\n\n82\n00:03:53.005 --> 00:03:54.885\nthe idea is they need the help to spread.\n\n83\n00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:58.115\nAnd this is the definition we use for\ncomputer viruses as well.\n\n84\n00:03:58.115 --> 00:04:00.075\nA computer virus needs help to spread.\n\n85\n00:04:00.075 --> 00:04:03.685\nIt spreads from host to host\neffectively but is being spread through\n\n86\n00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:07.895\nthe interaction and/or the support and\nassistance of either an individual or\n\n87\n00:04:07.895 --> 00:04:11.500\nsome sort of mechanism like sending\nsomething via email, and then somebody\n\n88\n00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.760\nclicking on that link and then infecting\nthe new system, whatever it may be.\n\n89\n00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.250\nSo this is a virus.\n\n90\n00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.910\nSo the virus is defined by its ability\nto reproduce and spread, but to do so,\n\n91\n00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.240\nin effect, through the aid of others or\nsome sort of mechanism,\n\n92\n00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.660\nnot self-replicating and not the ability\nto spread on its own with no intervention.\n\n93\n00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.740\nA virus needs help.\n\n94\n00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.490\nWhereas a worm spread on its own.\n\n95\n00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.270\nA worm can spread irrespective\nof anybody getting in the way.\n\n96\n00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.160\nSo a worm effectively will infect one or\nmore systems and\n\n97\n00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.010\nthen just use the network or\nuse connectivity or use\n\n98\n00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.360\nsome sort of resource in that system to\njump into other systems and infect others.\n\n99\n00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.480\nBut whether we do anything or\nnot the worm will spread.\n\n100\n00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.710\nWe're not gonna be the catalyst\nthat causes the worm to spread.\n\n101\n00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.680\nSo worms spread on their own,\nviruses need help.\n\n102\n00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.250\nWanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n103\n00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.660\nDifferent kinds of viruses, right?\n\n104\n00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.130\nWe have all sorts of types.\n\n105\n00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.140\nWe have file infectors, viruses that\ninfect files, boot sector infectors,\n\n106\n00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:04.120\nthey infect the boot system or\nboot sector of a operating system.\n\n107\n00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.560\nThese are not very common today but\n\n108\n00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.730\nthey still exist and\nyou always want to be aware of them.\n\n109\n00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.290\nSystem infectors that infect one or\nmore aspects of the system overall.\n\n110\n00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.110\nCompanion viruses, viruses that may\nshow up as a result of downloading and\n\n111\n00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.000\ninteracting with something else.\n\n112\n00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.030\nEmail viruses sent through the mail.\n\n113\n00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.100\nMultipartite viruses,\nmacro viruses, script viruses.\n\n114\n00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.835\nThere's just a plethora,\nanother SAT vocabulary word.\n\n115\n00:05:26.835 --> 00:05:28.110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Conundrum and plethora.\n\n116\n00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.860\nWe're trying to give you multiple avenues\nto improve yourself here at ITProTV.\n\n117\n00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.430\nSo, a plethora.\n\n118\n00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.170\nJust a cornucopia of\nviruses that are out there.\n\n119\n00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.710\nYet another word.\n\n120\n00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.550\n>> We are on a roll.\n>> I'm just throwing it out there today,\n\n121\n00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.136\nleft and right.\n\n122\n00:05:41.136 --> 00:05:44.430\nWe should get out the Scrabble board,\nlittle virtual Scrabble here, right?\n\n123\n00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.980\nSo just to make sure, and we know\nthere are multiple types of viruses.\n\n124\n00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.880\nAlso multiple types of malware as we said,\nright?\n\n125\n00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.010\nThings like worms, trojans,\nbotnets, logic bombs,\n\n126\n00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.920\nspyware, adware, DDOS or DOS zombies.\n\n127\n00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.780\nThese are all considered\nto be forms of malware.\n\n128\n00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.580\nAnd they're all gonna play a part in\nspreading the implications of malware,\n\n129\n00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.940\nwhat it can do to a system in one form or\nanother.\n\n130\n00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.440\nRemember, probably the biggest thing\nwe do to protect against malware\n\n131\n00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.040\nis secured awareness and training, right?\n\n132\n00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.450\nIf we tell people and\neducate the people under our control and\n\n133\n00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.630\nunder our protection,\n\n134\n00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.700\nthat it's bad idea to click on this\nsoftware without knowing what it does.\n\n135\n00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.220\nIt's a bad idea to answer this email from\nsomebody that you're not familiar with.\n\n136\n00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.480\nIt's a bad idea to accept this\nfile when somebody pops up in\n\n137\n00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.250\na chat session or a online system and\n\n138\n00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.210\nsays, hey, I've got a file I want to send\nyou, will you please click on the link?\n\n139\n00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.095\nIt's the bad idea to do this thing unless\nyou know who this people are, right?\n\n140\n00:06:37.095 --> 00:06:40.350\nCuz we do one or more of those activities,\nyou engage in them,\n\n141\n00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.868\nchances are good you're probably going\nto open yourself up to compromise.\n\n142\n00:06:43.868 --> 00:06:45.170\nMalware may be spread this way.\n\n143\n00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.530\nSo, wanna think about that.\n\n144\n00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.280\nDon’t accept any attachments.\n\n145\n00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.910\nDon't accept any inbound email.\n\n146\n00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.080\nDon’t look at anything that you're\nnot familiar that you don't trust.\n\n147\n00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.450\nWe often talk about stranger danger,\nright,\n\n148\n00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.130\nwhen we talk to kids about awareness.\n\n149\n00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.560\nAnd stranger danger's a great thought\nprocess for security as well.\n\n150\n00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.160\nSpecifically when you're having to deal\nwith, dealing with security awareness and\n\n151\n00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.590\ntraining for individuals under your\ncare and guidance and feeding, right.\n\n152\n00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.000\nIf you have to educate 1,000 users in\nyour system because you are the CISSP,\n\n153\n00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.220\nyou're the one who's gonna be in\ncharge of, security awareness and\n\n154\n00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.370\nyou have to come up with\na malware protection campaign and\n\n155\n00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.030\nthat's this month or\nthis quarter steam for security awareness.\n\n156\n00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.045\nYou've got to think about the different\nways you can engage in this activity and\n\n157\n00:07:25.045 --> 00:07:28.130\npouching that conversation from\nthe perspective of of hey,\n\n158\n00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.460\nthere's a lot of bad things out there,\nyou know, don't click on anything.\n\n159\n00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.720\nYeah, but you know we gotta click\non stuff to do our job Adam,\n\n160\n00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.310\nthat's probably not the right message\nbecause you're effectively telling me you\n\n161\n00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.320\ndon't do anything.\n\n162\n00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.300\nWhat you really need to tell me and\nyou need to help me to understand is\n\n163\n00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.150\nthat there are certain things that\nare going to be obviously bad.\n\n164\n00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.482\nCertain things that are not so obvious and\ncertain things I'm never gonna understand\n\n165\n00:07:47.482 --> 00:07:49.391\nand know that are gonna\nbe potentially harmful.\n\n166\n00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:53.511\nSo if I break them into categories, and\nI try to identify warning signs for\n\n167\n00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:58.114\nthose categories and try to educate you on\nthe majority the things that you can do.\n\n168\n00:07:58.114 --> 00:08:01.446\nThat are safe, and the majority of things\nthat you could do that are probably\n\n169\n00:08:01.446 --> 00:08:04.570\nquestionable, and I give you good\nguidance and good examples of each,\n\n170\n00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.890\nI'm gonna be a lot more\nsuccessful with my message.\n\n171\n00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.030\nAnd so, a message like stranger\ndanger can be helpful,\n\n172\n00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.390\nnot only because it's catchy, but\nalso because people identify with that.\n\n173\n00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:16.620\nIt's something they already know, they\nunderstand, they have experience with, and\n\n174\n00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.430\nyou can translate that into security\nawareness with regards to making sure\n\n175\n00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.140\nthat people operate accordingly.\n\n176\n00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.350\nThings like sending HTML code\nas links through an email,\n\n177\n00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.190\nprobably not a good idea because a lot of\nvirus scanning systems will drop those and\n\n178\n00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.780\nnot allow them to be\npropagated in the first place.\n\n179\n00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.530\nAnd even if they are, users may or may\nnot realize that those links are valid.\n\n180\n00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:39.480\nThey may or may not understand what they\nare, so again, something to consider.\n\n181\n00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.690\nYou wanna send somebody a link to\na webpage, maybe write it down in\n\n182\n00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.630\na document, send it as an attachment,\nand digitally sign the email.\n\n183\n00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.070\nWe've talked about the value\nof digital signing and\n\n184\n00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.170\nprotecting through an integrity control,\n\n185\n00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.030\nthe purpose of that information\nto ensure it's not compromised.\n\n186\n00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.630\nThat would be a great way to send that\ninformation, but to do so in a way\n\n187\n00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.000\nthat is gonna mark it as secure and give\nthe recipient peace of mind and help them\n\n188\n00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.476\nto understand that it's probably something\nthat will be okay is one example, right?\n\n189\n00:09:05.476 --> 00:09:08.940\nYou can hand deliver that, just give it\nto them by writing it down and walking it\n\n190\n00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.930\nover to them, but again that may be time\nconsuming, may not be the easiest way.\n\n191\n00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.400\nSomebody may transcribe that incorrectly,\nthey may put that into the system,\n\n192\n00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.550\nget to the wrong email address, or rather,\n\n193\n00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:20.650\nexcuse me, the wrong web address as\na result of transposing something.\n\n194\n00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.250\nYou know, whitehouse.gov and\nwhitehouse.com, that whole thing,\n\n195\n00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.510\nif you're not familiar with that.\n\n196\n00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.160\nBy the way do not go to that website,\ndo not.\n\n197\n00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.920\nBut just so you know.\n\n198\n00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.620\nSo those kind of things can happen, right?\n\n199\n00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.830\nAnd so you wanna be aware of that.\n\n200\n00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.590\nSo what kind of tools do we need to\nprotect ourselves against malware aside\n\n201\n00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:38.340\nfrom awareness, aside from education,\nthings like scanning engines, right,\n\n202\n00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.540\nantivirus, anti malware platforms,\nvery important to think about.\n\n203\n00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.590\nHeuristic scanners,\n\n204\n00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.980\nactivity monitors, change detection\nwith integrity control mechanisms.\n\n205\n00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.900\nAll or\nany of these things would be helpful and\n\n206\n00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.090\nwanna be aware of these things and\nbe thinking about them.\n\n207\n00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.790\nThe role of policy is very\nimportant to touch on here as well.\n\n208\n00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.030\nWhat does policy give us?\n\n209\n00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.430\nIt gives us the ability to be able\nto implement a set of principles,\n\n210\n00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.720\nguiding principles typically in\nthe organization, that's strategically\n\n211\n00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.870\nexplained to individual users what\nthe importance of something is,\n\n212\n00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.210\nwhy would do something the certain way,\nand the reasons behind that.\n\n213\n00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:14.840\nAnd then we need procedures to implement\nand processes to implement those policies\n\n214\n00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.920\nto operationalize them and\ntactically allow us to execute on them.\n\n215\n00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.770\nAnd the combination of process, procedure,\nand policy, strategic and tactical\n\n216\n00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.810\napproach to this question will also be\nvery helpful with regards to management.\n\n217\n00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:30.440\nWanna think about things like the Trusted\nComputing Base, what's known as the TCB.\n\n218\n00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.460\nReach backwards in time to our\nconversation about the rainbow series and\n\n219\n00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.840\nthe orange book and the red book, the TNI,\nthe Trusted Network Interpretation, and\n\n220\n00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.900\nthe idea of being able\nto evaluate a system and\n\n221\n00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.260\nunderstand the holistic\nparts that it's made up of.\n\n222\n00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.140\nAnd securing them and\n\n223\n00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:47.110\nunderstanding all that is part of\nthat whole conversation we've had.\n\n224\n00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.160\nBut the TCB is the collection of\nall the hardware, the software, and\n\n225\n00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.480\nall the controls that go into making a\ncomputer system run the way it's supposed\n\n226\n00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.320\nto, and setting all that up, and then\nhaving that so we can trust the system,\n\n227\n00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.960\nand have it adhere to an established\nsecurity policy is what the TCB,\n\n228\n00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.790\nTrust Computing Base, is all about.\n\n229\n00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.860\nTCB play an important role in that.\n\n230\n00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.740\nReference monitors are also important for\nthat.\n\n231\n00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.630\nWe talked about reference monitors\nin our prior conversation about\n\n232\n00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.680\nsystem architecture,\nhow to design systems securely.\n\n233\n00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.740\nAny subject attempting to access\nany object should be monitored, and\n\n234\n00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.680\nthat interaction should be controlled,\nand should be tested to make sure,\n\n235\n00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.750\nto validate that the subject has the\nappropriate rights to access the object.\n\n236\n00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.560\nRemember, subjects are users.\n\n237\n00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.600\nObjects, traditionally,\nare refered to or defined as being data.\n\n238\n00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.240\nAnd so as a result of that,\nsubjects remember users, but\n\n239\n00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.310\nalso potentially a service that\ncan proxy on behalf of the user in\n\n240\n00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.620\norder to access a piece of data, or\n\n241\n00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:45.200\ncarry out some sort of a process on behalf\nof a user to get something in the system.\n\n242\n00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.520\nSo user or service accessing data,\nwe should monitor that interaction.\n\n243\n00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:52.770\nAnd a reference monitor does that,\nprotects the object, in effect,\n\n244\n00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.730\nfrom unauthorized access and\nunauthorized usage.\n\n245\n00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.670\nWant to make sure we understand\nthe concept of a reference monitor.\n\n246\n00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.640\nAll of these things are going to be\ncontrolled by, operated within, and\n\n247\n00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.640\nbe associated with something\nknown as a security kernel.\n\n248\n00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.820\nWe've talked about\nthe security kernel as well.\n\n249\n00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.681\nIt's part of the general kernel\nconversation with regards to our\n\n250\n00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:09.573\noperating system.\n\n251\n00:12:09.573 --> 00:12:13.581\nRemember the operating system kernel is\nthe most protected ring, most protected\n\n252\n00:12:13.581 --> 00:12:17.413\nlayer of the operating system, where\nthe core functional code executes, and\n\n253\n00:12:17.413 --> 00:12:21.478\nwhere unrestricted access is given to the\noperating system in terms of user mode and\n\n254\n00:12:21.478 --> 00:12:22.201\nkernel mode.\n\n255\n00:12:22.201 --> 00:12:24.600\nWe've differentiated between them and\ntalked about them.\n\n256\n00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.870\nAnd kernel mode is where we\nhave root level access and\n\n257\n00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.010\ncontrol directly to the hardware\nthrough the software kernel.\n\n258\n00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.080\nAnd user mode, sometimes\n\n259\n00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.100\nI'll sort of refer to as problem mode-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n260\n00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:34.710\n>> Which is a very apropo way of\n\n261\n00:12:34.710 --> 00:12:36.070\nreferring to user mode.\n\n262\n00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.730\nBut user mode is that higher level\nabstraction layer where we run through\n\n263\n00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.330\nsome sort of a hardware abstraction layer,\ntypically a HAL, or some sort of,\n\n264\n00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:49.160\nin the case of virtualization,\nsome sort of a hypervisor of some sort,\n\n265\n00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.920\nsome sort of an abstraction device,\nwhatever it may be, that allows users to\n\n266\n00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.370\ninteract through controlled software\nmechanisms to then gain restricted and\n\n267\n00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:02.680\neffectively brokered access to hardware\nand core functional elements or software\n\n268\n00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:06.620\ncontrol elements within the operating\nsystem kernel and security kernel.\n\n269\n00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.140\nSo the security colonel is made up\nof all the components of the TCB and\n\n270\n00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.940\nit's responsible for implementing and\nenforcing the reference monitor.\n\n271\n00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:16.140\nWanna make sure, again, is we review and\nremind ourselves that this things from our\n\n272\n00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.330\nsecurity architecture conversation,\nsystem architecture and\n\n273\n00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.630\ndesign is what we would been\ntalking this area is with and in.\n\n274\n00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.660\nWanna make sure we understand those\nthings and remind ourselves of them.\n\n275\n00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.310\nProcess or privileged states as well.\n\n276\n00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.690\nWe talked about user mode,\ntalked about kernel mode,\n\n277\n00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.910\nunderstanding those, understanding\nwhat they are why they're important.\n\n278\n00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:34.650\nSecurity controls through\nbuffer overflows,\n\n279\n00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:38.620\nwe talked about buffer overflows,\nwhat they are, why they are so important,\n\n280\n00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.650\nmaking sure we know that improper boundary\nchecking can lead to a buffer overflow or\n\n281\n00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:47.040\ncomprise where information can be\nput into a memory space or a buffer.\n\n282\n00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.070\nIt can be of the wrong type,\nthe wrong size, the wrong amount,\n\n283\n00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.270\nthe wrong format, and\nif we're checking for\n\n284\n00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:56.570\nthat through input validation to ensure\nthat on the way in we catch that and\n\n285\n00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:00.170\nmake sure we understand it's in the wrong\nform and don't allow it to continue and,\n\n286\n00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:03.562\ntherefore, be processed into the system\nand potentially create a compromise.\n\n287\n00:14:03.562 --> 00:14:06.140\nIf we captured up front,\nwe can restrict it and stop it.\n\n288\n00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.110\nWe're good, right?\n\n289\n00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:09.200\nIf somebody tried to attack us,\nwe prevented it.\n\n290\n00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.370\nIf we don't catch it cuz we're doing\ninput validation, boundary checking, and\n\n291\n00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.520\nall the other things we need to do,\nwe allow the malformed code,\n\n292\n00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.370\nwhatever form it is,\nto get into the system.\n\n293\n00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.260\nWhether it's too much,\nit's of the wrong format, the wrong size,\n\n294\n00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:25.200\nwhatever it may be,\nif we allow that to occur,\n\n295\n00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.770\nthen effectively the compromise is\na lot more likely to be successful.\n\n296\n00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:30.470\nNo guarantee.\n\n297\n00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:31.590\nWe may still be able to stop it,\n\n298\n00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:35.100\nthere might be other things that are going\non that can potentially impact that and\n\n299\n00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.270\nprevent that from happening, but we\nmissed probably one of the most important\n\n300\n00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.220\nelements to being successful at stopping,\nwhich is stopping at a front before it\n\n301\n00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.510\ngets into the system\nthrough input validation.\n\n302\n00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.860\nSo buffer overflow control has to\nbe something that we focus on and\n\n303\n00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:48.080\nthink about as well.\n\n304\n00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.870\nSo wanna make sure we're\nchecking parameters,\n\n305\n00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.960\ndoing input validation, boundary checking,\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n306\n00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.140\nProcess isolation, remember protection\nagain, very important as well.\n\n307\n00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.566\nWe've talked about these.\n\n308\n00:14:57.566 --> 00:15:02.530\nSharing multiple processes are not able\nto access the same system resource at\n\n309\n00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:06.670\nthe same time through time multiplexing,\ntime slicing, and time management, as well\n\n310\n00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:10.510\nas process isolation and memory management\nare all gonna be very important.\n\n311\n00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.300\nWe've talked about address\nspace layout randomization,\n\n312\n00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.212\nASLR is an example of memory isolation and\nmemory management.\n\n313\n00:15:17.212 --> 00:15:18.460\nTalked about different approaches for\n\n314\n00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.920\nthis, wanna remind yourselves\nagain of those conversations.\n\n315\n00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.650\nThe idea of being able to use an interrupt\nto allow the operating system to ensure\n\n316\n00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:29.620\nthat one process gets access to the system\nresource, and then is pulled out, and\n\n317\n00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.690\nother one gets access to it,\n\n318\n00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:33.770\nand controlling that flow is\nalso gonna be very important.\n\n319\n00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.585\nWhen was the last time we\nthought about interrupts and\n\n320\n00:15:36.585 --> 00:15:38.305\nhaving to set them and\ninteracting with them?\n\n321\n00:15:38.305 --> 00:15:39.765\nIt's probably been a while for most of us.\n\n322\n00:15:39.765 --> 00:15:41.552\n>> Way back in A plus, 2005?\n\n323\n00:15:41.552 --> 00:15:44.268\n>> Well not even in A plus, but\nyeah absolutely there from a technical\n\n324\n00:15:44.268 --> 00:15:47.581\nperspective, but think about the operating\nsystems, the way they work today.\n\n325\n00:15:47.581 --> 00:15:51.949\nMost modern operating systems, at least\nthe ones that are graphical anyway, and\n\n326\n00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:56.002\neven the non-graphical ones today for\nthe most part are gonna have a plug and\n\n327\n00:15:56.002 --> 00:16:00.055\nplay architecture where effectively\nwe auto control, auto discover, and\n\n328\n00:16:00.055 --> 00:16:02.236\neffectively auto configure Hardware.\n\n329\n00:16:02.236 --> 00:16:04.563\nAnd we've taken out the burden and\nthe liability,\n\n330\n00:16:04.563 --> 00:16:07.755\nand the responsibility away from\nthe user with regards to effectively\n\n331\n00:16:07.755 --> 00:16:11.020\nsetting up the controlling interrupts and\nhaving to worry about this.\n\n332\n00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:12.630\nI mean, you know, interrupts are there.\n\n333\n00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.440\nThey haven't gone away.\n\n334\n00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.780\nYou can go to the Control Panel\nin Windows and you can see them.\n\n335\n00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.980\nYou can interact with them if\nyou go into the Control Panel.\n\n336\n00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.660\nGo into the Device Manager.\n\n337\n00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.790\nYou can go open up the hardware.\n\n338\n00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.020\nYou can find them there.\n\n339\n00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.820\nThey're in the same place\nthey've always been.\n\n340\n00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.410\nBut we stopped worrying about them in the\n9x operating systems if you think about it\n\n341\n00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:32.510\nbecause getting into Windows XP which\nis really where the first true plug and\n\n342\n00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.840\nplay like architecture started to emerge.\n\n343\n00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.460\nWIndows 98 in the later version had some,\nearly inklings of this,\n\n344\n00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.950\nwe begin to see some of that.\n\n345\n00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:42.310\nIn Windows 98.\nBut certainly not on Windows 95,\n\n346\n00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:45.410\nat least not in a way that really\nworked and made sense anyway.\n\n347\n00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.780\nAnd in Windows 98 is kinda\nwhen they tested the waters.\n\n348\n00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:50.170\nWindows XP is really where\nit started to come out and\n\n349\n00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:51.160\nit was really starting to work.\n\n350\n00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.770\nAnd then as we progressed\ninto Windows Vista and\n\n351\n00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.180\ncertainly into Windows 7, Windows 8, etc.\n\n352\n00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.700\nWe really see an emergence in\na maturing of that technology.\n\n353\n00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.980\nAnd at least on the Windows side today and\nthe same thing could be said for Linux.\n\n354\n00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.450\nIn the modern builds of Linux.\n\n355\n00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.340\nYet we really just,\nalmost without exception,\n\n356\n00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.930\nunless it's something really bizarre,\nin terms of a new hardware element\n\n357\n00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.380\nwith custom unique drivers that have to\nprobably be installed and configured that\n\n358\n00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.785\nare not core in the operating system and\nalready look loaded in the driver cache.\n\n359\n00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:19.705\nIf they're not there yet, you probably\nhave to go in and configure a driver,\n\n360\n00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:23.415\nyou may have to load it and there may be\nan IRQ configuration as part of that.\n\n361\n00:17:23.415 --> 00:17:26.195\nAlthough, even then, we tend to script\nthat and hide that from the user,\n\n362\n00:17:26.195 --> 00:17:28.892\nbecause the user doesn't know\nwhat IRQ's are in play anyway.\n\n363\n00:17:28.892 --> 00:17:30.972\nIRQ's interrupts by the way,\njust to be clear.\n\n364\n00:17:30.972 --> 00:17:33.832\nAnd as a result of that, the system's\ngonna auto detect the ones that\n\n365\n00:17:33.832 --> 00:17:36.772\nare available and\nfeed that to the configuration module and\n\n366\n00:17:36.772 --> 00:17:40.072\nthen auto configure or manual\nconfiguration takes place as a result.\n\n367\n00:17:40.072 --> 00:17:41.622\nBut when was the last time\nyou had to deal with this?\n\n368\n00:17:41.622 --> 00:17:42.822\nI mean, when you think about it.\n\n369\n00:17:42.822 --> 00:17:43.344\n>> Years.\n\n370\n00:17:43.344 --> 00:17:46.822\n>> I mean, it's just nothing something\nmost modern operating systems expose.\n\n371\n00:17:46.822 --> 00:17:49.672\nAnd as a result many security\nprofessionals, many network admins,\n\n372\n00:17:49.672 --> 00:17:53.080\njust many generic IT people If\nthey haven't been doing this for\n\n373\n00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.510\nprobably at least ten years or longer,\n\n374\n00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.730\nmay not really have a full knowledge of\nthe fact that this goes on under the hood,\n\n375\n00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.910\nand even be aware of what we're\ntalking about, all right?\n\n376\n00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.762\nThis may sound like that scene in\nCharlie Brown where the teacher's\n\n377\n00:18:03.762 --> 00:18:04.571\ntalking, [SOUND].\n\n378\n00:18:04.571 --> 00:18:07.800\nAll right, you just don't understand\nwhat we're saying at all.\n\n379\n00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.560\nSo this is something that is there and\n\n380\n00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.800\nit's under the hood and\nit's something you have to be aware of.\n\n381\n00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:15.005\nWhen we think about encapsulating\na process and process isolating,\n\n382\n00:18:15.005 --> 00:18:19.050\nIRQs are one of the ways, through channel\ncontrol, that we do that with hardware.\n\n383\n00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.150\nBut you may not even be aware of the fact\nthis existence takes place today, yet\n\n384\n00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.580\nit's an important thought process for\na security professional.\n\n385\n00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.210\nSo, sometimes we don't think about\nthe fact that the most obvious\n\n386\n00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:28.790\nkind of underling hard.\n\n387\n00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:33.800\nHard coated bedrock things that go on,\nare so commonplace today that,\n\n388\n00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.600\nthey may be happening without our direct\nknowledge, or even our awareness.\n\n389\n00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.630\nI actually had this conversation with\none of my daughters during the break.\n\n390\n00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:42.970\nTook her to Holiday's.\n\n391\n00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:45.660\nWe're talking and\nat some point I forget where we were, but\n\n392\n00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.970\nwe were somewhere, and\nshe saw and get ready for this.\n\n393\n00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:50.861\nHold on to your socks.\n\n394\n00:18:50.861 --> 00:18:51.575\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n395\n00:18:51.575 --> 00:18:53.640\nThis is like,\nout of a blast from the past.\n\n396\n00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.880\nShe saw a rotary dial phone, and\nnot just a rotary dial phone,\n\n397\n00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.170\nbut a rotary dial phone\nas a pay phone set up as.\n\n398\n00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.380\n>> With a booth?\n>> As a pay phone with a booth and\n\n399\n00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.130\nthe whole nine yards.\n\n400\n00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:04.230\nI mean you go look around\nin most cities today.\n\n401\n00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:06.720\nNumber one it's very hard to\nfind pay phones at all today.\n\n402\n00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.780\nThere's really very few of them left at\nleast in the United States anyway today.\n\n403\n00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.070\nNot necessarily in other countries, but\n\n404\n00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.710\nin the US anyway,\nthey're becoming a dying breed.\n\n405\n00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:20.290\nAnd in addition, go try to find one\nthat's a rotary phone is like hunting for\n\n406\n00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:21.570\na needle in a haystack.\n\n407\n00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:23.230\nSo we actually saw one.\n\n408\n00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.720\nAnd she knew it was a phone.\n\n409\n00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.650\nBut she didn't really have\na concept of rotary dial.\n\n410\n00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:27.860\nThis was my younger daughter.\n\n411\n00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:31.470\nShe didn't have a concept of rotary\ndial and said, hey what is that?\n\n412\n00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:34.290\nWhat is that and how does it work?\n\n413\n00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:38.315\nI had to explain the whole concept that at\none point we actually did this, [SOUND].\n\n414\n00:19:38.315 --> 00:19:39.380\n>> And then get the free ride back.\n\n415\n00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.200\n>> And you got the ride back.\n\n416\n00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:40.990\nDo the whole thing.\n\n417\n00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.710\nBecause most people today, unless you're\nof a certain age and a certain generation,\n\n418\n00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.400\nit's not that you don't know that it's a\nphone, but generically you may never have\n\n419\n00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:53.770\nseen a rotary dial input device on\nthe front end of a phone before, right?\n\n420\n00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.260\nThat's something to think about and\nreally be aware of.\n\n421\n00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.960\nSo it's kinda interesting\nwhen you see these things.\n\n422\n00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.460\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n423\n00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.830\n>> I mean,\nyou're not always aware of what they are.\n\n424\n00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.710\nAnd as a result what they\nhave to do with security.\n\n425\n00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.540\nWe should get to back to talking\nabout that cause that's probably\n\n426\n00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:04.695\nwhy you're here.\n\n427\n00:20:04.695 --> 00:20:06.200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're time's valuable so we should do,\n\n428\n00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.160\nwe're gonna do that right now.\n\n429\n00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.040\nStop distracting me!\n\n430\n00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.070\n>> Okay, sorry, my bad.\n>> Stop doing that.\n\n431\n00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.070\n>> All right.\n>> So time multiplexing, right?\n\n432\n00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:12.340\nSo let's talk about time multiplexing.\n\n433\n00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.850\nWe're talking about are queues and\n\n434\n00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:17.120\nwe're talking about the ability to\ncontrol channels for communication.\n\n435\n00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.970\nTime multiplexing is used with IRQs in\na system to effectively time slice,\n\n436\n00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.020\ncontrol time.\n\n437\n00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.920\nIt's not just about controlling\nthe communication pathway or channel,\n\n438\n00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.670\nwhich is what the IRQ represents, for\nthe hardware to be able to interact with,\n\n439\n00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.710\nthe various control components of\nthe system and the software, but\n\n440\n00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.580\nit's the amount of time the system\nuses that IRQ and activates it for.\n\n441\n00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.310\nBecause these days we have\nmultiple devices sharing IRQ's,\n\n442\n00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.310\nand we do that through time\nmultiplies your time slice.\n\n443\n00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.910\nSo just another thought process\nwe want to be aware of.\n\n444\n00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.920\nWe know that we have to have\nuniqueness for everything.\n\n445\n00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.300\nWe have to have a unique channel for\n\n446\n00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.710\ncommunication, unique IP address,\nunique amount of time or\n\n447\n00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:55.360\nuninterrupted time, unique name,\nnaming distinctions are important.\n\n448\n00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.080\nAll of these things go\ninto this thought process.\n\n449\n00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.380\nYou wanna be aware of this.\n\n450\n00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.595\nA unique access to memory.\n\n451\n00:20:59.595 --> 00:21:01.760\nUnique memory spaces are important.\n\n452\n00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.490\nMapping that memory is also important.\n\n453\n00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.700\nThese are all considerations and\n\n454\n00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.120\nconcerns that we have to be thinking\nabout with regards to how we manage code.\n\n455\n00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.240\nHow we manage software and\nall the things associated with that.\n\n456\n00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.630\nMemory management also\nvery important as we said.\n\n457\n00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:16.590\nTalked a lot about the importance\nof memory management, why it is so\n\n458\n00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:19.800\nimportant from a security standpoint,\nis because the raw data,\n\n459\n00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.860\nthe raw execution of code,\nthe raw value that comes out of that,\n\n460\n00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:25.030\nall that stuff's sitting in memory,\nmoving in and out.\n\n461\n00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:27.850\nRemember, it's dynamic,\nthe content of memory traditionally.\n\n462\n00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.170\nAt least with RAM anyway, is dynamic.\n\n463\n00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.270\nROM, read only memory,\na little bit different, it's static.\n\n464\n00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:35.410\nIt's programmed, the information that's\nstored there is programmed in and\n\n465\n00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.310\nwill stay when the system is shut off.\n\n466\n00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:41.140\nBut the dynamic nature of RAM,\nrandom access memory that we use\n\n467\n00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.290\nto drive modern computing systems today,\nis very important.\n\n468\n00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.550\nAnd because of the dynamic nature of that\ndata, we have to understand how to manage\n\n469\n00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:52.080\nit, how to make sure that we isolate the\ndata and isolate the processes so that,\n\n470\n00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.660\nif it belongs to me I see it, but if it\nbelongs to Mike and we're sharing systems\n\n471\n00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.290\nas a process, two processes running on the\nsame system wanna make sure that process\n\n472\n00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:05.160\nA does not interact with interrupt indoor\nsomehow contaminate process these memory\n\n473\n00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.750\nspace unless they have agreed to share\ndata and share memory in which case that\n\n474\n00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:12.620\nmay very well happen but under very tight\ncontrol and the constraint circumstances.\n\n475\n00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.260\nSo wanna be aware of this and\nreally focus on this, remembering manager,\n\n476\n00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.590\nwe've talked about remembering manager and\nwhy they're important.\n\n477\n00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.720\nMemory manager has very\nspecific responsibilities and\n\n478\n00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.410\nthere are five of them.\n\n479\n00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:24.800\nWanna know what they are,\nI'm gonna detail them for you right now,\n\n480\n00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.080\nwanna make sure we know what the memory\nmanager's responsibilities are,\n\n481\n00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.340\nreminder ourselves of,\nwe have talked about this again,\n\n482\n00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.820\nthis is system architecture, secure system\ndesign conversations we've had earlier.\n\n483\n00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.950\nBut, the five memory\nmanager responsibilities,\n\n484\n00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.120\nin no particular order,\njust got to know what they are.\n\n485\n00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.808\nYou don't have to know\nthem in any certain order.\n\n486\n00:22:40.808 --> 00:22:46.036\nRelocation, protection,\n\n487\n00:22:46.036 --> 00:22:50.060\nsharing, logical organization, and\n\n488\n00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.660\nphysical organization of data,\nof the stuff in memory.\n\n489\n00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.830\nI'll go through them again so\nwe can capture them appropriately.\n\n490\n00:22:55.830 --> 00:23:00.260\nRelocation, protection, sharing.\n\n491\n00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.240\nLogical as well as physical organization.\n\n492\n00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.490\nLogical organization.\n\n493\n00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:06.720\nPhysical organization.\n\n494\n00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.500\nThese are the five responsibilities\nin the memory manager function.\n\n495\n00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.520\nPlease make sure you know what they are.\n\n496\n00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.800\nThey're definitely very important for\nyou to be aware of.\n\n497\n00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.420\nWe also have talked about covert channels.\n\n498\n00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:18.240\nRemember we talked about covert channels.\n\n499\n00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.180\nThe ability to communicate without anybody\nbeing aware of the fact you're using that\n\n500\n00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:24.300\nparticular channel is a covert channel.\n\n501\n00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.660\nWe have to control that, try to identify\nthose if possible and control them.\n\n502\n00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:31.400\nIf we have shared communication pathways\nand there's a covert channel there,\n\n503\n00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.270\nwe have to inspect those pathways\nto make sure we're aware of it, so\n\n504\n00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.320\nwe can account for it,\nmanage it, and control it.\n\n505\n00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.340\nSo this is important cause otherwise we\nmay lead to or have a situation where we\n\n506\n00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:45.900\ncan transfer information, violating the\nsystem security policy as a result of that\n\n507\n00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.530\nbecause the shared communication channel\nmay lead itself or may allow itself and\n\n508\n00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:53.310\nlend itself to effectively\nthe use of a covert channel for\n\n509\n00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:56.230\ncommunication without our knowledge or\nwithout our consent.\n\n510\n00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:57.427\nSo that's something to be aware of.\n\n511\n00:23:57.427 --> 00:24:00.934\nSocial engineering also very important\nhere as well to throw back out and\n\n512\n00:24:00.934 --> 00:24:02.377\nreally remind ourselves of.\n\n513\n00:24:02.377 --> 00:24:05.917\nThe impact of social engineering Can\nsomebody trick us into divulging\n\n514\n00:24:05.917 --> 00:24:09.220\ninformation that would allow them\nto bypass security controls?\n\n515\n00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.770\nAnd, if so, are we training and\n\n516\n00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:14.090\nmaking people aware of that,\nmaking sure that they're gonna know that?\n\n517\n00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.530\nCould we focus on Mike for just a second\nand just do a shot of him real quick?\n\n518\n00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:18.813\nRight?\nSo you'll notice the,\n\n519\n00:24:18.813 --> 00:24:21.310\nthere you go Mike smile, look pretty for\nthe camera, there you go.\n\n520\n00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:24.230\nSo you'll notice Mike is wearing, and\nI'm gonna point to it right here.\n\n521\n00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.880\nMike is wearing the ITProTV\nlogo on his shirt, right?\n\n522\n00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:30.640\nWe talked about before the fact,\nnow if you could pan back to me,\n\n523\n00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.380\nI'm gonna show you what a security\nprofessional should look like.\n\n524\n00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:34.210\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Notice, wait,\n\n525\n00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.760\nget the whole,\nI'm directionally challenged.\n\n526\n00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.171\nPoint to my logo on my shirt there.\n\n527\n00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:40.890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So there you go, thank you very much.\n\n528\n00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:43.370\nCan not figure out what the hell to do\nwith these things when they're setup\n\n529\n00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.870\nbackwards.\n\n530\n00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.770\nYou'll notice I'm wearing a generic shirt,\nright.\n\n531\n00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:48.070\nOh look, I got it right there.\n\n532\n00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.590\nThat is so cool, finally figured it out.\n\n533\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.000\nOkay, I have to label this hand so\nthat I know this is the right hand.\n\n534\n00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.140\nSo, you'll notice I'm not wearing\nlogo wear, whereas Mike is.\n\n535\n00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.730\nAnd in this example, no big deal.\n\n536\n00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:57.550\nWe're both presenting,\n\n537\n00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.510\nwe're both here talking to you, we've got\nour logo sitting on the screen right here.\n\n538\n00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:02.380\n>> Right, oh, there we go.\n\n539\n00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.321\n>> Right there, right there.\n\n540\n00:25:03.321 --> 00:25:06.532\n[LAUGH] So you can see it and so, I'm\njust directionally challenged in general.\n\n541\n00:25:06.532 --> 00:25:07.100\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I\n\n542\n00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.815\nbarely know my left from\nmy right on a good day.\n\n543\n00:25:08.815 --> 00:25:10.650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So the reality is for\n\n544\n00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.560\nus here talking to you,\nno big deal, right?\n\n545\n00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.630\nWe've branded everything.\n\n546\n00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.060\nYou know this is ITProTV.\n\n547\n00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:15.910\nNo big deal.\n\n548\n00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:19.760\nBut in the real world, if Mike was to\ngo out and be traveling somewhere,\n\n549\n00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.700\nwe've talked about the issues and\nconcerns about this.\n\n550\n00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.810\nMike wearing logo wear that clearly\nidentifies him as working for\n\n551\n00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:29.410\na company may be good for the company's\nbrand spreading that out, but\n\n552\n00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.720\nfrom a security perspective may not be so\ngood.\n\n553\n00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.340\nMaybe people are going to be able\nto socially engineer him and\n\n554\n00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:37.942\ntarget him because they know he works for\ncompany x or company y.\n\n555\n00:25:37.942 --> 00:25:39.740\nAnd so, it's the small things we do,\n\n556\n00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.970\nand the things we may not\nnecessarily be thinking about and\n\n557\n00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:46.810\nbe aware of that are gonna potentially,\nmore often than not, lead to compromise.\n\n558\n00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:50.360\nIt's not the fact the Mike has\nproprietary information on his laptop and\n\n559\n00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.090\nhe leaves it somewhere unprotected\nthat may yield compromise.\n\n560\n00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.240\nBecause he's probably not gonna do that.\n\n561\n00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.943\nBut the fact that he's got the name\nof his company on his shirt,\n\n562\n00:25:57.943 --> 00:26:01.411\nsomebody sits down next to him at a bar,\nwhile they're waiting to get on a plane,\n\n563\n00:26:01.411 --> 00:26:03.153\nor somewhere while he's out and about.\n\n564\n00:26:03.153 --> 00:26:07.213\nAnd starts chatting with him about hey,\nwhat's ITProTV and what does that do and,\n\n565\n00:26:07.213 --> 00:26:10.524\nwow you guys provide online training and\nonline, that's so cool.\n\n566\n00:26:10.524 --> 00:26:11.250\nHow do you guys do that?\n\n567\n00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.852\nWhat kind of technology do you use?\n\n568\n00:26:12.852 --> 00:26:17.013\nMaybe they're a competitor, maybe they're\nlooking to get information about ITProTV\n\n569\n00:26:17.013 --> 00:26:20.948\nworks and without realizing it maybe Mike\njust was sharing that through just having\n\n570\n00:26:20.948 --> 00:26:23.665\nconversation innocently may\ngive them some advantage.\n\n571\n00:26:23.665 --> 00:26:26.660\nIt may not even be security,\nit may just be competitive information in\n\n572\n00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.896\nthe marketplace that\nsomebody's trying to steal or\n\n573\n00:26:28.896 --> 00:26:31.340\nlisten from us to gain advantage that way.\n\n574\n00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:35.764\nSo security thought processes are so\nimportant because something\n\n575\n00:26:35.764 --> 00:26:39.881\nlike social engineering can happen for\na variety of reasons.\n\n576\n00:26:39.881 --> 00:26:43.447\nAnd if we focus on awareness and focus on\ntraining, we can educate our people to try\n\n577\n00:26:43.447 --> 00:26:46.031\nto hopefully, be a little bit\nmore aware of those things and\n\n578\n00:26:46.031 --> 00:26:48.840\nprevent them from falling prey\nto it when it does occur.\n\n579\n00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.510\nThings like software forensics and\nsandboxing, also very important for\n\n580\n00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:56.240\nus to think about and to be aware of,\nmaking sure we can analyze information,\n\n581\n00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.990\nlike the dynamic information in RAM,\nin memory.\n\n582\n00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:03.610\nMaking sure we can gather that if we have\na problem, sandboxing to virtually isolate\n\n583\n00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.135\ninformation that's running in a memory\nbubble so we can prevent the system\n\n584\n00:27:07.135 --> 00:27:11.135\nfrom being further compromised while\nwe're examining what's going on with it.\n\n585\n00:27:11.135 --> 00:27:12.725\nThe use of virtual technology for\ninstance.\n\n586\n00:27:12.725 --> 00:27:14.465\nVirtualization good example of this.\n\n587\n00:27:14.465 --> 00:27:16.045\nProvides a protective bubble or\n\n588\n00:27:16.045 --> 00:27:19.777\ncocoon around the system that will isolate\nit and that's something else to consider.\n\n589\n00:27:19.777 --> 00:27:21.957\nWe have to think about\nconfiguration management here,\n\n590\n00:27:21.957 --> 00:27:25.307\nas well, and understand the importance and\nthe impact of configuration management.\n\n591\n00:27:25.307 --> 00:27:27.217\nWe talked a lot about change management,\nbut\n\n592\n00:27:27.217 --> 00:27:29.347\nconfiguration management\nis also important.\n\n593\n00:27:29.347 --> 00:27:33.017\nKeeping track of those baselines,\nunderstanding what the expected norm,\n\n594\n00:27:33.017 --> 00:27:36.117\nwhatever that may be defined as,\nis gonna be for a system.\n\n595\n00:27:36.117 --> 00:27:37.697\nAnd then operating accordingly.\n\n596\n00:27:37.697 --> 00:27:41.710\nAnd then not only doing that, but\nalso doing continuous monitoring and\n\n597\n00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:45.900\ndoing compliance validation to verify\nwhether that baseline is indeed in play.\n\n598\n00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.430\nIs it still the expected\nnorm that we are seeing?\n\n599\n00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:51.090\nOr has the system configuration\nchanged in some way?\n\n600\n00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:54.950\nIf it has, integrity may now be an issue,\nconfidentiality may be an issue,\n\n601\n00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.740\navailability may be an issue,\nand we may have a problem.\n\n602\n00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:59.490\nAnd we have to monitor for that.\n\n603\n00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:03.460\nWe have to access that on an ongoing basis\nto ensure that changes are not happening\n\n604\n00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:06.370\nwithout our knowledge and\nmost importantly without our permission.\n\n605\n00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.530\nSo these are things to consider as well.\n\n606\n00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.610\nSo we have to be thinking about all these\nthings as we look at how we're gonna safe\n\n607\n00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.090\nguard and protect the system.\n\n608\n00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.748\nIt's gonna be very important for\nus to have a complete picture.\n\n609\n00:28:15.748 --> 00:28:19.640\nNot just of the software, not just of\nsecure development of the software,\n\n610\n00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.900\nnot just the hardware, not just\nimplementation of the hardware, but\n\n611\n00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.710\nall the things that go with that\nplus the policies, the procedures,\n\n612\n00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:30.100\nthe expectations, the awareness,\nand the implementation.\n\n613\n00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.210\nThe TCB, the trust the computing base,\nthe reference monitor, memory management,\n\n614\n00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.370\nall of this stuff becomes very\nimportant as we look at and\n\n615\n00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:38.400\nthink through the logic of this.\n\n616\n00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.020\n>> Very good Adam.\n\n617\n00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.540\nAgain another great episode,\na lot of information there.\n\n618\n00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.590\nWe started off with a look\nat some malware and\n\n619\n00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:48.080\nthen rehashing the different types of\nmalware that we have to deal with.\n\n620\n00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.925\nWent through some blasts from the past,\nthings that are still there like IRQs that\n\n621\n00:28:51.925 --> 00:28:55.838\nwe might not think about anymore because\nour operating systems deal with it for us.\n\n622\n00:28:55.838 --> 00:28:56.984\nBut very important for\n\n623\n00:28:56.984 --> 00:29:01.270\nus to at least to understand what's going\non under that hood, so we can validate it.\n\n624\n00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:04.930\nMake sure that it is being done\nsecurely or if we have an

--> 00:00:16.960\nI'm your host, Mike Rodrick.\n\n4\n00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.200\nToday we're doing our CISSP content.\n\n5\n00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.432\nAnd specifically we're gonna continue our\nlook at software development security.\n\n6\n00:00:24.432 --> 00:00:27.400\nAnd in this episode we're gonna\ntake you to that next step.\n\n7\n00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.649\nWe've learned about the different\nsoftware development models,\n\n8\n00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.622\nwe've talked about implementing\nsecurity early and often.\n\n9\n00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:36.954\nAdam's taught us a lot of things about\nhow to make sure we're developing that\n\n10\n00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:37.884\nsoftware security.\n\n11\n00:00:37.884 --> 00:00:40.530\nWe've talked about malware as well.\n\n12\n00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.090\nNow we want to take a look at\nthe effectiveness of software security.\n\n13\n00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.350\nAnd here to help us with\nthat is Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n14\n00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.460\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n15\n00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.070\n>> Good, good so, let's talk a bit\nabout assessment, effectiveness,\n\n16\n00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.780\nsoftware security,\n\n17\n00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.340\nall things that Mike just kind of\nintroduced his thought processes for us.\n\n18\n00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.500\nWhen we are thinking about how to decide,\nright, whether or\n\n19\n00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.230\nnot something is working,\nwe have to have a couple of things.\n\n20\n00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.730\nWe have to have a baseline for what we\nassume would logically equal success.\n\n21\n00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.293\nWe have to have a way to measure where\nwe are currently at the present moment,\n\n22\n00:01:10.293 --> 00:01:13.594\nwhere we would like to go in the process\nto get us from point A to point B.\n\n23\n00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:16.507\nAnd we have to then\nunderstand unequivocally and\n\n24\n00:01:16.507 --> 00:01:19.491\nthrough a relatively\nstraightforward process,\n\n25\n00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:22.770\nwhat the definition or\nthe bar for success will equal.\n\n26\n00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.312\nAnd when we think about assessment,\nwe have to think about all these things.\n\n27\n00:01:25.312 --> 00:01:28.385\nAnd so when we think about\nassessing software security,\n\n28\n00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:31.660\nwe have to understand what\nthe current state of security is.\n\n29\n00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.890\nWe have to define what security may be,\nor what it will not be.\n\n30\n00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.610\nWe have to then understand whether or\nnot we meet that definitely currently.\n\n31\n00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.340\nIf we do, we have to figure out\nhow to quantify and measure that.\n\n32\n00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.322\nIf we don't,\nwe have to figure out where the gaps are.\n\n33\n00:01:43.322 --> 00:01:46.370\nAnd then we have to decide\nwhat success will look like.\n\n34\n00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.593\nIt could look like what we do today,\nit may look like something very different,\n\n35\n00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:53.190\nit may look like a combination\nof the two things.\n\n36\n00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.965\nAnd then, based on understanding\nthose things, we then have to define,\n\n37\n00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:00.506\ndocument, and declare what our as is,\n\n38\n00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:04.213\nwhat our progression from as\nis into the to be looks like.\n\n39\n00:02:04.213 --> 00:02:08.180\nWhat to be equals, our desired state,\nwhat success equals.\n\n40\n00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.729\nAnd then we have to come up with a plan\nto measure that, not only in the current\n\n41\n00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:15.455\nstate in the present moment, but\ncontinuously to assess compliance ongoing.\n\n42\n00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:19.328\nAnd then understand from the baseline\nperspective if we do deviate what our,\n\n43\n00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:23.650\nnot only compliance issue will be, but\nalso what our mitigation solution will be.\n\n44\n00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.970\nHow do we then impact that\nmitigation is used or\n\n45\n00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.780\nthe concept of mitigation will\nbe used to impact positively\n\n46\n00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.550\nthe changes we see to bring them\nback into alignment in effect.\n\n47\n00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.740\nAnd how to we impact that change,\nthat drift or delta in such a way\n\n48\n00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.590\nthrough gap analysis, and ultimately\nthrough remediation, that we can address\n\n49\n00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.540\nwhatever deviations we find and bring our\nsystem or systems back into compliance.\n\n50\n00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.460\nThis is the process we have to think\nabout and go through, ultimately.\n\n51\n00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.610\nOne of the most important things we can\ndo along the way is understand, and\n\n52\n00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.370\nwe've talked a lot about this in prior\nconversations, understand, assess,\n\n53\n00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.630\nand ultimately define what risk is and\nwhat risk equals within the organization.\n\n54\n00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.501\nOne of the great tools we have\nto think about doing that would\n\n55\n00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:04.234\nbe the Risk Management Framework.\n\n56\n00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:06.923\nNIST 800 or in NIST SP 800-37 r1 is gonna\n\n57\n00:03:06.923 --> 00:03:10.061\nbe the current version of\nthe Risk Management Framework,\n\n58\n00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:13.340\nor at least the guidance around\nRisk Management Framework.\n\n59\n00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.270\nRisk Management Framework,\none form or another,\n\n60\n00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.770\nhas been around for\nprobably over a decade now.\n\n61\n00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.400\nBut the idea is that we wanna be\nthinking about the thought processes\n\n62\n00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.380\nassociated with risk identification.\n\n63\n00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.143\nRemember, we talked about threat actors,\nwe talked about threat,\n\n64\n00:03:26.143 --> 00:03:27.740\nwe talked about vulnerability.\n\n65\n00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.420\nWe talked the availability to\nexploit that vulnerability.\n\n66\n00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.130\nAnd then, ultimately,\n\n67\n00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.200\nwhat all that equals or culminates in\nis the idea of identification of risk,\n\n68\n00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.610\nmanagement of risk, and the measurement\nof risk in relation to the business.\n\n69\n00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.700\nThe exposure factor and the impact and\nthe liability we have as a result of that.\n\n70\n00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.750\nSo, the Risk Management Framework\ncomes to mind here,\n\n71\n00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.030\nsomething we wanna remind ourselves of,\nbe aware of think about.\n\n72\n00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.510\nWith CISSPs it's always very\nimportant think about risk.\n\n73\n00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.057\nSo I share to you a little practical\nstory that happened to me just\n\n74\n00:03:56.057 --> 00:03:59.188\nearlier today that I was asking Mike\nabout, he helped me to resolve the issue.\n\n75\n00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:03.280\nAnd it really kinda just, at a baseline\nlevel, demonstrates the potentiality for\n\n76\n00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.440\nrisk and the exposure associated\nwith risk or liability.\n\n77\n00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.000\nSo, as many of us do, my car has a remote\ncontrol option, remote key entry option.\n\n78\n00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.800\nAnd so, I've used that remote\nprobably several times a day for\n\n79\n00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.120\nthe last three and a half years since\nI bought that car, with no trouble.\n\n80\n00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.670\nGot it from the dealer,\neverything was fine.\n\n81\n00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.320\nClick a button, boom, door opens.\n\n82\n00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.830\nClick a button, boom, door closes.\n\n83\n00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.260\nOccasionally click the wrong button,\n\n84\n00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.000\nboom, alarm goes off,\nyou don't want that to happen too often.\n\n85\n00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.180\nBut I'm the first one to admit I'm one of\nthose people that sets it off on occasion\n\n86\n00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.980\nby accident.\n\n87\n00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.290\nSo I go to do that this morning,\n\n88\n00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.670\nnot set off the alarm, that was not\nwhat I wanted to do this morning.\n\n89\n00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.030\nBut to open and\nthen ultimately close the door.\n\n90\n00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.014\nAnd so\nI pull up here at the ITProTV studios,\n\n91\n00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:44.783\nthe palatial place that ITProTV-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n92\n00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:45.712\n>> And the studios are.\n\n93\n00:04:45.712 --> 00:04:47.859\nAnd the valet driver was\nnot here this morning,\n\n94\n00:04:47.859 --> 00:04:51.517\nwasn't available to park my car for me,\nhave to about that, by the way, right-\n\n95\n00:04:51.517 --> 00:04:52.770\n>> He took an extended vacation.\n\n96\n00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.860\n>> Took an extended vacation, so\n\n97\n00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.880\nI had to park my own car this morning\nwhen I pulled up here at ITProTV.\n\n98\n00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.743\nAnd so I went ahead, parked the car,\nand went to lock it.\n\n99\n00:04:59.743 --> 00:05:03.000\nAnd I went to use the remote, and\nremote's dead, it's not working.\n\n100\n00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.130\nAnd I'm pressing of course, you know,\ncuz you stand there dumbstruck, right?\n\n101\n00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.050\nIt's like you pick up the phone,\nthere's no dial tone, you're like, what?\n\n102\n00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.980\nNo dial tone.\n\n103\n00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.800\nSo I'm going like this, it's not working.\n\n104\n00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.860\nFinally, being the intelligent,\nsmart human being that I am,\n\n105\n00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.170\nI eliminate the obvious.\n\n106\n00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.880\nBecause I banged it on my\nhand to make sure it's not\n\n107\n00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.460\nthat the gremlins inside aren't awake and\nmoving.\n\n108\n00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.290\nWe do the stupidest things sometimes.\n\n109\n00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.500\nAnd so ultimately I finally figured out\nthrough process of elimination, fine,\n\n110\n00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.810\nscientific method right,\neliminate the obvious things.\n\n111\n00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.150\nIt must be the battery, it's not working.\n\n112\n00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.151\nSo, I figured that out,\nI come inside, we do our shows and\n\n113\n00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:36.310\nour episodes this morning, no problem.\n\n114\n00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.753\nAnd I say at some point to Mike, hey,\n\n115\n00:05:37.753 --> 00:05:40.142\ngotta get a battery to replace\nthe battery that's in there.\n\n116\n00:05:40.142 --> 00:05:43.473\nHe says oh well go down, so and so,\ngo down this area, there is a place,\n\n117\n00:05:43.473 --> 00:05:44.210\nget a battery.\n\n118\n00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.500\nSo, when I did all that.\n\n119\n00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.490\nCame back, took care of it, it's fine.\n\n120\n00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.826\nAnd by the way,\nvalet parker's still not outside.\n\n121\n00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:50.169\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just thought I'd mention that,\n\n122\n00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.030\nwas not here when I came\nback from lunch either.\n\n123\n00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.315\nSo had to park my own car again.\n\n124\n00:05:53.315 --> 00:05:55.450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just saying, I'm talent here, you know,\n\n125\n00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.100\nI was expecting a little bit more,\nthat's all.\n\n126\n00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.250\nI'm suggesting, nothing really big deal,\nbut you might wanna take a note.\n\n127\n00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.670\nJust think about that for the next time.\n\n128\n00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.770\nSo I park my own car,\nand it worked just fine.\n\n129\n00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.810\nSo that's not the risk part.\n\n130\n00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:05.970\nThe risk part was, hey, you know what,\n\n131\n00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.290\nif the battery failed,\ndid I have a spare battery with me?\n\n132\n00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.780\nThe answer is clearly no, or I wouldn't\nhave a funny story to talk about with you.\n\n133\n00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.230\nBut because I didn't assess the risk,\nthe likelihood of the battery failing,\n\n134\n00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.360\nit's been working for\nover three years, no problem.\n\n135\n00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.650\nWhat's the likelihood that thing's\ngonna fail, and randomly fail today?\n\n136\n00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.810\nWell, obviously pretty\ngood because it did.\n\n137\n00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.610\nBut did I assess that,\nwas I concerned about that?\n\n138\n00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.260\nIn the grand scheme of things, not really,\ncuz I could have just used the key as I\n\n139\n00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.430\ndid this morning to lock\nthe car with no trouble.\n\n140\n00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.740\nHowever, as with all good things, I found\nout something new as a feature on my car I\n\n141\n00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.620\ndid not realize that my car\ndid until this happened.\n\n142\n00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.740\nSo in all the years I've had the car,\nnever had the battery on the remote fail.\n\n143\n00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.210\nSo when it failed this morning, being,\nas I said, the idiot that I am,\n\n144\n00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.490\nI'm sitting there trying to do\nthis to press, it's not working.\n\n145\n00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.349\nSo I go to open the door to see\nif the door is locked or not.\n\n146\n00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:52.416\nAnd the thing starts, the thing,\nthe car, let me be technical.\n\n147\n00:06:52.416 --> 00:06:54.147\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> The thing with wheels,\n\n148\n00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:56.440\nyou know the thing that you drive,\nyou go down the road and moves.\n\n149\n00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.660\nSo the car starts beeping at me,\nor pinging, the, hey,\n\n150\n00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.070\nthe door's open light comes on on\nthe dash, but it normally never pings.\n\n151\n00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.123\nYou know that annoying,\nhey your seatbelt's not on.\n\n152\n00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:05.053\n>> Yeah, ding ding, yeah.\n\n153\n00:07:05.053 --> 00:07:06.570\n>> Same kinda thing, ding ding ding.\n\n154\n00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.890\nSo it's doing that and\nthe light's flashing on the dash,\n\n155\n00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:09.980\nit's one of the warnings.\n\n156\n00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.390\nAnd so I close the door and I lock it\nwith the key, double check and it's fine.\n\n157\n00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.230\nAnd so I get in, and being the person\nthat I am, I don't take the current\n\n158\n00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.550\nstatus quo to be the status quo and\nI don't take well enough as being good.\n\n159\n00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.520\nSo I go out today before I\ngo to replace the battery.\n\n160\n00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.992\nI'm thinking, well,\nit's been two hours, right, it'll work.\n\n161\n00:07:25.992 --> 00:07:28.160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So I try it again.\n\n162\n00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.425\nDoesn't work, that battery's totally dead,\nbut I did that.\n\n163\n00:07:31.425 --> 00:07:34.525\nOpen the door, it's pinging me again,\nthis has never happened in three and\n\n164\n00:07:34.525 --> 00:07:36.055\na half,\nalmost four years I've owned the car.\n\n165\n00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:38.495\nAnd so once I got the battery in and\nI got it fixed and I did that,\n\n166\n00:07:38.495 --> 00:07:42.485\nI figured out that not just the light\ncoming on, so the light comes on when\n\n167\n00:07:42.485 --> 00:07:45.635\nyou open the door when you're in trouble,\nbut it doesn't ping.\n\n168\n00:07:45.635 --> 00:07:46.601\nI figured out that's a feature,\n\n169\n00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:48.719\nthat's a warning sign that tells you\nthe battery's dead in the remote.\n\n170\n00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:49.601\n>> Really?\nInteresting.\n\n171\n00:07:49.601 --> 00:07:50.437\n>> Which I did not know.\n>> That's good to know.\n\n172\n00:07:50.437 --> 00:07:52.175\n>> Which, had I read the owner's manual,\nit's only about this big.\n\n173\n00:07:52.175 --> 00:07:53.123\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Had I read it,\n\n174\n00:07:53.123 --> 00:07:54.757\nit would've told me that,\nI would've known, and\n\n175\n00:07:54.757 --> 00:07:55.860\nit wouldn't have been a problem.\n\n176\n00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.514\nSo you see, the dealership, or the dealer\nrather, had clearly dealt with, and\n\n177\n00:07:59.514 --> 00:08:02.951\nthe manufacturer, the risk, and had come\nup with a way to alert me to the risk\n\n178\n00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:06.850\nthat the battery was indeed not working,\nor the remote itself had stopped working.\n\n179\n00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:10.920\nBut I, being clueless and not being\neducated, hence the reason we often talk\n\n180\n00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.720\nabout training and\nawareness as being so critical.\n\n181\n00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.460\nFor the CISSP, I did not pay attention.\n\n182\n00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.090\nI was not educated,\nI did not take the opportunity to do that.\n\n183\n00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.390\nI did not mitigate the risk successfully.\n\n184\n00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.350\nThe dealer did on my behalf,\nthe manufacturer did.\n\n185\n00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.950\nI was not aware so\nin effect they did the right thing.\n\n186\n00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.530\nI screwed up, I did not do the right\nthing by paying attention.\n\n187\n00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.350\nBut ultimately I learned something new and\nvaluable.\n\n188\n00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.570\nSo in the now new life cycle of the car\nif I ever live to have this car long\n\n189\n00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.440\nenough that that happens again,\nI'm prepared.\n\n190\n00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.000\nI will know when the thing starts pinging,\nmy remote is dead.\n\n191\n00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.610\nSo I do that, I'm gonna go home and\ntake the battery out and\n\n192\n00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.580\ntry to get my wife involved in this,\nsee if she can figure this out and\n\n193\n00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.215\nsee how that goes when we get done.\n\n194\n00:08:46.215 --> 00:08:49.280\nSo the idea behind risk mitigation and\nrisk awareness and\n\n195\n00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.180\nrisk management is obviously,\nclearly if the impact is high,\n\n196\n00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.780\nI would've bothered to take the steps\nto figure out what was going on.\n\n197\n00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.920\nThe loss of the remote, not a big deal, I\nhave a key, I can operate the car with or\n\n198\n00:08:58.920 --> 00:08:59.700\nwithout it.\n\n199\n00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.340\nIt's a convenience issue, but\nit's not an operational safety issue.\n\n200\n00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.120\nIt's not a concern issue, not like\nsomebody's gonna come along and steal\n\n201\n00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.710\nthe car, right, because I could still lock\nit, at least not for that reason anyway.\n\n202\n00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.570\nSo the risk is relatively low,\nand when we think about risk and\n\n203\n00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.590\nrisk management we have to classify risks,\nright?\n\n204\n00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:20.870\nYour high value risks, high impact,\nhigh exposure, high vulnerability\n\n205\n00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:23.980\nare gonna be risks that we really want to\nassist you with and be concerned about.\n\n206\n00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.360\nLow impact, low vulnerability, low concern\nrisks are risks we wanna be aware of.\n\n207\n00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.000\nWe wanna take note of them like I did,\n\n208\n00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.090\nI knew in theory in the back of my mind\nthe battery could potentially fail and\n\n209\n00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.870\nindeed it did, but\nI really wasn't concerned about it, right?\n\n210\n00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.580\nBecause ultimately you get it fixed,\nit's not a big deal.\n\n211\n00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.045\nSo risks are not all the same,\nis the point of the story, right?\n\n212\n00:09:42.045 --> 00:09:45.510\nRound-about way to get there, but\nnot all risks are equally impactful,\n\n213\n00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.610\nnot all risks are equally important and\nnot all risks should be taken seriously,\n\n214\n00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.300\nto the point we have to worry\nabout mitigating them and\n\n215\n00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.490\ndealing with them and\nhaving a solution on hand.\n\n216\n00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.620\nI should not, in other words,\n\n217\n00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:59.100\ncarry around a spare battery with me every\nwhere I go on the assumption that at some\n\n218\n00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.810\npoint the battery's gonna fail, because\nwhat would probably have happened is\n\n219\n00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.460\nthe spare battery would have failed over\nthe three years that I kept in the car if\n\n220\n00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.210\nyou don't keep it in the car it's not\ngonna be available when you need it.\n\n221\n00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.575\nIf you're one of those people\nright you have the battery?\n\n222\n00:10:10.575 --> 00:10:12.220\nOh, yeah I'm good and\nthen you go and open and\n\n223\n00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:16.390\nthe battery's dead along with the remote\nthen you obviously are unfortunately,\n\n224\n00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:17.960\nyou thought you were prepare but\nyou're not.\n\n225\n00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.210\nSo the reality is you now\nwe have to assess risk,\n\n226\n00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.540\nwhat the risk management framework helps\nus to do is really understand how to not\n\n227\n00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:29.080\njust assess risk once but through dynamic\non going process which is very important.\n\n228\n00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.460\nContinuously assess risk and\n\n229\n00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.610\nunderstand the impact of risk throughout\nthe life cycle of the system,\n\n230\n00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.440\nthe service, whatever it is we may be\nassessing throughout the organization,\n\n231\n00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.650\nacross the entire organization\nholistically, what that impact is.\n\n232\n00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:42.360\nSo, we want to be thinking about that.\n\n233\n00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.320\nObviously, keeping an eye on those things,\n\n234\n00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.490\ncontinuing to be connected to them\nbecomes very, very important.\n\n235\n00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.250\nWe have to audit, and we have to log,\nin order to assess risk, and\n\n236\n00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:53.540\nwe have to bring change management back\ninto the equation to deal with risk, and\n\n237\n00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.430\nwe've talked about these linkages before.\n\n238\n00:10:55.430 --> 00:11:00.690\nAuditing and logging helps us to create a\npaper trail, effectively create a forensic\n\n239\n00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.940\nsolution that we can examine and go back\nto over time, if necessary or if need be,\n\n240\n00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.770\nin order to figure out what was going\non in a certain moment in time or\n\n241\n00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.210\nperhaps through a series of events,\nunravel something that did occur.\n\n242\n00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.230\nSo auditing and logging become very\nimportant parts of risk management,\n\n243\n00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:15.520\nwant to be thinking about that.\n\n244\n00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.510\nWe know that logs are gonna affect records\nof all the activates that are taking place\n\n245\n00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.930\ninside of a system or throughout multiple\nsystems so we have different logs for\n\n246\n00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.130\ndifferent reasons.\n\n247\n00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.190\nWanna have the ability to be\nable to monitor that centrally.\n\n248\n00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.730\nTalked about the use of a SIEM system,\nsecurity information event management in\n\n249\n00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:35.430\norder to be able to essentially aggregate\nlogs, bring them together, do analysis on\n\n250\n00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.610\nthem, bring data visualization techniques\nto bear, things of that nature, centrally\n\n251\n00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.940\nstore and manage and archive logs for\nthe express purpose of risk management.\n\n252\n00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.540\nAnd so this kind of a thought process from\na CISSP's prospective becomes important.\n\n253\n00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:52.930\nYou'll ask yourselves as we're going\nthrough this with you, how well today,\n\n254\n00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.420\ncurrently, in your job, in your world,\noutside of the environment we're talking\n\n255\n00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.860\nabout here, but in the real world, how\nwell do you, how well does your company,\n\n256\n00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.240\nhow well does the organization you\nrepresent work for and or work through?\n\n257\n00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.720\nHow well do they do logging today?\n\n258\n00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.190\nHow well do they do auditing?\n\n259\n00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.880\nHow well do they manage change?\n\n260\n00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:10.770\nHow well do they manage configuration?\n\n261\n00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:15.270\nHow well do they assess and therefore,\nultimately, understand and manage risk?\n\n262\n00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.800\nIf these answers are not forthcoming\nquickly, If you're not able to say\n\n263\n00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.340\nunequivocally, oh yeah,\nwe're very good at log management.\n\n264\n00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.070\nWe've got this, this, and this going on.\n\n265\n00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.450\nWe have a retention\nperiod clearly defined.\n\n266\n00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.890\nWe have a central management solution for\nlogging.\n\n267\n00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.230\nWe have data classification\napplied to that.\n\n268\n00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.210\nWe have the ability to be able to\nnot only classify our data, but\n\n269\n00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:37.440\nto do deep packet, deep inspection\nanalysis on logs and data streams.\n\n270\n00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.883\nWe can capture them in real time, archive\nthem and hold them for a period of time.\n\n271\n00:12:40.883 --> 00:12:46.220\nWe tie DLP, IRM and new discovery systems\ninto our log management solution.\n\n272\n00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:51.820\nWe have policies as well as procedures\nas well as processes all detailed,\n\n273\n00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.650\nreported on, communicated effectively\nup and down the organization.\n\n274\n00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.400\nAnd we audit against that randomly to\ncheck validity and to check current state.\n\n275\n00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.820\nIf you're not able to talk through that\nsolution and hit all the check boxes I\n\n276\n00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:10.590\njust very quickly ranted through in 30 or\n40 seconds and say yes to all of that.\n\n277\n00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.030\nThat's not a good or a bad thing,\nit just means that there's room for\n\n278\n00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.830\nimprovement, right?\n\n279\n00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:17.720\nAnd the idea is ultimately, this is not\nabout, hey, you guys suck and, wow,\n\n280\n00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.320\nthese guys are doing so much better.\n\n281\n00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.050\nIt's about what are you doing today.\n\n282\n00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.050\nHow good is the current state,\nin other words.\n\n283\n00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:24.170\nCan we make it better?\n\n284\n00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:26.360\nChances are probably yes, but not always.\n\n285\n00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.680\nAnd so, if we can make it better, great.\n\n286\n00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.940\nIf we can't, okay.\n\n287\n00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.720\nMaybe it's as good as it's gonna get.\n\n288\n00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.300\nAs a CISSP, we have to understand\nwhat the current state of affairs is.\n\n289\n00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.550\nGood, bad or ugly.\n\n290\n00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.460\nWe have to be brutally honest about it and\n\n291\n00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.090\nwe then have to figure\nout if there is a path.\n\n292\n00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:44.620\nA way forward to make that better either\nincrementally or over time, you know,\n\n293\n00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.120\nby changing out one or\nmore aspects of the system.\n\n294\n00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:51.410\nBut we have to do so throughout the\nconversation with the business by showing\n\n295\n00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.845\nand ultimately convincing\nthe organization,\n\n296\n00:13:53.845 --> 00:13:57.860\nstakeholders to customers,\nthat risks exists, documenting it.\n\n297\n00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.460\nClearly identifying it, and then coming\nup with a plan, a solution, a way forward\n\n298\n00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:05.980\nif you will, that is value positive,\nthat creates value by changing and\n\n299\n00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.050\nmodifying and ultimately mitigating\nrisk into something that can be managed.\n\n300\n00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.620\nAnd this is really what CISSPs\nare supposed to do everyday.\n\n301\n00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:15.292\nRemember, due care and due diligence,\nwe've talked a lot about this.\n\n302\n00:14:15.292 --> 00:14:19.070\nTalked about the importance to focus and\nthe reasons why this is so critical.\n\n303\n00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.710\nIf you're not able say yes to all\nthe things we've mentioned then you've got\n\n304\n00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.010\nsome work cut out for you.\n\n305\n00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.230\nYou're business is gonna\nhave a need even more so.\n\n306\n00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.310\nProbably than they did before our\nconversations for guidance and for\n\n307\n00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:32.930\nclear and articulate policy, procedure,\nand process to be implemented and\n\n308\n00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.110\nmanaged in order to achieve the end\nresult that you're looking for.\n\n309\n00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:41.000\nThis is the value you can add to CISSP\nthis is ultimately why being the CISSP\n\n310\n00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.800\ncan be so tremendously impactful to\nthe organizations that you work with and\n\n311\n00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.610\nrepresent.\n\n312\n00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.200\nAnd if there isn't that opportunity, it\ncan certainly be one that you create for\n\n313\n00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.250\nyourself and, by extension, for\nthe business by bringing those best\n\n314\n00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.330\npractices to bear and\nthen focusing the business on risk.\n\n315\n00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.740\nAnd this is one of the key most important\naspects of what CISSPs are able to do.\n\n316\n00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.560\nRemember auditing,\nremember log management.\n\n317\n00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.980\nWhat about patch management?\n\n318\n00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.320\nWhat about configuration management?\n\n319\n00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.120\nWhat about baseline, baselines and\nor configuration management?\n\n320\n00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.760\nWhat about continuous monitoring?\n\n321\n00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.615\nAny and\nall of these things become important.\n\n322\n00:15:11.615 --> 00:15:13.690\nWhere to be thinking about them.\n\n323\n00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.960\nThe value of change control,\nthe value of configuration management.\n\n324\n00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.190\nThese are underlying assumptions.\n\n325\n00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.960\nThese are, in effect, givens that we have\nto assume are gonna be in the business,\n\n326\n00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.550\nand if we don't find them there,\n\n327\n00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.640\nwe have to take steps immediately to\nfigure out how to implement them.\n\n328\n00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.090\nI deal with many, many customers.\n\n329\n00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.770\nI deal with many businesses,\nnot just in the United States, but\n\n330\n00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:33.980\nglobally, on a regular basis.\n\n331\n00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.650\nAlmost without exception,\nit's hard to say 100%, but\n\n332\n00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.870\nalmost without exception, every one\nof my customers has an understanding\n\n333\n00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:44.210\nof the things we've been talking about,\nknows the importance of them.\n\n334\n00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:48.312\nIdentifies the fact that these are\ncritical elements to success in terms of\n\n335\n00:15:48.312 --> 00:15:49.951\nsecuring the organization.\n\n336\n00:15:49.951 --> 00:15:52.473\nBut, like many of us,\nis not 100% aligned or\n\n337\n00:15:52.473 --> 00:15:56.225\nare not 100% aligned with every one\nof those things and is not doing or\n\n338\n00:15:56.225 --> 00:15:59.990\nare not doing any or all of them\non a regular basis consistently.\n\n339\n00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:01.968\nAnd this is where we find ourselves.\n\n340\n00:16:01.968 --> 00:16:06.230\nThis is one of the reasons why\nthe continued skyrocketing growth and\n\n341\n00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:10.268\nthe need for security professionals\nseems to be unrestrained,\n\n342\n00:16:10.268 --> 00:16:12.678\neven going into this year and beyond.\n\n343\n00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:15.646\nWe project for the next several,\nprobably five to ten years at least,\n\n344\n00:16:15.646 --> 00:16:19.067\nthat security professionals, in terms of\nthe need for them in the organizations\n\n345\n00:16:19.067 --> 00:16:22.310\nthat we represent and manage and\nwork for, is gonna continue to grow.\n\n346\n00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.800\nBecause the complexity and the needs\nof the organization vis-a-vis and\n\n347\n00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.430\nwith regards to, that's another cool word,\nby the way, vis-a-vis.\n\n348\n00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:29.460\nIt's very cool to say.\n\n349\n00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:31.025\nIt's also really good spell.\n\n350\n00:16:31.025 --> 00:16:32.250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You get the little\n\n351\n00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:33.550\nano at the top there, right?\n\n352\n00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.800\nNot the ano, but the little,\n\n353\n00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.910\nwhatever the French equivalent of the ano\nis, a little apostrophe or whatever it is.\n\n354\n00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:41.470\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So with regards to that, with cloud,\n\n355\n00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:44.000\nwith virtualization,\nwith the Internet of Things,\n\n356\n00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.620\nwith the idea of being able to have\nconvergence and converged systems.\n\n357\n00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:54.150\nI was reading right before we started\nup again for finishing the CISSP\n\n358\n00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:58.110\nmaterial bringing you the new episodes\nwe're doing now and are finishing up with.\n\n359\n00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.860\nI was reading some stuff\non the Internet of Things,\n\n360\n00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.510\njust catching up on some stuff\nI hadn't been able to get to\n\n361\n00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.190\nwhile we were filming and\njust continuing my thought process.\n\n362\n00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:08.580\nI do a lot work with cloud,\ncloud security, things of that nature.\n\n363\n00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.110\nAnd I was actually writing an article,\nit's gonna be published probably in\n\n364\n00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:14.900\nthe next couple of months for one of\nthe magazines that I do some work for\n\n365\n00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.780\non occasion with regard to cloud security.\n\n366\n00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.430\nAnd so I was just doing some research,\nand I was reading up on the Internet of\n\n367\n00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.360\nThings, and this idea of converged systems\nand all the things they represent, and\n\n368\n00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:27.150\none of the catchy bylines that people were\nusing to represent the Internet of Things\n\n369\n00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.469\nrecently is the Internet\nof Insecure Things, right?\n\n370\n00:17:29.469 --> 00:17:31.690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because reality is, and\n\n371\n00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.110\nthis past year especially has\nshown that the reality is that,\n\n372\n00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.720\nwhile we still have made tremendous\nstrides, there's a huge amount\n\n373\n00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:42.160\nof work to do, and there's a huge\namount of unsecured and uncontrolled\n\n374\n00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.510\ninfrastructure that's being connected to\nthe cloud, either directly or indirectly.\n\n375\n00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.370\nAnd this represents a significant concern,\nnot just for individuals with their\n\n376\n00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:53.222\nsmart devices and their, God help me, I'll\nsay it again, apps that I love, right?\n\n377\n00:17:53.222 --> 00:17:54.280\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n378\n00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.630\nall the other things that we do as well.\n\n379\n00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:01.510\nI mean IP enabling and IP connecting\nup to the cloud, the toaster oven,\n\n380\n00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:06.100\nthe home thermostat, the air conditioning\nor HVAC systems in buildings,\n\n381\n00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.400\nthe monitoring systems for fire safety,\nand for elevators and all that stuff.\n\n382\n00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.650\nA lot of that is great,\nvery important all kidding aside, and\n\n383\n00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:17.190\nit's super critical to be able to do\nthese things to ensure life safety and\n\n384\n00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:19.180\nto be able to do the things we need to do.\n\n385\n00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.050\nBut the downside to that\nis that everybody else that\n\n386\n00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:25.680\nhas no business seeing that information\nis potentially exposed to it if we're not\n\n387\n00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.490\nreally smart about what we do.\n\n388\n00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.160\nAnd it's the job of the CISSP to be smart.\n\n389\n00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.770\nIt's the job of the CISSP to consider and\nto act\n\n390\n00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:41.940\nin a considered way with regards\nto these kinds of systems.\n\n391\n00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.330\nIt's easy say, oh yeah,\nlet's just do that, let's hook that up.\n\n392\n00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:46.410\nIt's not so easy to say,\nlet's do that, but\n\n393\n00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.760\nlet's be risk adverse, let's be risk\naware while we're doing those things.\n\n394\n00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.400\nWhat I often see is a rush to\nfunctionality, a rush to enablement of\n\n395\n00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:59.100\nfeatures, not a rush to risk management,\nand not a rush to risk adversity.\n\n396\n00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:04.515\nBut, rather, a rush to risk awareness and\nawareness of risks.\n\n397\n00:19:04.515 --> 00:19:06.840\nYeah, we've got a risk, but\nGod I don't know what to do about so\n\n398\n00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.685\nI'm just gonna turn on and\nhope that nobody bothers me.\n\n399\n00:19:08.685 --> 00:19:09.652\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n400\n00:19:09.652 --> 00:19:11.201\n>> I mean that's really not gonna be\n\n401\n00:19:11.201 --> 00:19:12.430\na very good solution.\n\n402\n00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:16.190\nWe've talked a lot about why, over our\ntime together through many episodes.\n\n403\n00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.920\nIt's many different things,\nit's not one thing, but\n\n404\n00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.190\nyou can look for numerous examples in\nany given year across any given timeline\n\n405\n00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.160\nof why just turning something\non without fully understanding\n\n406\n00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.040\nthe impact of what that system\nrepresents is a significantly bad idea.\n\n407\n00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.710\nI've talked about several of\nthem over episodes with you.\n\n408\n00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:36.800\nThe ability to be able to hook up\ncabin-based avionics on a plane to\n\n409\n00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:41.230\nthe internet in-flight wireless system,\nand why that's a really bad idea.\n\n410\n00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:42.810\nThankfully, that's not being done anymore.\n\n411\n00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.110\nBut when it was being done,\nwhy that was such a horrendously bad idea,\n\n412\n00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.920\nand why nobody thought it was a bad idea,\n\n413\n00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.910\nis the subject of many\nongoing conversations, right?\n\n414\n00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:55.780\nWhy hooking up SCADA and ICS systems\nto the Internet can be a tremendous\n\n415\n00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.310\nvalue add for\nbusinesses that have to remotely manage.\n\n416\n00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:01.850\nBut why doing that without updating\nsecurity protocols and configuration\n\n417\n00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:05.650\nsettings to safeguard the information\non those networks is a very bad idea.\n\n418\n00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.190\nAnd there's just a laundry\nlist of these examples, right?\n\n419\n00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:12.730\nSo, thinking about these things and\nunderstanding why we do what we do, and\n\n420\n00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:16.380\ntrying to be smarter, trying to be better\nabout it, is definitely not only a good\n\n421\n00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.730\nNew Year's resolution for everybody,\nbut is generically a good idea for\n\n422\n00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.390\nanybody that's connected to system\nsecurity at any level for any reason.\n\n423\n00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:28.350\nAnd users should be the first people, not\nthe last, that challenge assumptions and\n\n424\n00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:31.810\nsay why am I doing something\nthat seems to not make sense?\n\n425\n00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.860\nIf we can get our end users to give\nus that kind of feed back as security\n\n426\n00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.400\nprofessionals, think about what\na different world it would be.\n\n427\n00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.930\nInstead of viewing users, right?\n\n428\n00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:41.250\nAnd all kidding aside cuz we often joke,\nand\n\n429\n00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:45.215\nI joke about it as much as anybody does,\nMike loves it when I make those jokes.\n\n430\n00:20:45.215 --> 00:20:46.343\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> He says to me every time we go off\n\n431\n00:20:46.343 --> 00:20:48.790\nthe air, hey, make another user joke,\nthey're so funny, right?\n\n432\n00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.500\nDo it again.\n\n433\n00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.470\nBut all kidding aside,\n\n434\n00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:54.680\nif we could turn the mindset of the\nsecurity professional away from oh my God,\n\n435\n00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.572\nusers, what a pain they are, like the bane\nof our existence, the IT10 jokes, right?\n\n436\n00:20:59.572 --> 00:21:01.520\nOr ID10T jokes, right?\n\n437\n00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.380\nGet rid of that persona and that thought\nprocess of the end user being the bane of\n\n438\n00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:08.020\nour existence as IT\nsecurity professionals, and\n\n439\n00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:09.960\ngenerically as IT professionals.\n\n440\n00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:14.530\nAnd turn them into an early warning system\nthrough security awareness training, and\n\n441\n00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:18.210\nthrough the adoption of best practices,\nand through understanding of root cause\n\n442\n00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.840\nanalysis, and why we do things,\nthe reasons why, and the way we do them.\n\n443\n00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.810\nWe can get them to be better educated.\n\n444\n00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:27.230\nThink about the fact that you now\nin theory, in a 1,000 user network,\n\n445\n00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:32.170\nwould have 1,000 pairs of eyes, ears, and\nhands acting as early warning sensors for\n\n446\n00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.090\nyou if you could achieve\nwhat I'm talking about.\n\n447\n00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.880\nEven if you got a tenth of the way there,\nif you got 100 of those people to\n\n448\n00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.740\nact smarter, to be a little bit more\nengaged, to tell you when something looks\n\n449\n00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.360\nlike it is not behaving and\ndoing the things it should do.\n\n450\n00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.110\nYou've got 100 early warning systems that\nyou couldn't buy if you spent $1 million\n\n451\n00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.370\nin order to play because they are gonna\nbe able to intuitively tell you\n\n452\n00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.860\nwhen something doesn't look right, even\nthough it may on the surface appear right.\n\n453\n00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.420\nAnd I'm not suggesting our goal as\nCISSps needs to be to go out and\n\n454\n00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.940\nchange the world, and get users to become\nthis kind of a thought process and\n\n455\n00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.470\nsubstantiate in their minds,\nto become our early warning net.\n\n456\n00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.460\nWhat I'm simply pointing out to you is\nthere's more than one way to approach\n\n457\n00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.490\nrisk management.\n\n458\n00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:13.710\nAnd sometimes it takes money, sometimes it\ntakes resources, sometimes it takes time,\n\n459\n00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.890\nsystem architecture, redesign,\nall the things we've been talking about.\n\n460\n00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.430\nSometimes it can be as simple\nas simply saying to somebody,\n\n461\n00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:23.510\nhey, if this happens, just make sure\nyou let me know as soon as possible.\n\n462\n00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.080\nThat doesn't take anything\nother than you stopping and\n\n463\n00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.780\nspending ten minutes with that user and\neducating them as to why it's important\n\n464\n00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.685\nto tell you, or whatever telling\nyou equals, send an email,\n\n465\n00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:38.210\npen up a ticket in the help desk, whatever\nit is, to ask them to be proactive.\n\n466\n00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.030\nImagine how much more impactful\nyour security systems would be, and\n\n467\n00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.400\nyour risk management would be,\nif you're able to do those things.\n\n468\n00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.280\nAnd these are the kind of things\nthat we talk about, right?\n\n469\n00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.105\nTesting and verification,\npatch management, all this stuff's good.\n\n470\n00:22:49.105 --> 00:22:51.870\nBut all this relies on us\nconfiguring a bunch of stuff,\n\n471\n00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:55.280\nautomating a bunch of stuff, and\nthen hoping that our configuration and\n\n472\n00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.170\nautomation is done in the right way so\nthat it picks up the things that\n\n473\n00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:00.980\nare aberrant,\nthat are not supposed to be there.\n\n474\n00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.750\nWhat if we got it wrong?\n\n475\n00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:06.160\nWhat if all the stuff we configured is\nnot the stuff that's gonna go wrong?\n\n476\n00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:09.680\nOur systems are gonna work 100% spot on,\nthey're gonna be flawless but\n\n477\n00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.360\nthey're gonna execute on the wrong place,\nlooking for the wrong things,\n\n478\n00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.890\nexamining the wrong events, and\ntherefore tell us everything is fine.\n\n479\n00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.920\nThe system isn't broken,\nthe configuration is what is a problem.\n\n480\n00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.340\nYou implemented it poorly, right?\n\n481\n00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.450\nAnd, as a result of that,\nthe system's gonna work just fine but\n\n482\n00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.660\nyou're never gonna know about the risk.\n\n483\n00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.280\nIt's just not gonna be reported.\n\n484\n00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.190\nBut if you had users that were\npaying attention, that said,\n\n485\n00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:33.800\neven though Adam said\neverything should look okay,\n\n486\n00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.610\nI get the feeling this isn't right, I\nshould probably say something to somebody.\n\n487\n00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:41.050\nIf somebody just did that, imagine how\nmuch more secure a system could be.\n\n488\n00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.940\nAnd it's a combination of these\nthings that we have to take on and\n\n489\n00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.070\nthink about when we think\nabout these kind of solutions.\n\n490\n00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:49.280\nIt's not just, in other words,\nthe hardwired systems.\n\n491\n00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:52.817\nIt's not just, in other words, the ability\nto be able to anticipate, guess and\n\n492\n00:23:52.817 --> 00:23:55.171\nconfigure accordingly,\nit's much more than that.\n\n493\n00:23:55.171 --> 00:23:58.978\nBecause it's the intuitive nature of the\nthings we see that we haven't anticipated,\n\n494\n00:23:58.978 --> 00:24:01.233\nbut that's somebody\nunderstands is not correct.\n\n495\n00:24:01.233 --> 00:24:05.031\nThat can also lead us to understanding and\nuncovering risk-threat vulnerability, and\n\n496\n00:24:05.031 --> 00:24:08.573\nas a result of that potentially mitigating\na concern before it gets out of hand, but\n\n497\n00:24:08.573 --> 00:24:10.710\nwe have to have a combination of both.\n\n498\n00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:13.750\nSo things like code signing very important\nand we've talked about the value of\n\n499\n00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:16.760\ndigitally signing code, and\nthe reasons why this is critical.\n\n500\n00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.837\nBut human awareness, right,\n\n501\n00:24:17.837 --> 00:24:20.330\nand human intelligence also\nplays a significant role here.\n\n502\n00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.260\nSo just think about that and\nbe aware of these kind of things.\n\n503\n00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.490\nI'm not suggesting again you go out, stop\neverything you're doing, stop buying and\n\n504\n00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.770\ninvesting in that technology,\nstop implementing automation and\n\n505\n00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.150\nput a bunch people out there with\ntheir eyes glued to a monitor,\n\n506\n00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.530\nwaiting something to happen,\ncuz that's gonna be just as ineffective\n\n507\n00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:41.520\nas if you did what we just discussed\nwithout the human component or element.\n\n508\n00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.480\nThe goal is to try to\nmarry the two together.\n\n509\n00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.400\nRight?\nBecause not every system is going to catch\n\n510\n00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.350\neverything, and not every human user\nis going to see everything, and\n\n511\n00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:49.590\nthe more eyes, the more ears,\n\n512\n00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.770\nthe more systems we have have monitoring,\nultimately, the better we are going to be.\n\n513\n00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:56.290\nWe also have to keep in mind and consider\nthe concerns around regression testing and\n\n514\n00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:57.760\nsystem integration, right?\n\n515\n00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:01.330\nSystems that are designed to work a\ncertain way, as we update and change them\n\n516\n00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.370\nover time, may change the underlying\nassumptions of that architecture.\n\n517\n00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.440\nAnd if we're not testing the changes,\n\n518\n00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.589\nthink about patch management\nas a good example of this,\n\n519\n00:25:09.589 --> 00:25:13.980\nif we're not patch managing, and part of\npatch management is regression testing\n\n520\n00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.670\nto validate that that patch will not break\nanything already in place in the system.\n\n521\n00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.980\nIf we're not doing that,\nwe're gonna have a concern as well,\n\n522\n00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.280\nso regression testing\nbecomes very important.\n\n523\n00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.905\nWe have to think about the kind\nof testing we do in general.\n\n524\n00:25:24.905 --> 00:25:28.400\nWe should have a general library of tests\nthat we always use and roll out and\n\n525\n00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.760\nmanage change through.\n\n526\n00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:30.960\nRegression testing is one of them.\n\n527\n00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.450\nAcceptance testing, typically,\n\n528\n00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.790\nwould be another that we wanna make sure\nthat we are thinking about and doing.\n\n529\n00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:39.700\nThis is a formal test that's used to go\nthrough and actually validate a system,\n\n530\n00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.100\nand ultimately decide that\nthe system as delivered,\n\n531\n00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.280\nas configured, as operated, will be good.\n\n532\n00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.100\nAnd then to document\n\n533\n00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.190\nthat formal acceptance at\nthe end of the testing cycle.\n\n534\n00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:50.100\nSo, wanna make sure that\nwe're thinking about that,\n\n535\n00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.600\nwanna make sure that we\nare concerned about these things.\n\n536\n00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.280\nSoftware assurance,\nit's also very important.\n\n537\n00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.040\nHow do we go through the thought\nprocess around assuring\n\n538\n00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.170\nthat software is gonna be secure, is\ngonna be well built, is gonna be aligned\n\n539\n00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:05.100\nwith the function requirements that\nwe have stipulated and specified.\n\n540\n00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.870\nWell, clearly we've talked\nabout this already.\n\n541\n00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:09.800\nThe use of an STLC is gonna\nhelp us drive through that.\n\n542\n00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:12.171\nBut software assurance\nis a byproduct of that.\n\n543\n00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:13.680\nIt is an outcome, in other words, right?\n\n544\n00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.881\nAnd the idea is that if we don't\nimplement security through the STLC,\n\n545\n00:26:16.881 --> 00:26:19.606\nwe're not gonna have software\nassurance out the back end.\n\n546\n00:26:19.606 --> 00:26:25.530\nWe can use an SDLC, a Software Development\nLife Cycle, in order to develop software.\n\n547\n00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:28.630\nBut if we're not using security\nas a component that is an add on,\n\n548\n00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:33.430\na bolt on to the SDLC, and\nfocusing on security at every phase,\n\n549\n00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:36.860\nwe're not necessarily gonna have software\nthat we can assure ourselves, and\n\n550\n00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.820\nthose that are using it, will be secure.\n\n551\n00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:43.040\nWe may, in other words, create a software\nproduct that has functionality, but\n\n552\n00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.990\nfrom a security standpoint,\nit may or may not be secure.\n\n553\n00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:48.910\nAnd so just because we use an SDLC doesn't\nmean we equal security and assurance.\n\n554\n00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:53.020\nWe have to use security as part of that\nSDLC, and we often go the extra mile and\n\n555\n00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:54.800\nsay, it's not just the SDLC,\n\n556\n00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.950\nit's the secure SDLC that we really\nhave to focus on to create assurance.\n\n557\n00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.470\nWe wanna make sure we're\nthinking about that, and\n\n558\n00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:01.850\nthat we're aware of that as well.\n\n559\n00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.760\nAnd there are phases associated\nwith software assurance.\n\n560\n00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:08.600\nPlanning, contracting,\nmonitoring receptance, and follow on\n\n561\n00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:12.290\nare traditionally the four phases we\nassociate with software assurance.\n\n562\n00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:16.220\nAnd in every one of these phases, we have\nto worry about security, have to worry\n\n563\n00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:19.080\nabout validation of assumptions,\nhave to worry about functionality,\n\n564\n00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.790\nall the things we talk about in the SDLC,\nin the Software Development Life Cycle.\n\n565\n00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.790\nBut security being added early and often\ninto those phases are gonna help us to\n\n566\n00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:30.666\nalign with and ultimately achieve the end\nresult we want through a software\n\n567\n00:27:30.666 --> 00:27:34.605\nassurance phase, or rather a software\nassurance plan or thought process,\n\n568\n00:27:34.605 --> 00:27:36.231\nphase by phase, area by area.\n\n569\n00:27:36.231 --> 00:27:39.763\nWhich is ultimately, we want software\nthat's secure, that's validated,\n\n570\n00:27:39.763 --> 00:27:43.025\nthat has been tested and that ultimately\nis going to operate securely and\n\n571\n00:27:43.025 --> 00:27:46.930\nnot expose confidentiality, integrity, or\navailability concerns in the system and\n\n572\n00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:49.016\nis then going to be able\nto be change managed and\n\n573\n00:27:49.016 --> 00:27:52.210\nconfiguration managed ultimately\nthrough its life cycle.\n\n574\n00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:55.520\nSo, wanna make sure we're focusing on all\nthese things as well, really making sure\n\n575\n00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.740\nwe understand the risks associated with\na lack of a security thought process\n\n576\n00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:04.150\nwith regards to the SDLC and the negative\noutcomes that than can ensure.\n\n577\n00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.550\nAnd I will underscore that word,\nthat they can ensure,\n\n578\n00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:10.190\nif we don't apply security thoughtfully\nand formally at every stage of the SDLC.\n\n579\n00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.850\nYou know, as we already talked about.\n\n580\n00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:13.490\n>> All right Adam.\n\n581\n00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.290\nAnother great episode there.\n\n582\n00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.770\nA look at that software development\nsecurity and really being able to test\n\n583\n00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:22.740\nthe effectiveness of the security that\nwe've tried to impart into that software.\n\n584\n00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.540\nSo, thank you for that Adam.\n\n585\n00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.580\nWe appreciate that.\n\n586\n00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.010\nHope you guys out there
