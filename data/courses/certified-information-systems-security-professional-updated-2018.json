00:00:15.346\ntuning in to ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:15.346 --> 00:00:17.673\n&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n7\n00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:21.575\nwe got a little bobble head in here,\nthat's right.\n\n8\n00:00:21.575 --> 00:00:22.998\nNow, we've got Adam Gordon here.\n\n9\n00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:23.855\nBut we are continuing along\nin our series and CISSP.\n\n10\n00:00:23.855 --> 00:00:26.247\nAnd well, joining us back in the studios,\nyou know him.\n\n11\n00:00:26.247 --> 00:00:28.002\nI've already mentioned his name,\nis Adam Gordon.\n\n12\n00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:28.872\nAdam, how are we doing today, sir?\n\n13\n00:00:28.872 --> 00:00:29.732\n&gt;&gt; Doing well, how about you?\n\n14\n00:00:29.732 --> 00:00:32.064\n&gt;&gt; Doing good,\nI need to tighten up the neck muscles.\n\n15\n00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:34.440\n&gt;&gt; I guess, it's just, yeah,\nyou get stiff every so often.\n\n16\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.812\nI just, I travel so much, and I've been\ntraveling recently in the last few\n\n17\n00:00:37.812 --> 00:00:39.826\ndays before we are giving\nthese these episodes.\n\n18\n00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:42.606\nBeen on like three different airplanes and\ntwo different hotels, so.\n\n19\n00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:43.396\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Burning the candle\nof both [INAUDIBLE].\n\n20\n00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:46.286\n&gt;&gt; Every so often I just get to the point\nwhere I’d like to take my head off,\n\n21\n00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:48.946\nturn it sideways and\nput it back on my body to adjust it.\n\n22\n00:00:48.946 --> 00:00:52.026\nSo since I can’t do that you\noccasionally see me doing this.\n\n23\n00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:53.908\nHow about if we do the whole\nepisode like this?\n\n24\n00:00:53.908 --> 00:00:54.526\nBut that would be so annoying.\n&gt;&gt; Yes it would, yes it would.\n\n25\n00:00:54.526 --> 00:00:56.906\n&gt;&gt; Wanna shake the modern, stop that.\n\n26\n00:00:56.906 --> 00:01:00.296\nAll right, anyway, so we are here to\ntake on that security risk management.\n\n27\n00:01:00.296 --> 00:01:02.230\nHopefully you’ve been\njoining us up until now.\n\n28\n00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.770\nWe're making our way through the first\nof the eight domains that make up\n\n29\n00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.170\nthe CISSP CBK,\nthe Common Body of Knowledge.\n\n30\n00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.900\nJoin me here, I'll show you where we are.\n\n31\n00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.160\nWe are dealing with subtopic number 5,\nunderstanding, adhering to,\n\n32\n00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.690\nand promoting professional ethics.\n\n33\n00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.370\nVery, very important topic.\n\n34\n00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.110\nAlthough very small, it's probably gonna\nbe one of the shortest episodes we do in\n\n35\n00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.630\nthe entire show, yet probably one\nof the most impactful for you.\n\n36\n00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.317\nI mentioned in the overview\nepisode if you haven't seen that,\n\n37\n00:01:28.317 --> 00:01:31.410\ngreat place to find out a little bit\nmore about the process, procedure,\n\n38\n00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.859\nthought behind how you move through the\nvarious gates that are associated around\n\n39\n00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.350\nsuccess around becoming a CISSP.\n\n40\n00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.152\nOne of the things you're gonna hear\nme talk about there was that you must\n\n41\n00:01:41.152 --> 00:01:44.530\nadhere to our ISC code of\nethics to become a CISSP.\n\n42\n00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.830\nYou actually are asked to agree to and\n\n43\n00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.630\nsign off on the code of ethics as part\nof the application process to be given\n\n44\n00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.770\nthe ability to be able to be\ngranted the CISSP credential.\n\n45\n00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.530\nIndeed any of the ISC squared credentials,\nnot just the CISSP.\n\n46\n00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.810\nFrom SSCP all the way through\nto any of the other nine or so\n\n47\n00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.642\ncredentials that currently\nexist in market.\n\n48\n00:02:04.642 --> 00:02:08.280\nEvery one of them requires adherence\nto the same code of ethics.\n\n49\n00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.660\nSo this is a very important part of\nwhat we do as information security\n\n50\n00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.720\nprofessionals, as members of the IC Square\ncommunity at large globally.\n\n51\n00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.410\nVery, very big community\nof practitioners and\n\n52\n00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.640\ncertification holders around the world.\n\n53\n00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.280\nAnd indeed, just as a member of the\ninformation security community at large.\n\n54\n00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.910\nWhether you are certified currently\nthrough ISC Squared, any other vendor, or\n\n55\n00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.690\nnone at all.\n\n56\n00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.140\nDoesn't matter, it's still a good idea\nto adhere to the same code of ethics and\n\n57\n00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.200\npractice canons that we subscribe to here.\n\n58\n00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.980\nIt also is the only thing\nI can tell you without any\n\n59\n00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.020\nrisk of it exposing or in any way\nviolating our NDA's around the exam and\n\n60\n00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.670\nthe content in it without being in any\nway concerned about you saying, but\n\n61\n00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.290\nI didn't see that on the exam,\nyou said it would be there.\n\n62\n00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.150\nI can promise you without fail on\nevery one of ISC Squared exams\n\n63\n00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.670\nfrom the time they started\ndoing it until today and\n\n64\n00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.190\nprobably throughout the future,\nuntil whenever, there's always at least\n\n65\n00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.310\na question if not more than one on\nmaterial around the code of ethics.\n\n66\n00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.938\nThat is how important it is to\nISC Squared, how important it is to all of\n\n67\n00:03:12.938 --> 00:03:16.259\nus that are members of that community\nthat are proud to hold one or\n\n68\n00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:17.949\nmore ISC Squared credentials.\n\n69\n00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:21.525\nAnd it is something as\na legacy passed between\n\n70\n00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:24.995\ngenerations of certification holders\nthat we hold ourselves accountable to,\n\n71\n00:03:24.995 --> 00:03:29.105\nand we create consistency and\nvalue in our community by doing.\n\n72\n00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:30.865\nSo it is very, very important for\n\n73\n00:03:30.865 --> 00:03:33.845\nyou to be aware of what\nwe're about to talk about.\n\n74\n00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:35.730\nPlus a very simple conversation.\n\n75\n00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.660\nThere is a Code of\nProfessional Ethics as I mentioned.\n\n76\n00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.090\nThe Code of Ethics is made up of\na Preamble and then the Canons,\n\n77\n00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.640\nthe four points that specifically\naddress our behavior and\n\n78\n00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.460\nhow we should engage around it.\n\n79\n00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.080\nThere is a URL at the bottom\nof the page there,\n\n80\n00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.750\nlet's just take a quick\npeek at that website.\n\n81\n00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.800\nAnd what you can see, and again,\nthis look and feel changes over time.\n\n82\n00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.901\nThis is in the beginning of June,\nroughly around June 8th or so\n\n83\n00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:03.090\nas we're shooting this episode live.\n\n84\n00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.610\nPlease go back full screen if you could.\n\n85\n00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.023\nThis is what the page at ISC squared\non the website currently looks like for\n\n86\n00:04:08.023 --> 00:04:08.970\nthe Code Of Ethics.\n\n87\n00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.686\nI've seen it look like several\nthings over the many years I've been\n\n88\n00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:15.945\nassociated with the organization\nas a credential holder,\n\n89\n00:04:15.945 --> 00:04:19.610\nso don't be concerned if it looks\ndifferent when you go there.\n\n90\n00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.410\nThe information itself is\nwhat we're focused on.\n\n91\n00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.730\nYou could see the code is discussed\na little bit right at the top.\n\n92\n00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.620\nAll right, so you can see, right?\n\n93\n00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.770\nThe Code of Ethics Preamble is there,\nright?\n\n94\n00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.870\nAnd the Code of Ethics Canons right below,\njust like in the notes, looks the same.\n\n95\n00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.130\nGo back to the notes in just a second.\n\n96\n00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.650\nThought it was good to show\nit to you on the website.\n\n97\n00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.025\nBut this is one of those few areas where\nthe Code of Ethics Canons in particular,\n\n98\n00:04:40.025 --> 00:04:43.580\nwe're kind of highlighting and\nhovering over the first bullet point here.\n\n99\n00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.110\nYou'd need to know them and\nknow them in order.\n\n100\n00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.090\nI'll show them to you in my notes, they're\na little bit bigger, easier to see.\n\n101\n00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.130\nBut this one in particular\nis the most important of all\n\n102\n00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.500\nof the four Code of Ethics Cannons.\n\n103\n00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.419\nSo you want to know all of them and\nmake sure you are aware of them in order.\n\n104\n00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.610\nLet's just take a look at them here.\n\n105\n00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.881\nA little bit easier to see, right.\n\n106\n00:04:57.881 --> 00:05:01.916\nSo the preamble safety of the\ncommonwealth, duty to our principals, and\n\n107\n00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:05.890\nto each other requires that we adhere,\nand be seen to adhere.\n\n108\n00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.730\nHighest ethical standards of behavior.\n\n109\n00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:12.068\nTherefore, strict adherence to this\ncode is a condition of certification.\n\n110\n00:05:12.068 --> 00:05:14.850\nI said, right, you gotta make sure\nyou adhere to this code of ethics.\n\n111\n00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.530\nIf you're found not adhering to it,\nthere is actually a section on\n\n112\n00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.360\nthe website that talks about\nthe things that can happen\n\n113\n00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.660\nincluding the potential procedures involve\nsomebody bringing a complaint against you.\n\n114\n00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.430\nAnd potentially seeking to\nhave you decertified, which\n\n115\n00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.670\ncertainly would not want to be the case\nfor anybody but can happen in rare cases.\n\n116\n00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.510\nJust be aware of that.\n\n117\n00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.130\nThe Code of Ethics Cannons, the four\nkey principles we operate by in order.\n\n118\n00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.080\nAnd yes, please know them in order.\n\n119\n00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.640\nCome up with a mnemonic of\nsome kind if you need to.\n\n120\n00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.050\nYou could see PAPA kind of repeats, so\n\n121\n00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.820\nmaybe something like that\nwould be helpful, maybe not.\n\n122\n00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.420\nBut protect society, the commonwealth,\nand the infrastructure, right.\n\n123\n00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:59.685\nAct honorably, act honestly, justly,\nresponsibly, and legally, always legally.\n\n124\n00:05:59.685 --> 00:06:01.835\nProvide diligent and\ncompetent service to principles.\n\n125\n00:06:01.835 --> 00:06:03.745\nAdvance to protect the profession.\n\n126\n00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:08.075\nAlthough it doesn't say so, we often\ninterpret the first code of ethics canon\n\n127\n00:06:08.075 --> 00:06:11.605\nas do no harm and\nprotect life above all else.\n\n128\n00:06:11.605 --> 00:06:14.390\nMeaning, when faced with\na choice to save the computer or\n\n129\n00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.929\nsave the human in a burning building\nmake sure you save the human first and\n\n130\n00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:20.151\nthen save the computer afterwards, right.\n\n131\n00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:24.380\nIt's very important that we\nunderstand the Code of Ethics Canons.\n\n132\n00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.840\nMake sure we value all of them, but we\nreally in particular focus on the first,\n\n133\n00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.580\nwhich is to ensure life safety\nabove all else, all right.\n\n134\n00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.590\nAnd then with regards to\norganizational codes of ethics,\n\n135\n00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.370\nI have bullet point item\nnumber 2 down there.\n\n136\n00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.940\nIt's the broader conversation\nabout what organizations may do\n\n137\n00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.840\nas a code of practice or within\nthe boundaries of the organization itself.\n\n138\n00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.440\nAnd that is a one size\nfits one solution often.\n\n139\n00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.930\nThe code of ethics from (ISC)²\nis a one size fits all solution.\n\n140\n00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.440\nMeaning, everybody must adhere to it,\n\n141\n00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.470\nno questions about it, there’s no\ninterpretation there, it is what it is,\n\n142\n00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.690\nyou must adhere to it if you wanna\nbe a certified professional.\n\n143\n00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.855\nBut having said that certainly\nmany corporations and\n\n144\n00:07:03.855 --> 00:07:07.880\nIT's may choose to them implement\ntheir own standards and\n\n145\n00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.300\ncodes of conduct within the boundaries\nof their organization that will vary.\n\n146\n00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.340\nAnd in some respects be aligned with and\nothers perhaps vary.\n\n147\n00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.370\nSo you'll just keep in mind we're not\nreally talking about what it is your\n\n148\n00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.425\norganization do because we\nhave no way of knowing that,\n\n149\n00:07:20.425 --> 00:07:22.255\nthere's no way to test for that.\n\n150\n00:07:22.255 --> 00:07:24.783\nIt's really just a placeholder and\na footnote for\n\n151\n00:07:24.783 --> 00:07:29.000\nus to understand that as CISSP's part\nof how we implement, live through, and\n\n152\n00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.580\nadhere to and uphold the code\nof ethics we all ascribe to.\n\n153\n00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.791\nThe code of professional ethics for\n\n154\n00:07:34.791 --> 00:07:40.097\n(ISC)² is to move our organizations\ntowards implementing these guidelines, and\n\n155\n00:07:40.097 --> 00:07:44.960\nhelping our organizations to understand\nthat codes of conduct of code of ethic\n\n156\n00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.990\noften represent helps the standardized\nbehavior and normalize expectations.\n\n157\n00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.399\nSo everybody is going to be able to\nexercise due care because of due\n\n158\n00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:58.530\ndiligence being brought to bare,\nis that we minimize risk.\n\n159\n00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.020\nWe keep coming back to this theme.\n\n160\n00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.345\nBut this is really what the code of ethics\nspeaks to with regards to our behavior,\n\n161\n00:08:04.345 --> 00:08:07.110\nour conduct and our focus.\n\n162\n00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:12.040\nIn and around the organization at all\ntimes regardless of whether we are or\n\n163\n00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.070\nare not dealing with individuals from\nwork, maybe representing our business or\n\n164\n00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:17.080\nour company somewhere.\n\n165\n00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.340\nWe may just simply be\ninteracting on a personal level.\n\n166\n00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.100\nWe still were bound by\nthe same code of conduct.\n\n167\n00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.750\nVery, very important for\nyou to be aware that.\n\n168\n00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.510\n&gt;&gt; All right Adam, great information\nthat we need to keep in mind.\n\n169\n00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.710\nSo we're gonna go ahead,\nwe're gonna end this one right here.\n\n170\n00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.610\nAs always, we do appreciate having\nyou in the studios with us and\n\n171\n00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.370\nwe appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n172\n00:08:34.370 -->

Welcome ladies and\n\n6\n00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.815\ngentlemen, back to another\ngreat episode here in ITPro TV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:20.115\nI'm your host Wes Bryan and in today's\nepisode we are continuing through our\n\n8\n00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:22.365\nseries in the CISSP Exam, that's right.\n\n9\n00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:24.385\nJoining us back in\nthe studio is Adam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:26.665\nAdam, how are we doing today sir?\n&gt;&gt; Doing well, how about you?\n\n11\n00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:27.245\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good,\n\n12\n00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:29.575\ngot a little bit rain coming\nthrough the area right now but\n\n13\n00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:32.410\nwe're managing.\n&gt;&gt; We're tap dancing through the rain.\n\n14\n00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.620\n&gt;&gt; That's right, that's right.\n\n15\n00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.950\nSo without singing in the rain,\ncuz you don't wanna hear me sing,\n\n16\n00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.121\nwhat are we looking at today?\n&gt;&gt; I left my umbrella in the car,\n\n17\n00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.280\nwouldn't matter.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n18\n00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.160\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, one of my most favorite movies\n\n19\n00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.100\nin the world actually, great movie.\n\n20\n00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.380\nSo we are going to continue our\nconversations with regards to Security and\n\n21\n00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.320\nRisk Management.\n\n22\n00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.280\nIf you have joined us up until now, you\nknow we're working through the first of\n\n23\n00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.130\nthe eight domains that\nmake up the CISSP CBK.\n\n24\n00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.490\nIf you are just new to what we're doing\nand randomly decided to arrive here and\n\n25\n00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.240\nstart your journey with us with regards to\nunderstanding the CISSP Exam then welcome.\n\n26\n00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.600\nWe're always glad to see you and\nhave you join us but\n\n27\n00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.140\nyou're jumping in roughly halfway through\n\n28\n00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.160\nthe object discussions around the specific\nknowledge associated with this domain.\n\n29\n00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.290\nJoin me here,\nwe are taking on the topic or\n\n30\n00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.270\nsub topic other than the security and\nrisk management, a developed document and\n\n31\n00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.440\nimplement security policy standard\nprocedures and guidelines.\n\n32\n00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.830\nWe're gonna carve up those\nterms specifically and\n\n33\n00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.130\nwe'll actually do it this way.\n\n34\n00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.020\nPolicy standard procedures and guidelines\nand to find them cuz that's really\n\n35\n00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.430\nthe operational information we\nneed In this particular episode.\n\n36\n00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.040\nWhat is or\n\n37\n00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.670\nwhat are the working operational\ndefinitions of those four terms?\n\n38\n00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.650\nWhen we talk about\ndevelopment documentation,\n\n39\n00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.410\nimplementation of these items, we're\ntalking about the thought process start to\n\n40\n00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.520\nfinish holistically, of how we at\nCISSPs provide guidance to and\n\n41\n00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.655\ndirection for\nthe implementation of security controls.\n\n42\n00:01:56.655 --> 00:02:00.310\nAnd the implementation of thought\nprocesses around how we build\n\n43\n00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.800\nthe ISMS the information\nsecurity management system\n\n44\n00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.590\nwhich you heard me talk about\nwith ISA 270001 270002.\n\n45\n00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.650\nHow we do that in a coherent and concise,\nwell documented, standardized and\n\n46\n00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.380\nrepeatable way in order to fully focus on\nthe ideas of confidentiality, integrity,\n\n47\n00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.110\nand availability,\nnow we drive to minimize or mitigate risk.\n\n48\n00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.180\nThat's what we talk about and\nwhat we've been doing.\n\n49\n00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.660\nProbably the most important\nthing we can do aside\n\n50\n00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.170\nfrom clearly articulating and\ndeveloping our thought processes.\n\n51\n00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.880\nAnd then allowing through that process for\nus to have something that is coherent,\n\n52\n00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.950\nthat we can document, clearly write down.\n\n53\n00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.870\nBroadly and widely disseminate and\ncommunicate within.\n\n54\n00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.940\nAround the organization,\nand then as a result offer\n\n55\n00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.760\nthrough due diligence guidance around how\nwe should oversee the implementation of,\n\n56\n00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.320\nand through due care,\nactually execute on the implementation of.\n\n57\n00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.710\nAs we bring those thoughts together,\n\n58\n00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.320\nthe single most important thing we can\ndo Is ensure that we act continuously.\n\n59\n00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.760\nAnd we act, I will say relentlessly in our\npursuit of creating that security culture.\n\n60\n00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.690\nThat culture of security you\nkeep hearing me refer to.\n\n61\n00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.280\nThis in particular discussion, this whole\nthought process in step number six or\n\n62\n00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.190\nitem number six, is really speaking to us\nfrom the perspective of how do we create\n\n63\n00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.170\nthe building blocks in order to craft\nthem into the elements that go into\n\n64\n00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.140\nthe creation of our culture of\nsecurity in the organization.\n\n65\n00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.330\nWhen we have an idea,\nand we talk through it,\n\n66\n00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.250\nand we massage it and\nget it to the point where we think we've\n\n67\n00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.940\ndeveloped it enough that it becomes\nsomething that is coherent.\n\n68\n00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.040\nAnd then we document that through\nwriting it down and broadly and\n\n69\n00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.980\nwidely disseminating it and\ncommunicating it.\n\n70\n00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.490\nIt creates standardization.\n\n71\n00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.120\nAnd then we act on it\nthrough implementation.\n\n72\n00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.090\nWe are creating culture.\n\n73\n00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.960\nAnd so understand the concepts of\nculture along with the concepts of\n\n74\n00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.620\nthe definitive documentation or\ndefinitive set of resources we refer to.\n\n75\n00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.200\nAnd the way in which we use those\nresources or policy standards, procedures,\n\n76\n00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.040\nand guidelines are what we focus on.\n\n77\n00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.230\nVery, very important part of what we do.\n\n78\n00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.720\nLet's go through and\noffer you some definitions,\n\n79\n00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.260\nsome things that will\nhelp us with this regard.\n\n80\n00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.980\nSo with regards to, and security sits\nin front of the word policy, but\n\n81\n00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.040\njust generically with regards to policy.\n\n82\n00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.060\nWhether it is a security policy, or\n\n83\n00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.340\nwhether we potentially take that\nword out and just say policy.\n\n84\n00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.900\nPolicy overall, is the idea of\nthis direction we get from senior\n\n85\n00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.610\nmanagement in the organization,\nin the enterprise.\n\n86\n00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.320\nIt is giving us guidance, and\nI'm using that word hesitantly,\n\n87\n00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.360\nbecause we have the word guideline that\nsounds very similar to it right below.\n\n88\n00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.970\nBut it's giving us direction and\ngiving us focus and giving us boundaries.\n\n89\n00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.530\nThat's what policy is designed to do.\n\n90\n00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.220\nThese are the things that\nare important for the organization.\n\n91\n00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.040\nLet's make sure we align to support\nthem and let's pursue them.\n\n92\n00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.900\nIt is often seen as being\nstrategic in nature,\n\n93\n00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.130\nwhich is why you see the word\nstrategic right in parenthesis.\n\n94\n00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.220\nWhen we think about standardization or\n\n95\n00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.770\nwe think about standards that we\nthink of and aligning with standards.\n\n96\n00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.640\nWe think of formalize guidance\nthat allows us to be able to\n\n97\n00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.550\noperate in alignment with or more often\nthan not some sort of regulation,\n\n98\n00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.920\nsome sort of set of things that need to\nbe done and adhere to in a certain way.\n\n99\n00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.044\nSo I'm gonna bring Wes into\nthe conversation here for a minute.\n\n100\n00:05:30.044 --> 00:05:30.760\n&gt;&gt; Alright.\n\n101\n00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.640\n&gt;&gt; As we often do, because he's always so\n\n102\n00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.580\nkind to stand by and listen.\n\n103\n00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.260\nAnd then of course add value whenever he\nasks us, or makes commentary about things\n\n104\n00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.900\nwe're doing and asks us to represent and\nthink about things.\n\n105\n00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.399\nMany of our viewers may not realize but\nyou have a background and\n\n106\n00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:49.497\namong many of the other things\nyou've done in food service and\n\n107\n00:05:49.497 --> 00:05:52.426\n[CROSSTALK] in the hospitality industry\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n108\n00:05:52.426 --> 00:05:54.250\n&gt;&gt; Which is a very interesting industry to\n\n109\n00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.024\nbe involved with.\n\n110\n00:05:55.024 --> 00:05:57.470\nMy father in-law also the same for\nmany many years.\n\n111\n00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.140\nBackground my father,\nour family business is.\n\n112\n00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.200\nOne side of the family anyway,\nin the restaurant business and\n\n113\n00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.760\nrunning them and owning them.\n\n114\n00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.550\nSo in that industry standards are so\nimportant,\n\n115\n00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.640\nas are procedures, as are guidelines.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n116\n00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.030\n&gt;&gt; All three, but standards in particular.\n\n117\n00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.213\nI'm thinking food safety standards,\nthings of that nature.\n\n118\n00:06:14.213 --> 00:06:17.040\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say yeah, here in Florida,\n\n119\n00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.850\nspecific to Florida,\nwe have the Safe Serve Certification.\n\n120\n00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.130\nAnd really that is just a carbon copy of\nwhat they did in the early days at NASA.\n\n121\n00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.630\nBecause they figured if it would keep\nyour food safe in space where you don't\n\n122\n00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:30.870\nhave a lot of room for error.\n\n123\n00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.140\nAnd also keeping the guidelines for\nkeeping the food safe while you're eating\n\n124\n00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.140\nat a restaurant.\n&gt;&gt; So we could say a standard whatever it\n\n125\n00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:43.300\nis, whatever vertical we may address but\nit is going to be one or more things.\n\n126\n00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.120\nTypically promulgated in some sort of\n\n127\n00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.350\nLegalese in paragraph\nfour more often than not.\n\n128\n00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.450\nNot the easiest thing to wade through\nalways, but essentially boiled\n\n129\n00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.140\ndown gives us formalized guidance about\nhow we should approach a problem.\n\n130\n00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.050\nAnd the things we need to do\nin order to be essentially be\n\n131\n00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.120\naligned with the outcomes\nwe were looking for.\n\n132\n00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.135\nAnd as a result of\nfollowing that standard,\n\n133\n00:07:04.135 --> 00:07:07.786\nor whatever recommendations are part of\nthe standard that we have to adhere to,\n\n134\n00:07:07.786 --> 00:07:11.230\nif we do those things, hopefully,\nas you suggested, outcomes are good.\n\n135\n00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.970\nWhether it's food safety,\nwhether it's automobile safety.\n\n136\n00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:18.540\nThere's all sorts of things that we\ncould look to with regards to standards.\n\n137\n00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.150\nBut it is,\nthe key there will be formalized, right?\n\n138\n00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.390\nIt is written down.\n\n139\n00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:27.050\nIt is coming from typically some sort\nof agency or entity that aggregates and\n\n140\n00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.120\npromulgates all of this into language and\ninto things we can then implement.\n\n141\n00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.770\nWe often implement standards by producing\nprocedures that will, in some cases,\n\n142\n00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.120\nbe part of the standard.\n\n143\n00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.200\nHey, you handle food this way.\n\n144\n00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.320\nHere's the temperature meat needs\nto be stored at, or you know,\n\n145\n00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.640\nwhatever the case may be.\n\n146\n00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.910\nHere's the process for prepping meat.\n\n147\n00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.510\nYou must do these things,\nsanitize this way.\n\n148\n00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.570\nAfter you do this, right?\n\n149\n00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:49.440\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n150\n00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.900\nThose are procedures.\n\n151\n00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.020\nWhatever they may be.\n\n152\n00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.360\nAnd procedures are step by step\nmethods to accomplish something.\n\n153\n00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.980\nAnd they're often referred\nto as being tactical, right?\n\n154\n00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.110\nAs opposed to strategic.\n\n155\n00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.170\nStrategies, security policy's\na high level statement of intent.\n\n156\n00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.300\nThe indicator from Cedar Management\nof direction we wanna follow and\n\n157\n00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.540\nplaces we wanna take the organization.\n\n158\n00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.000\nBut a strategy, right,\nin terms of security policy,\n\n159\n00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.090\na high level strategy is not\nthe same as specific step by step\n\n160\n00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:23.440\ndetailed guidance of how to recognize\nthat strategy and get to those things.\n\n161\n00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:26.930\nSo the strategy maybe,\nwe wanna use cloud services.\n\n162\n00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:28.930\nThe procedure maybe,\n\n163\n00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:33.920\nlet's go figure out how we sign up\nwith Amazon and AWS to get an account.\n\n164\n00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.420\nLet's figure out how\nwe go to Microsoft and\n\n165\n00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:37.950\nsign up on the Azure platform or Google.\n\n166\n00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.510\nOr Google Cloud Platform and\n\n167\n00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.890\nhow we then create virtualized\ninfrastructure step by step.\n\n168\n00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.818\nThose are procedures as opposed\nto strategies that we think of.\n\n169\n00:08:47.818 --> 00:08:50.880\nSo policy is high level strategic and\nintent and\n\n170\n00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.750\nfocus, whereas procedure\nis step by step methodical.\n\n171\n00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.160\nDo this then this when this happens\ngo here when that happens go there.\n\n172\n00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.430\nIt's very tactical so think about that and\nkeep in mind the distinction.\n\n173\n00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.575\nAnd then guidelines often referred\nto as best practice recommendations.\n\n174\n00:09:05.575 --> 00:09:08.885\nThey don't have the same\nthought process behind them,\n\n175\n00:09:08.885 --> 00:09:13.115\nnor the same enforcement capacity\nbehind them as standards do.\n\n176\n00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:17.085\nGuidelines are recommended where standards\nare more often than not required for\n\n177\n00:09:17.085 --> 00:09:18.315\nyou to follow.\n\n178\n00:09:18.315 --> 00:09:19.965\nAgain, by industry by vertical,\n\n179\n00:09:19.965 --> 00:09:24.265\nthe food safety standards are required\nwhen you run a restaurant and sell food.\n\n180\n00:09:24.265 --> 00:09:26.095\nThey're good to follow at home,\n\n181\n00:09:26.095 --> 00:09:31.460\nbut there's no Indication of the fact you\nmust do that else, or there's a penalty.\n\n182\n00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.250\nBut it makes good common sense, right?\n\n183\n00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:36.890\nFood safety is good\nregardless of where you are.\n\n184\n00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:41.640\nBut the idea is that a standard that says\nthis is a restaurant must prepare food\n\n185\n00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.060\nis not something you\nnecessarily follow at home.\n\n186\n00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.040\nBut if you chose to, you could.\n\n187\n00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.040\nBut the restaurant must or\nthey will be fined or\n\n188\n00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.800\nperhaps even driven out of business,\nwho knows what.\n\n189\n00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.530\nBut there is a penalty\nassociated with that.\n\n190\n00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:57.280\nWhereas with a guideline, this is best\npractice information, it's good to do,\n\n191\n00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.350\nrecommendations are helpful,\nthey probably are good things to follow.\n\n192\n00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.830\nBut they don't carry the same weight\nas a standard in terms of that.\n\n193\n00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.430\n&gt;&gt; Definitely, and\n\n194\n00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.710\nas having to be in management aspect\nof this, and manage the kitchen,\n\n195\n00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.810\nwe would have a standard that said, hey,\nyou can only use the chicken, let's say,\n\n196\n00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:13.580\nwithing a three day window or\nspan of time.\n\n197\n00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.620\nBut the procedure would be something that\nI was surprised to see used in IT too,\n\n198\n00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.480\nwould be FIFO.\n\n199\n00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.780\nFirst in, first out but that would be the\nmethod of how we accomplished only a three\n\n200\n00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:26.190\nday window of opportunity for that.\n&gt;&gt; Right, time rotates so that's right.\n\n201\n00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.640\nWe know that the chicken from two days\nago should always be used before the new\n\n202\n00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.662\nchicken.\n&gt;&gt; That's right, and then the guidelines\n\n203\n00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:34.610\nsometimes was like cross contamination and\nexamples of how we would avoid that.\n\n204\n00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.080\nNot specifics, but examples.\n&gt;&gt; Right, okay and\n\n205\n00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.570\nsee it's all great stuff.\n\n206\n00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.290\nIt's really important to think about.\n\n207\n00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.640\nWhat we wanna make sure you're clear\non from the vocabulary perspective.\n\n208\n00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.400\nWe've come to this road and\nthis fork in the road before.\n\n209\n00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.310\nWe're gonna return to it many times\nthroughout our conversations.\n\n210\n00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.830\nNumber one remind you,\nflash cards are very important.\n\n211\n00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.380\nFlash card machine, Wizzlet,\nwhatever you choose to use.\n\n212\n00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.260\nPlease let us know.\n\n213\n00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:01.062\nIf you have others where you always in\nneed of new recommendations for people.\n\n214\n00:11:01.062 --> 00:11:03.620\nIf they're good we certainly\nwill be happy to promote them.\n\n215\n00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.750\nBut do keep in mind you should\nbe thinking about that.\n\n216\n00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.640\nI'm an old school kind of guy.\n\n217\n00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.360\nI still do my flash cards by hand.\n\n218\n00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.910\nAnd I use index cards.\n\n219\n00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:10.670\nAnd that's how I do it.\n\n220\n00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.690\nCuz I find value in\nhaving to write it out.\n\n221\n00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:16.300\nOther people say well you're typing and\nit's kinda the same thing.\n\n222\n00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.720\nIt may work for you, don't get me wrong.\n\n223\n00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.470\nBut for me I grew up learning without\nall this fancy computer stuff.\n\n224\n00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.200\nWhen I wanted to learn something the old\nfashioned way when I went to school you\n\n225\n00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.270\nwrote it down.\n\n226\n00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.250\nSo for me, that's just where I come from.\n\n227\n00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:29.270\nI use flash cards.\n\n228\n00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.790\nI got boxes of them.\n\n229\n00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.960\nBut I write them out by hand still.\n\n230\n00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.820\nSo just keep that in mind.\n&gt;&gt; I was gonna say,\n\n231\n00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.260\nI'm gonna put an age on you here, and it\nmight be a cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n232\n00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:41.940\nDo you still have a Rolodex?\n&gt;&gt; You know, I don't have a rollerdex.\n\n233\n00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.210\nI used one for many years when I\nwas in the entertainment industry.\n\n234\n00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.880\nHad one for a long time.\n\n235\n00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.900\nBut I don't have one anymore just\nbecause honestly, I travel so much.\n\n236\n00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.950\nYou can't travel with one.\n\n237\n00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.780\nYou can, but that's why you have a phone,\nand whatever.\n\n238\n00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.410\nLuckily I'm fortunate\nenough that I can walk\n\n239\n00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:02.540\naround with a lot of\nthat stuff in my head.\n\n240\n00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.690\nSo they now respect I do but\nit's more up here.\n\n241\n00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.230\nWhen this stops working, I don't know,\n\n242\n00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.550\nthen at that point I'm\nprobably gonna have a problem.\n\n243\n00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.250\nIf I keep doing this often enough it\nmay fall out the side [LAUGH] that\n\n244\n00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:13.592\ncould be an issue as well.\n\n245\n00:12:13.592 --> 00:12:15.480\nAll right so\nmake sure you know the difference,\n\n246\n00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.540\ndefinitional differences between policy,\nstandard, procedure, guideline.\n\n247\n00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.650\nVery, very important.\n\n248\n00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.948\nAlso keep in mind that no matter what,\n\n249\n00:12:22.948 --> 00:12:28.310\nthe one thing that we must do without\nfail in order to minimize risk aside from\n\n250\n00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:32.290\nthe obvious things like encrypt your data\netc finding out in this area specifically,\n\n251\n00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:38.400\none thing that beyond all else is super,\nsuper critical good documentation, right?\n\n252\n00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.730\nIf we don't write down what our policy is,\n\n253\n00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:44.050\nif we don't know because it's been\nwritten down and communicated broadly,\n\n254\n00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.990\nwidely where our standard that\nwe are aligning with will be.\n\n255\n00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.820\nWe don't have the documentation\nabout the procedures.\n\n256\n00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.250\nAnd we haven't communicated that to all\nthe people on the point of the spear.\n\n257\n00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:55.060\nAt the tip we're going to execute.\n\n258\n00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:58.600\nIf we don't understand the guidelines\nthat we're going to attach,\n\n259\n00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.370\nbecause they're well communicated,\nwritten down, and formalized.\n\n260\n00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.080\nWe got nothing.\nIt's going to be informal.\n\n261\n00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.120\nIt's going to be random.\n\n262\n00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.512\nIt's going to be chaos.\n\n263\n00:13:06.512 --> 00:13:10.810\nWe're gonna invite risk in, and\nprobably punch risk up in the business,\n\n264\n00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.080\nas opposed to minimized and\nit mitigated down.\n\n265\n00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:18.010\nSo good documentation solves a lot\nof problems, believe it or not.\n\n266\n00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:23.475\nAs simple as that sounds, and as wacky and\ncrazy as you may think that is, you look\n\n267\n00:13:23.475 --> 00:13:28.750\nat organizations that have spot-on,\nsuper tight, really good documentation.\n\n268\n00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:33.580\nAnd you see they are experts at change and\nrisk management.\n\n269\n00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.335\nYou look at organizations that\nare lax on documentation.\n\n270\n00:13:37.335 --> 00:13:40.351\nAnd you see great opportunity for\nimprovement and\n\n271\n00:13:40.351 --> 00:13:42.144\nyou see a variety of issues and\n\n272\n00:13:42.144 --> 00:13:46.904\nconcerns that are under addressed because\nthey are not recognized formally.\n\n273\n00:13:46.904 --> 00:13:51.095\nAnd they are not managed appropriately\nbecause lack of awareness unfortunately\n\n274\n00:13:51.095 --> 00:13:54.913\nleaves a lot of room for error So\nit's a very important thought process for\n\n275\n00:13:54.913 --> 00:13:56.900\nus at CISSP.\n&gt;&gt; All right great information.\n\n276\n00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.000\nDocumentation, documentation,\nand well, more documentation.\n\n277\n00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.940\nThat's right, so we're gonna go ahead and\n\n278\n00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:04.170\ndocument the end [LAUGH] of\nthis show while we're at it.\n\n279\n00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.960\nSo Adam we're gonna go ahead and\nwrap up here.\n\n280\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.820\nWe appreciate having you\nhere in the studios, and\n\n281\n00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.600\nwe always appreciate you the viewers.\n\n282\n00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.240\nRemember you're the reason we exist!\n\n283\n00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.850\nSigning out for ITProTv,\nI've been your host Wes Bryan.\n\n284\n00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:14.470\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n285\n00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.100\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time\n\n286\n00:14:16.100 -->

00:00:12.287\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV\n\n4\n00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:13.864\n&gt;&gt; Greetings, everyone, and\n\n5\n00:00:13.864 --> 00:00:16.697\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.697 --> 00:00:19.571\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n7\n00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:21.169\nAnd in today's episode,\nwe got a road trip,\n\n8\n00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:23.090\nwe're continuing on with our CISSP Series.\n\n9\n00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.870\nToday, looking at security\nawareness training.\n\n10\n00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.070\nGood friend joining us in that\nendeavor is one Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.580\nAdam, I'm glad to have you today, and\n\n12\n00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.700\nhow's it going?\n&gt;&gt; Going well,\n\n13\n00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.660\nhow about you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm fantastic.\n\n14\n00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.440\n&gt;&gt; Outstanding.\n\n15\n00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.733\n&gt;&gt; We're talking security\n\n16\n00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:39.003\nawareness training, which I have done,\nI have implemented.\n\n17\n00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:43.199\nIt's a really important thing people don't\nunderstand, why are you making me do this?\n\n18\n00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:44.771\nBut there is a method for the madness,\n\n19\n00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:46.220\ncorrect?\n&gt;&gt; There is, and\n\n20\n00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.821\nwe'll examine that just a little bit\nin detail in the next minute or so.\n\n21\n00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:53.728\nIt's actually gonna be a relatively small\nepisode compared especially to some of\n\n22\n00:00:53.728 --> 00:00:56.504\nthe ones, like our discussions\naround understanding and\n\n23\n00:00:56.504 --> 00:00:58.333\napplying risk management concepts.\n\n24\n00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:01.514\nWhich took five fairly full, and very,\n\n25\n00:01:01.514 --> 00:01:05.643\nvery long and\ndetailed discussions to get through.\n\n26\n00:01:05.643 --> 00:01:08.020\nSome obviously topics take\nmore time than others.\n\n27\n00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.840\nThis is a small one, but\ndon't let it fool you.\n\n28\n00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.450\nIt is still very important and\nstill one that is incredibly relevant to\n\n29\n00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.000\nwhat we do with regards\nto risk management and\n\n30\n00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.970\nsecurity we build in terms of the culture\nof security around risk management.\n\n31\n00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.490\nJoin me here.\n\n32\n00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.380\nIt's actually the last topic in\nour list in the first domain\n\n33\n00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.470\nin our body of knowledge around\nsecurity and risk management.\n\n34\n00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.160\nBeen through all the other\ntopics up until now.\n\n35\n00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.566\nYou can see right down here,\nbottom of the list, item number 12.\n\n36\n00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:36.070\nGive you a little preview of some things\nup and coming in future domains, but\n\n37\n00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.956\nitem number 12.\n\n38\n00:01:36.956 --> 00:01:40.181\nEstablish and maintain a security\nawareness, education, and\n\n39\n00:01:40.181 --> 00:01:42.458\ntraining program is what we're focused on.\n\n40\n00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:44.720\nSo, we're going to spend just\na couple of minutes discussing this.\n\n41\n00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.930\nWhen we establish or seek to establish and\nmaintain a security awareness and\n\n42\n00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.380\neducation and/or training program,\nwe really have to start by describing and\n\n43\n00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.820\ndefining what security awareness is.\n\n44\n00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.750\nSo, you could see here, establishing\nan understanding of the importance of need\n\n45\n00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.250\nto, or importance and need to comply with\nsecurity policies within the organization.\n\n46\n00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.320\nIt's really what security\nawareness is all about.\n\n47\n00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.580\nDaniel just kicked us off by talking about\nthe fact that he's done these things.\n\n48\n00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.230\nHe's been on the implementing end,\nhe's been on the receiving end.\n\n49\n00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.700\nHe's been involved in sharing his wisdom\nand knowledge, and helping people in\n\n50\n00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.050\nthe organization to understand that there\nare certain things that we expect of them.\n\n51\n00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.081\nAnd as a result,\n\n52\n00:02:23.081 --> 00:02:27.959\ncertain things we ask them to do whether\nthey are clear on those reasons or not.\n\n53\n00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.141\nAnd whether they understand or not is\na function of how clear and how concise\n\n54\n00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:38.664\nwe are at addressing this exact statement\nright here the why of policy, right?\n\n55\n00:02:38.664 --> 00:02:41.811\nYou've heard of the Tao of Pooh.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n56\n00:02:41.811 --> 00:02:44.845\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; This is the why of policy, right?\n\n57\n00:02:44.845 --> 00:02:48.631\nAnd when we talk about the why of policy,\nwhat we're talking about is really\n\n58\n00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:52.597\nanswering the central, fundamental\nquestion that drives, or should drive,\n\n59\n00:02:52.597 --> 00:02:54.940\nall activities in the organization.\n\n60\n00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.710\nWhat are we attempting to achieve and\nwhy are we doing these things?\n\n61\n00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.780\nWill our activities align to support\nthese requirements and check off this or\n\n62\n00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.330\nthat box, ultimately, through our action,\nand if not, why are we doing them?\n\n63\n00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.490\nAnd if it will,\nlet's make sure we do them and\n\n64\n00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.810\ncontinuously access to make sure\nwe're doing them correctly.\n\n65\n00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.870\nSo as a result what awareness helps\nus to do is create programs and\n\n66\n00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.200\ndrive education that helps\nto spread this word.\n\n67\n00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.890\nIt's really to reinforce the culture\nof security that I talked about.\n\n68\n00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.460\nBy establishing, understanding,\nand communicating effectively and\n\n69\n00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.360\ncoherently and concisely with\nall members of our organization.\n\n70\n00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.480\nFrom the top all the way to the bottom,\nmeaning senior level executives,\n\n71\n00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.070\nmost senior people in the company,\nall the way down to the most junior.\n\n72\n00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.820\nThey may have just joined us yesterday or\ntoday as brand new employees.\n\n73\n00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.958\nIt doesn't matter.\n\n74\n00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:48.528\nRegardless of what they do and\nhow long they've been there,\n\n75\n00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:52.658\neverybody should have to go through\nthe same kind of training designed\n\n76\n00:03:52.658 --> 00:03:54.977\nto address the same kinds of concerns.\n\n77\n00:03:54.977 --> 00:03:58.209\nCreate the same general\nlevels of awareness.\n\n78\n00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.137\nNow, having said that, do senior leaders\nin the business, mid-level managers in\n\n79\n00:04:04.137 --> 00:04:09.313\nthe business, front line practitioners\nin the trenches responsible for\n\n80\n00:04:09.313 --> 00:04:14.924\nsystems in the business, do those three\nspecific audiences I just called out?\n\n81\n00:04:14.924 --> 00:04:19.836\nDo they need different kinds of\nuniquely crafted, specific training,\n\n82\n00:04:19.836 --> 00:04:23.378\nunique to their role in the business,\nlateral to and\n\n83\n00:04:23.378 --> 00:04:28.868\nin addition to general security awareness\nto truly be effective at what they do?\n\n84\n00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.135\nAbsolutely, without a doubt.\n\n85\n00:04:30.135 --> 00:04:33.984\nWe're not saying for a minute everybody\ngets the same basic training, boom,\n\n86\n00:04:33.984 --> 00:04:38.182\nwe're done, goodby, good luck, quite\nthe opposite Let's give everybody the same\n\n87\n00:04:38.182 --> 00:04:40.423\nbaseline in regards to security awareness.\n\n88\n00:04:40.423 --> 00:04:41.420\nThere are policies.\n\n89\n00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.780\nLet's make sure we communicate them and\n\n90\n00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.310\neverybody understands what\nthe expectations are around them.\n\n91\n00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.930\nLet's make sure that everybody's\nread the employee handbook.\n\n92\n00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.730\nWhatever additional sporting documentation\ngoes with that, and that they sign off on\n\n93\n00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.550\nit, and that we do our yearly refresher\nto ensure everybody is aware.\n\n94\n00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:03.560\nBut beyond that, if I'm a network\nengineer in charge of Cloud and\n\n95\n00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.460\nvirtualization, I better get additional\nspecific training unique to my job role\n\n96\n00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.500\nbeyond security awareness, or\nI'm not gonna be effective at what I do.\n\n97\n00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.070\nBut if I don't get that general awareness\nsecurity training everyone else got,\n\n98\n00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.220\nI'm likely to make mistakes\nthat expose the business,\n\n99\n00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.000\nand potentially my coworkers,\nmy teammates, my employees, my colleagues,\n\n100\n00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.010\nwhatever you call them,\nto unnecessary risk, and\n\n101\n00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:32.000\nundue burden, because I may violate\nconfidentiality, I may violate integrity.\n\n102\n00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.790\nI may violate availability, or\n\n103\n00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.510\ncause others to do so,\nbecause of lack of awareness.\n\n104\n00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.670\nSo this is why we say let's baseline and\n\n105\n00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.230\naddress awareness for\neverybody in the organization.\n\n106\n00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.630\nAnd then let's add specific content and\nrole unique\n\n107\n00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.320\ncrafted training that That gives them the\nadvantages they need to do their job, but\n\n108\n00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.200\neverybody gets the same baseline\ntraining that addresses the why.\n\n109\n00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.570\nThe why of policy, the why of why\nwe need to do certain things and\n\n110\n00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.180\nwhat we are there to accomplish.\n\n111\n00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.110\nMethods and techniques to\npresent awareness and training.\n\n112\n00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.100\nThey can take a variety of\ndifferent approaches, right.\n\n113\n00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.240\nSo for instance, Dan, you said you've been\ninvolved with some of these things over\n\n114\n00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.480\nthe time you've been in a various\norganizations doing this.\n\n115\n00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.600\nProbably, some were briefings\nwhere you may have gone\n\n116\n00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.810\nsomebody such as myself where\nyou in a format like this,\n\n117\n00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.770\neither online, in real time or recorder or\nlive presentation Would have spoken,\n\n118\n00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.840\nyou may have seen prerecorded content and\nasked a series of questions.\n\n119\n00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.880\nYou may have been given a document\nasked to read and sign off or\n\n120\n00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.300\nverbally acknowledge or\nboth that you got it,\n\n121\n00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.090\nthere's a variety of ways these things\nhappen and nobody's saying one is right or\n\n122\n00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.110\nwrong or better than the other,\nit's really a one size fits one solution.\n\n123\n00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:46.610\nI've been involved with\nmany organizations.\n\n124\n00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.800\nI've crafted many of these programs for\norganizations around the world, and\n\n125\n00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.420\nI've done a variety of things to drive\nthese particular concerns forward.\n\n126\n00:06:55.420 --> 00:07:00.130\nAnd it really is a question of just\nwhat plays well among the organization,\n\n127\n00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:04.460\nbased on culture and based on relevancy\nof information being Communicated.\n\n128\n00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.040\nI've been in all-hands\nmeetings where hundreds,\n\n129\n00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.430\nthousands of employees\nare attending virtually.\n\n130\n00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.340\nAnd watching the kick-off, and\n\n131\n00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.920\nthen breaking out into individual\nsessions by region, by geography.\n\n132\n00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.250\nLocalized, to engage in activities\nwith thought leaders On the ground.\n\n133\n00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.700\nI've done this where it's been\nprerecorded and people just log in and\n\n134\n00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.840\nview content over time\nwithin a certain time frame.\n\n135\n00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.590\nThere's no right and wrong.\n\n136\n00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.420\nThe only thing that's wrong is not getting\nit done and not making it available.\n\n137\n00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.950\nKeep in mind for the CISSP with\nregards to the exam, the box that says\n\n138\n00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.770\ndo we need security training, do we need\nawareness should always be checked off.\n\n139\n00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.150\nThe answer is always yes There's never\never gonna be a compelling reason why you\n\n140\n00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.810\ndo not make this available as\na resource in the organisation.\n\n141\n00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.720\nIt will always be a wrong\nanswer in other words,\n\n142\n00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.160\non the exam if you chose not to\nengage in awareness and training.\n\n143\n00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.980\nThere is only one correct way to\nproceed and that is to create and\n\n144\n00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.830\nallow for the creation of this blanketing\nformat and coverage for everybody.\n\n145\n00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:06.060\nSo everybody operates from, as we've\noften said, the same page in the book.\n\n146\n00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.180\nShould we review content periodically,\nensuring relevancy, ensuring that it\n\n147\n00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.725\nis aligned with and supporting\nthe business requirements we are pursuing,\n\n148\n00:08:13.725 --> 00:08:15.930\njust like everything else we said?\n\n149\n00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.050\nAbsolutely.\n\n150\n00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.850\nYou're watching content\nfrom 1975 about security\n\n151\n00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.400\nawareness with somebody on the main frame\nwith a green screen, you are not watching\n\n152\n00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.670\ncontent that is relevant and\naligned with how you do business today.\n\n153\n00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.510\nUnless your business is working on old\nsystems in which case then you're probably\n\n154\n00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.210\nwhere you need to be, right?\n\n155\n00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.503\nWell we probably have broader\nissues if that's the case, right?\n\n156\n00:08:36.503 --> 00:08:37.128\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n157\n00:08:37.128 --> 00:08:40.334\n&gt;&gt; So make sure that, we are doing this.\n\n158\n00:08:40.334 --> 00:08:43.938\nA big miss a lot of companies have,\nthey move into new systems,\n\n159\n00:08:43.938 --> 00:08:47.490\nespecially SAS based delivery\ntoday of Cloud services.\n\n160\n00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:52.340\nAnd they forget to update the security\nawareness content to reflect the fact\n\n161\n00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.370\nThey now have new resources, and\n\n162\n00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.720\nthey are not training individuals on\nhow to behave on these platforms.\n\n163\n00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.285\nThe huge gap and the hue miss,\n\n164\n00:08:59.285 --> 00:09:03.543\nthe one that often goes undetected because\nwe rush to implement technology, and\n\n165\n00:09:03.543 --> 00:09:07.064\nwe often forget about the fact we\nhave to bring right along with it.\n\n166\n00:09:07.064 --> 00:09:11.856\nRemember, secure early secure often\nthat awareness capacity capability which\n\n167\n00:09:11.856 --> 00:09:16.770\nyour alignment with the ideas of risk\nmitigation within the organization.\n\n168\n00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.561\nEffectiveness of the program\nin terms of evaluation.\n\n169\n00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:22.450\nIt's not enough to do\nperiodic content review.\n\n170\n00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.940\nContent may be timely and appropriate,\nbut it may not be delivered in effective\n\n171\n00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:31.560\nformats that people that are engaging\nwith it find are actually valuable.\n\n172\n00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.650\nYou make people read a 200\npage policy document\n\n173\n00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.320\nas a way to drive security awareness,\nI promise you\n\n174\n00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.340\nthere's not a lot of effect that's\ngonna be derived from that approach.\n\n175\n00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:46.670\nIf you distill that 200 page document\ndown to a 20 minute online discussion\n\n176\n00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.760\nwith some PowerPoints and some scenarios,\nyou're gonna have a lot more buy in,\n\n177\n00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.710\nyou're gonna be much more effective\nat reaching your overall goal\n\n178\n00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.700\nof people complying based on\ndissemination of knowledge.\n\n179\n00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.560\nThe question of how people learn and\n\n180\n00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.640\nhow they engage whether we are tuned into\nthat using the appropriate technologies,\n\n181\n00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.320\nthe appropriate approaches\nto deliver information.\n\n182\n00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.890\nRemember there's different\nways people learn,\n\n183\n00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.620\nyou may be a kinesthetic learner,\nlearning by touch, interacting.\n\n184\n00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.720\nYou may be a learner\nthat is auditory driven.\n\n185\n00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.900\nThat's essentially an audio driven\nlearner, you listen and you hear, and\n\n186\n00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.880\nyou process.\n\n187\n00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.170\nYou may be visual, you may see things.\n\n188\n00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.270\nPeople that have photographic\nmemories fall into this category.\n\n189\n00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.472\nI hate those people by the way.\n\n190\n00:10:27.472 --> 00:10:29.958\n[LAUGH] I cannot stand them,\nI struggle with that.\n\n191\n00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:32.387\nI've been an educator and\na teacher for over 30,\n\n192\n00:10:32.387 --> 00:10:37.065\nclose to 35 years I learn as\na kinesthetic learner, primarily.\n\n193\n00:10:37.065 --> 00:10:41.655\nI'm somebody who has to do things and\ninteract and sample them and tear them\n\n194\n00:10:41.655 --> 00:10:44.455\nout, put them back together, really\nmake it my own and claim that knowledge.\n\n195\n00:10:44.455 --> 00:10:46.185\nThat's why I share it with you over time.\n\n196\n00:10:46.185 --> 00:10:47.135\nBut when I do flashcards,\n\n197\n00:10:47.135 --> 00:10:49.905\nI still hand write them,\nbecause that's how I learn best.\n\n198\n00:10:49.905 --> 00:10:51.705\nI know that about myself.\n\n199\n00:10:51.705 --> 00:10:56.690\nAnd, as an educator First and foremost,\nI have to be aware of the fact that not\n\n200\n00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.160\neverybody in my classroom is a student,\nis gonna learn the way I learn.\n\n201\n00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.890\nAnd therefore I can't teach just one way.\n\n202\n00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.020\nBecause if I all do is teach\nin a kinesthetic approach,\n\n203\n00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.070\nI'm gonna be in the sweet spot for\npeople like me.\n\n204\n00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.120\nAnd I know Daniel was shaking his head\noff camera agreeing with me when I said,\n\n205\n00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.740\nthat's the kind of learner I am.\n\n206\n00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:15.480\nThat it would be great for\nus, but it may not work for\n\n207\n00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.760\nyou, cuz maybe you don't learn that way.\n\n208\n00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.870\nAnd as a result,\nI got to constantly be aware of that and\n\n209\n00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:24.540\nI got to be incorporating multiple\napproaches and techniques to be able to\n\n210\n00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.230\nallow people that are learning different\nmodalities or from different perspectives.\n\n211\n00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.950\nAnd it's important for\nus to be aware of that and\n\n212\n00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:36.370\nthink about that as we evaluate\neffectiveness, because not everybody finds\n\n213\n00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:40.048\nan approach that works for\nthat person to be effective for them.\n\n214\n00:11:40.048 --> 00:11:41.983\nWe have to be sensitive to that.\n\n215\n00:11:41.983 --> 00:11:45.717\nWe wanna reach saturation in coverage\nwhere everybody is gonna be able to\n\n216\n00:11:45.717 --> 00:11:49.942\noperate or be involved in the culture of\nsecurity we wanna create because they're\n\n217\n00:11:49.942 --> 00:11:52.455\nincorporated into and\nare drawing value from and\n\n218\n00:11:52.455 --> 00:11:56.840\nobviously this is all acting accordingly\nthe messages we are communicating out.\n\n219\n00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.220\nSo keep that in mind,\n\n220\n00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.370\nright, this monolithic approach\nto delivery of information.\n\n221\n00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:07.280\nThat comes from just one modality,\nthis is unfortunately the standard and\n\n222\n00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.160\nnorm in many organizations but\nis not the best approach.\n\n223\n00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.160\nAnd we have to as CISSPs constantly\nbe fighting those battles\n\n224\n00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.060\nto ensure that we are delivering as much\nvalue to the organization as we can.\n\n225\n00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.807\nThis is an area where we can have\nan effect, and it's a small area, and\n\n226\n00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:24.540\noften people often overlook the value and\nimportance of it.\n\n227\n00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.442\nRemember, building awareness is\nthe same thing as building culture.\n\n228\n00:12:28.442 --> 00:12:32.352\nAnd we build the culture of security\nbecause that's the foundation\n\n229\n00:12:32.352 --> 00:12:36.740\nthat everything else rests on, and\nenables everything else we talk about,\n\n230\n00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.308\nthroughout all the domains,\nacross all areas of knowledge,\n\n231\n00:12:40.308 --> 00:12:44.120\nin every aspect of the practice\nthat a CISSP has to engage.\n\n232\n00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.699\nVery, very important.\n&gt;&gt; Well, very important stuff.\n\n233\n00:12:47.699 --> 00:12:48.510\n&gt;&gt; And there we are.\n\n234\n00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:49.266\n&gt;&gt; And that was it.\n\n235\n00:12:49.266 --> 00:12:49.957\n&gt;&gt; That is it.\n\n236\n00:12:49.957 --> 00:12:50.897\nI told you it would be\na short conversation.\n\n237\n00:12:50.897 --> 00:12:51.842\n&gt;&gt; You told me it was gonna be short.\n\n238\n00:12:51.842 --> 00:12:53.697\nIt was so short.\n&gt;&gt; I did not lie.\n\n239\n00:12:53.697 --> 00:12:54.817\n&gt;&gt; But I think you did a great job\n\n240\n00:12:54.817 --> 00:12:57.550\nof answering that question of the why\nwe should be engaging in this.\n\n241\n00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.160\nIt's a very important process.\n\n242\n00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.750\nSomething we should be doing, and\n\n243\n00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:04.890\nnow you should be able to explain to the\npeople that you are administering this to,\n\n244\n00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.080\nwhy this is happening,\nand why it is important.\n\n245\n00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.400\nGreat stuff, Adam,\nwe appreciate your time, as always.\n\n246\n00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.100\nAnd we appreciate you, as always.\n\n247\n00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.740\nHopefully you'll stick around more for\nour SSP series.\n\n248\n00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.290\nThis episode looks like\nwe're calling it a day.\n\n249\n00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.210\nThanks for watching.\n\n250\n00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.136\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowery.\n\n251\n00:13:20.136 --> 00:13:21.915\n&gt;&gt; One thing before we sign off.\n\n252\n00:13:21.915 --> 00:13:22.927\nJust one quick thing,\njust one quick thing.\n\n253\n00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:25.218\nYou can leave the lower third up,\nI'm gonna finish up right now.\n\n254\n00:13:25.218 --> 00:13:29.370\nI just wanna remind you of the fact\nthat we talked about addressing policy,\n\n255\n00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:30.590\ngreat way to wrap it up.\n\n256\n00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:32.625\nJust one thing to equate with why.\n\n257\n00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:37.470\nWhy in your mind, for exam purposes\nwhy equals root cause, right?\n\n258\n00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.950\nRoot cause,\nwhy answers the question of root cause.\n\n259\n00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.850\nIf we can get down to why and\nget that actual answer and\n\n260\n00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.830\nreally understand it, we're really\neffectively seeking root cause.\n\n261\n00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.560\nAnd if we find root cause,\nwe can address concerns and\n\n262\n00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.030\nproblems, cuz we understand\nthe reasons why they're happening.\n\n263\n00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.870\nSo just keep that in mind and\nremember that.\n\n264\n00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:57.310\nHaving said that, I am Adam Gordon and\nwe're done talking about security\n\n265\n00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.390\nawareness and training.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll see you next time.\n\n266\n00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:00.924\nHave a good one everyone.\n&gt;&gt; Take care everybody.\n\n267\n00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:07.806\n[MUSIC]\n\n268\n00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:10.329\n&gt;&gt; Thank you for watching ITProTV.\n\n",

00:00:08.047\n[MUSIC]\n\n4\n00:00:08.047 --> 00:00:13.294\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings everyone and\n\n5\n00:00:13.294 --> 00:00:16.720\nwelcome back to another\ngreat episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.790\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie and\ntoday's episode,\n\n7\n00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.610\nwe are continuing on with CISSP series.\n\n8\n00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.864\nAnd joining us yet again, lending his\nexpertise to us, our good friend Mr.\n\n9\n00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:25.450\nAdam Gordon.\n\n10\n00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.919\nAdam, so glad to have you back in\nthe studio, and how's it going?\n\n11\n00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.686\n&gt;&gt; I am doing well, I'm doing well.\n\n12\n00:00:29.686 --> 00:00:32.670\nI am good, it's all good.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, it's all good.\n\n13\n00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.298\n&gt;&gt; I am hyper-focused,\n\n14\n00:00:33.298 --> 00:00:34.028\nis what I was going to say.\n\n15\n00:00:34.028 --> 00:00:37.798\nSo if you were watching us live,\nyou would've seen us, me, specifically,\n\n16\n00:00:37.798 --> 00:00:40.229\nflood the intro to this episode.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n17\n00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.825\n&gt;&gt; Just before we\n\n18\n00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:42.630\nactually are filming it again.\n\n19\n00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.810\nSo I promise, I will attempt to\nnot be distracted this time and\n\n20\n00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.630\nactually pay attention to what\nwe're here to talk about.\n\n21\n00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.240\nSo it is going well, always a pleasure,\nsir, to spend time with you.\n\n22\n00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.090\nAnd of course, with all of you.\n\n23\n00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.321\nWe are having our conversations around\nsecond domain in CISSP CBK asset security.\n\n24\n00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:02.098\nAnd we have been talking about all\nthings asset related Information\n\n25\n00:01:02.098 --> 00:01:06.303\nand/or data as an example of\nthe asset class and category.\n\n26\n00:01:06.303 --> 00:01:11.373\nBut remember, it is simply one type of\nasset and assets all up overall would be\n\n27\n00:01:11.373 --> 00:01:16.366\nthe broader context that we talk about\nall things that the organization owns\n\n28\n00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:21.540\nthat is somehow going to have value\nand/or important to subscribe to it.\n\n29\n00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.790\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n30\n00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.784\nAlso, we talked about the concept\nof data ownership, and\n\n31\n00:01:26.784 --> 00:01:32.327\nthe idea that whoever the individual or\nentity is that owns the data in question,\n\n32\n00:01:32.327 --> 00:01:36.503\nas the asset should determine\nclassification of that data.\n\n33\n00:01:36.503 --> 00:01:41.183\nAnd should be involved in the annual or\nperhaps more aggressive semiannual,\n\n34\n00:01:41.183 --> 00:01:45.791\nquarterly, whatever review life cycle\ntime we assign to be involved in that\n\n35\n00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:50.399\nreview to assess whether classification\nis still appropriate or perhaps,\n\n36\n00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.720\ndata must be reclassified under\nsome sort of additional scheme.\n\n37\n00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.159\nSo join me here, we're gonna take on our\nsecond topic in the asset security domain,\n\n38\n00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.425\npermanently maintaining information and\nasset ownership.\n\n39\n00:02:02.425 --> 00:02:05.454\nOwnership as we said,\nis very critical, very important,\n\n40\n00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:08.068\nbecause among the many\nthings ownership implies.\n\n41\n00:02:08.068 --> 00:02:12.619\nIt implies the ability, in the case\nof information and data as an asset,\n\n42\n00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:16.873\nto classify the data, and\nremember classification implies that we\n\n43\n00:02:16.873 --> 00:02:21.070\nare setting up some sort of scheme,\nsome sort of way to label data.\n\n44\n00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.530\nWe said there's a variety\nof things we could do.\n\n45\n00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.551\nBut whatever that scheme is, whatever\nthat labeling will be, that will be\n\n46\n00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:33.907\nused to drive access to the data based on\nwhatever requirements we put in place.\n\n47\n00:02:33.907 --> 00:02:39.015\nSo a top secret labeling or top secret\nclassification would be different\n\n48\n00:02:39.015 --> 00:02:44.472\nthan a secret and eyes only, all the other\nexamples we could throw out there.\n\n49\n00:02:44.472 --> 00:02:47.572\nAnd each one of those\nclassification labels and\n\n50\n00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:52.689\nlayers would then have access controls and\nrequirements associated with it,\n\n51\n00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:58.228\nagain, they have to be defined,\ndocumented, implemented, audited, etc.\n\n52\n00:02:58.228 --> 00:03:00.890\nBut they will have those\nassociated with them,\n\n53\n00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.280\nthen they drive access to the data,\naccess to the asset.\n\n54\n00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.020\nAnd indeed, in order to ensure\nconfidentiality in the case of data\n\n55\n00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.450\nintegrity, in the case of data and\ncertain availability in the case of data.\n\n56\n00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.919\nBut also keep in mind, so\nI made the point in the last episode.\n\n57\n00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.945\nIt's not just data and I just made\npoint again, started this conversation.\n\n58\n00:03:21.945 --> 00:03:26.360\nData is one kind of asset, but\nbroadly, there are multiple types,\n\n59\n00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.570\nor categories of assets\nin the organization.\n\n60\n00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.350\nSystems overall are assets.\n\n61\n00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.860\nI made this case in the last episode\nwhere I talked about military and\n\n62\n00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.790\ngovernment installations where entire\nrooms, entire areas, whole buildings and\n\n63\n00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.090\nfacilities are classified according to\naccess levels as are computer systems.\n\n64\n00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.930\nIt's funny the first few times you go into\none of these places, especially if you\n\n65\n00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.160\nhave not had this experience, and\nif you are from the military or\n\n66\n00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.660\nthe government or have a background in\nworking as a consultant in these areas,\n\n67\n00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.770\nyou will certainly appreciate to know\nwhat I'm about to share with you.\n\n68\n00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.110\nBut everything is labeled, and so you have\nred labels and you have green labels.\n\n69\n00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.540\nRed labeling is for classified systems,\n\n70\n00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.190\nsecret systems that have access\nconstriction or controls assigned to them.\n\n71\n00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.999\nAnd green labels are for non-classified\nsystems, open access kind of thing,\n\n72\n00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:20.086\nwhich is normal.\n\n73\n00:04:20.086 --> 00:04:24.500\nYou see in monitors or in computers,\nthey have red or green labels on them.\n\n74\n00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.090\nYou see signs on doors or\nmeeting rooms, that kind of thing.\n\n75\n00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.140\nThat's all fine, but\ndown to the mouse pad, right.\n\n76\n00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.019\nSo literally,\nyou don't see mouse pads much anymore,\n\n77\n00:04:34.019 --> 00:04:36.417\nit's just kind of this\nan older kind of thing.\n\n78\n00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:39.620\nWe had mice that were not\nable to track on surfaces.\n\n79\n00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.640\nBut when you had roller ball mice,\nas opposed to optical mice,\n\n80\n00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.900\nyou had mouse pads.\n\n81\n00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.070\nAnd you would walk into these systems,\nliterally,\n\n82\n00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.975\nyou would turn the mouse pad and\nit would have a confidential,\n\n83\n00:04:48.975 --> 00:04:54.760\nnon-confidential green or red sticker on\nit because it was part of the totality\n\n84\n00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.070\nof the architecture of the system, and\nas a result it had to be classified.\n\n85\n00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.230\nIt was nothing secret or\nclassified about the mouse pad, but\n\n86\n00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.560\nit was part of a classified system.\n\n87\n00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.708\nSo you would get these crazy things where-\n&gt;&gt; That's funny.\n\n88\n00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:08.929\n&gt;&gt; I walked into an office and literally,\n\n89\n00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:13.187\nI mean somebody had done it as joke,\nbut every pencil in the pencil holder.\n\n90\n00:05:13.187 --> 00:05:13.770\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n91\n00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.115\n&gt;&gt; They obviously were bored and\n\n92\n00:05:15.115 --> 00:05:17.673\nhad nothing to do, right?\n&gt;&gt; This is the ones that they picked\n\n93\n00:05:17.673 --> 00:05:20.302\nout the ceiling [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; This is what happens when IA officers\n\n94\n00:05:20.302 --> 00:05:21.942\nare bored and have nothing to do, right?\n\n95\n00:05:21.942 --> 00:05:23.720\nIt's stickers and time on their hands.\n\n96\n00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.840\nEvery pencil had a red classified label,\nand\n\n97\n00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.610\nthen there was another cup holder where\nall the pencils were green, right?\n\n98\n00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.945\nAnd it wasn't because one was secret and\nnot, it was [CROSSTALK]\n\n99\n00:05:32.945 --> 00:05:33.867\n&gt;&gt; It was a supply chain attack they\n\n100\n00:05:33.867 --> 00:05:35.821\nwere trying to avoid [CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; They were trying to confuse and\n\n101\n00:05:35.821 --> 00:05:36.851\nconfound the enemy, right?\n\n102\n00:05:36.851 --> 00:05:38.920\nBut it was just funny,\nI mean, just look at it.\n\n103\n00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.890\nYou see the irony in that stuff.\n\n104\n00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.585\nBut it is, it speaks to a broader issue,\nwhich is we have to be aware of the fact\n\n105\n00:05:45.585 --> 00:05:49.656\nthat all assets, right potentially\ncan be classified as we said.\n\n106\n00:05:49.656 --> 00:05:52.479\nWe tend to see this\nprimarily around data but\n\n107\n00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.669\nthat's not an exclusive statement, I want\nyou to be clear on that and understand\n\n108\n00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.658\nthat that there are additional asset\nclasses that will often be classified.\n\n109\n00:06:02.658 --> 00:06:06.112\nAnd as a result, have labeling\nthe controls so as you do with that,\n\n110\n00:06:06.112 --> 00:06:08.760\nso please just keep that\nin mind as we get started.\n\n111\n00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.720\nAll right, so join me here if you will.\n\n112\n00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.520\nLet's take a look.\n\n113\n00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.910\nDetermining and maintaining information,\nasset ownership.\n\n114\n00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:15.812\nVery small conversation.\n\n115\n00:06:15.812 --> 00:06:18.192\nThis is one of those,\nthey should come up with a name.\n\n116\n00:06:18.192 --> 00:06:21.385\nI'm thinking, like, micro episode,\ncuz this is a pretty quick one.\n\n117\n00:06:21.385 --> 00:06:24.465\nA data policy defines the goals for\ndata management.\n\n118\n00:06:24.465 --> 00:06:29.252\nWell, we know from other conversations\nearlier in other episodes,\n\n119\n00:06:29.252 --> 00:06:32.965\nin the first domain,\nsecurity and risk management,\n\n120\n00:06:32.965 --> 00:06:36.608\nwhere we defined policy,\nstandard, guidelines.\n\n121\n00:06:36.608 --> 00:06:40.635\nWe defined these terms, right,\nin terms of vocabulary,\n\n122\n00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:46.220\nthat a policy is a statement of intent and\nguidance from senior leadership.\n\n123\n00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.080\nIn the organization,\nit is seen as more of a strategic\n\n124\n00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.630\nas opposed to a procedure more of\na tactical approach to things and\n\n125\n00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:00.045\nanswers to very important questions, why\nare we doing this and what are we doing?\n\n126\n00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:04.140\nWhereas, procedures\nare step by step guidance\n\n127\n00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.380\nthat are provided to implement policy.\n\n128\n00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.470\nAnd so policy, whatever words you\nput in front of it doesn't matter.\n\n129\n00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.130\nRetention policy, data policy,\naccess control policy,\n\n130\n00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.670\nwe've got policies for all sorts of stuff.\n\n131\n00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.587\nWhatever the policy speaks to,\n\n132\n00:07:21.587 --> 00:07:26.344\nthe generic idea of policy is this high\nlevel of strategic statement of guidance\n\n133\n00:07:26.344 --> 00:07:31.180\nthat helps us to apply due diligence from\nthe perspective of senior management.\n\n134\n00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.640\nProcedures translate and implement\npolicy into tactical operational step\n\n135\n00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.266\nby step things that could be executed\nthat give practitioners the ability to,\n\n136\n00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:47.460\nwith the guidance from policy,\nexercise and operate with due care.\n\n137\n00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.980\nBringing those terms back in and linking\nthem for you yet again, cuz they are so\n\n138\n00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:52.900\nimportant.\n\n139\n00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.820\nSo in this case, data policy provides and\ndefines the goals for data management.\n\n140\n00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.090\nOkay, that makes sense.\n\n141\n00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.202\nWhy do we do data management,\nand what does data management\n\n142\n00:08:02.202 --> 00:08:05.698\nrepresent in the organization is\nwhat a data policy will speak to.\n\n143\n00:08:05.698 --> 00:08:09.670\nIt helps to establish a guiding\nframework for data management.\n\n144\n00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.120\nMove that down there,\nit should be a separate sentence.\n\n145\n00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.750\nAnd it addresses issues such as things\nlike data access, relevant legal,\n\n146\n00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:22.310\nstatutory, regulatory matters and\nconcerns, data stewardship and\n\n147\n00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.002\ncustodial duties,\nwe'll come back to that in a minute.\n\n148\n00:08:25.002 --> 00:08:29.970\nAcquisition of data, and in general,\nblanket issues around the life cycle and\n\n149\n00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.480\nmanagement of data in the organization.\n\n150\n00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.040\nLet's come back to this idea,\nor these ideas, these terms\n\n151\n00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.110\nof stewardship and custodianship, or\nstewardship and custodial duties.\n\n152\n00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:47.780\nWe will define in an upcoming conversation\nin yet another episode in this domain.\n\n153\n00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.070\nWe'll talk about a being a data processor,\n\n154\n00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:56.040\na term you heard in the GDPR privacy\nconversations in domain one.\n\n155\n00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.280\nWe'll talk about being the data owner.\n\n156\n00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.350\nWe can talk about stewardship and\ncustodianship of data.\n\n157\n00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.170\nThe oversight and management of\nthat on behalf of the owner is what\n\n158\n00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:12.470\nstewardship and custodianship or\ncustodial duties are centered around.\n\n159\n00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.430\nAnd so\nthe idea of defining these roles and\n\n160\n00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.900\nexplaining it a higher level, what\nthe expectations are and why we need them.\n\n161\n00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:24.760\nThen a policy is important to call\nout because these are structures and\n\n162\n00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:30.465\nformalities that we will then operate\nagainst and use to implement the policy,\n\n163\n00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:34.950\nthrough procedure of course,\nthrough guidelines and implementation of\n\n164\n00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.920\nthose procedures over time.\n&gt;&gt; Here I just thought it was, so\n\n165\n00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.550\nwe can point the big finger of blame.\n&gt;&gt; Well, if there is,\n\n166\n00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.330\nthere is something to that,\nall kidding aside, right?\n\n167\n00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.659\nSo certainly, we've talked about\nthe idea of the data ownership, role, or\n\n168\n00:09:47.659 --> 00:09:50.323\nwhoever the data,\nwhatever the data owner is,\n\n169\n00:09:50.323 --> 00:09:53.939\nbeing all up the entity that\ndecides on classification of data.\n\n170\n00:09:53.939 --> 00:09:58.266\nAnd of course overall, all up in\nthe organization is responsible for data,\n\n171\n00:09:58.266 --> 00:10:03.065\nmeaning, they bear ultimate responsibility\nbecause of data classification, and\n\n172\n00:10:03.065 --> 00:10:07.933\nrenewal of that classification through\nexamination during the timeline annually,\n\n173\n00:10:07.933 --> 00:10:09.706\nsemi-annually, whatever.\n\n174\n00:10:09.706 --> 00:10:13.169\nThey ultimately are responsible for\nthe disposition of data.\n\n175\n00:10:13.169 --> 00:10:17.616\nAnd if they get it wrong, we roll\nthat ball over to them and say, hey,\n\n176\n00:10:17.616 --> 00:10:19.210\nyou screwed this up.\n\n177\n00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.840\nBut they, the owner of the data,\n\n178\n00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.330\ndo not traditionally execute\nin the same way that stewards,\n\n179\n00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:32.790\nprocessors, overseers of\nthe data are gonna be different.\n\n180\n00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.900\nIn other words, managers of the data\nare different than practitioners that\n\n181\n00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.838\nwork with it, and maintained it everyday.\n\n182\n00:10:37.838 --> 00:10:42.770\nAnd so, well ownership implies\noverall responsibility, right.\n\n183\n00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:48.322\nThe idea is that individuals of active in\nprocessor role or active in stewardship or\n\n184\n00:10:48.322 --> 00:10:53.740\ncustodial role, or going to be doing so\nwith the guidance provided by the owner.\n\n185\n00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:58.085\nAnd as a result, our on point and you\ntypically have the hands on the data in\n\n186\n00:10:58.085 --> 00:11:02.922\na more fundamental way and they may screw\nsomething up because they act without due\n\n187\n00:11:02.922 --> 00:11:05.890\ncare and expose the data for\na variety of reasons.\n\n188\n00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:10.106\nAnd so, we could say they may be\nresponsible for a breach but ultimately,\n\n189\n00:11:10.106 --> 00:11:14.934\nthe data owner bears the overarching, all\nof responsibility of classification and\n\n190\n00:11:14.934 --> 00:11:18.820\nultimately disposition of that\ndata within the organization.\n\n191\n00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.910\nEven though they may not day to day,\nmoment to moment,\n\n192\n00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:24.310\nactually interact with and\nmanage the systems that control that data.\n\n193\n00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.600\nSo it is a dichotomy,\n\n194\n00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.260\nit's an interesting way of looking\nat the world in that respect.\n\n195\n00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.510\nPolicy and process are used to\nprovide access to data as we said,\n\n196\n00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:35.330\nbased on legal requests,\ntraditionally when we say legal request,\n\n197\n00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.670\nwhat we mean is just a formalized process\nwhatever that is in the organization.\n\n198\n00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:44.070\nYou may have a change request that\nyou have to go through and file.\n\n199\n00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:48.750\nYou may be able to submit\na request to a librarian or\n\n200\n00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:52.930\nsome sort of authority,\nfunction that maintains access and\n\n201\n00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:58.350\nvalidates the process as well as\nthe credentials of the requester.\n\n202\n00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.090\nYou may just be able to walk\nup Tto a file cabinet and\n\n203\n00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.990\npunch in a code and open it up and\npull out something.\n\n204\n00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.200\nIf you're authorized, you may have to sign\nin to get into a room to access the data.\n\n205\n00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.920\nThere are all these ways it can happen.\n\n206\n00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.204\nWhatever that process is, whatever that\nformally documented methodology is in\n\n207\n00:12:15.204 --> 00:12:19.748\nthe organization, when we say illegal\nrequest, that is what we're talking about.\n\n208\n00:12:19.748 --> 00:12:24.460\nIt's policy and process to provide access\nto data based on some sort of request.\n\n209\n00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:29.415\nMust be designed then implemented so that\nthey do not violate any access controls,\n\n210\n00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:33.896\nor any existing policies, ensuring\nonly the data subject to the request.\n\n211\n00:12:33.896 --> 00:12:37.070\nMeaning, the data that is\ngonna be a partitioned out or\n\n212\n00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:41.590\ncarved out in the request is made\navailable not exposing any unrelated data.\n\n213\n00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:44.780\nThis goes to back to this idea or\nthese ideas of privacy.\n\n214\n00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.700\nPersonally identifiable information and\nmanagement of pi, that we spoke about more\n\n215\n00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:52.390\nbroadly in the security and risk\nmanagement domain in other conversations.\n\n216\n00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.400\nWe'll see that come up\nin this domain again,\n\n217\n00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.580\nin the privacy discussion which\nhappens in this domain separately.\n\n218\n00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:02.693\nAnd again, there's a theme when you\ntend to see something more than once.\n\n219\n00:13:02.693 --> 00:13:06.638\nIt's a good indication, a good hint for\nyou, a good focal point for you,\n\n220\n00:13:06.638 --> 00:13:10.810\nthat it's a very important concept\nthat runs through multiple domains.\n\n221\n00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.920\nIt's very likely to be asked about\nfrom multiple vantage points, or\n\n222\n00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.230\nfrom different context points on the exam.\n\n223\n00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:21.460\nSo when we are thinking about\ndata policies, crafting them, and\n\n224\n00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.710\nunderstanding how to determine to\nmaintain ownership ultimately.\n\n225\n00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:27.430\nInformation and asset ownership.\n\n226\n00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:32.358\nWhat we have to think about is ensuring\nthat we do these things in this way that\n\n227\n00:13:32.358 --> 00:13:37.055\nwe are able to say, if you are\nlegitimately going to need access to data,\n\n228\n00:13:37.055 --> 00:13:38.450\nwe have a mechanism.\n\n229\n00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:43.740\nWhatever that is, that policy, that\npolicy you should call out, the process,\n\n230\n00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.260\nand the process should then\ndocument the actual steps involved.\n\n231\n00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.539\nAs I said,\nthere is a variety of ways to do this.\n\n232\n00:13:49.539 --> 00:13:53.410\nBut whatever process we follow,\nthat should allow for\n\n233\n00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:58.461\nauthorized individuals to legitimately\nrequest and be granted access\n\n234\n00:13:58.461 --> 00:14:03.426\nto data that is within their purview\nthat they are authorized to see but\n\n235\n00:14:03.426 --> 00:14:07.660\nin so doing disallow,\nprevent exposure or modification.\n\n236\n00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.620\nRemember, we have to think about\nthis from three perspectives.\n\n237\n00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:15.050\nExposure is confidentiality,\nmodification is integrity as well as\n\n238\n00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:19.470\navailability because anyone or all three\nof those being modified or breached or\n\n239\n00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:24.750\nsomehow rendered in or unavailable or\ninoperable would violate one or\n\n240\n00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.520\nmore of the pillars of\ninformation security management.\n\n241\n00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.870\nWe have to ensure as we give\naccess to authorized individuals\n\n242\n00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:35.320\nwithin the confines and\ndefine parameters of the procedure and\n\n243\n00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.600\nthe policy that we don't over extend and\ngive them more than they need.\n\n244\n00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.545\nThis idea of least privilege, you can\nextend that to least information access,\n\n245\n00:14:44.545 --> 00:14:48.120\nmeaning grant them access to\nwhat they need, but no more.\n\n246\n00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.161\nIf there is a requirement to then, request\nadditional levels or layers of access,\n\n247\n00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:55.797\nthey may be able to do that if they're\nauthorized, they would come back and\n\n248\n00:14:55.797 --> 00:14:58.840\nhave to go through another\nprocess in order to do so.\n\n249\n00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.170\nSo we wanna make sure we understand\nthe logic of structuring policy and\n\n250\n00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.560\nprocess to overlap and\nreinforce one another.\n\n251\n00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.640\nRemember, policy dictates your diligence.\n\n252\n00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.330\nThe why and the what process\nthrough due care drive by,\n\n253\n00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:15.860\noverseen by, directed by diligence.\n\n254\n00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.707\nAnswers and implements for us tactically,\na step-by-step of the how, the when,\n\n255\n00:15:20.707 --> 00:15:24.136\nthe where, right, and the who,\ntraditionally, right.\n\n256\n00:15:24.136 --> 00:15:28.856\nThose other areas we want to focus on cuz\nthose are tactical elements that have to\n\n257\n00:15:28.856 --> 00:15:34.650\nbe done within the parameter's specificity\nof the specific operation we're engaging.\n\n258\n00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:38.210\nThat's what process does,\nit defines for us or rather defines for\n\n259\n00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:43.320\nus the procedure, what we should be doing,\nwhen we should be doing it and\n\n260\n00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.100\nas a result, who and\nhow will be answered as well.\n\n261\n00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.550\nSo make sure we understand the logic here,\nbut it is important to think about\n\n262\n00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:54.660\nthe fact that as we establish as guiding\nframework, doctors for data management.\n\n263\n00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.390\nBut we can in theory say,\nasset management all up.\n\n264\n00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.180\nWe really are just focusing\non data here in particular.\n\n265\n00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:05.190\nBut as we define this framework for\nmanagement of data and assets.\n\n266\n00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:09.920\nThat we have to clearly understand\nthe difference, the distinction,\n\n267\n00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.270\nbetween due diligence and due care,\nbetween policy and process and procedure.\n\n268\n00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:17.850\nWhat role each part plays in\ndeveloping and reinforcing for\n\n269\n00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:22.970\nus, our defense in-depth thought processes\nare multiple overlapping layers,\n\n270\n00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:24.580\ncontrols and counter measures.\n\n271\n00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.430\nMutually reinforcing one another,\n\n272\n00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.260\nthat lead to our enterprise\nsecurity architecture.\n\n273\n00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.650\nVery, very important theme\nwe come back to time and\n\n274\n00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:32.840\ntime again.\n&gt;&gt; Well Adam,\n\n275\n00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.470\nit definitely a shorter episode.\n\n276\n00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.060\nBut the quality is very high.\n\n277\n00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.300\nSo it's not always about the quantity.\n\n278\n00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.058\nThat's right, we've talked about\nqualitative and quantitative stuff.\n\n279\n00:16:42.058 --> 00:16:44.500\nThat's qualitative here, great stuff.\n\n280\n00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:46.900\nAdam, thanks for joining us today and\ntalking about assets,\n\n281\n00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:52.100\nworking our way through the asset domain\npart and objectives of our CISSP.\n\n282\n00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.100\nBut it's a short episode today,\nso thanks for watching everyone,\n\n283\n00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.180\nI hope you got a lot of\ngreat information on that.\n\n284\n00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:01.358\nWe'll definitely come back with more of\nour CISSP series, so stick around for\n\n285\n00:17:01.358 --> 00:17:02.636\nthat for this episode.\n\n286\n00:17:02.636 --> 00:17:05.498\nSigning off for ITProTV,\nI've been your host, Daniel Lowrie.\n\n287\n00:17:05.498 --> 00:17:06.543\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n288\n00:17:06.543 --> 00:17:07.518\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n289\n00:17:07.518 -->

and\n\n7\n00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.380\njoining us back in\nthe studios is Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.155\nAdam, how are we doing today, sir?\n&gt;&gt; Doing well.\n\n9\n00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:27.376\nHow about you?\n&gt;&gt; I'm doing good.\n\n10\n00:00:27.376 --> 00:00:28.391\nBeen out a little bit but\nI am back and ready to get started.\n\n11\n00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:32.858\n&gt;&gt; Yes, we are glad to welcome you back.\n\n12\n00:00:32.858 --> 00:00:35.659\nYou've morphed from\nDaniel back to yourself.\n\n13\n00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:36.225\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n14\n00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:38.535\n&gt;&gt; Almost as tall, but a little more hair.\n\n15\n00:00:38.535 --> 00:00:39.145\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n16\n00:00:39.145 --> 00:00:40.894\n&gt;&gt; So you may have seen Daniel standing\n\n17\n00:00:40.894 --> 00:00:43.471\nwhere my partner in crime, Mr.\nWes, is standing.\n\n18\n00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:47.110\nNow you'll see him again in at\nleast one upcoming episode.\n\n19\n00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.290\nWe are rotating things around every so\noften.\n\n20\n00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.602\nBut we are in the middle of\ndiscussing asset security.\n\n21\n00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:56.900\nDomain two in terms of the,\ndomains that make up the CISSP CBK.\n\n22\n00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.697\nAnd if you have been following along with\nus, well you have seen both Daniel and\n\n23\n00:01:01.697 --> 00:01:05.048\nWes and I talking about risk and\nsecurity management.\n\n24\n00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:08.879\nAnd now asset security and\na lot of interesting stuff still to come.\n\n25\n00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:11.371\nBut in our discussions\narounnd asset security,\n\n26\n00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.969\nup until now we've talk about how\nto identify classify information.\n\n27\n00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.236\nAssets, we've differentiated\nthe fact information and, or\n\n28\n00:01:19.236 --> 00:01:23.500\ndata, we can see those terms\nare synonymous with one another,\n\n29\n00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.408\nare a type of asset but assets as\na category can indeed be much broader when\n\n30\n00:01:28.408 --> 00:01:32.134\nwe envision what they may\nbe within the organization.\n\n31\n00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:35.868\nAny and all of the stuff see behind me,\nmyself, Wes and, or\n\n32\n00:01:35.868 --> 00:01:38.336\nDaniel, the computers we're using,\n\n33\n00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:43.455\nthe tables that sit underneath our\ncomputers in our studios, the microphones.\n\n34\n00:01:43.455 --> 00:01:47.639\nAll of the fancy equipment we have here to\nmake all the magic happen along with all\n\n35\n00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:51.637\nthe people behind the camera that work\neven harder than we do to make the magic\n\n36\n00:01:51.637 --> 00:01:52.154\nhappen.\n\n37\n00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:56.258\nAll of those things in one form or\nanother can be considered assets and\n\n38\n00:01:56.258 --> 00:02:00.647\nindeed are assets in many organizations,\ndepending on the nature of what\n\n39\n00:02:00.647 --> 00:02:04.424\nyour organization does,\nthe kind of business they engage in.\n\n40\n00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:10.215\nSo we've talked about how to classify and\nhow to categorize information and assets.\n\n41\n00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:14.468\nTalked about the differences between\nthose two activities and what they mean.\n\n42\n00:02:14.468 --> 00:02:19.068\nRemember, classification is really about\nensuring the proper controls were applied\n\n43\n00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:21.280\nto the data, is driven by the data owner.\n\n44\n00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.655\nWhereas, categorization is really about\nunderstanding the impact of loss, or\n\n45\n00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:29.126\navailability, or use of that asset,\nwhatever we may think of,\n\n46\n00:02:29.126 --> 00:02:30.692\nhowever that may be framed.\n\n47\n00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:35.789\nWith regards to understanding the impact\nof risk around the management,\n\n48\n00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:39.089\nand potentially a lack\nof access to that asset.\n\n49\n00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.642\nWe've talked about determining and\nmaintaining information and\n\n50\n00:02:42.642 --> 00:02:45.687\nasset ownership, again,\nclearly differentiating and\n\n51\n00:02:45.687 --> 00:02:48.400\ndefining the role of the data or\nasset owner.\n\n52\n00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.467\nAnd remember, I made clear to you in\nseveral conversations that while we often\n\n53\n00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:58.613\nascribe ownership to an individual because\nit's just easier to say Taylor owns\n\n54\n00:02:58.613 --> 00:03:03.908\nthat asset, or Megan is responsible for\nthat asset and is the owner, or the person\n\n55\n00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:09.093\nof record, or whatever you may hear with\nregards to that in your organization.\n\n56\n00:03:09.093 --> 00:03:11.453\nCuz you hear different terminology,\n\n57\n00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:16.244\ndifferent ways of describing ownership,\nbut ultimately we say so and so\n\n58\n00:03:16.244 --> 00:03:20.471\nis the owner of that particular\nline of business for that resource.\n\n59\n00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:25.782\nThe reality is that it's an asset that\nthe business owns and that person is not\n\n60\n00:03:25.782 --> 00:03:31.597\ntruly the owner but rather more often than\nnot, is acting on behalf of the business.\n\n61\n00:03:31.597 --> 00:03:36.127\nOr the organization to represent ownership\nof that, in terms of responsibility,\n\n62\n00:03:36.127 --> 00:03:40.700\naccountability, and in terms of all the\nthings that have to happen around that.\n\n63\n00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.690\nSo, we do say, hey so and so\nis the owner of that asset, but\n\n64\n00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.247\nit's very unlikely in a business setting,\nthat that person truly is the owner.\n\n65\n00:03:50.247 --> 00:03:54.360\nIt's really more that the business\nrepresents ownership by assigning and\n\n66\n00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.536\nascribing that role to one or more\nindividuals for purposes of management,\n\n67\n00:03:58.536 --> 00:04:02.399\nease of tracking, audit ability and\nall the things that go with that.\n\n68\n00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:04.644\nSo don't get confused by that.\n\n69\n00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:08.615\nWhen we say data ownership and\nwe talk about data ownership in regards to\n\n70\n00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:11.475\nthe data or\ninformation as an asset specifically.\n\n71\n00:04:11.475 --> 00:04:15.124\nAnd we say it's the data owner\nthat is ultimately responsible for\n\n72\n00:04:15.124 --> 00:04:19.436\ndriving classification of the asset,\nwhat we mean is whoever the individual\n\n73\n00:04:19.436 --> 00:04:22.686\nof record is that is responsible\non paper for ownership and\n\n74\n00:04:22.686 --> 00:04:26.830\noversight of that asset is the person\nthat we talk about as the data owner.\n\n75\n00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.820\nBut do keep in mind, it can actually be\nan entity as opposed to an individual,\n\n76\n00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.070\nand we just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n77\n00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.500\nAll that's come through the first\ncouple of conversations we've had.\n\n78\n00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.480\nJoin me here.\n\n79\n00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.140\nLet's talk about where we are going\nnow that we know where we have been.\n\n80\n00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.548\nSo under asset security domain two,\nas I mentioned in the CISSP CBK,\n\n81\n00:04:45.548 --> 00:04:50.567\nyou could see we are more or less right\nin the middle there protecting privacy.\n\n82\n00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:53.447\nNow this is a conversation\nthat this young gentleman\n\n83\n00:04:53.447 --> 00:04:55.053\nwho is rather tall.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n84\n00:04:55.053 --> 00:04:56.696\n&gt;&gt; And smiling off camera here\n\n85\n00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:57.699\nwith me has had.\n\n86\n00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.023\nYou and I were together as we did\nthis conversation in the security and\n\n87\n00:05:01.023 --> 00:05:03.170\nrisk management area in domain one.\n\n88\n00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.475\nTalked extensively about\nhow to define privacy.\n\n89\n00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:10.300\nP-I-I, personally\nidentifiable information, PII\n\n90\n00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.110\nas a category of interest and importance\nin particular in regards to privacy.\n\n91\n00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.344\nWe spoke extensively\nabout privacy frameworks.\n\n92\n00:05:18.344 --> 00:05:22.880\nThe OECD core principles, we'll return\nback to one of those core principals.\n\n93\n00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.089\nAs part of this conversation\nwe'll remind you about them.\n\n94\n00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:31.220\nWe talked also about regulatory issues and\nconcerns around GDPR.\n\n95\n00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.994\nGeneral Data Privacy or General Data\nProtection Regulation that has gone\n\n96\n00:05:35.994 --> 00:05:39.074\ninto effect in the EU in\nthe last several weeks.\n\n97\n00:05:39.074 --> 00:05:42.778\nWe had a pretty thorough conversation,\nindeed a couple of episodes,\n\n98\n00:05:42.778 --> 00:05:45.870\nif I remember correctly,\naround the importance of GDPR.\n\n99\n00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.795\nThat fact that it is supplanting and\ntaking the place of the earlier attempt at\n\n100\n00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:54.608\nregulation around privacy,\nEU EC directive 95/46.\n\n101\n00:05:54.608 --> 00:05:59.162\nTalked about things like safe harbor,\nwe've talked about a lot of things that\n\n102\n00:05:59.162 --> 00:06:03.860\ndeal with privacy already in the framework\nof security and risk management.\n\n103\n00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.882\nSo, we're gonna remind you\nof those conversations.\n\n104\n00:06:06.882 --> 00:06:09.435\nWe're not gonna have them\nagain cuz you can go back and\n\n105\n00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:10.809\nwatch those in the library.\n\n106\n00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:12.826\nWe'd encourage you to do that and\n\n107\n00:06:12.826 --> 00:06:17.294\nI will often point out places in our\nconversations, episode to episode,\n\n108\n00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:22.572\ntopic to topic, domain to domain, where\nthere is close pollination and dependency.\n\n109\n00:06:22.572 --> 00:06:27.545\nAnd therefore you can build bridges and\ncreate in your minds hopefully connections\n\n110\n00:06:27.545 --> 00:06:32.020\nthat reinforce key concepts and\nideas like due care and due diligence.\n\n111\n00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.130\nLike confidentiality,\nintegrity and availability.\n\n112\n00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.540\nLike ownership and how we define that with\nregards to this position of an asset,\n\n113\n00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.300\ndata in particular being\none type of asset.\n\n114\n00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.063\nThese are central themes that\nrun throughout multiple areas,\n\n115\n00:06:47.063 --> 00:06:48.699\nacross multiple domains.\n\n116\n00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.386\nAnd we have to pick up on them.\n\n117\n00:06:50.386 --> 00:06:55.215\nWe have to recognize them and we have to\nbe aware of them in order to apply that\n\n118\n00:06:55.215 --> 00:06:59.894\nknowledge correctly within the various\ndomains based on the question or\n\n119\n00:06:59.894 --> 00:07:05.129\nquestions we may see across the exam,\ndepending on what area they may come from.\n\n120\n00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:06.720\nRemember, we have no way of knowing.\n\n121\n00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.800\nOn the exam, you can kind of surmise\nif you get a question about ports and\n\n122\n00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.084\nabout networks, probably a safe bet it\nhas something to do with the network\n\n123\n00:07:15.084 --> 00:07:17.602\ncommunications security domain, right?\n\n124\n00:07:17.602 --> 00:07:19.962\nBut while you may be able to discern or\n\n125\n00:07:19.962 --> 00:07:23.019\npick out what domain\na question is coming from.\n\n126\n00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:25.207\nAt a high level,\nit's not really important, nor\n\n127\n00:07:25.207 --> 00:07:27.875\nis it a goal of answering\nthe question correctly on the exam.\n\n128\n00:07:27.875 --> 00:07:31.911\nIt's actually just a waste of time, quite\nhonestly, for you to be thinking that way,\n\n129\n00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:33.916\nand it's just not relevant or important.\n\n130\n00:07:33.916 --> 00:07:37.542\nBut it is important to understand\nthat regardless of what domain,\n\n131\n00:07:37.542 --> 00:07:40.069\nwhat knowledge area, a question addresses,\n\n132\n00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:43.780\nthere are central themes that\nare gonna be consistent throughout.\n\n133\n00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:47.568\nAnd then there's unique specific\ninformation related to that particular\n\n134\n00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:50.888\ntopic or question that may be\nrelevant to your ability to answer.\n\n135\n00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:55.512\nSynthesizing and bringing together both\nof those streams, unlike in Ghostbusters\n\n136\n00:07:55.512 --> 00:07:59.043\nwhere they say, never,\nnever ever cross the streams, right?\n\n137\n00:07:59.043 --> 00:08:00.682\nDon't listen to them, right?\n\n138\n00:08:00.682 --> 00:08:01.793\nCross the streams.\n\n139\n00:08:01.793 --> 00:08:03.950\nThat's the secret to success.\n\n140\n00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.752\nI keep talking about\nthe idea of synthesizing and\n\n141\n00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:08.473\nblending this information.\n\n142\n00:08:08.473 --> 00:08:10.190\nNot gonna be as simple as hey.\n\n143\n00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.870\nSometimes it will, right?\n\n144\n00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.600\nPort 443.\n\n145\n00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.520\nWhat does that have to do with this,\nthis, this or this?\n\n146\n00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:18.550\nIt may be a simple question with\na relatively straightforward path\n\n147\n00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:19.590\nto an answer.\n\n148\n00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.450\nMore often than not it's\ninformation within the question\n\n149\n00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.570\nthat has to be interpreted,\nbuilt through or\n\n150\n00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:30.470\nbuilt around some sort of contextual idea\nthat then will lead you to an answer.\n\n151\n00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.040\nBut it is a derivative answer.\n\n152\n00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.680\nIt's not one that is straightforward.\n\n153\n00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.390\nNot one that is obvious on first glance.\n\n154\n00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.850\nSo keep that in mind.\n\n155\n00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.320\nHaving said that we're gonna\ntalk about protecting privacy.\n\n156\n00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.660\nSo please join me here if you will.\n\n157\n00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:46.400\nLet's take a look, there we go,\nat some of our conversation topics\n\n158\n00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.900\nbefore we delve into\nthe sub-areas as we often do.\n\n159\n00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.390\nAnd remember there\nare the number of items often so\n\n160\n00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.360\ndefinition of data ownership\nreminding us of that.\n\n161\n00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.090\nDefinition of data processing\nas a role in the data processor,\n\n162\n00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.020\nhearken back to GDPR conversations\nreminding us of that,\n\n163\n00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.510\ndefinition of data remanence,\nwhat that is.\n\n164\n00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.670\nWe talked about residual risk,\nthis is essentially residual data but\n\n165\n00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.660\nwe call it data remanence,\nwe'll talk about that and what it is.\n\n166\n00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.770\nDifferent ways to address,\nmedia sanitization, clearing, purging, and\n\n167\n00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:18.900\ndestruction.\n\n168\n00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.910\nMechanisms and methodologies.\n\n169\n00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.246\nWe'll talk a bit about\nthe differences between SSD and HDD.\n\n170\n00:09:24.246 --> 00:09:26.263\nThat's gonna be Wes's topic of choice,\n\n171\n00:09:26.263 --> 00:09:29.820\nwe'll let him speak about that cuz\nhe knows all about those things.\n\n172\n00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.324\nAnd collection limitation,\n\n173\n00:09:31.324 --> 00:09:34.560\nwhich is where we harken back\nto the OECD core principles.\n\n174\n00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.660\nBefore we go through these major\nareas that we have to touch on,\n\n175\n00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.880\nit's important sometimes to throw some\nvocabulary and terminology your way,\n\n176\n00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:41.920\nas we often try to do.\n\n177\n00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.695\nI often try to put those up at\nthe top of the notes, separate them or\n\n178\n00:09:45.695 --> 00:09:48.420\nset them off with some sort of dotted or\n\n179\n00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:52.850\ndashed line to create a section where we\ncan kind of focus andpend a few minutes.\n\n180\n00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:56.960\nAnd so you'll see at the top here\nwe have two terms, quality control,\n\n181\n00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.340\nquality assurance, QA, QC.\n\n182\n00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:04.040\nTerms you often will hear in application\ndevelopment, software development and\n\n183\n00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.250\nsystem development life cycle\nmethodology conversations.\n\n184\n00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:11.980\nIn validation, verification,\nactivities in certification and\n\n185\n00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:13.500\naccreditation activities.\n\n186\n00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.750\nWe will often hear these kinds of\nterms thrown around and discussed.\n\n187\n00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:22.750\nAnd certainly if you do any\nkind of work in staging and\n\n188\n00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:27.520\nSDLC management with regards to\nproduction of some sort of system,\n\n189\n00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.880\nsome sort of application,\nsome sort of offering.\n\n190\n00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.440\nWhen you walk through the well\ndefined phases of that methodology.\n\n191\n00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.390\nWe'll be talking about those in depth\nin Domain 8 and upcoming conversations.\n\n192\n00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.250\nWhen you do those things,\nyou will learn very quick quickly,\n\n193\n00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.790\nif you don't already know that QA and\n\n194\n00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.970\nQC activities are integral to what\nwe do in terms of success and\n\n195\n00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.750\nvalidation and understanding at one or\nmore stages in that process.\n\n196\n00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:54.770\nWhat we have done and\n\n197\n00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:59.060\nwhether what we have done is aligning\nwith business requirements, the strategic\n\n198\n00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.920\nimperatives andfunctional imperatives\nthat the customer, stakeholder, whoever,\n\n199\n00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.810\nwhatever they are have shared with us and\ntold us are important.\n\n200\n00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:12.845\nAnd this is a way to not assume, but\nrather to beyond reasonable doubt verify\n\n201\n00:11:12.845 --> 00:11:17.960\nand validate against a known set of\nexpectations, that we are doing things we\n\n202\n00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:23.076\nknow will meet with approval and will\ntarget and therefore, allow us to say,\n\n203\n00:11:23.076 --> 00:11:29.010\nwe have been successful based on that\nstandard or based on those specifications.\n\n204\n00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.930\nSo it's a very important set of skills and\n\n205\n00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.190\nideas that we talked about\nas we get started here.\n\n206\n00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.365\nYou may question,\nwhy do we put them in here,\n\n207\n00:11:35.365 --> 00:11:38.635\nwhy do we discuss them with\nregards to protecting privacy?\n\n208\n00:11:38.635 --> 00:11:43.615\nDon't they belong, more formally,\nmore properly, as you were suggesting\n\n209\n00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:46.945\na minute ago, Adam, maybe in domain aid,\naround software engineering,\n\n210\n00:11:46.945 --> 00:11:51.445\nwhere we deal with these kind of things,\nand SDLCs and development cycles overall.\n\n211\n00:11:51.445 --> 00:11:53.455\nAnd you're right,\nthey certainly have a place there, and\n\n212\n00:11:53.455 --> 00:11:55.560\nyou will hear me refer\nto them there as well.\n\n213\n00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.693\nBut it's important to think about\nthem here even though that maynot be\n\n214\n00:11:58.693 --> 00:12:00.402\nself-evident and obvious up front.\n\n215\n00:12:00.402 --> 00:12:03.658\nBecause as we think about\nhow we apply terminology,\n\n216\n00:12:03.658 --> 00:12:08.624\nwe've already actually specified and\ntalked about that in earlier episodes.\n\n217\n00:12:08.624 --> 00:12:12.128\nStandards, processes, procedures, policy.\n\n218\n00:12:12.128 --> 00:12:14.408\nYou may have heard me, hopefully you\ndid hear me talk about those things.\n\n219\n00:12:14.408 --> 00:12:17.696\nIf not, important to go back,\ntake a look at those episodes,\n\n220\n00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:19.862\nremind yourself of those definitions.\n\n221\n00:12:19.862 --> 00:12:25.523\nBut as you can see we assess the quality\ninternally of these areas to look at and\n\n222\n00:12:25.523 --> 00:12:28.330\nunderstand the controls.\n\n223\n00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:33.170\nCountermeasures, we talked about those,\nof and around our monitoring of quality.\n\n224\n00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.064\nIt’s important to think about this\nwith regards protection of privacy.\n\n225\n00:12:36.064 --> 00:12:40.069\nBecause what better place to assess\nour ability to prove that we are doing\n\n226\n00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:43.549\nthe things the right way they need\nto be done, and doing them for\n\n227\n00:12:43.549 --> 00:12:47.687\nthe right reasons than with regards\nto confidentiality, integrity, and\n\n228\n00:12:47.687 --> 00:12:50.020\navailability of information.\n\n229\n00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.690\nPersonally identifiable\ninformation as an asset.\n\n230\n00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:56.300\nThis is a great place to think\nabout not just what we do.\n\n231\n00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.260\nBut validating we're doing it the right\nway, and making sure that we are aligning\n\n232\n00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.220\nwith the requirements that drive\nus to do it the right way.\n\n233\n00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.820\nThis is a prototypical example of\nhow we can distill down due care and\n\n234\n00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:10.750\ndue diligence, and ensure that we are\nvalidating that both are being applied.\n\n235\n00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:13.400\nThat's why they're here\namong many other areas.\n\n236\n00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:16.352\nBut a very important for\nus to talk about them.\n\n237\n00:13:16.352 --> 00:13:17.910\n&gt;&gt; I'm not too familiar,\n\n238\n00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:18.630\nI guess I should say,\n\n239\n00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.870\nwith things like SDLC, whether it's system\nor software development life cycles.\n\n240\n00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.010\nAnd I've certainly heard that these terms\nand acronyms have been thrown around.\n\n241\n00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:28.569\nAnd I know that I've seen other\npeople erroneously think that hey,\n\n242\n00:13:28.569 --> 00:13:29.950\nthey're one in the same.\n\n243\n00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:35.330\nBut they're definitely clear,\ndistinct differences between QA QC yeah.\n\n244\n00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:39.020\nAny particular order on this one or\nis it just how they landed?\n\n245\n00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.440\n&gt;&gt; Just got to make sure we know what\n\n246\n00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.270\nthey are.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n247\n00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.666\n&gt;&gt; There's no reason why we would put\n\n248\n00:13:43.666 --> 00:13:46.160\nQC and/or QA first, second.\n&gt;&gt; Okay.\n\n249\n00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.580\n&gt;&gt; Yeah that kind of thing if you're one\n\n250\n00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.380\nof those people that just\nlikes your world ordered.\n\n251\n00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.680\nI guess QA would come first\nbecause A comes before C.\n\n252\n00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.110\nBut you know that,\nthat's just the way it is.\n\n253\n00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.150\nCertainly they both are equally important.\n\n254\n00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.290\nThey both play a role on in\ndifferent aspects of what we do.\n\n255\n00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.985\nThe key pivot point,\ngo back to the items if you could, please.\n\n256\n00:14:03.985 --> 00:14:06.980\nI didn't get a chance to finish really\nthe discussion between the two.\n\n257\n00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.410\nReally just kinda start\nharping a little bit on QC.\n\n258\n00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.560\nBut you can see here, and\nI did mention one, but\n\n259\n00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.700\nI didn't get a chance to juxtapose,\ncompare it to the other.\n\n260\n00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.780\nBut the key difference or\npivot point here,\n\n261\n00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:22.250\nand one thing I don't like about Notepad\nis you can't highlight two things at once.\n\n262\n00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:26.610\nRight, but the key pivot point here is the\nfocus on the difference between internal\n\n263\n00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:27.260\nand external.\n\n264\n00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.420\nIn other words,\n\n265\n00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:33.830\nQC is an activity that is designed to\nbe executed and focused internally.\n\n266\n00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:37.990\nWithin the business, the process,\nwhatever it is we're doing.\n\n267\n00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:42.720\nWhereas QA is essentially\nthe mirror image of that, but\n\n268\n00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.220\nis really designed to focus on\nthe external aspects of that.\n\n269\n00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:53.230\nAnd as a result, we are able to, from the\ninternal customer and internal perspective\n\n270\n00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:58.280\nand the external customer and the external\nperspective, have two mechanisms.\n\n271\n00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.380\nThat allow us to ensure and\n\n272\n00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:04.050\nvalidate that we are aligned,\nas I was suggesting a moment ago.\n\n273\n00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:08.470\nBut the key pivot point for you to\nunderstand is that QC is an internal\n\n274\n00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:14.350\nfocused activity, whereas QA is\ndefined as an external focus activity.\n\n275\n00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.640\nSo please make sure you are aware of that,\n\n276\n00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.140\nbecause that will be\na key decision point for\n\n277\n00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.910\nyou with regards to where you may apply\none or the other if asked about them.\n\n278\n00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:29.950\nGiven a scenario and asked to decide which\nprocess would be the appropriate one,\n\n279\n00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.700\nit really comes down to whether you're\nlooking into assessing internally or\n\n280\n00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.770\nlooking into assessing externally.\n\n281\n00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:38.290\nAnd as a result, you would apply one or\nthe other or maybe both, but\n\n282\n00:15:38.290 --> 00:15:41.300\nmaybe in a certain order\nin the process flow or\n\n283\n00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.840\nin the timeline chain,\ndepending on where you are looking.\n\n284\n00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.351\nWe obviously have some\nspecific guidance and\n\n285\n00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:51.842\nIn many questions we indicate one path or\nanother, we’d have to pick up on that,\n\n286\n00:15:51.842 --> 00:15:54.367\nhowever subtle or\nhowever obvious it may be.\n\n287\n00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:57.283\nSo make sure you understand the difference\nbetween the two, it is important.\n\n288\n00:15:57.283 --> 00:16:02.147\nSo I suggestrf one of the reasons I felt\nit was good to bring this up here Is that\n\n289\n00:16:02.147 --> 00:16:06.840\nit's critical for us to be able\nto provide validation and proof.\n\n290\n00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.859\nNot just verbal confirmation but\n\n291\n00:16:08.859 --> 00:16:12.689\nactual documentary proof that\nwe are engaging in activities.\n\n292\n00:16:12.689 --> 00:16:19.007\nEspecially with regards to asset security,\nwith regards to the protection of privacy,\n\n293\n00:16:19.007 --> 00:16:24.668\nensuring confidentiality of assets if\nthey are information and data related.\n\n294\n00:16:24.668 --> 00:16:27.983\nEnsuring integrity, again,\nif they're in that category.\n\n295\n00:16:27.983 --> 00:16:31.508\nEnsuring availability, really,\nregardless of what the asset is.\n\n296\n00:16:31.508 --> 00:16:34.468\nIt's important for\nus to be able to validate it and\n\n297\n00:16:34.468 --> 00:16:38.910\nverify audit perspective as well as\nfrom a documentation perspective that\n\n298\n00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:42.574\nwe're doing things prior to having\na problem in ways that will\n\n299\n00:16:42.574 --> 00:16:45.409\nhopefully mitigate risk\nas we've discussed.\n\n300\n00:16:45.409 --> 00:16:50.129\nAnd so QC capabilities focused\ninternally help us to validate those\n\n301\n00:16:50.129 --> 00:16:53.937\nactivities in the minds of our strategy,\nproviders,\n\n302\n00:16:53.937 --> 00:16:59.450\nour senior leaders, in the minds\nof our stakeholders, customers.\n\n303\n00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.954\nRemember, we have customers,\nboth internal and external, and\n\n304\n00:17:02.954 --> 00:17:07.350\nwe have to always focus on the fact we do\nneed to validate across both platforms, or\n\n305\n00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:09.601\nrather across both audience verticals.\n\n306\n00:17:09.601 --> 00:17:12.072\nIn order to ensure we're\nreally doing our job and\n\n307\n00:17:12.072 --> 00:17:15.520\nexercising the appropriate level\nof oversight and due diligence.\n\n308\n00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.830\nSo that we can validate in the minds\nin both customer segments for\n\n309\n00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:22.470\nthose particular segments with those\nrequirements what we're doing.\n\n310\n00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:26.340\nSo understand the difference here,\nit is important, internal versus external.\n\n311\n00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.967\nIt's another great way to\nthink about QC versus QA.\n\n312\n00:17:28.967 --> 00:17:31.053\nAll right, so data ownership.\n\n313\n00:17:31.053 --> 00:17:33.088\nWhat is data ownership all about?\n\n314\n00:17:33.088 --> 00:17:36.740\nWell I summarize that they're\nsaying masters of all meaning.\n\n315\n00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.126\nThe data owners, as we've already\ndiscussed in the introductory remarks\n\n316\n00:17:40.126 --> 00:17:43.309\nhere, determine data's impact on\nthe mission of the organization.\n\n317\n00:17:43.309 --> 00:17:46.474\nThey are responsible for\nclassification of data,\n\n318\n00:17:46.474 --> 00:17:50.311\nultimately all up as we made\nthe case in other conversations.\n\n319\n00:17:50.311 --> 00:17:51.489\nAnd should help us and\n\n320\n00:17:51.489 --> 00:17:56.020\nreally think through how to understand\nthe replacement cost to the information.\n\n321\n00:17:56.020 --> 00:17:57.697\nIf indeed, it can be replaced.\n\n322\n00:17:57.697 --> 00:18:00.854\nSome information may or\nmay not be able to be replaced.\n\n323\n00:18:00.854 --> 00:18:05.685\nIt may or may not be timely,\nit may or may not be financially and,\n\n324\n00:18:05.685 --> 00:18:10.120\nor for other reasons,\nfeasible to replace that data.\n\n325\n00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.270\nIt may have been a moment in time, a piece\nof data that is no longer relevant but\n\n326\n00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.130\nif we had it would be nice.\n\n327\n00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:20.470\nThe amount of heavy lift and detail\nassociated with reproducing the data.\n\n328\n00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:25.260\nMaybe it's too much to understand or\npotentially take on.\n\n329\n00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:30.228\nOr there just may not be a burning need or\ndesire to spend those resource hours and\n\n330\n00:18:30.228 --> 00:18:34.710\ndollars doing this when we can\nredirect into something different.\n\n331\n00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:38.440\nThere's lots of reasons why data may or\nassets in general may or\n\n332\n00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.272\nmay not be replaced at any given moment in\ntime, but the data owner needs to help us\n\n333\n00:18:43.272 --> 00:18:47.140\nto understand what those kind\nof replacement costs may be.\n\n334\n00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.483\nAnd to understand the logic of that,\nif it comes down to that.\n\n335\n00:18:51.483 --> 00:18:55.030\nThey also have to determine who may have\na need for the data, in terms of accessing\n\n336\n00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:58.960\nit, and under what circumstances the data\nshould be made available or released.\n\n337\n00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.250\nThis is really the function of coming back\nto classification as we've talked about,\n\n338\n00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:05.840\nand identifying when data is inaccurate,\nor no longer needed and\n\n339\n00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.010\nshould be destroyed.\n\n340\n00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:11.412\nWe talked about this a little\nbit in some respects earlier.\n\n341\n00:19:11.412 --> 00:19:14.580\nWe will talk about it again in\nsome of the future conversations\n\n342\n00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.370\nin asset security regards to retention.\n\n343\n00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:19.560\nUnderstanding data retention periods.\n\n344\n00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.581\nWhen data needs to be kept for how long,\nis often a legal conversation.\n\n345\n00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:28.550\nThere are typically regulatory and\nstatutory concerns we have be aware of and\n\n346\n00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:29.232\nalign with.\n\n347\n00:19:29.232 --> 00:19:33.170\nAnd may vary by area, by geography, etc.\n\n348\n00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:38.167\nThere's usually going to be at a minimum,\nin the United States there are federal\n\n349\n00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:43.092\nrequirements around business records\nspecific to things like tax filings that\n\n350\n00:19:43.092 --> 00:19:46.635\nmust be kept regardless of\nwhat state you do business in.\n\n351\n00:19:46.635 --> 00:19:49.397\nThis is a federal as opposed\nto a state requirement.\n\n352\n00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:53.269\nSo all businesses have to\nmaintain these records for\n\n353\n00:19:53.269 --> 00:19:57.759\na minimum of seven years,\nbased on current IRS guidelines.\n\n354\n00:19:57.759 --> 00:20:02.107\nIn Germany, for instance, that\ntranslates into a ten year requirement.\n\n355\n00:20:02.107 --> 00:20:06.268\nFor very similar reasons, different\nby country and it can obviously vary.\n\n356\n00:20:06.268 --> 00:20:10.531\nThere may be state requirements that\nmay speak to certain aspects of\n\n357\n00:20:10.531 --> 00:20:14.436\nthis that may or may not trump or\nbe aligned with or lateral to.\n\n358\n00:20:14.436 --> 00:20:17.411\nOther regulations you have to be\ninvolved with depending on the nature of\n\n359\n00:20:17.411 --> 00:20:18.375\nthe business.\n\n360\n00:20:18.375 --> 00:20:22.145\nIn certain industries,\nusing certain kinds of information,\n\n361\n00:20:22.145 --> 00:20:25.515\nyou may have a requirement to maintain and\nto categorize,\n\n362\n00:20:25.515 --> 00:20:30.955\nclassify data using some very stringent\nguidelinest hat really are non-negotiable.\n\n363\n00:20:30.955 --> 00:20:33.375\nWe talked about that a little bit already.\n\n364\n00:20:33.375 --> 00:20:36.910\nWe'll talk about it again some\nmore in upcoming conversations.\n\n365\n00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:41.124\nBut for instance, around the management of\npatient and electronic health records or\n\n366\n00:20:41.124 --> 00:20:44.004\nmedical records,\ndata in the United States under HIIPA.\n\n367\n00:20:44.004 --> 00:20:48.559\nWith regards to financial services,\nregulatory compliance in\n\n368\n00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:53.367\nthe banking industry with regards\nto public traded companies, and\n\n369\n00:20:53.367 --> 00:20:56.927\nSarbates Oxley compliance\nin the United States.\n\n370\n00:20:56.927 --> 00:21:01.903\nThe Basal Accords that are broad and\nencompassing around financial services and\n\n371\n00:21:01.903 --> 00:21:03.154\nbanking globally.\n\n372\n00:21:03.154 --> 00:21:07.908\nThese are the kinds of things that we just\nhave to be aware of if we work in that\n\n373\n00:21:07.908 --> 00:21:12.362\nindustry and that may very well\ntarget information and discussions or\n\n374\n00:21:12.362 --> 00:21:15.457\nassets that are data and\ninformation related and\n\n375\n00:21:15.457 --> 00:21:19.251\ndiscussions in ways that we may or\nmay not have any say over.\n\n376\n00:21:19.251 --> 00:21:23.463\nWe may just have to apply whatever\nthat is and then manage and\n\n377\n00:21:23.463 --> 00:21:28.444\nmonitor accordingly, or we may have\nthe ability to decide on our own.\n\n378\n00:21:28.444 --> 00:21:31.206\nPrivately held companies that\nhave no public exposure.\n\n379\n00:21:31.206 --> 00:21:35.526\nThey don't issue stock,\nthey don't engage with stakeholders and\n\n380\n00:21:35.526 --> 00:21:39.170\ntake their money in exchange for\na share in the business.\n\n381\n00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.586\nThose kinds of companies that\nare privately held are managed under\n\n382\n00:21:42.586 --> 00:21:43.934\na different set of rules.\n\n383\n00:21:43.934 --> 00:21:47.951\nIn the sense that they don't have to\nalign with some of the requirements that\n\n384\n00:21:47.951 --> 00:21:52.580\nSarbanes Oxley, for instance, puts into\neffect for publicly traded companies.\n\n385\n00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.774\nThey don't have to report the same way\nthat a publicly held company does.\n\n386\n00:21:56.774 --> 00:22:01.518\nThey don't have to behave in\nsome areas at the same level.\n\n387\n00:22:01.518 --> 00:22:05.679\nNot suggesting that means that they can\ngo act in unethical or illegal ways,\n\n388\n00:22:05.679 --> 00:22:06.857\nquite the opposite.\n\n389\n00:22:06.857 --> 00:22:09.027\nThey cannot do that regardless, but\n\n390\n00:22:09.027 --> 00:22:13.647\nthey just don't have the same level of\nscrutiny and regulatory compliance and\n\n391\n00:22:13.647 --> 00:22:18.790\nconcerns in terms of things they must do\nin order to be considered to be compliant.\n\n392\n00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:23.000\nSo they may choose to not retain data for\ncertain reasons at certain levels.\n\n393\n00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.166\nThat's up to them.\n\n394\n00:22:24.166 --> 00:22:26.081\nSo there are many,\nmany ways we could go here.\n\n395\n00:22:26.081 --> 00:22:30.783\nThe point is data ownership is really\nthe pivot point in the organization with\n\n396\n00:22:30.783 --> 00:22:35.775\nregards to how those decisions get made if\nthere is any opportunity to interpret or\n\n397\n00:22:35.775 --> 00:22:39.492\nmodify our stance,\ndata owners have to be involved in that.\n\n398\n00:22:39.492 --> 00:22:43.065\nEven if the mandate comes down and\nwe say hey, do a, do b, do c,\n\n399\n00:22:43.065 --> 00:22:44.772\nno exception, must be done.\n\n400\n00:22:44.772 --> 00:22:48.411\nData owners still have to be involved\nbecause they have to say, okay,\n\n401\n00:22:48.411 --> 00:22:50.703\nthis is what we're doing, due diligence.\n\n402\n00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:56.017\nLet's provide oversight and frame the\nguidance so that those that execute with\n\n403\n00:22:56.017 --> 00:23:01.028\ndue care understand how to operate and\nthere's no kind of funny business.\n\n404\n00:23:01.028 --> 00:23:04.479\nNobody saysn I thought this, we didn't\ndo this, we did that, I thought that.\n\n405\n00:23:04.479 --> 00:23:05.330\nIt's very clear and concise.\n\n406\n00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.809\nCommunicated, everybody's\non the same page.\n\n407\n00:23:07.809 --> 00:23:10.392\nStandardized and\neverybody does the same thing.\n\n408\n00:23:10.392 --> 00:23:14.382\nWe need data owners involvement to be\nable to frame those conversations and\n\n409\n00:23:14.382 --> 00:23:18.243\nhelp us to ensure that we create that\nculture of security that broadly and\n\n410\n00:23:18.243 --> 00:23:21.691\nwidely communicates the information\nwe need to be successful.\n\n411\n00:23:21.691 --> 00:23:22.677\nJoin me back here.\n\n412\n00:23:22.677 --> 00:23:27.332\nData processors, they are instead of\nowners of all, they are managers of all,\n\n413\n00:23:27.332 --> 00:23:29.300\non behalf of the data owner.\n\n414\n00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:34.958\nWe talked about this with regards to\nGDPR in particular, where we saw and\n\n415\n00:23:34.958 --> 00:23:40.733\nfocused on the idea of carving out\na role called the data process, right?\n\n416\n00:23:40.733 --> 00:23:45.749\nWhich is gonna be the doer that is gonna\ninteract with, manage, and execute on\n\n417\n00:23:45.749 --> 00:23:50.846\nthings having to do with data and privacy\nrights around data everyday, right?\n\n418\n00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:53.613\nThey are the ones that\nare on the front lines.\n\n419\n00:23:53.613 --> 00:23:56.335\nWhere we see this being important is\n\n420\n00:23:56.335 --> 00:24:00.696\nthe idea that the processors\nact on behalf of the owners.\n\n421\n00:24:00.696 --> 00:24:05.470\nAnd so the processors exercise or\nshould exercise due care.\n\n422\n00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:10.190\nWhereas data owners should provide,\nthrough due diligence, the ability and\n\n423\n00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:14.460\nthe guidance required for\nthe processors to act with due care.\n\n424\n00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.450\nAdherence to appropriate and\nrelevant data policy and\n\n425\n00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.970\nownership guidelines is under\nthe purview of the processor.\n\n426\n00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.610\nEnsuring accessibility\nto appropriate users,\n\n427\n00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.070\nmaintaining appropriate levels of data\nsecurity and/or dataset or asset security.\n\n428\n00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:30.420\nYou can kind of interpret that and\nput any word in there.\n\n429\n00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.810\nIt would be the same thing.\n\n430\n00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:35.060\nThat is gonna be the space\nthe processors inhabit.\n\n431\n00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.990\nThey are responsible for\nfront line maintenance and\n\n432\n00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.010\ndocumentation of our data, very important.\n\n433\n00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.690\nThese are the people in\nthe roles that manage and\n\n434\n00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:49.355\ninteract with our assets more broadly,\nnot just data but all assets every day.\n\n435\n00:24:49.355 --> 00:24:52.290\nData owners don't go out and\nkick the tires and\n\n436\n00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:56.240\nturn on the engine and\ntake the asset for test drive everyday.\n\n437\n00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.280\nThey don't wash it, they don't care for\nit, they don't put it to bed,\n\n438\n00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.290\nthey don't feed it,\nthey don't wake it up in the morning.\n\n439\n00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.092\nIt's not what owners do,\nat least not most owners.\n\n440\n00:25:04.092 --> 00:25:06.279\nSome owners are a bit more\nhands-on than others.\n\n441\n00:25:06.279 --> 00:25:10.410\nBut in general,\nowners are not going to be doers.\n\n442\n00:25:10.410 --> 00:25:15.960\nAnd doers represent the indications\nof the path that the owners\n\n443\n00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.580\nwould like to follow by carrying out\nthose actions on behalf of the owners.\n\n444\n00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.860\nAnd that's the distinction\nwe're trying to make.\n\n445\n00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:22.820\nAssurance of quality and\n\n446\n00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:27.490\nvalidation of any additions to a dataset,\nincluding things like auditing and\n\n447\n00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:32.070\nongoing data integrity, are gonna also\nbe in the purview of the processors.\n\n448\n00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:35.220\nAnything that deals with day-to-day,\nmoment-to-moment interaction, maintenance\n\n449\n00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.870\nthroughout the data lifecycle is really\ngonna be driven by the processor.\n\n450\n00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.503\nIn terms of oversight and compliance,\n\n451\n00:25:41.503 --> 00:25:45.023\nwe're really thinking\nabout ownership guidance.\n\n452\n00:25:45.023 --> 00:25:48.220\nIn terms of doing and maintaining,\nwe're thinking about processor.\n\n453\n00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:49.420\nWhat about data remnants?\n\n454\n00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:52.476\nI said when we started\nthe conversation quickly,\n\n455\n00:25:52.476 --> 00:25:55.950\nkinda walked through and\nsaw the overview of the highlights here.\n\n456\n00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.290\nThat we've talked about risk before,\nsecurity and\n\n457\n00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.760\nrisk management in domain number one.\n\n458\n00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.250\nWe made the case that\nthere's always residual risk.\n\n459\n00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.490\nRisk left over after\nall countermeasures and\n\n460\n00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.390\ncontrols were applied,\nwhether we understand and define and\n\n461\n00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:13.260\nknow what that risk is at any moment in\ntime, obviously open to interpretation.\n\n462\n00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.400\nBut we have to be aware\nas IT professionals,\n\n463\n00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:22.100\nas IT security practitioners and\nprofessionals, as CISSP candidates,\n\n464\n00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.790\nwe have to be aware that there is\nalways some element, some accountable.\n\n465\n00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:30.552\nA percentage or item that we can measure,\neven if it's not known and\n\n466\n00:26:30.552 --> 00:26:34.908\nquantifiably defined right now, that\nsomewhere in our system there are one or\n\n467\n00:26:34.908 --> 00:26:37.224\nmore elements of risk that always exist.\n\n468\n00:26:37.224 --> 00:26:39.442\nWe can never reach a zero risk solution.\n\n469\n00:26:39.442 --> 00:26:40.693\nIt's why we define.\n\n470\n00:26:40.693 --> 00:26:42.250\nWe talk about residual risk.\n\n471\n00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.170\nData remnants is a very similar idea but\n\n472\n00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:49.010\nfocused on a specific kind of asset,\nin this case, information or data.\n\n473\n00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:54.320\nIt's the residual information or\nrepresentation of digital data remaining,\n\n474\n00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.990\neven after all the attempts\nthat have been made to erase or\n\n475\n00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.850\nremove that data have been executed.\n\n476\n00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:03.690\nIf you've ever tried to go take a,\n\n477\n00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:08.520\nwhether it's a hard drive or\nit's a USB, a memory stick or\n\n478\n00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:12.180\nan SD card,\nwhatever it may be as a storage medium.\n\n479\n00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.330\nI would say a floppy disk, but\nI don't want to date myself too much.\n\n480\n00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.783\nWhatever it may be, here's another\nreally cool one for you, a zip drive.\n\n481\n00:27:18.783 --> 00:27:19.700\n&gt;&gt; Wow, yeah.\n\n482\n00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:20.535\n&gt;&gt; Remember zip drives?\n\n483\n00:27:20.535 --> 00:27:21.525\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, 250 megs.\n\n484\n00:27:21.525 --> 00:27:23.800\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; So, you know,\n\n485\n00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:28.210\nall sorts of things, whatever they may be,\nwherever you put data.\n\n486\n00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:31.640\nSo if you've ever worked with\none of more of those mediums and\n\n487\n00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:36.760\nyou have just followed a standard,\ntraditional way to delete files,\n\n488\n00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.590\nor information contained\nin one of those mediums.\n\n489\n00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:43.650\nMeaning, you haven't done something on\nthe list that we kinda saw quickly and\n\n490\n00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:48.340\nwe'll get back to, which is a more\nextensive, deeper, more thorough technique\n\n491\n00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:53.950\nlike degaussing, like multiple override\npasses, like crypto shredding.\n\n492\n00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:59.380\nBut you've just highlighted a file and\ndrag it over to the delete icon or\n\n493\n00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.700\nthe waste bin or whatever that means or\nyou held down the Shift key and\n\n494\n00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.640\nhit Delete, or you just highlighted\nthe file and hit Delete.\n\n495\n00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.540\nKind of entry level,\n\n496\n00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:11.340\nbasic 101, let's get rid of what's\nthere visually within the UI.\n\n497\n00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:16.140\nIf you've ever done that, and then either\nhad to go back and recover that later, or\n\n498\n00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:21.120\nyou've done that and then interacted\naround some other Aspects of security and\n\n499\n00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.060\nincident management and recovery.\n\n500\n00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:26.380\nAnd have come to find out that\nyou haven't really deleted and\n\n501\n00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.520\nsuccessfully purged and removed that data.\n\n502\n00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.900\nBut rather you have simply engaged\nin an activity that has masked\n\n503\n00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.600\nthe existence of that data\nfrom the average individual.\n\n504\n00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.760\nYou've removed references to it from\nthe file allocation table or the listing\n\n505\n00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.510\nof files within that medium, however that\nis achieved, that allows us to see it in\n\n506\n00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:50.520\nthe GUI, in the graphical interface,\nwhatever the management interface is.\n\n507\n00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.570\nBut the actual bits of data are most\nlikely still exactly where they were\n\n508\n00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.430\non that disk or on that medium.\n\n509\n00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:57.170\nThey haven't moved.\n\n510\n00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:58.780\nThey're still there.\n\n511\n00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.849\nWe know how to find them.\n\n512\n00:28:59.849 --> 00:29:02.414\nThey're easily recoverable and, indeed,\n\n513\n00:29:02.414 --> 00:29:06.330\ncan be recovered with minimal\nadditional effort in time and energy,\n\n514\n00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:11.320\nother than just knowing that we have to\nengage in certain activities to do that.\n\n515\n00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:16.324\nSo data remnants speaks to this idea that\nthere are different levels of removal or\n\n516\n00:29:16.324 --> 00:29:20.089\ndifferent levels of potential\ndestruction that can occur.\n\n517\n00:29:20.089 --> 00:29:24.410\nAnd if we as security professionals are\nnot in line with, we're not aware of and\n\n518\n00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.216\nwe're not educated about this,\n\n519\n00:29:26.216 --> 00:29:29.265\nwe may be making mistakes\nthat can be very problematic.\n\n520\n00:29:29.265 --> 00:29:32.919\nBecause we may be thinking we are securely\nremoving data, when, in fact,\n\n521\n00:29:32.919 --> 00:29:33.807\nwe are not at all.\n\n522\n00:29:33.807 --> 00:29:37.607\nWe're simply making it less\nobvious that the data is there.\n\n523\n00:29:37.607 --> 00:29:42.365\nBut to the trained professional, that data\nrecovery will be possible and, indeed,\n\n524\n00:29:42.365 --> 00:29:46.145\nwill be very likely in forensic and\nincident response activities.\n\n525\n00:29:46.145 --> 00:29:51.047\nOne of the first things we check for Is to\nfind out what's lurking under the surface,\n\n526\n00:29:51.047 --> 00:29:53.465\nespecially with regards to forensics and\n\n527\n00:29:53.465 --> 00:29:56.309\nthe approach to forensics\nthat we talked about.\n\n528\n00:29:56.309 --> 00:29:56.994\nWhich will come up, and\n\n529\n00:29:56.994 --> 00:29:59.580\nwe'll talk about at some point in\nthe future in some episodes, I'm sure.\n\n530\n00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.510\nSo make sure you understand the logic\nof data remnants, very important.\n\n531\n00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:05.330\nWhat about the different\napproaches that we may engage in?\n\n532\n00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:09.040\nI just mentioned there are different ways\nto do this, so we have three categories.\n\n533\n00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.310\nLet's talk about clearing, talk about\npurging, talk about destruction.\n\n534\n00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:15.821\nBe able to define, hopefully and\nfairly consistently and logically,\n\n535\n00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:16.765\neach one of these.\n\n536\n00:30:16.765 --> 00:30:18.745\nClearing is the removal of data,\n\n537\n00:30:18.745 --> 00:30:22.940\nwhatever that data is classified as,\nsensitive, whatever we say.\n\n538\n00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:26.400\nThat's a relative term, but\nremoval of data from the mechanism,\n\n539\n00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.370\nthe storage device, whatever it is.\n\n540\n00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:31.935\nSo there is assurance, meaning we\nhave some level of confidence that\n\n541\n00:30:31.935 --> 00:30:35.377\nthe data may not be reconstructed\nusing a normal system function or\n\n542\n00:30:35.377 --> 00:30:37.541\nsoftware file delete recovery utility.\n\n543\n00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:42.052\nSo clearing is the absolute bare minimum\nlevel we would strive for to make it\n\n544\n00:30:42.052 --> 00:30:46.938\ndifficult for somebody to recover that\ndata using normal tools and techniques.\n\n545\n00:30:46.938 --> 00:30:50.988\nNotice it doesn't say that's it's\nimpossible to recover the data.\n\n546\n00:30:50.988 --> 00:30:54.500\nIt doesn't say,\nthat unless you are law enforcement or\n\n547\n00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:59.511\nunless you have access to crazy special\nwicked hacking techniques and tools and\n\n548\n00:30:59.511 --> 00:31:04.200\nmagical incantations, that you will\nnot be able to recover the data.\n\n549\n00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:10.120\nIt just says that normal system functions\nlike undelete or whatever that may be or\n\n550\n00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:16.160\nsoftware file data recovery utilities\ncan or will not be typically successful.\n\n551\n00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.301\nIt's the minimum level we strive for.\n\n552\n00:31:18.301 --> 00:31:21.240\nThat is not necessarily\ngonna ensure security.\n\n553\n00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.625\nIt's not gonna validate and\nensure ongoing confidentiality.\n\n554\n00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:26.870\nIt's not gonna ensure integrity.\n\n555\n00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:30.257\nIt may or may not impact availability,\ndepending on our skills and\n\n556\n00:31:30.257 --> 00:31:32.690\nthe abilities we bring\nto the table to recover.\n\n557\n00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:37.662\nBut it maybe acceptable for\nbasic kinds of data that does not\n\n558\n00:31:37.662 --> 00:31:42.737\nrequire complex protection and\ndoes not require long-term\n\n559\n00:31:42.737 --> 00:31:47.529\nretention and\nprotection against a variety of attacks.\n\n560\n00:31:47.529 --> 00:31:51.917\nIf I create a to-do list around items\nI have to buy at the grocery store or\n\n561\n00:31:51.917 --> 00:31:55.354\nsomething like that, and\nI then decide to get rid of it,\n\n562\n00:31:55.354 --> 00:31:59.249\nI'm not worried about whether or\nnot somebody can recover it.\n\n563\n00:31:59.249 --> 00:32:01.196\nMatter of fact, I would like them to\nbecause hopefully they'll do it for me.\n\n564\n00:32:01.196 --> 00:32:03.426\nSo it may actually work out to my benefit.\n\n565\n00:32:03.426 --> 00:32:05.830\nBut I don't really care if\nsomebody sees my to-do list.\n\n566\n00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.420\nJust feel it's not all that critical.\n\n567\n00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.788\nSo the level that I'm striving for there\nmay just simply be I wanna clear the data.\n\n568\n00:32:11.788 --> 00:32:16.565\nI wanna use the Shift key and\nhit Delete and remove it, not totally, but\n\n569\n00:32:16.565 --> 00:32:20.714\nremove it from referenceable\nrecovery in the system easily.\n\n570\n00:32:20.714 --> 00:32:24.570\nThat may be enough for me,\nI may not have to do anything else, right?\n\n571\n00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:28.130\nBut I may want to, join me back here\nif you would, achieve a secondary,\n\n572\n00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:33.150\nmore complex, and\nhopefully more involved level that will\n\n573\n00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:36.790\nrequire additional capabilities, and\nadditional skills to recover data.\n\n574\n00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:40.650\nThat would be purging, removal of\nsensitive data from a system restored\n\n575\n00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:45.420\ndevice with the intent the data cannot be\nreconstructed through any known technique.\n\n576\n00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:50.389\nNow, again we're talking about\ngeneralities here and relativity, right.\n\n577\n00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:54.219\nReconstructed through any known technique,\n\n578\n00:32:54.219 --> 00:32:58.941\nwell what we know today will\nnot be what we know tomorrow.\n\n579\n00:32:58.941 --> 00:33:01.158\nWe may, in other words, over time,\n\n580\n00:33:01.158 --> 00:33:06.110\nand indeed it's a pretty safe guarantee\nthat over time we will see this bar move.\n\n581\n00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:10.150\nMeaning we will learn and\nknow many things that are unknown and\n\n582\n00:33:10.150 --> 00:33:13.850\nunclear and perhaps not applicable today.\n\n583\n00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:18.691\nAnd so over time the bar for purging can\nshift, meaning what I did to purge data\n\n584\n00:33:18.691 --> 00:33:23.610\ntoday may no longer be considered to be\nas effective in the future because maybe\n\n585\n00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:28.633\nthere's now technology and mechanisms\nthat will actually recover that data.\n\n586\n00:33:28.633 --> 00:33:31.393\nWhereas a year ago when I did this,\nmaybe there were not.\n\n587\n00:33:31.393 --> 00:33:35.390\nOr at least were not known to me or\navailable to me, whatever that may mean.\n\n588\n00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.910\nAgain, also keep in mind,\nthere's a lot of stuff that goes on\n\n589\n00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:42.190\nall the time around us that we\nmay not be aware of, right?\n\n590\n00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:46.680\nLaw enforcement has access to tools and\ntechniques as we often\n\n591\n00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:51.700\nfind out at certain critical points\nbased on things that are going on.\n\n592\n00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:56.360\nUsually bad things, but things that are\ngoing on, that we may not even be aware or\n\n593\n00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.870\nknow exist unless we work\nin those communities.\n\n594\n00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:05.330\nI don't know how many of you knew that,\nin theory, you could hack into\n\n595\n00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:10.100\ndevices like mobile phones using\na variety of different techniques.\n\n596\n00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.030\nThat's not new news, by any means.\n\n597\n00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:15.900\nBut the fact that even if there were\nself-destruct mechanisms put in\n\n598\n00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.830\nplace around defending these devices,\n\n599\n00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:23.560\nthat you may be able to bypass them with\ncertain tools if you had access to that.\n\n600\n00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.118\nThat may have been news to\nmany us in many communities.\n\n601\n00:34:27.118 --> 00:34:30.410\nIt was not news to some of us that know\nmore about these things than others.\n\n602\n00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:34.020\nBut the reality is the average person\nmay not have even realized that or\n\n603\n00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:35.220\nthought about that.\n\n604\n00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:39.532\nAnd so there are definitely techniques out\nthere that exist that we may not normally\n\n605\n00:34:39.532 --> 00:34:43.104\nhave access to but for certain reasons,\nunder certain conditions,\n\n606\n00:34:43.104 --> 00:34:46.861\nwith the right people involved,\nmay actually be brought to bear that can\n\n607\n00:34:46.861 --> 00:34:50.024\ncertainly change the dynamic\nof what we're talking about.\n\n608\n00:34:50.024 --> 00:34:52.799\nWe're not talking about that, what I'm\nsimply pointing out is the following.\n\n609\n00:34:53.910 --> 00:34:59.100\nYou should be comfortable to finding these\ncategorical definitions as a standard way\n\n610\n00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:04.750\nof saying, given a problem, given\nthe discussion and given the outcome.\n\n611\n00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:08.160\nAm I clearing, am I purging or\nam I looking to destruct?\n\n612\n00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.840\nWhatever the third category will be.\n\n613\n00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:13.280\nMedia is made unusable.for\nconventional equipment using a variety\n\n614\n00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.550\nof techniques that modify or alter.\n\n615\n00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:18.045\nThe data, the structure of the form and\n\n616\n00:35:18.045 --> 00:35:20.999\npotentially the ability\nto interact with it.\n\n617\n00:35:20.999 --> 00:35:26.431\nWhat level of destruction, what level of\nassurance are we looking for here, right?\n\n618\n00:35:26.431 --> 00:35:28.180\nIt's almost like the three bears analogy.\n\n619\n00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:32.090\nI often talk about this with customers and\nin class with students, right.\n\n620\n00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:34.981\nIs it the mama bear's,\nthe papa bear's, the baby bear, right?\n\n621\n00:35:34.981 --> 00:35:38.275\nAs you go up the chain things get\nmore difficult, more complex,\n\n622\n00:35:38.275 --> 00:35:41.325\nbecause things get bigger,\nthey're more ferocious, and\n\n623\n00:35:41.325 --> 00:35:45.380\nthe more difficult to deal with, or\nat least that's the idea behind it.\n\n624\n00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:46.610\nMaybe not the best one, but\n\n625\n00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:49.700\nyou get the idea, I'll work on that,\nI'll try to make that one better for you.\n\n626\n00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.516\nAll right, let's get here\ninto instruction if we could.\n\n627\n00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:55.683\nSo media is made unusable\nwhen we seek to destruct.\n\n628\n00:35:55.683 --> 00:35:59.043\nAnd there are a variety of techniques\nthat we have to engage in, or\n\n629\n00:35:59.043 --> 00:36:00.890\npotentially engage in here.\n\n630\n00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:04.150\nThe discussion around these techniques\nI'd like to spend a few minutes on and\n\n631\n00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:05.110\nwalk through.\n\n632\n00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:10.190\nWe're kind of already verging past\nthe point of normal time for this episode.\n\n633\n00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:16.610\nSo what I'd like to do is come back in\npart two, episode number two in this area.\n\n634\n00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:20.676\nPick right up here where we left off, that\nway we can just pick that thread back up.\n\n635\n00:36:20.676 --> 00:36:24.010\nBut we could spend a few minutes really\nteasing out and making sure we're\n\n636\n00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:28.003\ncomfortable with the differences between\noverwriting, degaussing, encryption,\n\n637\n00:36:28.003 --> 00:36:30.750\na form of encryption that is\na little bit more involved.\n\n638\n00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:34.200\nIt's like encryption plus encryption,\nwhich is crypto-shredding,\n\n639\n00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.020\na physical destruction that's always fun.\n\n640\n00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.790\nIt's where you like get the big wood\nchipper and start shredding drives.\n\n641\n00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.240\nAnd/or thermite which is ever so\nmuch for to play with.\n\n642\n00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.000\nChemical alteration, and\nof course phase shifting.\n\n643\n00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.100\nWhat we will commonly refer to as\ntransition through the application of\n\n644\n00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.600\nsomething known as a Curie\ntemperature point.\n\n645\n00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.610\nSo it's an interesting\nset of conversations.\n\n646\n00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:56.660\nAnd also, I wanna make sure we do a good\njob of talking about the differences.\n\n647\n00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:01.970\nNot at the actual constructive layer,\narchitecturally between SSD and HDD.\n\n648\n00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:03.650\nThat's an important conversation, but\n\n649\n00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:07.570\none that takes plus in A+ in particular\nothers a little bit more formally.\n\n650\n00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.480\nWe don't need to go into\nthat level of detail here.\n\n651\n00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:13.370\nBut with regards to that, referencing\nthat, why do we have to approach\n\n652\n00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:16.630\ndata destruction differently\ngiven those two mediums?\n\n653\n00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.060\nBecause they operate differently.\n\n654\n00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.855\nAnd as a result have\ndifferent capabilities and\n\n655\n00:37:20.855 --> 00:37:23.355\ndifferent liabilities associated\nwith data management.\n\n656\n00:37:23.355 --> 00:37:25.865\nWe wanna just make sure we remind\nourselves we're aware of that.\n\n657\n00:37:25.865 --> 00:37:27.295\nAnd what's the role of cloud data?\n\n658\n00:37:27.295 --> 00:37:33.525\nAnd how do we deal with making sure cloud\ndata has been safely rendered inoperable,\n\n659\n00:37:33.525 --> 00:37:37.555\ninaccessible, not useable, through\nthe thought process of destruction.\n\n660\n00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:39.345\nThis is a whole new brave world and\n\n661\n00:37:39.345 --> 00:37:42.440\narea that many of us haven't\nreally spent a lot of time on.\n\n662\n00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.215\nAnd we need to make sure we have a sense\nof that cuz that's a very important\n\n663\n00:37:45.215 --> 00:37:45.864\nconversation.\n\n664\n00:37:45.864 --> 00:37:48.660\nThen we have to say a couple of\nthings about collection limitation.\n\n665\n00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:52.380\nRemind ourselves of the core\nOECD principles as I mentioned.\n\n666\n00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:53.660\nWe'll go back, we'll take a look at those.\n\n667\n00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.660\nSo gonna invite you to come back for\nanother episode to deal with this.\n\n668\n00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.167\nAnd then after all that,\nwell we've got other stuff to talk about\n\n669\n00:37:59.167 --> 00:38:01.720\nin the asset security domain,\nand then we got, of course, many,\n\n670\n00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.410\nmany other domains that are equally\ninteresting to get into.\n\n671\n00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:08.120\nStill a lot of work left to go but as we\nget ready to think about getting over\n\n672\n00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:12.260\nthe top and moving towards the downside of\nfinishing up domain two, we are a quarter\n\n673\n00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.520\nof the way, or close to a quarter of\nthe way through our conversations.\n\n674\n00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.210\nEight domains, we will have put\ntwo of them behind us shortly.\n\n675\n00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:21.880\nWhich means overall, 25% of what\nyou need to know, give or take, for\n\n676\n00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.590\nthe exam, should hopefully be behind us.\n\n677\n00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:28.221\nAnd give you the opportunity to\nlook ahead to the 75% that remains,\n\n678\n00:38:28.221 --> 00:38:31.031\na heck of a lot of information.\n&gt;&gt; All right, well, fun stuff, too.\n\n679\n00:38:31.031 --> 00:38:33.993\nAnd I tell you what I'm excited to see\nsome of the next stuff that he's gonna\n\n680\n00:38:33.993 --> 00:38:34.520\ntalk about.\n\n681\n00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.970\nSo you're gonna have to come back and\nsee us in the continuation of this.\n\n682\n00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:40.687\nWe will see whether we can convince Adam\nto keep the acetylene torch there in\n\n683\n00:38:40.687 --> 00:38:41.344\nthe closet.\n\n684\n00:38:41.344 --> 00:38:42.855\nBut we'll see you guys back in the.\n\n685\n00:38:42.855 --> 00:38:44.210\nSo we're gonna go ahead and sign out here.\n\n686\n00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:46.280\nAs always, Adam,\nwe appreciate having you here.\n\n687\n00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.080\nAnd we appreciate you the viewer watching.\n\n688\n00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.503\nSigning off for ITPro.TV,\nI've been your host, Wes Bryan.\n\n689\n00:38:50.503 -->

00:00:07.242\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n4\n00:00:07.242 --> 00:00:08.279\n[MUSIC]\n\n5\n00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:12.829\n&gt;&gt; You're watching ITProTV.\n&gt;&gt; Greetings and\n\n6\n00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.740\nsalutations to all the viewers\ntuning in to ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.460\nThank you for choosing us for\nyour learning needs.\n\n8\n00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.800\nI'm your show host Wes Bryan and\n\n9\n00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.420\nin today's episode we are continuing\nthrough our series on the CISSP.\n\n10\n00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.520\nJoining us back in\nthe studio is Adam Gordon.\n\n11\n00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.690\nAdam how are we doing today sir?\n&gt;&gt; You\n\n12\n00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.270\nknow what CISSP backwards is?\n&gt;&gt; No, but\n\n13\n00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.870\nyou're gonna tell me I hope.\n&gt;&gt; Crazy.\n\n14\n00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:32.430\n&gt;&gt; Crazy, that's\n\n15\n00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.520\nabsolutely crazy.\n\n16\n00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.854\n&gt;&gt; PSSIC.\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n17\n00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:37.581\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; All right so that's your thought for\n\n18\n00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:38.820\nthe day here at ITProTV.\n\n19\n00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.140\nWe are continuing our conversations\nwith regards to domain two.\n\n20\n00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.290\nAsset security.\n\n21\n00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.790\nIf you have not seen us up until now,\nwell, you've seen double.\n\n22\n00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.880\nBecause you were seeing Daniel,\nnow you're seeing Wes.\n\n23\n00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.590\nAnd of course we're swapping out our\nhosts, but we are not swapping out our\n\n24\n00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.650\nfocus on the importance of the topic\nof projecting, or protecting privacy.\n\n25\n00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.000\nI should probably get that right if\nI'm going to say it the first time.\n\n26\n00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.630\nWe are in the middle of talking\nabout domain number two, assets,\n\n27\n00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.640\nsecurity subtopic number three,\njoin me here.\n\n28\n00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.190\nLet me remind you of where we are,\nwhere we're going.\n\n29\n00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.280\nWe are focusing on protecting privacy.\n\n30\n00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.130\nIn our last episode did most of the work\naround this topic, carved out a very\n\n31\n00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.420\nimportant discussion and distinction\naround the differentiators between\n\n32\n00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.050\nthe approach of quality control, QC and\nthe approach of quality assurance, QA.\n\n33\n00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.510\nI know my partner in crime over there was\nvery fastidious, took notes, wrote down\n\n34\n00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.190\neverything, got it backwards, asked me,\nflipped it around and corrected it.\n\n35\n00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.750\nI'm not gonna put him on the spot\nto tell us the difference but\n\n36\n00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.740\nI am gonna put you on the spot and remind\nyou that the distinction between QC and\n\n37\n00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.950\nQA is the distinction between\ninternal versus external focus.\n\n38\n00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.460\nDo you know which is which?\n\n39\n00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.690\nIf you don't,\nI know where you can find out.\n\n40\n00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.130\nGo back, take a look at our last episode.\n\n41\n00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.165\nIf you do, well you are one step ahead of\neverybody else who hasn't watched that\n\n42\n00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:53.720\nepisode yet.\n\n43\n00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.910\nSo for you, we now have without\nfurther ado, episode number two\n\n44\n00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.080\nwith regards to protecting privacy, and\nby the way the answer to the question.\n\n45\n00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.090\nQC is internal, QA is external.\n\n46\n00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.850\nPlease remember that,\n\n47\n00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.560\nalong with all of the other stuff\nwe've discussed in the last episode.\n\n48\n00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.090\nData ownership versus data processing,\nthe roles, the distinction,\n\n49\n00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.685\nand the coverage of each.\n\n50\n00:02:13.685 --> 00:02:16.895\nWe're finishing up our\nconversation around data remnants.\n\n51\n00:02:16.895 --> 00:02:20.855\nWe have defined the idea of data remnants,\ntalked through at a high level\n\n52\n00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:24.495\nthe distinctions between three approaches\nregarding clearing, purging, and\n\n53\n00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:30.475\ndestruction, levels of or attainment\nof levels of inaccessibility for\n\n54\n00:02:30.475 --> 00:02:35.610\ndata that allow it to be protected\nbeyond reasonable recovery measures.\n\n55\n00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.410\nIs what we are talking about.\n\n56\n00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.430\nWanna minimize the possibility of data\nremnants being used to recover data\n\n57\n00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.360\nin the.\n\n58\n00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.760\nAnd under the destruction category, we\nreally stopped at the point we said, okay,\n\n59\n00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.420\nhere's a list of techniques.\n\n60\n00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.730\nWanna spend a few minutes on them so\nwe're gonna come back in this episode,\n\n61\n00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.620\ndelve a little bit more\ndeeply into them so\n\n62\n00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.650\ncan explain them,\nnot have to rush through them.\n\n63\n00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.420\nSo let's start by talking\nabout overwriting.\n\n64\n00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.580\nThe idea of overwriting\nis the idea of applying\n\n65\n00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.073\none or more streams, spell that correctly,\n\n66\n00:03:11.073 --> 00:03:18.018\nof 1's and 0's and\n\n67\n00:03:18.018 --> 00:03:23.800\nI really do need to figure out\nhow to put an S versus a 2 there.\n\n68\n00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.405\n1s and 0s in a and\n\n69\n00:03:27.405 --> 00:03:32.214\nI'll put this in quotes\n\n70\n00:03:32.214 --> 00:03:36.551\nin a random pattern.\n\n71\n00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:44.140\nOne or more times.\n\n72\n00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.200\nAnd the idea behind overwriting\nis the idea that we want\n\n73\n00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.360\nto engage some sort of utility or\nfunction in the system.\n\n74\n00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.340\nWhether it's a third party tool, or\nbuilt in command that executes this\n\n75\n00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.490\nwithin the confines of the management\ninterface or the hardware, and firmware,\n\n76\n00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.560\nand software capabilities\nthe manufacturer may provide.\n\n77\n00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.890\nIt's done different ways.\n\n78\n00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.510\nBut, ultimately, the idea is that, we\nwanna be able to instead of just leaving\n\n79\n00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.970\nthe data there on the platter in place,\nreadable, structured, sequential, right?\n\n80\n00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.770\nThat kind of thing,\nwe wanna replace that data\n\n81\n00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.940\nwith a generated stream of ones and\nzeros which are gonna be\n\n82\n00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.250\njust random characters that have no\nmeaning with regards to the data.\n\n83\n00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.690\nAnd we wanna place those in multiple\nplaces in multiple overwrite passes\n\n84\n00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.780\nto ensure that the more times we go\nthrough and one and zero out that drive\n\n85\n00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.120\nthe more likely it is we're gonna touch\nall of those places where the data lives.\n\n86\n00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.240\nAnd we're gonna eradicate every piece or\nthe majority of the individual bits and\n\n87\n00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.020\npieces of data.\n\n88\n00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.060\nAnd so one over ride pass is okay,\ntwo is better, and three is better still.\n\n89\n00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.600\nAnd obviously the more over ride\npasses we engage in the more deeply\n\n90\n00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.550\nwe go through and the more thoroughly we\noverwrite the data that is on the platter,\n\n91\n00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.470\nand indeed the empty\nspaces on the platter.\n\n92\n00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.890\nIt doesn't matter, but the more times\nwe touch that hard drive platter or\n\n93\n00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.570\nthat storage medium.\n\n94\n00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.940\nAnd the more times we go through it,\nplacing ones and zeros and criss crossing,\n\n95\n00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.750\noverwriting, overlapping\nrandomized patterns,\n\n96\n00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.240\nmore likely it is we're going to eradicate\nwhatever data may have been there and\n\n97\n00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.080\nof course obviously fill up the empty\nspaces that may not have had data.\n\n98\n00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.960\nBut in so doing, hopefully eradicate,\nif not all traces\n\n99\n00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.260\nbecause it's highly unlikely we'd\nget rid of every single bit of data.\n\n100\n00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.640\nBut enough of the data that we would deem\nit unrecoverable by most modern methods.\n\n101\n00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.400\nSo overriding can be\nan effective mechanism.\n\n102\n00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.200\nProblem is you have to overwrite multiple\ntimes, and you have to engage in multiple\n\n103\n00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.350\npasses or times in overriding\nto really make it effective.\n\n104\n00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.528\nA lot of people say, okay I overrode one\ntime, or whatever the standard way in\n\n105\n00:05:55.528 --> 00:05:59.581\nwhich overwriting may be programmed to\ntake place using the tool you use and\n\n106\n00:05:59.581 --> 00:06:04.146\nthey missed the fact that you may have an\noption to select multiple override passes,\n\n107\n00:06:04.146 --> 00:06:07.840\nor there may be a switch you can use\nthat may go from standard to deep.\n\n108\n00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.234\nThere's different ways you'd see it\ndone depending on the tool you use.\n\n109\n00:06:10.234 --> 00:06:11.950\nAnd as a result, right?\n\n110\n00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.940\nIt's very important to know that the more\noverwrite passage you engage in, the more\n\n111\n00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.940\nsuccessful the overwriting and therefore\nthe removal of data is likely to be.\n\n112\n00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.470\nYes.\n&gt;&gt; Now, would you say Adam,\n\n113\n00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.720\nin your opinion that this is one\nthat's not necessarily easier but\n\n114\n00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.830\nmore accessible to people?\n\n115\n00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.730\nIt may be other comparative to\nsome of the other examples here.\n\n116\n00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.330\nFor instance, I have used before.\n\n117\n00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.850\nWhat's a duke boot newcom?\n\n118\n00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.660\nAnd they have had different\npasses that you could go to.\n\n119\n00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.790\nBUt I could get that software.\n\n120\n00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.980\nIt was a little Linux live CD that I could\nput in and I could erase a hard drive.\n\n121\n00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.530\nDo you find this one maybe a little\nbit more accessible to people or\n\n122\n00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.430\nnot necessarily?\n&gt;&gt; As a technique overriding\n\n123\n00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.330\ngenerically without maybe\nchoosing a specific or\n\n124\n00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.410\nlimitation like you were saying.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n125\n00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.332\n&gt;&gt; Just generically.\n\n126\n00:06:52.332 --> 00:06:52.965\nI think it's\n\n127\n00:06:52.965 --> 00:06:55.024\na fairly accessible technique.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n128\n00:06:55.024 --> 00:06:56.187\n&gt;&gt; It's probably a lot easier to engage in\n\n129\n00:06:56.187 --> 00:06:58.256\nthen de-gousing would be, for instance.\n&gt;&gt; Right.\n\n130\n00:06:58.256 --> 00:06:59.460\n&gt;&gt; Where you'll see in just a minute\n\n131\n00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.370\nin case you're not\nalready familiar with it.\n\n132\n00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.060\nWe need some sort of special equipment\nin order to engage in de-gousing\n\n133\n00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.890\nproperly although in theory,\nif you had a strong enough magnet,\n\n134\n00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:13.430\nyou could de-gouse on a workbench as long\nas you are willing to take your shot and\n\n135\n00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.980\nmaybe not get too close\nto things that are metal.\n\n136\n00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.567\nBut in theory, normally,\nit's done with some sort of\n\n137\n00:07:18.567 --> 00:07:22.112\nspecial equipment that's designed to\nbe able to erase that medium through\n\n138\n00:07:22.112 --> 00:07:25.657\na strong from magnetic field by running\nit through a machine that generates\n\n139\n00:07:25.657 --> 00:07:29.118\nthat field often with really cool\nsound effects and dimmings of lights.\n\n140\n00:07:29.118 --> 00:07:32.181\nIt's like the old school spooky black and\nwhite sci fi movies.\n\n141\n00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:36.858\nBut you know, yes, certainly more\napproachable than de-gousing would be than\n\n142\n00:07:36.858 --> 00:07:39.968\ndepending on the nature of\nthe techniques involved.\n\n143\n00:07:39.968 --> 00:07:43.845\nPhysical destruction certainly can\ninvolve not only life safety issues,\n\n144\n00:07:43.845 --> 00:07:47.906\nyou gotta be very careful because you can\ndamage yourself using a hammermill or\n\n145\n00:07:47.906 --> 00:07:50.552\nusing a shredder that’s\nphysically big enough and\n\n146\n00:07:50.552 --> 00:07:54.269\nstrong enough to destroy metal hard\ndrive casings, things like that.\n\n147\n00:07:54.269 --> 00:07:57.811\nYou're talking about a fairly\nsignificant powerful piece of equipment,\n\n148\n00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.215\nreally cool to play with, but\n\n149\n00:07:59.215 --> 00:08:00.985\nyou gotta be really careful.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n150\n00:08:00.985 --> 00:08:01.834\n&gt;&gt; Not to mention\n\n151\n00:08:01.834 --> 00:08:03.536\nchemical alteration with.\n\n152\n00:08:03.536 --> 00:08:06.871\nI joked around in the last episode about\nthings like Thermite and Plasma, but\n\n153\n00:08:06.871 --> 00:08:09.160\nthose are actually\nthings that can be used.\n\n154\n00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.478\nAcid a lot of ways you can do this.\n\n155\n00:08:11.478 --> 00:08:16.651\nThese are highly, highly potentially\nlife safety impacting things\n\n156\n00:08:16.651 --> 00:08:22.287\nif you're not trained and know how to\nhandle these things and do so safely.\n\n157\n00:08:22.287 --> 00:08:26.180\nYou can really mess yourself up and really\ndo a lot of damage to those around you.\n\n158\n00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.305\nSo it's definitely a safer effort,\nrelatively low threshold for entry and\n\n159\n00:08:30.305 --> 00:08:33.346\nminimal chance you're going\nto hurt anybody, right.\n\n160\n00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.340\nSo as a result it's free unless you\nliterally take the drive up and\n\n161\n00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.840\nfling it at somebody, you're not gonna\nhurt them by overriding anything.\n\n162\n00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.392\nSo it's a pretty safe way to go, but\nit may not be the most effective.\n\n163\n00:08:43.392 --> 00:08:45.990\nAnd that's just something that we\nwanna point out and think about.\n\n164\n00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.965\nAll right, so\njoin me back here with degaussing.\n\n165\n00:08:47.965 --> 00:08:50.050\nYou kind of heard me talk\nabout this one already.\n\n166\n00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.231\nDegaussing, right, use of strong and\n\n167\n00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:59.308\nlet's put that in capitals, strong, right?\n\n168\n00:08:59.308 --> 00:09:03.937\nMagnetic, man-netic, magnetic fields or\n\n169\n00:09:03.937 --> 00:09:06.993\nfiles, either way, right?\n\n170\n00:09:06.993 --> 00:09:09.318\nNo, you cannot trust me to type on my own.\n\n171\n00:09:09.318 --> 00:09:13.770\nField(s) to erase data.\n\n172\n00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.981\nAnd what we really are doing is not so\nmuch erasing the data, but\n\n173\n00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:20.556\nrearranging the bits in such a way\nthat they become unintelligible and\n\n174\n00:09:20.556 --> 00:09:23.114\ncannot really be recovered or\nused for anything.\n\n175\n00:09:23.114 --> 00:09:26.260\nBecause if you've ever seen a magnet,\nand its effect on iron fillings,\n\n176\n00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.715\nif you ever played with an Etch A Sketch\nor anything like that, or one of those old\n\n177\n00:09:29.715 --> 00:09:32.830\ngames where you have the face with\nthe big clown nose, and the filings.\n\n178\n00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:33.729\nRemember the pen and-\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n179\n00:09:33.729 --> 00:09:34.791\n&gt;&gt; I used to love those things.\n\n180\n00:09:34.791 --> 00:09:38.647\nGone are the simple days of toys when I,\nand you to a certain extent,\n\n181\n00:09:38.647 --> 00:09:41.387\nalthough I'm a few years older than you-\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n182\n00:09:41.387 --> 00:09:42.912\n&gt;&gt; But when people of our generation\n\n183\n00:09:42.912 --> 00:09:44.681\nwere growing up, right?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.\n\n184\n00:09:44.681 --> 00:09:46.145\n&gt;&gt; I'm sure they still have those things.\n\n185\n00:09:46.145 --> 00:09:51.232\nBut I mean, just you'd give a kid of\nmy generation an Etch A Sketch and\n\n186\n00:09:51.232 --> 00:09:54.760\nthey looked like they were busy for hours.\n&gt;&gt; That's right,\n\n187\n00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.980\nwe didn't get the controls either.\n\n188\n00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.280\nOur Ctrl+Z was take the Etch A Sketch and\nturn it upside down and shake it, right?\n\n189\n00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.384\n&gt;&gt; Or beat your brother with it.\n\n190\n00:10:00.384 --> 00:10:01.024\n&gt;&gt; That can happen,\n\n191\n00:10:01.024 --> 00:10:02.224\ntoo, cuz I'm an older brother.\n\n192\n00:10:02.224 --> 00:10:03.343\nI had to torture them.\n\n193\n00:10:03.343 --> 00:10:07.162\nWhen it comes to degaussing, though,\nit does make sense what you're saying,\n\n194\n00:10:07.162 --> 00:10:10.525\nbecause if you store the information\nmagnetically, that some kind of\n\n195\n00:10:10.525 --> 00:10:13.927\nmagnetic field would do [CROSSTALK].\n&gt;&gt; Modifying the accessibility and\n\n196\n00:10:13.927 --> 00:10:15.270\nthe ordering of them.\n\n197\n00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.620\nThat what a degaussing system does.\n\n198\n00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.670\nI grew up early on in one\nof my original iterations,\n\n199\n00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:26.565\nAdam 1.0, where you saw me now which\nis Adam 2.5.0 with minimal hair.\n\n200\n00:10:26.565 --> 00:10:29.115\nBut when I was much younger\nI was in the music business,\n\n201\n00:10:29.115 --> 00:10:33.385\namong many things that are secretive, and\nyou may not know much about me that I did.\n\n202\n00:10:33.385 --> 00:10:36.785\nBut I was in radios, DJ,\nI was in the music business early on.\n\n203\n00:10:36.785 --> 00:10:40.445\nAnd I worked in several radio stations\nin college and things like that.\n\n204\n00:10:40.445 --> 00:10:44.895\nAnd we used to use degaussers all the time\nto clear what they called cards back\n\n205\n00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:48.980\nthen which were the tapes, the drops you\nhear on radio today, things like that.\n\n206\n00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:53.310\nYou may hear some DJs and people talking\nabout sound effects,something like that.\n\n207\n00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.915\nThey're recorded, at least they were\nback then, on cards, which were plastic\n\n208\n00:10:57.915 --> 00:11:02.480\neight-track like cassette tape holders\nthat were roughly the size of a pop tart.\n\n209\n00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.791\nCuz that's about what they were.\n\n210\n00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:07.672\n[LAUGH] And you would add anywhere from\nseveral seconds to maybe several minutes\n\n211\n00:11:07.672 --> 00:11:10.550\nof tape in the card,\ndepending on how it was loaded.\n\n212\n00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.070\nAnd you would then be able to record\na certain amount of information,\n\n213\n00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:14.610\na song, whatever, on it.\n\n214\n00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.030\nYou would pop into a player and\nit would be teed up, and\n\n215\n00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.730\nthat's how you would play stuff.\n\n216\n00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.000\nThese days a lot of it's just all done\ndigitally, but it's the same idea.\n\n217\n00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.790\nAnd on those cards, because they used\ntape, you would have to erase them when\n\n218\n00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.720\nyou wanted to record over them by\nrunning them through a degausser.\n\n219\n00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.920\nYou would put them in a machine,\nhit a button.\n\n220\n00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.580\nThere will be a low, earth-shattering and\nbuilding-shaking rumble.\n\n221\n00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.300\nThe lights would dim and\nsparks would come flying out.\n\n222\n00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.490\nAnd this incredibly strong\nmagnet would be engaged, and\n\n223\n00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.770\nthe tape head would run across\nthe heads with the magnet.\n\n224\n00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:46.560\nIt would be wiped,\n\n225\n00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.540\nand then you could essentially have\na clean medium to start over with.\n\n226\n00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.900\nIt's just like you would have the ability,\nif you've ever used or seen,\n\n227\n00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:56.490\ncuz these are old systems, you may\nnot even know about them anymore, but\n\n228\n00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.600\nif you ever used cassette tapes,\nif you have a point of reference for\n\n229\n00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.860\na cassette tape recorder, right?\n\n230\n00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.170\nAnd you remember making tapes or\nrecording tapes or VHSs, Betamax.\n\n231\n00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.620\nThey all work the same way.\n\n232\n00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:11.930\nAll of these systems would allow\nyou to record and record and\n\n233\n00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:16.080\nrecord over mediums by running tape\nacross one or more record heads\n\n234\n00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.990\nthat at some level were magnetized to\nbe able to write data to the system.\n\n235\n00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.455\nThey just might not have been strong\nenough to actually be engaged the right\n\n236\n00:12:23.455 --> 00:12:24.665\nway to do degaussing, but\n\n237\n00:12:24.665 --> 00:12:28.110\nit's just a matter of how much\nmagnetic fields you're producing.\n\n238\n00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.184\nSo degaussing is the state\nof using a magnetic field.\n\n239\n00:12:30.184 --> 00:12:32.961\nThat's really all it is.\n&gt;&gt; In a former endeavor when I was\n\n240\n00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:37.316\nteaching for some of the US military,\nit really doesn't matter the specific US\n\n241\n00:12:37.316 --> 00:12:40.962\nglobally, if you're in\na maritime-type of military endeavor.\n\n242\n00:12:40.962 --> 00:12:43.374\nDegaussing the ships for magnetic mines,\n\n243\n00:12:43.374 --> 00:12:46.965\nrunning the huge degaussers.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, they would run and the original\n\n244\n00:12:46.965 --> 00:12:50.563\ntechnology comes actually from right\naround the time of the II World War.\n\n245\n00:12:50.563 --> 00:12:52.690\nThe British actually invented it.\n\n246\n00:12:52.690 --> 00:12:57.640\nThey figured out that they\ncould run these huge massive\n\n247\n00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.310\nmagnetic charges through the hulls to be\nable to demagnetize or render the ships\n\n248\n00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:05.730\nnot approachable by us because they\nwouldn't be able to stick and blow up.\n\n249\n00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.390\nAnd that was kind of the original\nthought process they came up with.\n\n250\n00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:11.400\nIt was the British and the Americans and\na bunch of other people involved.\n\n251\n00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.620\nThey did that and then ultimately over\ntime it led into all these other things,\n\n252\n00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.421\nbut yeah, you're right.\n&gt;&gt; That would be the macroism of it.\n\n253\n00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:20.094\nNow the microscopic part of it, just\ntake that whole same thought process and\n\n254\n00:13:20.094 --> 00:13:22.500\napply it to our data\nstored on magnetic media.\n\n255\n00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.090\nSo you shrink down a battleship\nto the size of about, so\n\n256\n00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.870\nbig and you get a degausser.\n&gt;&gt; At then we play Battleship at\n\n257\n00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.010\nlunch.\n&gt;&gt; And there you go.\n\n258\n00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.230\nAll right, so\njoin me back here on the list.\n\n259\n00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:31.988\nSo encryption,\n\n260\n00:13:31.988 --> 00:13:35.350\nwe've talked about encryption in\npassing already in several episodes.\n\n261\n00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:39.060\nWe have a whole set of discussions\ndedicated to the network communication and\n\n262\n00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.330\nsecurity domain where we'll talk about\napplying cryptography a little bit.\n\n263\n00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.460\nWe'll talk about it in security\nengineering domain in particular where we\n\n264\n00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.990\nreally address cryptography head on.\n\n265\n00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.062\nSo encryption is gonna be, remember, our\nnumber one control we're trying to measure\n\n266\n00:13:54.062 --> 00:13:56.540\ntypically associated with confidentiality.\n\n267\n00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.091\nThe idea of whether we\nare applying a single key,\n\n268\n00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:05.202\nwhat's called a symmetric, or\na dual key, an asymmetric encryption\n\n269\n00:14:05.202 --> 00:14:09.983\nsolution public/private key pair\nversus single key solution.\n\n270\n00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:15.663\nWe are using some sort of algorithm,\nessentially a mathematical approach and\n\n271\n00:14:15.663 --> 00:14:20.395\nformula, a variety of different types,\nstructured a variety of\n\n272\n00:14:20.395 --> 00:14:25.230\nways that has a certain amount of\ncapability based on a set of keys.\n\n273\n00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:27.690\nThe possibility of the number\nof combinations or\n\n274\n00:14:27.690 --> 00:14:30.920\nkeys that could be generated\nis called the keyspace.\n\n275\n00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:35.040\nAnd the bigger the keyspace,\nthe more hopefully secure and, therefore,\n\n276\n00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.080\nthe better the protection\noffered by the algorithm.\n\n277\n00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.790\nWe'll talk more about these\nideas in upcoming discussions.\n\n278\n00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:45.800\nAnd we also measure what's known as the\nwork factor, which is the amount of time,\n\n279\n00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:52.610\nit's a measure of time, that it would take\nto test every possible key combination\n\n280\n00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:57.090\nwhile trying to brute force or attack\nthe algorithm to break the encryption.\n\n281\n00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:01.300\nThe longer the measure of time, we're\ntalking not just days, weeks, months,\n\n282\n00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.370\nyears, but centuries,\nmillions of years, right, potentially.\n\n283\n00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:10.270\nThe longer the work factor, the longer\nthe amount of the time, and the bigger\n\n284\n00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:14.920\nthe keyspace, the bigger the overall\nnumber of possible key combinations are,\n\n285\n00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.584\nwe say the stronger the algorithm is,\nthe better the encryption is.\n\n286\n00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:22.599\nIf the keyspace is to small, not enough\nrandom choices that can be used, and\n\n287\n00:15:22.599 --> 00:15:26.114\ntherefore we can use, and\ntherefore we can iterate through them so\n\n288\n00:15:26.114 --> 00:15:29.344\nquickly that we can ultimately\nfind the right combination.\n\n289\n00:15:29.344 --> 00:15:32.490\nWe have to factor, the amount of\ntime it would take to do that,\n\n290\n00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.650\nis relatively short.\n\n291\n00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.450\nAnd you can see how one\ndirectly impacts the other.\n\n292\n00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:39.590\nSmall keyspace equals small word factor.\n\n293\n00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:43.490\nLarge keyspace equals larger work factor,\nlonger time.\n\n294\n00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:48.270\nSo we want both to be big because one\nis derived from the other directly.\n\n295\n00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:53.192\nAnd so when both are very, very large,\nit is said that the encryption offers or\n\n296\n00:15:53.192 --> 00:15:57.314\nthe algorithm provides the encryption\noffers good protection.\n\n297\n00:15:57.314 --> 00:15:58.702\nBut that is a relative thing.\n\n298\n00:15:58.702 --> 00:16:01.011\nRemember, we talked about this,\nsliding scale.\n\n299\n00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:01.767\n&gt;&gt; Overtime,\n\n300\n00:16:01.767 --> 00:16:05.470\nour technology brought to bear\nto break that encryption,\n\n301\n00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:09.032\nto attempt to work through\nall those key combinations.\n\n302\n00:16:09.032 --> 00:16:14.721\nAnd do so quicker and quicker, and quicker\nin less time with less power involved,\n\n303\n00:16:14.721 --> 00:16:19.510\nand less a system involved in order\nto achieve the same results rose.\n\n304\n00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.752\nAnd as a result, our protection shrinks.\n\n305\n00:16:21.752 --> 00:16:26.128\nAnd so what is perhaps able to offer\na million years of protection today,\n\n306\n00:16:26.128 --> 00:16:28.724\na year from now would\nonly offer half that.\n\n307\n00:16:28.724 --> 00:16:32.740\nAnd a year after that, half that based\non something known as Moore's Law and\n\n308\n00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:36.901\nwe'll talk more about this and the ideas\nbehind it at some point in the future.\n\n309\n00:16:36.901 --> 00:16:41.047\nThis will change radically with the advent\nand the introduction in the next,\n\n310\n00:16:41.047 --> 00:16:42.465\nwho knows how many years.\n\n311\n00:16:42.465 --> 00:16:47.145\nCommercially, quantum computing or\na different approach and set of laws and\n\n312\n00:16:47.145 --> 00:16:49.161\napproaches to and ideas around.\n\n313\n00:16:49.161 --> 00:16:51.477\nHow we move information structure and\n\n314\n00:16:51.477 --> 00:16:56.119\nprotect it by using modern computing\nsystems that are non-quantum based.\n\n315\n00:16:56.119 --> 00:16:59.184\nAs a result,\nwe are bound by certain things and\n\n316\n00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:04.058\nwe are instructed by certain things and\nwe operate within certain laws and\n\n317\n00:17:04.058 --> 00:17:08.817\nexpectations and Moore's Law is\na very important concept for us.\n\n318\n00:17:08.817 --> 00:17:12.144\nBecause it shows us that very,\nvery high-level very strong\n\n319\n00:17:12.144 --> 00:17:16.331\nprotections are only good for measurable,\nquantifiable periods of time.\n\n320\n00:17:16.331 --> 00:17:19.387\nIf we don't pay attention to\nthat timeline and that horizon,\n\n321\n00:17:19.387 --> 00:17:21.632\nwe run the risk of running\nout of protection.\n\n322\n00:17:21.632 --> 00:17:23.111\nSo encryption is very good and\n\n323\n00:17:23.111 --> 00:17:27.015\nwe certainly can see it as a technique\nthat does allow for destruction of data,\n\n324\n00:17:27.015 --> 00:17:31.780\nbut not in the traditional way and\nthis is what people often miss about this.\n\n325\n00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:35.244\nTechnique number one overriding\ntechnique number two degaussing.\n\n326\n00:17:35.244 --> 00:17:41.070\nPhysically, we'll go ahead and\ntry to remove or render inaccessible.\n\n327\n00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:46.341\nBecause of modification in some way,\nthe actual data itself.\n\n328\n00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:49.727\nThe overriding removes the data by\nswapping the bit, that's there that\n\n329\n00:17:49.727 --> 00:17:53.180\nrepresents that piece of data for\nanother bit that is random and useless.\n\n330\n00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.755\nAnd as result, literally removes the data\nfrom the system if done correctly and\n\n331\n00:17:57.755 --> 00:17:59.881\ndone often enough in the proper way.\n\n332\n00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:04.133\nDegaussing will magnetically alter\nthe environment and scramble the bits, so\n\n333\n00:18:04.133 --> 00:18:08.139\nthat they are non-recoverable,\nessentially rendering them unusable.\n\n334\n00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.791\nEncryption does the same kind of\nthing from a different perspective.\n\n335\n00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:13.213\nIt doesn't remove the data.\n\n336\n00:18:13.213 --> 00:18:16.862\nThe data stays in place, the data is\nthere and people often miss this.\n\n337\n00:18:16.862 --> 00:18:19.582\nWhen I talk about encryption,\nI say to people, you should encrypt.\n\n338\n00:18:19.582 --> 00:18:23.050\nOr in the cloud,\nyou should crypto-shred your data.\n\n339\n00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.974\nAnd as a result,\nyour data will have a modicum.\n\n340\n00:18:25.974 --> 00:18:29.890\nA relatively acceptable during\na well-defined period of time level of\n\n341\n00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.130\nconfidentiality protection.\n\n342\n00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:32.912\nThey say, okay, great.\n\n343\n00:18:32.912 --> 00:18:34.673\nSo that means all the data's gone,\nnobody can get it.\n\n344\n00:18:34.673 --> 00:18:36.400\nNo, people can get your data.\n\n345\n00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.070\nAs a matter of fact,\nI will give you the data.\n\n346\n00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:42.873\nI don't care about you possessing the data\nif it is encrypted sufficiently with\n\n347\n00:18:42.873 --> 00:18:46.170\na strong enough solution,\nwhat we call the entirety or\n\n348\n00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:51.403\nthe totality of the encryption solution,\nthe cryptosystem which is the algorithms,\n\n349\n00:18:51.403 --> 00:18:55.270\nthe keys and all the things\nthat go with that in totality.\n\n350\n00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:56.386\nI'll give you the data.\n\n351\n00:18:56.386 --> 00:18:57.898\nI don't have a problem with you having it.\n\n352\n00:18:57.898 --> 00:18:59.404\nIt's not gonna do you any good.\n\n353\n00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:01.836\nBecause if you can not\nbreak the encryption,\n\n354\n00:19:01.836 --> 00:19:06.060\nphysical possession of the data itself in\nan unusable form is not the same thing\n\n355\n00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:07.662\nas being able to use the data.\n\n356\n00:19:07.662 --> 00:19:13.860\nSo encryption renders the data unusable,\nunreadable, inaccessible.\n\n357\n00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.531\nBut does not remove the data from\nthe system, it secures it in place.\n\n358\n00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:20.787\nAnd this is why as we get down\nto cloud data in a few minutes,\n\n359\n00:19:20.787 --> 00:19:24.976\nit is the number one technique we talk\nabout with regards to protecting data\n\n360\n00:19:24.976 --> 00:19:28.452\nthat is gonna be left in a cloud\nsystem as you exit that system.\n\n361\n00:19:28.452 --> 00:19:31.486\nBecause you're leaving the data\nin the hands of the provider and\n\n362\n00:19:31.486 --> 00:19:33.972\nyou have to ensure that\nnobody can access that data.\n\n363\n00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:37.885\nSo encrypting that data in a special\nway referred to as cryptoshredding is\n\n364\n00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:40.080\nthe mechanism we often point to.\n\n365\n00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:45.034\nSo encryption is about securing\n\n366\n00:19:45.034 --> 00:19:49.987\nin place via use of algorithms,\n\n367\n00:19:49.987 --> 00:19:54.579\nif I spelled that correctly.\n\n368\n00:19:54.579 --> 00:19:57.116\nI'll go-\n&gt;&gt; R-I-T-H-M-S.\n\n369\n00:19:57.116 --> 00:20:01.985\n&gt;&gt; R-I-T-H, I had an extra I in there.\n\n370\n00:20:01.985 --> 00:20:04.322\nAlgorithms, I can't spell either.\n\n371\n00:20:04.322 --> 00:20:05.320\nI'm really cute.\n\n372\n00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.692\nI'm great at parties, but\nI cannot spell or type to save my life.\n\n373\n00:20:07.692 --> 00:20:09.772\nSecure use of algorithms.\n\n374\n00:20:09.772 --> 00:20:15.430\nRemember, stronger is better.\n\n375\n00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:22.452\nStronger is better and-\n\n376\n00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:34.645\nLong, long, long time periods which\nare referred to as workfactors.\n\n377\n00:20:34.645 --> 00:20:36.290\nSo that's what we're\ntalking about encryption.\n\n378\n00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:37.793\nAgain, high-level conversation.\n\n379\n00:20:37.793 --> 00:20:39.812\nA lot of detail we've\ngotta get into there.\n\n380\n00:20:39.812 --> 00:20:42.959\nA lot of richness and complexity that\nwill come up in future conversations.\n\n381\n00:20:42.959 --> 00:20:47.422\nWe're just really giving you a little\nteaser around the encryption conversation\n\n382\n00:20:47.422 --> 00:20:51.884\nby talking about things like single versus\ndual key, symmetric, asymmetric and\n\n383\n00:20:51.884 --> 00:20:55.652\nall the kind of stuff I just mentioned,\ncryptosystems and all that.\n\n384\n00:20:55.652 --> 00:20:58.091\nCrypto-shredding, I know you\nwanted to say something.\n\n385\n00:20:58.091 --> 00:20:59.262\nLet me just type my thought.\n\n386\n00:20:59.262 --> 00:21:01.190\nNo, talk while I'm typing my\nthought as we already defined\n\n387\n00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:02.273\ncrypto-shredding.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n388\n00:21:02.273 --> 00:21:03.313\n&gt;&gt; And then let's talk about it.\n\n389\n00:21:03.313 --> 00:21:04.062\n&gt;&gt; Sure, absolutely.\n\n390\n00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:07.877\nNow while he's typing, one of the things\nyou had said in the first part of this\n\n391\n00:21:07.877 --> 00:21:11.942\nthought process that we're in is the\nencryption or encrypting your encryption.\n\n392\n00:21:11.942 --> 00:21:14.986\nNow, that's an oversimplification on\nmy part for lack of understanding.\n\n393\n00:21:14.986 --> 00:21:18.002\nYou simplify it by taking the complex and\nmaking it understandable.\n\n394\n00:21:18.002 --> 00:21:18.974\nTell me a little more about that.\n\n395\n00:21:18.974 --> 00:21:22.307\nI thought that was a fascinating term\nabout encrypting your encryption, I think\n\n396\n00:21:22.307 --> 00:21:24.906\nin the context of crypto-shredding.\n&gt;&gt; That's what I'm about to\n\n397\n00:21:24.906 --> 00:21:25.530\ntype right now.\n\n398\n00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:29.074\nEncrypting your encryption.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n399\n00:21:29.074 --> 00:21:31.148\n&gt;&gt; And so what we mean by crypto-shredding\n\n400\n00:21:31.148 --> 00:21:33.832\nis that,\nlet's assume we've encrypted our data,\n\n401\n00:21:33.832 --> 00:21:37.922\nall of the conversation we just had a\nmoment ago about encryption as a baseline.\n\n402\n00:21:37.922 --> 00:21:41.126\nSo we've taken our RSA\n4096-bit algorithm and\n\n403\n00:21:41.126 --> 00:21:43.800\nour encrypted system that goes with it.\n\n404\n00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.521\nWe've encrypted our data and\nwe've branded it most likely,\n\n405\n00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:51.699\nconsiderably more secured than it was and\n\n406\n00:21:51.699 --> 00:21:55.983\nwill be secured very likely for\na very long time to come.\n\n407\n00:21:55.983 --> 00:21:58.723\nIf all we did was that and\nwe stop right there,\n\n408\n00:21:58.723 --> 00:22:01.766\nwe would have a potential\nweakness in the system.\n\n409\n00:22:01.766 --> 00:22:05.424\nAnd the potential weakness is that\nthe key whether it is a single key,\n\n410\n00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:09.333\nthe symmetry key, the private key or\nthe only key that we have in a single or\n\n411\n00:22:09.333 --> 00:22:10.620\nsymmetric key system.\n\n412\n00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:17.468\nAnd, or the public, private key pair, the\nasymmetric keys which are paired together.\n\n413\n00:22:17.468 --> 00:22:19.657\nOne is gonna be dedicated\nto one operation.\n\n414\n00:22:19.657 --> 00:22:23.510\nOne depending on how you set the system\nup, dedicate it to the other operation.\n\n415\n00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.420\nIn our example, let's just say,\nit's the private key that encrypts.\n\n416\n00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.952\nAnd therefore, as a result, we will then\nhave a public key that can decrypt or\n\n417\n00:22:30.952 --> 00:22:33.409\nvice versa depending on what we wanna do.\n\n418\n00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:36.711\nIt doesn't really matter, cuz we're not\nworried about what's doing what right now.\n\n419\n00:22:36.711 --> 00:22:40.883\nWe just wanna distinguish the fact that\none key of the two keys is dedicated\n\n420\n00:22:40.883 --> 00:22:43.250\nto each function as you set the system up.\n\n421\n00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:48.459\nAnd so the weakness in our example\njust with encryption is the fact\n\n422\n00:22:48.459 --> 00:22:53.098\nthat if we can gain access to\nthat key which every key it is,\n\n423\n00:22:53.098 --> 00:22:58.114\nthen as a bad actors, the thread source,\nI have the one missing\n\n424\n00:22:58.114 --> 00:23:03.445\npiece of the puzzle that I would\nneed in order to decrypt that data.\n\n425\n00:23:03.445 --> 00:23:06.097\nEncryption is the process\nof securing data and\n\n426\n00:23:06.097 --> 00:23:10.111\nproviding confidentiality protection\nby applying a cryptosystem,\n\n427\n00:23:10.111 --> 00:23:14.066\nand running the data through\nthe cryptosystem to achieve security.\n\n428\n00:23:14.066 --> 00:23:16.650\nDescription is the exact\nopposite of endeavor.\n\n429\n00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:20.214\nWe run the data through the cryptosystem\nbackwards to strip away\n\n430\n00:23:20.214 --> 00:23:24.570\nthe confidentiality protections rendering\nthe data usable or readable again\n\n431\n00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:28.403\nby decrypting or unincrypting,\nyou hear it referred to either way.\n\n432\n00:23:28.403 --> 00:23:30.973\nAnd so\nthe weakness in a generic cryptosystem and\n\n433\n00:23:30.973 --> 00:23:33.993\na generic approach to encryption\nis security of the key.\n\n434\n00:23:33.993 --> 00:23:39.483\nMeaning, physically and logically securing\nthat key, so that nobody can get it.\n\n435\n00:23:39.483 --> 00:23:41.787\nBecause if somebody\ngets a hold to the key,\n\n436\n00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:45.442\nall the other protections\nare essentially stripped away and gone.\n\n437\n00:23:45.442 --> 00:23:49.508\nBecause all you have to do is put\nthe key in the system, turn it on and\n\n438\n00:23:49.508 --> 00:23:52.206\nout the back end pops\nthe data unencrypted.\n\n439\n00:23:52.206 --> 00:23:56.514\nAnd remember, people are most likely\nto be able to get a copy of that data.\n\n440\n00:23:56.514 --> 00:23:58.971\nI'm not saying they will in every case,\nbut I'm saying they can.\n\n441\n00:23:58.971 --> 00:24:02.835\nIf it's in encrypted form, cuz we normally\ndon't worry about the fact they get\n\n442\n00:24:02.835 --> 00:24:05.502\nthe data,\nbecause they can't unencrypt it, right?\n\n443\n00:24:05.502 --> 00:24:09.475\nSo we gotta be really focused on the fact\nthat there is a potential liability in\n\n444\n00:24:09.475 --> 00:24:13.790\ngeneric encryption systems, which is\nsecurity of the key after the fact.\n\n445\n00:24:13.790 --> 00:24:15.160\nHow do we secure the key?\n\n446\n00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.053\nWhat crypto-shredding does is\nit says head-on, hey listen,\n\n447\n00:24:19.053 --> 00:24:21.440\nlet's encrypt our data, okay great.\n\n448\n00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.650\nNow, how are we gonna\ndeal with key security?\n\n449\n00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:25.650\nWell, what if we come back through, and\n\n450\n00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.970\nwhat if we encrypt the key\nthat unencrypts the data?\n\n451\n00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.130\nAnd then what if we take\nthat encrypted key,\n\n452\n00:24:32.130 --> 00:24:38.000\nthat must be used to decrypt that data,\nand we separate it from the data?\n\n453\n00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.310\nAnd then we throw away the encryption\nkeys that will unencrypt the key\n\n454\n00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:42.330\nthat unencrypts the data,\n\n455\n00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:47.610\nbreaking the system in such a way that\nit is almost impossible for anybody\n\n456\n00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:52.570\nto recover all the pieces necessary in\norder to decrypt the original data.\n\n457\n00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:57.230\nAnd so when we encrypt\nthe encryption system keys and\n\n458\n00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:01.320\nthen break the system by throwing\naway those keys and destroying them.\n\n459\n00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.870\nYou would have to recover the keys\nthat would unencrypt the original data\n\n460\n00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:06.990\nencryption key.\n\n461\n00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:09.260\nAnd then unencrypt that\nkey to unencrypt the data.\n\n462\n00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.280\nIt becomes exponentially\nmore difficult to imagine\n\n463\n00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.370\nthat all that can occur within\na reasonable period of time.\n\n464\n00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.380\nIf again, we are focused on this,\nwe do this the right way,\n\n465\n00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:20.968\nwe implement the appropriate protections.\n\n466\n00:25:20.968 --> 00:25:25.790\nAnd so crypto-shredding is simply the idea\nof encrypting the encryption system.\n\n467\n00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.170\nSo that we further protect it\nby putting another barrier,\n\n468\n00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.390\nanother layer of separation between us and\nthe original data.\n\n469\n00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:35.530\nAnd preventing the bad actor from\naccessing both sets of keys to\n\n470\n00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.040\naccess the data.\n\n471\n00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:43.220\nThe idea behind this in cloud data\nsecurity is the idea that if we can do\n\n472\n00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:47.070\nthis successfully, we can leave the data\nphysically present in the cloud system.\n\n473\n00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:50.490\nWe just don't care, because even\nif somebody accesses the data,\n\n474\n00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:53.710\nthe likelihood that they would be\nable to get both sets of keys and\n\n475\n00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:57.462\nthe data within a reasonable\namount of time is highly unlikely.\n\n476\n00:25:57.462 --> 00:26:00.590\nSo crypto-shredding has\nbecome the reference point,\n\n477\n00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:03.740\nor one of the key reference points for\ncloud data security.\n\n478\n00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:08.200\nSo re-encrypting, or rather encrypting the\noriginal encryption keys are what we talk\n\n479\n00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.776\nabout in crypto-shredding.\n\n480\n00:26:09.776 --> 00:26:13.100\nPhysical destruction,\ntalked about this, right?\n\n481\n00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:17.240\nThis can take a variety of forms, you\ncould use what are called hammer mills,\n\n482\n00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.970\nwhich are huge machines that just\nliterally set of massive metal hammers.\n\n483\n00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.225\nOr some sort of big pieces of\niron that just come down and\n\n484\n00:26:24.225 --> 00:26:27.778\nbeat the snot out of everything that goes\nthrough them, destroying things, right?\n\n485\n00:26:27.778 --> 00:26:29.124\n&gt;&gt; Pulverizing, mm-hm.\n\n486\n00:26:29.124 --> 00:26:31.152\n&gt;&gt; You may have a shredder,\n\n487\n00:26:31.152 --> 00:26:35.788\nmuch like a wood chipper, but\ndesigned specifically for\n\n488\n00:26:35.788 --> 00:26:42.180\nthe use with physically metal-encased\nphysical drives, things like that.\n\n489\n00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:46.103\nYour big cloud providers have these if\nyou've ever seen a virtual tour of a data\n\n490\n00:26:46.103 --> 00:26:47.240\ncenter kind of thing.\n\n491\n00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.239\nThey have them on YouTube,\nyou could watch them.\n\n492\n00:26:49.239 --> 00:26:52.630\nGoogle has one out there that they show,\nso does Microsoft.\n\n493\n00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:56.000\nThey got these massive systems,\nsitting in their loading bays\n\n494\n00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.010\nwhere somebody just walks up,\ndrops a whole bunch of drives in the top.\n\n495\n00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:03.090\nAnd they just spit out basically\nmetal confetti out the back end.\n\n496\n00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.255\nBecause they're just massive shredders.\n\n497\n00:27:04.255 --> 00:27:06.260\nSo there's a lot of ways to do this.\n\n498\n00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:10.540\nDoesn't really matter what the mechanism\nis, the point is you're gonna try to\n\n499\n00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:14.600\nremove all possibility of those\nphysical devices being accessed.\n\n500\n00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.712\nBecause you're gonna destroy\nnot just the electronics,\n\n501\n00:27:17.712 --> 00:27:20.258\nbut the actual storage medium as well,\nright?\n\n502\n00:27:20.258 --> 00:27:22.270\nThat's what physical\ndistraction is all about.\n\n503\n00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:27.635\nSo, the idea of rendering, whoops,\n\n504\n00:27:27.635 --> 00:27:31.996\nrendering unusable through,\n\n505\n00:27:31.996 --> 00:27:35.685\n[COUGH] a variety of means,\n\n506\n00:27:35.685 --> 00:27:39.892\nright what every that may be.\n\n507\n00:27:39.892 --> 00:27:45.485\nThings like shredding,\n\n508\n00:27:45.485 --> 00:27:50.501\npulverizing, etc.\n&gt;&gt; And\n\n509\n00:27:50.501 --> 00:27:53.551\nwould the manual way be\ncoming to play here, too?\n\n510\n00:27:53.551 --> 00:27:55.560\nAnd I give you a case in point here.\n\n511\n00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:57.767\nI've actually had to do this for\nour co-founder,\n\n512\n00:27:57.767 --> 00:28:00.657\nbecause every time he gets a new laptop,\nhe switches hard drives.\n\n513\n00:28:00.657 --> 00:28:02.264\nAnd he gave me a stack\nof laptop drives and\n\n514\n00:28:02.264 --> 00:28:04.930\nI basically took the platters apart and\nsmashed every one of them.\n\n515\n00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:07.970\nThat's how I found out the platters\nare actually glass, not metal in there.\n\n516\n00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:12.077\nWith the physical destruction,\neven if it's a manual process apply?\n\n517\n00:28:12.077 --> 00:28:14.708\nI mean it's more labor.\n&gt;&gt; It could, depending on the level you\n\n518\n00:28:14.708 --> 00:28:18.430\nwanna achieve, because if you did not\nthen take those shards or pieces and\n\n519\n00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:22.351\nensure that they would not be able to\nbe put back together again, number one.\n\n520\n00:28:22.351 --> 00:28:24.133\nSo separate them, right?\n\n521\n00:28:24.133 --> 00:28:27.408\nAnd then dispose of them in such\na way that nobody could find them and\n\n522\n00:28:27.408 --> 00:28:28.870\nreconstitute them.\n\n523\n00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.196\nIt may have not actually\nprovided enough protection.\n\n524\n00:28:31.196 --> 00:28:34.004\nI am not suggesting that you did or\ndidn't do that, but\n\n525\n00:28:34.004 --> 00:28:37.746\ncracking something down the middle\nis not enough to render it unusable.\n\n526\n00:28:37.746 --> 00:28:41.980\nYeah, you're not gonna be able to put it\nback together, spin it at 15,000 RPM,\n\n527\n00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.620\nand read it.\n\n528\n00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:47.205\nBut that doesn't mean you can't Go through\nan analyze the surface of each shard to\n\n529\n00:28:47.205 --> 00:28:48.790\npull data off it.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n530\n00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:51.190\n&gt;&gt; So if you had not rendered the shards\n\n531\n00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:55.820\nunuseable through other mechanisms,\nthe magnetic remnant data is still there.\n\n532\n00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:58.480\nIt's just not in a form\nthat's easily accessible.\n\n533\n00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.310\nSo you actually may not have\nprovided a lot of protection,\n\n534\n00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.897\ndepending on what you did.\n&gt;&gt; That's good to\n\n535\n00:29:02.897 --> 00:29:03.738\nknow.\n&gt;&gt; Yep.\n\n536\n00:29:03.738 --> 00:29:06.961\nAll right, so, chemical alteration,\ntalked about this.\n\n537\n00:29:06.961 --> 00:29:11.134\nThis is using, whether it's acid,\nwhether it is thermite,\n\n538\n00:29:11.134 --> 00:29:15.403\nwhether it is plasma,\nthere's a variety of things you can do.\n\n539\n00:29:15.403 --> 00:29:19.405\nBut this is applying some sort\nof solution of one kind or\n\n540\n00:29:19.405 --> 00:29:23.582\nanother to the medium to again\nrender it inaccessible and\n\n541\n00:29:23.582 --> 00:29:27.650\nunusable for\na variety of different approaches.\n\n542\n00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:32.210\nRemember we're dealing with magnetic\ndata that somehow remnant in the system.\n\n543\n00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:37.570\nThe idea of physical access to\nthe system implies access to the data.\n\n544\n00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:42.160\nIf the medium is not readable, because it\nhas been modified beyond our ability to\n\n545\n00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.310\nuse it that may very well be enough and\nchemically altering the platter by\n\n546\n00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:52.310\npitting it with acid and or exposing\nit to incredibly high temperatures and\n\n547\n00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:56.480\nliquefying it in a gas furnace or\nwhatever you would do.\n\n548\n00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.420\nIs enough under most situations and\ncircumstances,\n\n549\n00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:03.210\nbut you would have to understand\nhow to do so safely, right?\n\n550\n00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:07.090\nYou can't just drop it into,\nyou know, a bucket of bleach and\n\n551\n00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:09.520\nexpect that bleach to render\nthe hard drive inoperable.\n\n552\n00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.790\nIt'll fry the electronics,\nthat doesn't mean that the platter itself\n\n553\n00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:15.130\nis going to get damaged to\nthe point it can't be repaired.\n\n554\n00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.270\nWhich means the average individual's not\ngoing to be able to plug that drive into\n\n555\n00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.390\na laptop and make it work.\n\n556\n00:30:20.390 --> 00:30:22.404\nBut that doesn't mean we can't recover it.\n\n557\n00:30:22.404 --> 00:30:25.733\nI threw it in water, okay yeah,\nwell you got it wet, we'll dry it out and\n\n558\n00:30:25.733 --> 00:30:29.020\nuse special tools and techniques and\nwe'll be able to access the data.\n\n559\n00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:33.940\nAgain, that's not gonna really render the\ndata inaccessible, it's just gonna render\n\n560\n00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:37.380\nit unavailable to the average individual\nwithout the skills and knowledge.\n\n561\n00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:41.400\nAccess the data in that situation\nthen we get into forensics and\n\n562\n00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:45.760\nresponse, all the things that we often\nhear about or find out after the fact.\n\n563\n00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.560\nSo chemical alteration can be effective.\n\n564\n00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.800\nBut again you have to use some\nsort of combination of mechanisms\n\n565\n00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.010\nthat would render platters unbeatable and\nunusable.\n\n566\n00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:59.690\nAnd then phase shifting or\n\n567\n00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:04.760\ntransition Specifically the Curie\ntemperatures I mentioned here.\n\n568\n00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.610\nThis is where through the application\nof incredibly high temperatures,\n\n569\n00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:11.810\nwe modify the magnetic\nproperties of the media.\n\n570\n00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:15.170\nWhen you heat magnetized media\nbeyond a certain temperature.\n\n571\n00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:20.210\nThat tipping point is called the Curie\ntemperature, in physics and in sciences.\n\n572\n00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:21.870\nWhen you reach that point and\n\n573\n00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:26.800\ngo beyond it, you physically transform\nthrough phase shift that medium,\n\n574\n00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.860\nyou change the way it is structured, the\nway it behaves and the properties it has.\n\n575\n00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:35.470\nAnd as a result that will\nrender the data unavailable and\n\n576\n00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:39.486\ncan do so very quickly and\nvery effectively by very high temperature.\n\n577\n00:31:39.486 --> 00:31:42.050\nIt's again Gas furnaces that can melt and\n\n578\n00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:45.890\nliquefy media are typically used\nhere to reach those points.\n\n579\n00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:49.270\nIf you've ever seen any blacksmithing or\nforging.\n\n580\n00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.140\nWhat is it?\n\n581\n00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:55.200\nForged in Fire,\nthe show on cable that shows you this.\n\n582\n00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.173\nYou see those gas furnaces they use to.\n\n583\n00:31:57.173 --> 00:32:00.833\nYou'll heat that metal up to\nmaybe 2,000 degrees or so.\n\n584\n00:32:00.833 --> 00:32:01.791\nIt's the kind of thing\nwe're talking about.\n\n585\n00:32:01.791 --> 00:32:03.562\nYou throw a hard drive in there and\nmelt it.\n\n586\n00:32:03.562 --> 00:32:05.142\nAnd the platters get melted.\n\n587\n00:32:05.142 --> 00:32:07.163\nThey're not going to be available to you.\n\n588\n00:32:07.163 --> 00:32:10.191\nI don't care what you have as slag\nmetal out the back end when we're done\n\n589\n00:32:10.191 --> 00:32:11.030\nin a puddle.\n\n590\n00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.830\nYou're not gonna be making heads or\ntails out of the data as a result.\n\n591\n00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.660\nSo make sure you're aware of that and\nhave a sense of that.\n\n592\n00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.870\nThat's also gonna be very critical.\n\n593\n00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:21.270\nAll right, I want to touch on\nthe differences at a high level.\n\n594\n00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:22.940\nI'm gonna ask Wes to help us out here,\n\n595\n00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.560\ncuz this is an area I know\nhe knows a lot about.\n\n596\n00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:28.060\nI dare to say probably more than I do\n\n597\n00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:31.100\nin many respects about\nthe intricacies of these devices.\n\n598\n00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:34.200\nRemember, we're gonna keep this not\nat the what's the ten things you\n\n599\n00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.830\ngotta know about why SSDs\nare different than HDs, but rather.\n\n600\n00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:42.710\nWhat are the key fundamental differences\nbetween solid state drives, SSD drives,\n\n601\n00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:46.570\nand what we call traditional hard drives\nwith spinning or moving platters?\n\n602\n00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:50.360\nBecause the most obvious difference is,\nhey, one moves and essentially,\n\n603\n00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.730\none does not, right?\n\n604\n00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:53.400\nBut there is a little bit\nmore to it than that.\n\n605\n00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.780\nSo let's maybe, just for\na couple minutes, talk about it.\n\n606\n00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:55.840\n&gt;&gt; Yes, definitely.\n\n607\n00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.288\nOne of the first two basic factors\nthat I can boil it down to are one,\n\n608\n00:33:00.288 --> 00:33:01.580\nmagnetic media.\n\n609\n00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:03.520\nThat is how the data is going\nto be stored and manipulated.\n\n610\n00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.410\nTwo, the other one is electronic storage.\n\n611\n00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:08.170\nYou know in the past that any kind\nof electronic storage medium,\n\n612\n00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:12.920\nsuch as an SSD, really stores data in a\nway that's nonvolatile, means power gone.\n\n613\n00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.810\nGuess what?\n\n614\n00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:15.030\nIt's still there, right?\n\n615\n00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:18.970\nWell, in magnetic media, when the data is\nstored, it's stored magnetically through\n\n616\n00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:21.230\nthe spinning platters like\nAdam's already mentioned.\n\n617\n00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:24.440\nAnd yeah, the data is still there\nwhen we power the systems down, but\n\n618\n00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.840\nagain it's how it's actually stored and\n\n619\n00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:31.040\nhow they actually write information to the\nPlatters versus let's say like [INAUDIBLE]\n\n620\n00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:36.220\nflash chip within that solid state drive\nthat really differentiate the two.\n\n621\n00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.950\nAnd I can only imagine from your\nperspective that that's gonna\n\n622\n00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:42.550\ndifferentiate how we destroy the\ninformation versus how it's also recovered\n\n623\n00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:44.350\nas well.\n&gt;&gt; More so\n\n624\n00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:45.810\nthe destruction than the recovery.\n\n625\n00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:46.850\nRecovery is recovery.\n&gt;&gt; Yes.\n\n626\n00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:47.610\n&gt;&gt; You plug the thing in or\n\n627\n00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:49.020\naccess it in some way and\n\n628\n00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.840\nhopefully something comes off it.\n&gt;&gt; Gotcha.\n\n629\n00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.640\n&gt;&gt; But, you know,\n\n630\n00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.580\nvendor intricacies in terms of just\ninterfaces not withstanding cuz\n\n631\n00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:57.140\nthere's always a little variation.\n&gt;&gt; Sure.\n\n632\n00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.620\n&gt;&gt; Maybe by vendors,\n\n633\n00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.660\nalthough many of these things\nare standardized today.\n\n634\n00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.810\nBut I'm thinking more about, you know,\nthe management interface, the software,\n\n635\n00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:06.790\nthe API that the vendor may\nprovide as being the variable.\n\n636\n00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:10.220\nNot the 32 pins on the plug or whatever\nit may be cause those are standardized,\n\n637\n00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:11.245\nright?\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n638\n00:34:11.245 --> 00:34:12.675\n&gt;&gt; But, aside from that,\n\n639\n00:34:12.675 --> 00:34:13.435\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n640\n00:34:13.435 --> 00:34:16.365\nThe key differentiator here,\ntwo things to be aware of.\n\n641\n00:34:16.365 --> 00:34:18.755\nNumber one, the SSD medium.\n\n642\n00:34:18.755 --> 00:34:23.955\nBoth are magnetic in the sense that we\nhave some capability to store data,\n\n643\n00:34:23.955 --> 00:34:26.487\nthe HD drive on a traditional\nhard drive is magnetic.\n\n644\n00:34:26.487 --> 00:34:28.757\nIt stores it in traditional ways.\n\n645\n00:34:28.757 --> 00:34:32.807\nSSD drives are essentially like\nhuge flash memory systems.\n\n646\n00:34:32.807 --> 00:34:36.307\nAnd we write to them and\nwe store the data there but\n\n647\n00:34:36.307 --> 00:34:39.297\nit is permanent,\nas it is in a traditional hard drive.\n\n648\n00:34:39.297 --> 00:34:42.077\nYou can power it off, power it back on,\nthe data will be resident there.\n\n649\n00:34:42.077 --> 00:34:42.950\nIt does not go away.\n\n650\n00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:47.800\nThe key difference is that\nbecause of the nature of the SSD\n\n651\n00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.540\ntechnology in architecture\nbeing a huge memory system,\n\n652\n00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.830\nas opposed to a physical\nmedium that we write to and\n\n653\n00:34:55.830 --> 00:35:01.380\naccess with a record player, CDROM,\nreading head-like technology.\n\n654\n00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.350\nThink of RAM in your computer.\n\n655\n00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:04.840\nThat's the closest thing\nyou can allocate or\n\n656\n00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.340\nthink of in your mind\nas equivalent to SSD.\n\n657\n00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.930\nWe access that very differently, right?\n\n658\n00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:15.360\nAnd because of that, the way we wipe data\nout in SSD drives has to be different.\n\n659\n00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.620\nWe can't simply de-gouse an SSD drive.\n\n660\n00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.910\nIt doesn't work that way because it's\nnot going to wipe the data out because\n\n661\n00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:24.820\nthe data is not stored in the same way as\nit would on an HD drive or traditional\n\n662\n00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:29.140\nhard drive, rather we have to use special\ncommands that the vendor provides.\n\n663\n00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.030\nThey are usually gonna be\na little bit different by vendor\n\n664\n00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.840\nbecause they are based on\nthe implementation of the firmware and\n\n665\n00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:39.570\nthe operational environment the vendor\nprovides to interact with the medium,\n\n666\n00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.010\nbut little vagaries notwithstanding,\nessentially these commands look and\n\n667\n00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:47.750\nfeel pretty much the same across many if\nnot most of the vendors systems today.\n\n668\n00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:50.765\nBut they are special and\nunique, you have to talk to or\n\n669\n00:35:50.765 --> 00:35:55.625\nfind out from each vendor the exact\nspecification and command or command sets,\n\n670\n00:35:55.625 --> 00:36:00.175\nthe switches, things like that, that have\nto be specified to wipe data out securely.\n\n671\n00:36:00.175 --> 00:36:03.455\nYou can do that, but it's not just\na simple matter of saying format,\n\n672\n00:36:03.455 --> 00:36:07.680\nor You know just to raise, put it in this\nbox, zap it with the magnetic field, and\n\n673\n00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.230\nboom we're done.\n\n674\n00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:11.160\nYou have to use the special commands\nbuilt in for construction or\n\n675\n00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.760\nfor management of data.\n\n676\n00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.140\nThey are typically going\nto be available to you,\n\n677\n00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.180\nyou may need administrative level or\ncertain kinds of passwords to protect\n\n678\n00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:21.450\nlevel rights to get to them Depends\non the nature of the system.\n\n679\n00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.490\nBut the vendor usually has documentation.\n\n680\n00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:24.750\nIt's not difficult to find out.\n\n681\n00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.560\nIt's a matter of knowing what they are.\n&gt;&gt; Does the standard overriding process,\n\n682\n00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.235\nthat's different if I\nunderstand this right?\n\n683\n00:36:30.235 --> 00:36:31.262\n&gt;&gt; It is different on SSDs\n\n684\n00:36:31.262 --> 00:36:34.240\nversus the traditional mechanical drive.\n&gt;&gt; Again, because of the way that\n\n685\n00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.800\nthe data is stored and the way that We see\nthe medium because remember with SSD drive\n\n686\n00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.510\ncentral you write once, right?\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n687\n00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.840\n&gt;&gt; And you access many.\n\n688\n00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.560\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n689\n00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.460\n&gt;&gt; So it's a worm like system, right?\n\n690\n00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:47.050\nOne text, or write once read many\nas what we call the acronym.\n\n691\n00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:50.810\nWhereas with a hard drive,\n[INAUDIBLE] media you can write once, and\n\n692\n00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:53.010\npotentially write again and\nagain and again in the same space,\n\n693\n00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:56.360\nin theory, overwriting data, but\nessentially accessing data as well.\n\n694\n00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.290\nThe structure in the operation\nis different, and\n\n695\n00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:02.840\nas a result, it behaves differently,\nwe can't treat it traditionally the same.\n\n696\n00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:07.110\nAll right, just to finish up here because\nthe clock on the wall has not moved since\n\n697\n00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:10.120\nwe started, which I'm thinking is-\n&gt;&gt; We're about 31 minutes.\n\n698\n00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.710\n&gt;&gt; Just a sticking problem there,\n\n699\n00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:15.100\nwe are officially beyond time at\nthis point, so we do wanna wrap up.\n\n700\n00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.250\nThis will only take a moment.\n\n701\n00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:20.020\nWe've talked extensively about cloud\ndata and the concerns around it already.\n\n702\n00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:24.010\nRemember reference the conversation\nup above here about crypto-shredding.\n\n703\n00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.970\nThe idea would be that we have to\nbe worried about data that sits\n\n704\n00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:30.180\nIn cloud systems after\nwe exit the platform and\n\n705\n00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:32.670\nhow we protect privacy\nwhile the data is there.\n\n706\n00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:36.510\nBut also certainly after we leave as\nwell throughout the data life cycle.\n\n707\n00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.920\nAn encryption encryption encryption,\nI can't say enough about it.\n\n708\n00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.200\nIn this case we don't just say encrypt but\n\n709\n00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.420\nremember we wanna encrypt\nwhile it is in storage.\n\n710\n00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:48.210\nWe don't want to encrypt the shed while\nit's in storage if you want to see\n\n711\n00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:49.620\nthe data again, right?\n\n712\n00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:53.380\nSo this is really a two step process.\n\n713\n00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:57.560\nEncrypt data, whoops,\n\n714\n00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:03.560\nwhile storage and use, right?\n\n715\n00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:10.290\nAnd this little arrow means then\nwrites to assure that then write upon\n\n716\n00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:20.480\nexit crypto-shred remaining data, right?\n\n717\n00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:25.150\nAnd as a result, we are rendering data\nthat is gonna stay in that system\n\n718\n00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:29.130\ninaccessible and unusable by anybody\nwho may be able to physically get their\n\n719\n00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:33.010\nhands on it by copying it or whatever once\nit's no longer in your direct control.\n\n720\n00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:36.230\nNow I am not suggesting the data\nstays in cloud systems forever.\n\n721\n00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:39.755\nYou may be able to have a negotiated\nagreement with the cloud a vendor that you\n\n722\n00:38:39.755 --> 00:38:41.835\nwill be able to remove that data and\n\n723\n00:38:41.835 --> 00:38:44.295\nthat they will certify\nremoval at a certain level.\n\n724\n00:38:44.295 --> 00:38:46.345\nIt just depends on the kind\nof agreements you have.\n\n725\n00:38:46.345 --> 00:38:50.785\nBut remember even then, there are backups\nof that data that take place every minute,\n\n726\n00:38:50.785 --> 00:38:55.255\nevery hour, every day, whatever on varying\nschedules, based on how the cloud provider\n\n727\n00:38:55.255 --> 00:38:59.920\nmanages high availability,\nfault tolerance, failover, redundancy.\n\n728\n00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.680\nIt's all the things you've\ngot to think about.\n\n729\n00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:05.960\nThey're backing data up on your behalf\nconsistently and constantly and\n\n730\n00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.620\nthat backed up data stays in their\nsystems for a period of time,\n\n731\n00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.650\neven when you're no longer a customer.\n\n732\n00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:15.950\nAnd so that data that's in backups over\na week, two weeks, a month, whatever that\n\n733\n00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:21.340\nrotation cycle may be is gonna be remnant\nin that system for some time upon exit.\n\n734\n00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.030\nAnd if you don't take\nsteps to protect that,\n\n735\n00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:27.320\nthen somebody may be able to expose\nthat data even after you are no longer\n\n736\n00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.820\na customer because you may\nnot realize it's happening.\n\n737\n00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.190\nSo you have to think about that.\n\n738\n00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:32.490\nAnd then collection limitations.\n\n739\n00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:34.460\nThe last thing.\nCan we go full screen here for a second?\n\n740\n00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.220\nSee that?\n\n741\n00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.570\nThis is part of the conversation\nfrom the core principles,\n\n742\n00:39:38.570 --> 00:39:43.110\nthe 8 core principles from the OACD what\nwe talked about in regards to privacy.\n\n743\n00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:45.960\nCollection limitation is one\nof those core principles.\n\n744\n00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.740\nWe had a pretty thorough discussion about\nthis already, but I want to remind you\n\n745\n00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:53.910\nthat in regards to protection of privacy,\nhigh personally identifiable information\n\n746\n00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.520\nin particular, that collection\nlimitation is a very important concept.\n\n747\n00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.520\nThere should be limits on\nthe collection of personal data, and\n\n748\n00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.450\nsuch data should be obtained lawfully,\nby fair means,\n\n749\n00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:07.220\nand where appropriate with knowledge and\nconsent of the data subject.\n\n750\n00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:11.830\nRemember, the data subject is the user\nwhose data is being collected.\n\n751\n00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:15.330\nThe data owner is the person\nwho is in charge of and\n\n752\n00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:17.510\nowns that data in the system.\n\n753\n00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:20.693\nNow, the data subject is the data\nowner of their own information,\n\n754\n00:40:20.693 --> 00:40:25.080\ndon't get me wrong, but when that\nsystem is collecting the data and\n\n755\n00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.960\nit gets stored somewhere else,\nthere's another owner of that data.\n\n756\n00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.830\nSomebody who's in charge of that\nsystem who may have very different\n\n757\n00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:35.030\ninterpretations of requirements around\nuse than you do as the personal owner.\n\n758\n00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:38.330\nSo there may be more than one owner\ndepending on the contents, right?\n\n759\n00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:40.928\nSo if you go to the OECD\nprivacy.org website,\n\n760\n00:40:40.928 --> 00:40:45.324\nthe one that I've listed there which you\ncan see and I did show you when we talked\n\n761\n00:40:45.324 --> 00:40:49.343\nabout the OECD Privacy Principles,\nyou will see they are listed here.\n\n762\n00:40:49.343 --> 00:40:52.421\nThe collection limitation principl,\namong all of the eight items.\n\n763\n00:40:52.421 --> 00:40:54.300\nYou should know all eight,\nif you remember.\n\n764\n00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:59.990\nThe key principles the OECD put out\ncollection limitation, data quality,\n\n765\n00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:04.270\npurpose specification, use limitation,\nsecurity safeguards, openness, individual\n\n766\n00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.930\nparticipation, the opt-in concept that\nwe talked about and accountability.\n\n767\n00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:09.471\nRight?\nYou should know all eight, but\n\n768\n00:41:09.471 --> 00:41:10.125\nin particular,\n\n769\n00:41:10.125 --> 00:41:13.155\ncollection limitation is very relevant\nin this particular conversation.\n\n770\n00:41:13.155 --> 00:41:17.070\nSo, make sure you are familiar with\nthese you have a sense of them and\n\n771\n00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:21.620\nunderstand what they represent but\nfocus on collection limitation\n\n772\n00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:26.330\nwith regards to protection of privacy.\n&gt;&gt; That is a reoccurring\n\n773\n00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:29.840\ntheme to this series, and can only imagine\nwe've got more of that type of thought\n\n774\n00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.820\nprocess to come, but not in this episode.\n\n775\n00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.260\nWe're going to go ahead and sign out here.\n\n776\n00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.950\nAdam, it's been a fun episode,\na fun few episodes here, and\n\n777\n00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:37.020\nthis one loved the topics.\n\n778\n00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:38.135\nAnd we love you the viewers.\n\n779\n00:41:38.135 --> 00:41:40.055\nRemember, I've been your\nhost here at IT Pro TV,\n\n780\n00:41:40.055 --> 00:41:40.670\nWes Bryan.\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n781\n00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:44.245\n&gt;&gt; We'll see you next time.\n\n782\n00:41:44.245 --> 00:41:50.444\n[MUSIC]\n\n783\n00:41:50.444 -->

00:00:12.124\n&gt;&gt; You're watching IT PRO.TV.\n\n4\n00:00:12.124 --> 00:00:16.274\nGreetings everyone, and welcome back to\nanother stunning episode of ITPRO.TV,\n\n5\n00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:17.826\nI'm your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n6\n00:00:17.826 --> 00:00:21.460\nAnd in today's episode, hold on to\nyour hats, cuz we're pack for more for\n\n7\n00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.938\nCISSP series,\njoining us in the studio yet again,\n\n8\n00:00:23.938 --> 00:00:27.183\nto talk about Asset Retention,\na good friend, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n9\n00:00:27.183 --> 00:00:29.908\nAdam, welcome back sir.\n&gt;&gt; I'm looking at hats, I have nothing to\n\n10\n00:00:29.908 --> 00:00:33.052\nhold onto tonight, I feel unprepared.\n&gt;&gt; The proverbial hat.\n\n11\n00:00:33.052 --> 00:00:34.601\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't actually\n\n12\n00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:35.684\nown a hat.\n&gt;&gt; Really?\n\n13\n00:00:35.684 --> 00:00:36.716\n&gt;&gt; I'm not the hat guy.\n\n14\n00:00:36.716 --> 00:00:38.117\n&gt;&gt; I'm not a hat guy either,\n\n15\n00:00:38.117 --> 00:00:41.937\nI have a couple of hats because my wife\nis always, you need to wear a hat,\n\n16\n00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:44.157\nyou'll get burned.\n&gt;&gt; She must know my wife.\n\n17\n00:00:44.157 --> 00:00:45.509\n&gt;&gt; I'm very light\n\n18\n00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:46.809\nskinned.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n19\n00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:48.591\n&gt;&gt; Obviously a man from Nordic\n\n20\n00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:51.564\ndescent of some sort.\n&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, but\n\n21\n00:00:51.564 --> 00:00:56.845\nI don't feel that I look good with hat.\n&gt;&gt; I agree to agree on that for\n\n22\n00:00:56.845 --> 00:00:59.235\nmyself.\n&gt;&gt; Anyway, so we have no hats to hold on\n\n23\n00:00:59.235 --> 00:01:03.502\nto, however, we do have information we\ncan apart you, just equally important.\n\n24\n00:01:03.502 --> 00:01:07.933\nAnd you well, good client folk of the IT\nProTV audience, you have to find a way to\n\n25\n00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:12.186\nobtain that information, but you keep\nit under your hat or some other form.\n\n26\n00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:14.031\nWhatever it is,\nit will be important for you to know.\n\n27\n00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:16.124\nIt's gonna be on the short episode,\nactually,\n\n28\n00:01:16.124 --> 00:01:17.921\nprobably even shorter than the last one.\n\n29\n00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:21.636\nJoin me here Asset Security, actually,\na little bit longer than the last one, but\n\n30\n00:01:21.636 --> 00:01:24.985\nshorter than determining maintaining\ninformation and asset ownership,\n\n31\n00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:26.224\nwhich was a short episode.\n\n32\n00:01:26.224 --> 00:01:30.729\nEnsuring appropriate asset retention is\nthe category we're going to be taking on\n\n33\n00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:31.717\nand discussing.\n\n34\n00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:34.713\nYou have assets, we have spent a lot\nof time defining what they are already.\n\n35\n00:01:34.713 --> 00:01:36.337\nNo need to go back over that.\n\n36\n00:01:36.337 --> 00:01:40.245\nBut we do have to think about how long we\nare going to hold on to them for this.\n\n37\n00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:44.207\nIn other words, should not be simply a\nrandom, hey, we haven't done any cleaning\n\n38\n00:01:44.207 --> 00:01:47.616\nin a while, let's go see what's in\nthat box and just throw it all away.\n\n39\n00:01:47.616 --> 00:01:52.586\nBut rather, let's have policy that\ndefines how long information or\n\n40\n00:01:52.586 --> 00:01:56.795\nother assets should be kept for,\nunder what conditions.\n\n41\n00:01:56.795 --> 00:02:01.627\nAnd as a result, we will then, hopefully,\nalign with not only policy that dictates\n\n42\n00:02:01.627 --> 00:02:06.393\nretention, but that policy is often driven\nby regulatory or statutory concerns,\n\n43\n00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:10.363\nand alignment with those issues is\nreally what we're seeking here.\n\n44\n00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:15.410\nMost businesses do not go out of their way\nto retain assets, especially information,\n\n45\n00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.784\ndata, unless there's a statutory,\nregulatory reason why they should.\n\n46\n00:02:19.784 --> 00:02:24.344\nFor instance, in the United States\nbusiness records under federal law\n\n47\n00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:28.448\nbecause of tax requirements\nauditability around reporting for\n\n48\n00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:33.160\ntaxes and because of disclosure\nrequirements around publicly traded and\n\n49\n00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.520\nheld companies, things like that.\n\n50\n00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.272\nWe have to maintain and retain business\nrecords for seven years by federal law.\n\n51\n00:02:40.272 --> 00:02:44.450\nIn Germany, that's actually ten years for\nthe same reasons more or less, and so\n\n52\n00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.655\nit varies by country,\ncertainly will vary by circumstance.\n\n53\n00:02:47.655 --> 00:02:51.859\nSome industries, the bio\npharmaceutical Industry for instance,\n\n54\n00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:56.582\nmedical services in general things\nthat have retention periods associated\n\n55\n00:02:56.582 --> 00:03:00.582\nwith patient data that may vary\nbased on the kinda data there is.\n\n56\n00:03:00.582 --> 00:03:04.749\nWhen you carry out drug studies and\nmedicine studies around.\n\n57\n00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:09.041\nWatching new products, you do trials and\nthose record has to be maintained under\n\n58\n00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:11.515\na very strict conditions for\nperiods of time.\n\n59\n00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:15.067\nThere's all this different reasons\nwhy we have retention periods and\n\n60\n00:03:15.067 --> 00:03:17.547\nwe have to make sure we\nhave policy to drive that.\n\n61\n00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:19.480\nSo that's what we're gonna\nspeak about a little bit.\n\n62\n00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.592\nJust have a few things to say.\n\n63\n00:03:21.592 --> 00:03:25.433\nThings to consider, we have a little\nnumbered list of items here.\n\n64\n00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:28.029\nDon't have to know or\nworry about these things in order.\n\n65\n00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:32.664\nIt's not a process, it's not a life cycle,\nbut they are simply things that\n\n66\n00:03:32.664 --> 00:03:36.287\noverall all up would be critical for\nus CISSPs to consider,\n\n67\n00:03:36.287 --> 00:03:40.064\nto weigh, in regards to how we\napproach our asset retention.\n\n68\n00:03:40.064 --> 00:03:42.031\nWhere data to be retained is.\n\n69\n00:03:42.031 --> 00:03:43.751\nWhere does it reside, in other words?\n\n70\n00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:47.956\nIs it in cloud based environments,\nis it on prem, is it in physical,\n\n71\n00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:51.581\nis it in virtual systems,\nis it in more than one system, and\n\n72\n00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:56.164\nis it maintained in more than one\ngeography or location as a result of that?\n\n73\n00:03:56.164 --> 00:04:00.026\nAll of those things are very important\nbecause we may have different\n\n74\n00:04:00.026 --> 00:04:00.984\nrequirements.\n\n75\n00:04:00.984 --> 00:04:03.968\nDifferent policies, and\ndifferent standards, and\n\n76\n00:04:03.968 --> 00:04:07.492\nregulations that are applied\ndepending on where that data is.\n\n77\n00:04:07.492 --> 00:04:13.598\nIf data crosses a geographical boundary,\nand is stored in a different geography.\n\n78\n00:04:13.598 --> 00:04:17.139\nThen, the main data or\nthe primary copy of that data.\n\n79\n00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.373\nI'm thinking in a disaster\nrecovery backup scenario,\n\n80\n00:04:20.373 --> 00:04:22.584\nwhere we have data stored off-prem.\n\n81\n00:04:22.584 --> 00:04:26.776\nIf that data leaves the geographic\nboundaries of where we are and\n\n82\n00:04:26.776 --> 00:04:29.415\nis

due\ndiligence around our hosting agreements\n\n85\n00:04:37.454 --> 00:04:42.157\nwith our cloud provider and we don't build\nin a geo-preference clause that says,\n\n86\n00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:45.650\nour data must be maintained\nwithin the physical boundaries or\n\n87\n00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.487\ngeographies of certain areas.\n\n88\n00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:51.657\nIf our data's allowed to migrate\nwe call it, transborder data flow,\n\n89\n00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:55.899\nwhere data's allowed to migrate\nbeyond the borders of our geography,\n\n90\n00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:57.826\nour operational environment.\n\n91\n00:04:57.826 --> 00:05:00.968\nIt may be subject to indeed,\nwe can guarantee it will be subject\n\n92\n00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:04.370\nto different laws, different statues,\ndifferent regulations.\n\n93\n00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.667\nAnd that data may no longer\nbe protected the same way,\n\n94\n00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:11.771\nit may be subject to different\nretention requirements, longer or\n\n95\n00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:15.016\nless than the ones we have\nin place where we operate.\n\n96\n00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:18.565\nWe have to think about these things\nbecause all these things could impact us\n\n97\n00:05:18.565 --> 00:05:20.874\nnegatively if we're not planning for\nthem, and\n\n98\n00:05:20.874 --> 00:05:23.091\nall these things\nare the preview of the CISSP.\n\n99\n00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:26.603\nWe're gonna be asked if that\nguidance where supposed to be.\n\n100\n00:05:26.603 --> 00:05:31.463\nThat knowledge expert, that repository\nof knowledge that can intelligently to\n\n101\n00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:35.893\nthese issues, and guide the organization,\nwith regards to the approach\n\n102\n00:05:35.893 --> 00:05:40.477\nthat is best suited to address that What\nform or forms does the data exist in?\n\n103\n00:05:40.477 --> 00:05:45.920\nIs the data and the log data written down\non paper in files in filing cabinets?\n\n104\n00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.103\nIs it digital data in a variety\nof forms and formats?\n\n105\n00:05:50.103 --> 00:05:52.337\nAnd is that data encrypted?\n\n106\n00:05:52.337 --> 00:05:53.912\nIs it not encrypted?\n\n107\n00:05:53.912 --> 00:05:58.581\nA lot of my customers, especially in\nthe medical area in particular, and\n\n108\n00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:00.841\nthe biopharma area in particular,\n\n109\n00:06:00.841 --> 00:06:05.510\nhave really seen the C shift move away\nfrom the mind set around retention,\n\n110\n00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.516\nnot the data or retained data, what I mean\nis a way in which they deal with data.\n\n111\n00:06:10.516 --> 00:06:15.496\nRetention of data and be CDR activities,\nthis is contrary disaster recovery\n\n112\n00:06:15.496 --> 00:06:19.328\nactivities in the last several\nyears because of the rise and\n\n113\n00:06:19.328 --> 00:06:23.313\njust the tidal wave associated\nwith ransomware attacks in and\n\n114\n00:06:23.313 --> 00:06:26.939\nacross this industries,\nfinancial services as well.\n\n115\n00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:31.267\nOften the medical industry, in particular,\nis been hit really hard because there been\n\n116\n00:06:31.267 --> 00:06:35.246\na lot of ransomware attacks against\nhospitals, healthcare providers that have\n\n117\n00:06:35.246 --> 00:06:39.184\nmade the news in Europe and the United\nStates, etc., the last several years.\n\n118\n00:06:39.184 --> 00:06:43.577\nAnd many of my customers in these\nareas have done a complete 180 with\n\n119\n00:06:43.577 --> 00:06:48.500\nregards to how they view data retention\nand BCDR activities in the formating.\n\n120\n00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.982\nAnd they actually gone down to the point\nnow, we're going back to this point now,\n\n121\n00:06:53.982 --> 00:06:59.148\nwhere they are starting to keep analog\nrecords, actual handwritten records\n\n122\n00:06:59.148 --> 00:07:04.075\nin filing cabinets store in offside\nstore systems than can saveguard data\n\n123\n00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:07.405\nbecause ransomware cannot attack paper.\n&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]\n\n124\n00:07:07.405 --> 00:07:08.812\n&gt;&gt; If you think about this, right?\n\n125\n00:07:08.812 --> 00:07:12.423\nI mean years ago, you have\nwarehouses full of this stuff, and\n\n126\n00:07:12.423 --> 00:07:15.631\nwe had issues with humidity,\nwith fire, with water.\n\n127\n00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:20.495\nAnd we moved away from this, because it\nwas ridiculously expensive to warehouse\n\n128\n00:07:20.495 --> 00:07:23.943\npaper, and it was problematic for\njust a lot of reasons.\n\n129\n00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:27.392\nAs a result, when we got really into\nthis idea of digital data, OCR,\n\n130\n00:07:27.392 --> 00:07:29.422\nright optical character recognition.\n\n131\n00:07:29.422 --> 00:07:32.132\nThe ability to scan and\ncreate digital data, etc.\n\n132\n00:07:32.132 --> 00:07:34.687\nWe've really, almost without exception,\nmoved away from this.\n\n133\n00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:38.323\nI mean, think about the last time you\nsaw somebody actually do something on\n\n134\n00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:39.140\npaper, right?\n\n135\n00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.572\nAnd had to do that, yes, you get a receipt\nwhen you buy some nutrional meal.\n\n136\n00:07:41.572 --> 00:07:46.503\nYou may have to sign a receipt but\nthe reality is that transaction is\n\n137\n00:07:46.503 --> 00:07:50.919\ndone electronically because\nof PCI DSS implementations.\n\n138\n00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:53.821\nAnd although you may get a printed\nreceipts for your records, for\n\n139\n00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:57.009\nreturning something, you may sign\nthe receipt you gave to the vendor.\n\n140\n00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:58.561\nThat they put into their till,\n\n141\n00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:02.919\nreality is unless you challenge the credit\ncard statement and say, I'm not buying and\n\n142\n00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:05.798\npay for that or I don't wanna pay for\nthat, it's not me.\n\n143\n00:08:05.798 --> 00:08:07.406\nThat receipt is worthless to the vendor.\n\n144\n00:08:07.406 --> 00:08:08.395\nThey don't need it.\n\n145\n00:08:08.395 --> 00:08:11.416\nThey simply send through\nthe transaction electronically.\n\n146\n00:08:11.416 --> 00:08:14.891\nIt's processed electronically through\nthe credit card vendor gateway and\n\n147\n00:08:14.891 --> 00:08:16.361\nthey get paid electronically.\n\n148\n00:08:16.361 --> 00:08:18.248\nI mean, there's no paper involved.\n\n149\n00:08:18.248 --> 00:08:20.501\nThere's almost no paper involved\nin anything we do today.\n\n150\n00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:23.549\nWhen was the last time you\nwent to a doctor's office or\n\n151\n00:08:23.549 --> 00:08:26.273\nany kind of interaction and\nyou saw the doctor.\n\n152\n00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:29.612\nYeah, they do pull out a file probably,\nthey look at your information,\n\n153\n00:08:29.612 --> 00:08:30.761\nthey may make notes, and\n\n154\n00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:33.971\nthey may write you a prescription\non a piece of paper traditionally.\n\n155\n00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:37.122\nAlthough, more and more of that's\nelectronic today, but when the nurse or\n\n156\n00:08:37.122 --> 00:08:40.374\nthe health practitioner whatever comes\nin to do all the background work before\n\n157\n00:08:40.374 --> 00:08:41.273\nthe doctor shows up.\n\n158\n00:08:41.273 --> 00:08:45.354\nThat's almost all done on computer\ntoday with a patient management system.\n\n159\n00:08:45.354 --> 00:08:47.779\nAll of your travel records\nare electronic today,\n\n160\n00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:51.081\nyou certainly can get a printed\nboarding pass and things like that.\n\n161\n00:08:51.081 --> 00:08:54.352\nBut more and more people are doing\ndigital versions of this, so\n\n162\n00:08:54.352 --> 00:08:58.254\nwe really have seen a sea shift away\nfrom paper overall in many industries.\n\n163\n00:08:58.254 --> 00:09:02.724\nOver the last decade or two, and BCDR in\nthese kinds activities were no exception\n\n164\n00:09:02.724 --> 00:09:07.460\nbut because of concerns around security,\naround availability in particular we've\n\n165\n00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:12.128\nactually seen a movement away from digital\nback towards paper, in some respects and\n\n166\n00:09:12.128 --> 00:09:14.375\nit's interesting, as you said.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n167\n00:09:14.375 --> 00:09:15.985\n&gt;&gt; Just coming full circle, so kind of\n\n168\n00:09:15.985 --> 00:09:19.918\ninteresting, old things are new again, I'm\nbreaking out of my skinny ties and bolo.\n\n169\n00:09:19.918 --> 00:09:20.615\n&gt;&gt; That's right.\n\n170\n00:09:20.615 --> 00:09:22.562\n&gt;&gt; I'm gonna corner the market based on my\n\n171\n00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.947\n1980s wardrobe.\n&gt;&gt; Some shoulder pads.\n\n172\n00:09:24.947 --> 00:09:25.894\n&gt;&gt; I have jackets with shoulder pads,\n\n173\n00:09:25.894 --> 00:09:28.216\nI leave them in my closet.\n&gt;&gt; Really, that's awesome.\n\n174\n00:09:28.216 --> 00:09:30.225\n&gt;&gt; My kids are gonna be the most rockin\n\n175\n00:09:30.225 --> 00:09:31.895\ncool thing I've ever kids.\n\n176\n00:09:31.895 --> 00:09:34.410\nWhen they start hitting my closet for\nall that stuff.\n\n177\n00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.633\nYou remember Rodney's smoking jacket,\nthe T-Shirt?\n\n178\n00:09:36.633 --> 00:09:37.609\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n\n179\n00:09:37.609 --> 00:09:38.470\n&gt;&gt; I actually have a paisley\n\n180\n00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:39.898\nsmoking jacket.\n&gt;&gt; Do you really?\n\n181\n00:09:39.898 --> 00:09:41.183\n&gt;&gt; Well remember I was in\n\n182\n00:09:41.183 --> 00:09:42.148\n&gt;&gt; That's true you were in the I forget\n\n183\n00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:43.275\nabout that, that's true.\n&gt;&gt; I've got\n\n184\n00:09:43.275 --> 00:09:44.135\nall that stuff.\n\n185\n00:09:44.135 --> 00:09:45.120\n&gt;&gt; Yeah.\n&gt;&gt; Yes,\n\n186\n00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.921\nI do.\n&gt;&gt; You've got to rock that thing out, man.\n\n187\n00:09:45.921 --> 00:09:47.315\n&gt;&gt; It's like a blue and\n\n188\n00:09:47.315 --> 00:09:51.006\nsilver paisley smoking\njacket with the black lapel.\n\n189\n00:09:51.006 --> 00:09:52.456\nIt is pretty cool.\n&gt;&gt; I think we need to see Adam in\n\n190\n00:09:52.456 --> 00:09:56.320\nthe paisley smoking jacket.\n&gt;&gt; I also had a purple velvet purple\n\n191\n00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.687\nvelour suit.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Man.\n\n192\n00:09:59.687 --> 00:10:01.435\n&gt;&gt; I did, I did.\n\n193\n00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:06.274\nI could go dressed as a variety of people\nduring halloween for many many years.\n\n194\n00:10:06.274 --> 00:10:08.186\n&gt;&gt; Those are assets you need to retain.\n\n195\n00:10:08.186 --> 00:10:10.769\n[CROSSTALK]\n&gt;&gt; That one is gone.\n\n196\n00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:12.345\nThat one unfortunately\nis no longer around.\n\n197\n00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:14.001\nBut I do have a smoking drill.\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.\n\n198\n00:10:14.001 --> 00:10:15.449\nYou have to bring it in\nas you can it in seconds.\n\n199\n00:10:15.449 --> 00:10:16.241\nIt is pretty cool.\n\n200\n00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:18.538\nBack to the, you're looking at me now,\n\n201\n00:10:18.538 --> 00:10:21.114\nyou're like what the hell did he do,\nright?\n\n202\n00:10:21.114 --> 00:10:22.641\nWhat kind of person was he?\n\n203\n00:10:22.641 --> 00:10:24.697\nI could tell you stories, trust me.\n\n204\n00:10:24.697 --> 00:10:26.033\nThat's why there are no pictures\nfrom that time in my life.\n\n205\n00:10:26.033 --> 00:10:27.469\n&gt;&gt; What is Pablo Escobar like?\n\n206\n00:10:27.469 --> 00:10:31.007\n[LAUGH]\n&gt;&gt; Let's have a fire side shot.\n\n207\n00:10:31.007 --> 00:10:33.233\nAll right, so who has access to the data?\n\n208\n00:10:33.233 --> 00:10:36.618\nThis is the idea of\nunderstanding what actors\n\n209\n00:10:36.618 --> 00:10:41.349\nmay be involved in under which terms and\nunder what scenarios.\n\n210\n00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:44.499\nMaybe they'll be able to gain access and\nas a result, who do we have to watch,\n\n211\n00:10:44.499 --> 00:10:47.690\nand who do we have to audit, and\nwho do we have to pay attention to?\n\n212\n00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.248\nHow long does the data need to be retained\nunder current conditions of access?\n\n213\n00:10:51.248 --> 00:10:54.720\nThis the idea of assessing data\nretention on an ongoing basis.\n\n214\n00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.945\nJust assessing data classification\non an ongoing basis.\n\n215\n00:10:57.945 --> 00:11:01.519\nAgain, minimally annually, but\nperhaps more aggressive than that.\n\n216\n00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:06.013\nBecause as I said, data may move through\ndifferent stages of classification and\n\n217\n00:11:06.013 --> 00:11:07.871\ndifferent stages of retention.\n\n218\n00:11:07.871 --> 00:11:11.469\nYou may have to retain records for\nseven years, but you may\n\n219\n00:11:11.469 --> 00:11:16.260\nhave to retain them in a certain format,\nand add a certain level of security.\n\n220\n00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:21.409\nBut you may also be able to move them\ninto alternate off-sight storage systems,\n\n221\n00:11:21.409 --> 00:11:23.314\nany kind of records they are.\n\n222\n00:11:23.314 --> 00:11:27.236\nAnd there's expectations around\nrecoverability in case of an audit.\n\n223\n00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:31.259\nA lot of this may be industry specific,\nregulation specific.\n\n224\n00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:34.765\nHIPPA requirements around medical\nprivacy and records management.\n\n225\n00:11:34.765 --> 00:11:36.923\nThere's all these different\nthings to consider.\n\n226\n00:11:36.923 --> 00:11:38.691\nSo we have to think about that.\n\n227\n00:11:38.691 --> 00:11:41.946\nWhen will Data Access Speed Modifier\nterminated again,\n\n228\n00:11:41.946 --> 00:11:43.721\nreference point number four.\n\n229\n00:11:43.721 --> 00:11:47.387\nIf we move through different layers and\nlevels of retention, and\n\n230\n00:11:47.387 --> 00:11:52.335\nretention systems over the period, when do\nwe see the breakpoints from modification?\n\n231\n00:11:52.335 --> 00:11:55.824\nWhat is the clearly defined endpoint for\ntermination?\n\n232\n00:11:55.824 --> 00:11:59.929\nYou have to have a standing system,\nand policy, and process,\n\n233\n00:11:59.929 --> 00:12:02.872\na grouping in place to manage,\nfrom day one,\n\n234\n00:12:02.872 --> 00:12:07.456\nall the way through day whatever,\nat the end of the retention period.\n\n235\n00:12:07.456 --> 00:12:11.433\nYou then have to have a process\nthat immediately flips that asset,\n\n236\n00:12:11.433 --> 00:12:15.768\nwhatever it is data or physical,\nwhatever it may be over into a different\n\n237\n00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:19.407\ncategorization area which says,\nokay, no longer retain.\n\n238\n00:12:19.407 --> 00:12:24.138\nNow, we must dispose and\nas a result of semitization disposal,\n\n239\n00:12:24.138 --> 00:12:29.133\nall the activities we get in to\nultimately get rid of that asset, and\n\n240\n00:12:29.133 --> 00:12:33.529\nwhatever identified and\nproper forms we choose to follow.\n\n241\n00:12:33.529 --> 00:12:37.983\nBecause holding an asset\npast retention period brings\n\n242\n00:12:37.983 --> 00:12:42.725\nwith it its own set of risks\nthat increase exponentially,\n\n243\n00:12:42.725 --> 00:12:45.050\nbecause we probably.\n&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]\n\n244\n00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:47.502\n&gt;&gt; Are not assigning the proper level of\n\n245\n00:12:47.502 --> 00:12:50.832\ncontrols to that asset any\nlonger to keep it safe.\n\n246\n00:12:50.832 --> 00:12:55.760\nWe may risk exposing the asset in ways\nthat are not going to be advantageous to\n\n247\n00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:56.839\nus if we do that.\n\n248\n00:12:56.839 --> 00:12:59.430\nAnd there may be legal\nliability because now,\n\n249\n00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.618\nwe may open that asset up to discovery\nbeyond the retention period and there\n\n250\n00:13:03.618 --> 00:13:07.889\ncan be concerns about that if the company\nis sued or whatever the case may be.\n\n251\n00:13:07.889 --> 00:13:12.634\nSo we have to have very rigid standards\nin place that stipulate on day 100,\n\n252\n00:13:12.634 --> 00:13:17.525\nthat asset is immediately recategorized\nsplit, and has moved into some sort of\n\n253\n00:13:17.525 --> 00:13:22.059\nprocess flow that ultimately leads\nto its termination and destruction.\n\n254\n00:13:22.059 --> 00:13:25.772\nNot just decommission, but\nactual termination and destruction.\n\n255\n00:13:25.772 --> 00:13:29.471\nBecause if you keep it around longer,\nyou're essentially inviting liability.\n\n256\n00:13:29.471 --> 00:13:30.950\nWhy is data being retained?\n\n257\n00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.496\nThis is the master question\nwe really have to start with.\n\n258\n00:13:33.496 --> 00:13:35.910\nAnd from there move out\ninto all there others.\n\n259\n00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.579\nRemember, why equals root cause, right?\n\n260\n00:13:38.579 --> 00:13:40.690\nWe wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n261\n00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.024\nWhat is, what are the compelling root\ncause reasons we keeping data or\n\n262\n00:13:45.024 --> 00:13:47.381\nwhatever asset we are talking about.\n\n263\n00:13:47.381 --> 00:13:48.698\nWhy are we doing this?\n\n264\n00:13:48.698 --> 00:13:51.034\nIs it because of a regulation, a statute?\n\n265\n00:13:51.034 --> 00:13:53.671\nIs there a legal requirement?\n\n266\n00:13:53.671 --> 00:13:58.276\nAre we concerned that we may be asked\nto provide documentary detail about\n\n267\n00:13:58.276 --> 00:14:03.725\nan ongoing project, and that project's\ntimeline will drive the retention period.\n\n268\n00:14:03.725 --> 00:14:06.957\nWe may have a policy not driven\nby legal requirements but\n\n269\n00:14:06.957 --> 00:14:09.228\nsimply internally defined that says,\n\n270\n00:14:09.228 --> 00:14:14.202\nall business records will be maintained in\narchive for five years on a rolling basis.\n\n271\n00:14:14.202 --> 00:14:18.917\nWhatever it is, we have to answer\nthe question why we're retaining this\n\n272\n00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:23.249\nasset before we engage in all these\nother questions and answers and\n\n273\n00:14:23.249 --> 00:14:25.512\nthen set up an act appropriately.\n\n274\n00:14:25.512 --> 00:14:29.571\nCuz if we don't understand why,\nif we don't understand the root cause,\n\n275\n00:14:29.571 --> 00:14:33.238\nour answers too in our implementation\nof all these other systems to\n\n276\n00:14:33.238 --> 00:14:35.613\nsupport this will potentially be skewed.\n\n277\n00:14:35.613 --> 00:14:39.153\nWe may be operating with a different\nset of assumptions in other words,\n\n278\n00:14:39.153 --> 00:14:42.466\nthat may be misdirected, or\nmisrepresented or misinterpreted.\n\n279\n00:14:42.466 --> 00:14:45.644\nCuz we don't truly understand the root\ncause, is the reason why we're doing this.\n\n280\n00:14:45.644 --> 00:14:50.389\nWe may think we're doing it simply because\nsenior management said the policy is this,\n\n281\n00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:54.813\nbut if that policy is actually tied back\nto a law or regulatory compliance issue.\n\n282\n00:14:54.813 --> 00:14:56.789\nWe don't fully understand that.\n\n283\n00:14:56.789 --> 00:15:00.436\nAnd then, we don't take the policy\nin implementing correctly to align\n\n284\n00:15:00.436 --> 00:15:04.692\nwith the letter and the implementation\nrequirements of that standard, that law,\n\n285\n00:15:04.692 --> 00:15:06.364\nthat requirement, whatever.\n\n286\n00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:10.346\nWe actually run the risk of having\na liability that we could get dragged to\n\n287\n00:15:10.346 --> 00:15:12.514\nthe court over, could get fined over.\n\n288\n00:15:12.514 --> 00:15:15.124\nThere maybe jail time,\nthere could be all three.\n\n289\n00:15:15.124 --> 00:15:18.487\nThis could be very serious, right,\nif we're not paying attention.\n\n290\n00:15:18.487 --> 00:15:22.655\nSo we really have to understand the root\ncause, it's very critical to what we do.\n\n291\n00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:27.078\nAll right, so these are the reasons why\nin round conversation more broadly of how\n\n292\n00:15:27.078 --> 00:15:30.134\nwe as CISSPs have to really\nframe the conversation, and\n\n293\n00:15:30.134 --> 00:15:33.277\nthink about how we ensure\nappropriate asset retention.\n\n294\n00:15:33.277 --> 00:15:38.053\nThe easiest way to sum this up\nis we have to understand, right?\n\n295\n00:15:38.053 --> 00:15:42.944\nWe have to understand all the contributory\nfactors associated with asset retention,\n\n296\n00:15:42.944 --> 00:15:48.036\nespecially, if there are external factors,\ntypically legal factors, that are driving\n\n297\n00:15:48.036 --> 00:15:52.659\nretention in order to ensure we are acting\nin appropriate ways that will guarantee\n\n298\n00:15:52.659 --> 00:15:56.880\nthat we are retaining the asset,\nwhatever the asset is in alignment with,\n\n299\n00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:00.770\nin accordance with and support of\nwhatever those requirements are.\n\n300\n00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:02.292\n&gt;&gt; Adam, great stuff today,\n\n301\n00:16:02.292 --> 00:16:06.212\nwe appreciate your time and\neffort on this asset retention business.\n\n302\n00:16:06.212 --> 00:16:08.868\nObviously, it's not something you\ncan just at a whim think about.\n\n303\n00:16:08.868 --> 00:16:11.301\nYou must put some time and\neffort into these things.\n\n304\n00:16:11.301 --> 00:16:14.213\nAnd although,\nnot a lot of quote and quote,\n\n305\n00:16:14.213 --> 00:16:18.011\nmounds of information are very\nimportant information.\n\n306\n00:16:18.011 --> 00:16:22.839\nThese are very concentrated nuggets of\ngold of knowledge that you're gonna need\n\n307\n00:16:22.839 --> 00:16:23.837\nfor that CISSP.\n\n308\n00:16:23.837 --> 00:16:26.847\nSo we thank Adam for sharing with us,\nwe thank you for watching but\n\n309\n00:16:26.847 --> 00:16:29.003\nlooks like it is the time for\nus to call it a day.\n\n310\n00:16:29.003 --> 00:16:31.890\nSigning off for IT Pro TV,\nI've been your host Daniel Lowrie.\n\n311\n00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.076\n&gt;&gt; I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n312\n00:16:33.076 --> 00:16:33.986\n&gt;&gt; See you next time.\n\n313\n00:16:37.259 --> 00:16:43.212\n[MUSIC]\n\n314\n00:16:43.212 --> 00:16:46.314\nThank you for watching IT PRO.TV.\n\n",
