take a moment and introduce\nyou to a new certification that we're\n\n4\n00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,420\nbeginning to film today,\nit's the CISSP, and\n\n5\n00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,440\nI shouldn't call it a new certification\ncuz it's been around quite a while.\n\n6\n00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,960\nBut if you're not familiar with it,\nthe CISSP It's just the certified.\n\n7\n00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,540\nLet's see if I can get this right.\n\n8\n00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,840\nCertified Information Systems\nSecurity Professional.\n\n9\n00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,590\nI only had to look at my notes once.\n\n10\n00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,900\nAnd it is a very well known and\n\n11\n00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,585\nvery well respected certification\nin the IT Security Community.\n\n12\n00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:40,285\nIt is a high level certification.\n\n13\n00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:43,315\nIt's not like some introductory\ngetting started in security.\n\n14\n00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:46,285\nThis is for people who have been in\nthe field for quite some time and\n\n15\n00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:47,895\nhave a high level of experience.\n\n16\n00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:51,510\nAs a result we didn't wanna just\nshoot this with our normal staff.\n\n17\n00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,930\nWe decided to bring in resident expert\nAdam Gordon to assist us in covering.\n\n18\n00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,131\n>> Are you implying I'm not part of\nthe normal, I'm gonna put that in quotes,\n\n19\n00:00:59,131 --> 00:00:59,891\nin normal staff.\n\n20\n00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:02,973\n[CROSSTALK] I'm abnormal, or\nextra normal, I'm not sure which.\n\n21\n00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:04,467\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm willing to go out on a limb, and\n\n22\n00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:05,815\nsay you are anything but normal.\n\n23\n00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,110\n[LAUGH]\n>> And thank you sir,\n\n24\n00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,090\nI do appreciate that characterization.\n\n25\n00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,200\n>> We definitely appreciate\nyou coming out and helping us.\n\n26\n00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,790\n>> Absolutely.\n\n27\n00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,890\n>> And Adam, you know, why don't you\njust take a brief moment to just kind of\n\n28\n00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,070\ntell everybody a little bit about\nyourself and then introduce us to CISSP.\n\n29\n00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,000\n>> Sure, absolutely.\n\n30\n00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,190\nSo first of all good morning,\ngood day, good afternoon or\n\n31\n00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,740\ngood evening depending on where you are in\nthe world and when you may be seeing this.\n\n32\n00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,990\nBut For those of you that perhaps\nhave never been associated or\n\n33\n00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,990\nheard much about the CISSP as\na credential may not know peers or\n\n34\n00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,570\ncolleagues or\nco-workers that hold this certification.\n\n35\n00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,950\nIt's considered to be by anybody in\nthe information security field the gold\n\n36\n00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,890\nstandard for information security\nmanagement, and really the top in terms of\n\n37\n00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,840\nhow you look at the pinnacle, or the\npyramid of certification and knowledge.\n\n38\n00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,930\nReally sitting at the top, right up there\nwith the industry leading certifications,\n\n39\n00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,050\nto validate your skills\nboth as a practitioner,\n\n40\n00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,620\nbecause you have to have at least five\nyears of practical hands on proven and\n\n41\n00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,840\ndemonstrable experience in two or\nmore of the ten bodies of knowledge areas.\n\n42\n00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,800\nWhat we call the common bodies of\nknowledge, are the domains and\n\n43\n00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,700\nwe'll talk about those in a few minutes.\n\n44\n00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,870\nBut you have to have two of the five\nminimum, and represent knowledge.\n\n45\n00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,550\nIn two of those five areas, but\n\n46\n00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,580\nalso because it brings together\nall the different areas\n\n47\n00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,540\nthat a security professional,\nboth as a practitioner and a manager\n\n48\n00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,015\nwill actually have to have knowledge of in\norder to do their job day in and day out.\n\n49\n00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:35,775\nAt the strategic as well\nas at the tactical and\n\n50\n00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:38,265\nthe operational levels of an organization.\n\n51\n00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:42,955\nAnd so most people that hold CISSP as a\ncredential are gonna be holding it because\n\n52\n00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:46,835\nthey've advanced through the ranks, they\nhave been practitioners at some point and\n\n53\n00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:49,745\nat that point in their career\nwhere they made the transition and\n\n54\n00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:54,130\nbecame a little more senior started\nfocusing on managerial related duties\n\n55\n00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,220\nmade believe that understood that\nin order to validate those skills\n\n56\n00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,370\nthere are many certifications that\ncan help along the way to do that,\n\n57\n00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,070\nperhaps a PMP certification for instance\nas a Project Management Professional.\n\n58\n00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,020\nPerhaps something like ITIL, which is\na framework certification that builds\n\n59\n00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,200\nIT foundation knowledge\naround customer service.\n\n60\n00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,540\nBut at the end of the day, you still have\nto have the information security focus\n\n61\n00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,520\nreally in this kind of a role to be able\nto show the business, and create, and\n\n62\n00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,730\nthe mind of the business the value\nyou bring as a manager and\n\n63\n00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,280\na more senior thought leader.\n\n64\n00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,835\nAnd so what I do in my practice\noutside of doing IT and\n\n65\n00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:34,830\ndoing IT in the real world\noutside of a studio such as this.\n\n66\n00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,470\nWhere we spend time talking a lot about\nhow to do these things to help you\n\n67\n00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,610\nhave better understanding and also to help\neducate you about what the opportunities\n\n68\n00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,000\nare with certifications like this.\n\n69\n00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,880\nI spend time in my practice in\nthe real world as both an educator and\n\n70\n00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,730\na trainer that's how I make my living.\n\n71\n00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,010\nI have for probably close to\n30 years now as a teacher,\n\n72\n00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,830\nboth in academia as well as\nin the professional world.\n\n73\n00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,940\nAnd so at one point I was an academic,\ntrue and tried in the sense that I taught\n\n74\n00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,310\nat university, but these days, and for\nmany many years, close to probably 17 or\n\n75\n00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,830\n18 years now, I've been in the public\nsector teaching for universities and\n\n76\n00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,140\nteaching their people, but teaching also\nfor just about anybody you could think of.\n\n77\n00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,620\nAnd I teach for a wide array and\nwide variety of people all over the world.\n\n78\n00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,360\nI do so both in the public and\nprivate space.\n\n79\n00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,330\nAnd I'm a consultant.\n\n80\n00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,680\nI make my living at the end of\nthe day helping people understand how\n\n81\n00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,820\nto do the things that we're going to spend\nthe rest of our show today and throughout\n\n82\n00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,320\nall the episodes associated with this\nparticular topic talking to about.\n\n83\n00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,920\nAnd so I write on these topics,\nI blog on these topics,\n\n84\n00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,300\nI write books on these topics, I speak\non these topics around the world, and\n\n85\n00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,220\nI spend a lot of time with customers\nhelping them to understand\n\n86\n00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,490\ntheir technologies,\nwhether it's in the Microsoft space,\n\n87\n00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,480\nwhether it's in the VMware space, Cisco\nCitrix, policy, procedure, you name it.\n\n88\n00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,830\nI spend time working\nin all of those areas.\n\n89\n00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,280\nAnd so we probably would wanna talk for\na few minutes and may wanna put up on\n\n90\n00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,420\nthe screen what some of those areas are,\nthe ten bodies of knowledge.\n\n91\n00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,840\nAnd maybe just quickly\nif we could briefly,\n\n92\n00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,760\nI'll walk through them for everybody.\n\n93\n00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,420\nWe wanna introduce them to you, make sure\nthat you're comfortable with them, and\n\n94\n00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,670\nthen as well, maybe just narrate\nthrough quickly at a high level.\n\n95\n00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,700\nWhat you'll expect as you watch some\nof these episodes going forward,\n\n96\n00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,430\nand hopefully you'll have the opportunity\nto watch all of them over time and\n\n97\n00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,270\ngo through this entire area with us,\nbut the CISSP CBK as you can\n\n98\n00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,940\nsee has ten domains, access control\nis listed as the first one here.\n\n99\n00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,130\nIn no particular order the sense of\nimportance, urgency, focus or priority.\n\n100\n00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,720\nThey're all equally important.\n\n101\n00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,150\nWe're just listing them out based on\nthe brochure that [INAUDIBLE] has been\n\n102\n00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,820\nmarketed around distributing, and\n\n103\n00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,260\ndiscussing the information\nabout this certification.\n\n104\n00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,180\nSo access control, you'll see here,\nare we going to zoom in, or we going to.\n\n105\n00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:54,547\nI think we're okay like that if you\nwant but, [CROSSTALK] okay, maybe not.\n\n106\n00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:56,010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n107\n00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,640\nthis is live TV by the way, boys and\ngirls, in case you didn't realize that.\n\n108\n00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,310\nSo we could see Access Control.\n\n109\n00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,530\nWe're talking about basically\nthis idea of all the things,\n\n110\n00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,660\nas that says there on the screen.\n\n111\n00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,560\nA collection of mechanisms.\n\n112\n00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,880\nWorking together to focus us on and\nfocus us in\n\n113\n00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,670\non the idea of if we could just kind of do\none of these and spin around in real time.\n\n114\n00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,780\n>> My assumption that it would zoom in and\nzoom out and instead it flips upside down.\n\n115\n00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,810\n>> It rotated in and out.\n\n116\n00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,480\nAll right.\nSo.\n\n117\n00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,450\n>> Keeping people on their toes.\n\n118\n00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,530\n>> It is.\nAnd it's all good.\n\n119\n00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,820\nSo access control.\n\n120\n00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,660\nThis idea of all the things that\nare working together to create a secure\n\n121\n00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,450\nenvironment, help us protect the assets\nthat are part of the information security\n\n122\n00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,100\npractice, in the business.\n\n123\n00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,350\nYou'll see some of the bullet points.\n\n124\n00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,990\nThere are things that are very high level,\nwe focus on in that domain.\n\n125\n00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,320\nThe concepts, methodologies,\ntechniques of access control,\n\n126\n00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,220\nwe introduce the concepts these concepts\nof confidentiality, integrity, and\n\n127\n00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,220\navailability as the cornerstones the\ntouchstones of the information security.\n\n128\n00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,090\nWe talk about of them in everyone\nof the domains at some level.\n\n129\n00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,650\nAll of them will be present in\nsome form in almost every domain.\n\n130\n00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,010\nWe don't talk about availability,\nfor instance,\n\n131\n00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,030\nin the cryptography domain really,\nwe focus on confidentiality and integrity,\n\n132\n00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,210\none of the only areas where we\ndon't see all three represented.\n\n133\n00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,120\nAnd so as we look at this overall list\nof ten areas we're gonna spend time on,\n\n134\n00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,560\nwant you to be thinking, and\nwe will obviously define for you later on.\n\n135\n00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,700\nWhat confidentiality, and\n\n136\n00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,180\nintegrity, and availability really mean\nin relation to each of these areas.\n\n137\n00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,120\nBut be thinking about these high level\ntopics in relation to those ideas.\n\n138\n00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,080\nAnd so conceptual ideas,\ntechniques, attacks, effectiveness.\n\n139\n00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,370\nHow do we set up, maintain,\n\n140\n00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,280\nmonitor, administer day to day\naccess control mechanisms?\n\n141\n00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,920\nWell we move to telecommunications and\n\n142\n00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,220\nnetwork security we're focusing on\na traditional networking architecture.\n\n143\n00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,790\nSo how do we build a network\nfrom the ground up?\n\n144\n00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,920\nWhat are the designs?\n\n145\n00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,380\nWhat are the logical, physical,\n\n146\n00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,260\nand technical elements we\nbring into the design?\n\n147\n00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,769\nHow do we work through a model such as\nthe OSI model or the Four-layer DoD,\n\n148\n00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:54,803\nTCP/IP model.\n\n149\n00:07:54,803 --> 00:07:59,946\nIn order to better understand\narchitecture, what are the role\n\n150\n00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:06,262\nof protocols, ports, technologies,\nand solutions such as DMZs, right?\n\n151\n00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:08,842\nFirewalls, things of this\nnature will be discussed.\n\n152\n00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:13,220\nAnd we will obviously broadly stretch\nthat out across the entire architecture.\n\n153\n00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,470\nBoth from the local area as well as in\nthe wide area into our perspective.\n\n154\n00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,330\nSo literally from the LAN to the WAN and\nback again.\n\n155\n00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,190\nInformation security governance and\nrisk management focuses on\n\n156\n00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,680\nmore of the policy areas associated\nwith information security management.\n\n157\n00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,000\nWe're really looking there at\nsecurity governance and policy and\n\n158\n00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,779\nthe guides that it provides to us in\nterms of the ways in which we're able to\n\n159\n00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,812\nwork through the thought process of\nbecoming a focal point for information.\n\n160\n00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:45,205\nAnd really this idea of awareness\nwithin the business and\n\n161\n00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:49,190\namong the user communities that\nare making up the community.\n\n162\n00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,107\nOr the information security management\nfocus, the community of interest that\n\n163\n00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:55,509\nthe business or\nyour practice may be focused on.\n\n164\n00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:00,152\nSo classification and ownership of data,\nthe ideas of risk management, business\n\n165\n00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:04,395\nimpact analysis and how we see the two\nworking together to help us to create,\n\n166\n00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:08,441\nnot only awareness, but guidance\naround that awareness from a policy,\n\n167\n00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:11,535\nfrom a standards, and\nfrom a guideline perspective.\n\n168\n00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:15,030\nAnd we will talk about those things and\nhow they all come together.\n\n169\n00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:19,154\nSoftware development security, we refer\nto the idea of a software development or\n\n170\n00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:21,150\na system development life cycle.\n\n171\n00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,160\nYou can see SDLC is listed there\nas one of the sub bullet points.\n\n172\n00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,916\nAll the control elements included\nwithin the software and/or system life\n\n173\n00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:33,853\ncycle to build a holistic secure solution,\nstart to finish.\n\n174\n00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:37,894\nFrom the idea of really thinking\nthrough it from the inception phase.\n\n175\n00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:41,711\nThinking through the strategies\nassociated with aligning value and\n\n176\n00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:46,052\nbusiness requirements all the way through\nto the proof of concept, the actual\n\n177\n00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:50,280\ntactical steps involved with defining and\nthen building an architecture.\n\n178\n00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,790\nAnd then actually managing and\nmanipulating that system,\n\n179\n00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,279\nmonitoring it in real time through its\nend of life cycle as we cycle it down and\n\n180\n00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,240\nreplace it in whatever that\nform may be over time.\n\n181\n00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,890\nAnd so that entire system life cycle\nis what we will speak about here.\n\n182\n00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,510\nVery interesting topic, one of the topics\nwhere a lot of the practitioners that\n\n183\n00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,870\ncome in looking to certify as CISSPs may\nor may not have a lot of background.\n\n184\n00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,310\nThis is one of those areas that you either\ndo this and you really do it for a living,\n\n185\n00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,310\nunderstand it.\n\n186\n00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,608\nTypical roles that we would\nsee as job holders here.\n\n187\n00:10:21,608 --> 00:10:24,920\nMaybe business analysts,\nmaybe project managers,\n\n188\n00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,490\na PMO type of people that focus on change,\nfocus on portfolio management.\n\n189\n00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:35,330\nCertainly business analysts that will do\nusage acceptance testing, UAT, that would\n\n190\n00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,570\nbe focused on universal languages such as\nUML for modeling business case scenarios.\n\n191\n00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,720\nThese are people that tend to focus in and\n\n192\n00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,730\nreally have an understanding\nof these areas.\n\n193\n00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,821\nIf you have a background with\nagile scrum or waterfall,\n\n194\n00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:51,048\nas methodological solutions\naround cycle development,\n\n195\n00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:54,870\nyou probably have a specialty area,\nand a knowledge area here.\n\n196\n00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,160\nBut if you're not in that space,\n\n197\n00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,920\nthis is one of those areas where we\nspend time helping you to understand it.\n\n198\n00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,080\nYou get familiar with it enough certainly\nto understand the material to ultimately\n\n199\n00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,700\nget ready to and indeed hopefully pass\nthe CISSP exam when you're ready.\n\n200\n00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,010\nBut you may not spend a lot of\ntime doing this kind of work\n\n201\n00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,820\nin your day to day practice and\nthat's okay.\n\n202\n00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,620\nYou don't have to be\nan expert in all these areas.\n\n203\n00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,760\nYou don't even have to\nlike all these areas.\n\n204\n00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,360\nAlthough we would want to encourage\nyou to certainly be aware of them.\n\n205\n00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,210\nAnd be focused on them in the relation to\nthe value they may add to the business,\n\n206\n00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,840\nand the issues associated with things\nlike threat and vulnerability and\n\n207\n00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,730\nrisk that all of them\nbring in to our practice.\n\n208\n00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,380\nBut you don't have to do SDLC\nin order to understand it.\n\n209\n00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,380\nAnd so be aware of the fact that there\nwill be some things you like on the menu,\n\n210\n00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,630\njust like anything else,\nsome things you may not be as happy with.\n\n211\n00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,560\nSome things you put off to the side and\ngo, there's absolutely no way.\n\n212\n00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,245\nBut at the end of the day,\nyou have to have some level of comfort and\n\n213\n00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:52,672\nknowledge in all ten of these areas to\nbe successful at passing the CISSP exam.\n\n214\n00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:56,220\nThen after that you go back to the real\nworld in terms of your practice.\n\n215\n00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,970\nYour focus on your day to\nday activities in your jobs.\n\n216\n00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,800\nAnd you will then further specialize and\n\n217\n00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,490\nfurther broaden your\nknowledge in key areas.\n\n218\n00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,210\nAnd others may, as a result,\nnot be as much of a focus for you.\n\n219\n00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:12,110\nCryptography, the idea of applying the\nprinciples, as it says, their means and\n\n220\n00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,690\nmethods of disguising information to\nensure not just authenticity, but\n\n221\n00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,425\nintegrity, and ultimately confidentiality.\n\n222\n00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:21,975\nAnd so\nwe wanna really focus on keeping data\n\n223\n00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:25,455\naway from people that don't need to see\nit, don't have the right to see it here.\n\n224\n00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:29,665\nBut ensuring proof of origin,\nensuring integrity in our data,\n\n225\n00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:33,265\nnon repudiation in our data streams,\nwhich is proof of origin.\n\n226\n00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:37,965\nAnd so things such as digital signatures,\nthings such as hashing, PKI,\n\n227\n00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,285\npublic key infrastructure,\nall of that is discussed here.\n\n228\n00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:42,955\nAnd we will spend time going through and\n\n229\n00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:47,170\nhelping you to better understand the way\nin which this kind of a solution\n\n230\n00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,730\ncan be built into the architecture\nof your systems from the ground up.\n\n231\n00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,820\nWe take a look at security\narchitecture and design.\n\n232\n00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,090\nThe principle structures and\nstrategies that help us monitor and\n\n233\n00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,020\nsecure not only operating\nsystems as it says there, but\n\n234\n00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,790\nall of the building blocks and\ncomponents of our network.\n\n235\n00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,570\nSo the equipment, the software,\nthe logical, physical, and\n\n236\n00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,220\ntechnical controls that\nare brought to bear there.\n\n237\n00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,880\nSo things such as virtualization.\n\n238\n00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,325\nThings such as cloud computing,\nbig topic today, often misunderstood,\n\n239\n00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:20,900\nmisrepresented, and not always very\neasily identified and defined.\n\n240\n00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,030\nGood marketing concept.\n\n241\n00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,910\nVery unsure of what that may\nmean in our world sometimes.\n\n242\n00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,300\nBut what are security models?\n\n243\n00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,080\nRight?\nWhat are vulnerabilities and threats?\n\n244\n00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,220\nWhat are countermeasures\nwe can bring to bear?\n\n245\n00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,660\nAnd how do we build security\nin from every level and\n\n246\n00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,550\nevery angle of our design\nfrom the ground up?\n\n247\n00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,130\nOperational security.\n\n248\n00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,620\nThis is where we tend to see a lot of\npeople having background in one of\n\n249\n00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,366\nthese areas.\n\n250\n00:13:42,366 --> 00:13:46,265\nSuch as operational security,\nwhere we see that most people have some\n\n251\n00:13:46,265 --> 00:13:49,982\nsort of exposure to physical security,\nanother area down below.\n\n252\n00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:53,794\nAnd we kind of blend these two together,\nwhere we talk about how we do resource\n\n253\n00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:57,903\nprotection, incident response, and then\nwhat are the things that are associated\n\n254\n00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:02,264\nwith that from a prevention and a tracking\nand vulnerability management perspective.\n\n255\n00:14:02,264 --> 00:14:04,958\nAnd so that's what we see\nin operational security.\n\n256\n00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,310\nBCP, business continuity planning,\nDRP, disaster recovery planning,\n\n257\n00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,340\nanother area that is usually a specialty\nof certain people in a business.\n\n258\n00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,810\nThis is the area where we talk about\n\n259\n00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,540\nhow do we deal with\nthe possibility of an impact?\n\n260\n00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,300\nAnd then if we do have this threat,\nthis vulnerability,\n\n261\n00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,370\nthis risk become realized,\nwhat do we do to get back to normal?\n\n262\n00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,430\nAnd so, we look at the what if,\n\n263\n00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,940\nand then we talk about what will we\ndo now, in order to return to normal.\n\n264\n00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,297\nAnd so, we'll talk about\nthe differences in these approaches,\n\n265\n00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:40,204\nthe modeling that takes place,\nthe business impact analysis, and the risk\n\n266\n00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:44,499\nmanagement that has to take place, as well\nas the awareness that has to take place.\n\n267\n00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:49,399\nNot just on the part of the practitioner,\nbut on the part of every person that plays\n\n268\n00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,782\nsome role in the business in terms\nof what their role is in this plan.\n\n269\n00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:58,820\nAnd when we talk about BCP,\nwe talk about DRP, we talk about this idea\n\n270\n00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,520\nthat it comes down to being aware of\nwhat should happen at critical moments\n\n271\n00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,730\nto make sure that bad things are not\nhappening because we're not aware of them.\n\n272\n00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,070\nAnd so we'll talk more about this and\nhow this works.\n\n273\n00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,030\nPretty fun discussion,\n\n274\n00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,800\nactually a lot of really interesting\nstuff that goes on there.\n\n275\n00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,860\nLegal, regulatory, investigative,\nand compliance concerns and areas.\n\n276\n00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,230\nWhat are legal issues?\n\n277\n00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,870\nWhat are the processes from\na forensics standpoint, for instance,\n\n278\n00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,450\nthat we go through to manage through\nperhaps the investigation of an incident,\n\n279\n00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,110\nor an event or a crime?\n\n280\n00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,250\nHow do we measure what is\ngoing on through logging and\n\n281\n00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,740\nhow do we measure things\nthrough evidence gathering?\n\n282\n00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,190\nSo, chain of custody of evidence,\nsteps involved with that.\n\n283\n00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,150\nWill be very interesting and, obviously,\na part of our conversation there.\n\n284\n00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,835\nThis is the area where most people\nlook at what we do as CISSP's and\n\n285\n00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:48,783\nthink, well I see that on\nreality TV all the time, or\n\n286\n00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:52,335\nI see that on TV shows cuz that's\nthat whole CSI thing, right?\n\n287\n00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:56,946\nThat's where you guys walk around\nwith all the cool technology and\n\n288\n00:15:56,946 --> 00:16:00,087\nmaybe carry guns and\nget to ride in cool cars.\n\n289\n00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:03,912\nQuite the opposite actually as you will\nhear me go on about when we get into\n\n290\n00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,054\nthese discussions.\n\n291\n00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:08,508\nIt is very fascinating work,\nit's work I love to do.\n\n292\n00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:12,699\nIt's work that anybody that has a passion\nfor that area of our field will tell you\n\n293\n00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:16,100\ncan be incredibly fascinating,\nincredibly rewarding.\n\n294\n00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,710\nBut it is very detail oriented,\nit is very precise, it is very focused and\n\n295\n00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,860\nunfortunately to burst your bubble,\nit can be a little bit\n\n296\n00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,690\ntedious in the sense that it's not quite\nas exciting as you may think it is.\n\n297\n00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,048\nYou sit in a cube of some sort, in a room,\nwherever that may be, working on this\n\n298\n00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:36,498\ninformation more so, than typically doing\nit in the field the way you see on TV.\n\n299\n00:16:36,498 --> 00:16:40,805\nAnd we don't tend to have the million\ndollar AV suite associated with our\n\n300\n00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:41,960\nworkspaces.\n\n301\n00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,940\nSo we don't get to perhaps play with some\nof those toys that you may see on TV, but\n\n302\n00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,870\nwe do a lot of really interesting\nthings in this kind of an error.\n\n303\n00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,791\nSo we'll talk about what does go on and\nwhat those particular items may be?\n\n304\n00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,565\nAnd then finally, physical security.\n\n305\n00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:59,240\nPhysical/Environmental Security,\nas you can see down there.\n\n306\n00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,190\nThis is where we talk about things\nlike where do we build the building,\n\n307\n00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,010\nthat will house the dad and\nhow should it be designed?\n\n308\n00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,010\nWhat kind of systems does it need?\n\n309\n00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,419\nFrom external gateways such fences,\nand guard posts, and\n\n310\n00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:16,988\na closed circuit TV and dogs and lighting,\nto what do we need on the inside?\n\n311\n00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:20,510\nSo this is where we talk about\nthings like, do we have man traps?\n\n312\n00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,160\nAnd if we have a man trap, do we then also\nhave monitoring on either side of it?\n\n313\n00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,750\nEither manually driven, somebody who's\nliterally watching you, make you sign at\n\n314\n00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,900\na desk as a guard or as an Automator where\nwe have some sort of scanning system.\n\n315\n00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,820\nSo a biometric concern there,\nand things like that.\n\n316\n00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,620\nSo this is where we get into these kinds\nof discussions, this is where we talk\n\n317\n00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,750\nabout how to build and\nhow to designed these secure environments?\n\n318\n00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,908\nSo this overall, take together is\nthe ten bodies of knowledge or\n\n319\n00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:50,072\nthe ten domain areas,\nthat make up the focal point of the CISSP.\n\n320\n00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:53,440\nSo want to encourage you to be thinking\nabout, what it takes to become a CISSP.\n\n321\n00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,530\nYou're gonna need to become at some level,\nas we've said, conversant with and\n\n322\n00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,130\ncomfortable with this material.\n\n323\n00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,140\nWe're gonna spend a lot of time, both\nmyself and my co-host as we work through\n\n324\n00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,260\nthese episodes and these areas with you,\nhelping you to better understand them.\n\n325\n00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,710\nBut we're also gonna make sure,\nhopefully, that you have some questions.\n\n326\n00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,910\nAnd along the way you ask us those, and\nI know Don is always very good about\n\n327\n00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,310\nsetting us up to deal with people\nthat may be in the chat room, and\n\n328\n00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,110\nmay have questions that\nthey wanna proffer to us.\n\n329\n00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,900\nWhat I think will be valuable for you, and\nwhat I think will be very interesting for\n\n330\n00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,320\nyou to do as you go through this material,\nas we help work through it with you,\n\n331\n00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,070\nis to make sure that you figure\nout how to personalize this?\n\n332\n00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,070\nSo what I mean is, bring it down to\nyour level in your world and help you to\n\n333\n00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,870\nunderstand, what something like a security\npolicy means, because it's what you do.\n\n334\n00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,070\nAnd your example of whatever\na security policy is in your world,\n\n335\n00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,810\nwill help you to better\nunderstand this material.\n\n336\n00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,580\nSo look for\nthose places to engage, look for\n\n337\n00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,190\nthose places to make it personal, look for\nthe kind of things that will help you to\n\n338\n00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:54,660\nbetter understand what challenges you\nmay face as you prepare for this exam.\n\n339\n00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,380\nAsk those questions, but\nalso seek out that knowledge.\n\n340\n00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,460\nPay attention to the things we offer,\nopportunities and tips for\n\n341\n00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,740\nyou to follow up.\n\n342\n00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,310\nAnd most importantly, as we work through\nthis material, think about as I said,\n\n343\n00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,080\nhow you prepare to study for\nthis kind of an exam?\n\n344\n00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,560\nWe'll talk more about that or\nthe methodology is at some point.\n\n345\n00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,870\nBut at a high level, 250 questions,\nmultiple choice exam.\n\n346\n00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,290\nYou'll back in the old day,\nback in the old school days,\n\n347\n00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,110\nthis was a paper based exam.\n\n348\n00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,880\nYou sat for six hours in a room.\n\n349\n00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,340\nYou did a Scantron bubble sheet where\nyou had to bubble in your answers,\n\n350\n00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,580\nmuch like we would have done on any of\nthe standardized tests you may have taken,\n\n351\n00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,960\nif you took testing at some point\nin your early academic career.\n\n352\n00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,000\nNow, it is computer based, so it is\na little bit of a different experience.\n\n353\n00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,600\nStill six hours in length however,\nstill 250 questions,\n\n354\n00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,320\nstill one of the longest\nprofessional exams in our industry.\n\n355\n00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,100\nStill often thought of by anybody who's\ngone through it, as being both one of\n\n356\n00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,750\nthe most difficult but\nalso something that they didn't expect.\n\n357\n00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,420\nWhen you often hear from people about what\nthey did in the exam, and how they kinda\n\n358\n00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,170\nwent through what they think, that's how\nyou know I spent all this time studying.\n\n359\n00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,875\nIt was as tough as I thought it would be,\nbut it was fair.\n\n360\n00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,865\nBut it was also not what I expected.\n\n361\n00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:07,515\nAnd it was a little bit different, didn't\nreally see some of those questions coming,\n\n362\n00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:08,967\nthey were out of left field maybe.\n\n363\n00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:12,650\nOr I thought it was going to be like this,\nand I really saw it this way.\n\n364\n00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,780\nSo it's all multiple choice driven.\n\n365\n00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,240\nWhat that means is at the end of the day,\n\n366\n00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,320\nyou have a series of\nquestions you must answer.\n\n367\n00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,980\nSome of them will be scenario based, so\nthere are scenario based exam solutions\n\n368\n00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,000\nthese days that were not in older\nversions of the exam, but there are now.\n\n369\n00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,480\nMeeting a series of questions built\naround a topographical map of knowledge,\n\n370\n00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,540\ntypically a couple of paragraphs that\nexplain a story or some sort of set of\n\n371\n00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,360\nevents to you which are then asked to\nanswer a series of questions about.\n\n372\n00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,550\nBut at the end of the day,\nthis is what an exam means.\n\n373\n00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,290\nIt means sitting in a room, and\nbringing that knowledge to the fore, and\n\n374\n00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,210\napplying it appropriately within the\nscenario that you're given on the screen.\n\n375\n00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,520\nIt does also mean for\nyou, to be very careful,\n\n376\n00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,630\nbringing in that external knowledge\nthat we all know we all have, and\n\n377\n00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,780\nwe all master in our normal\nprofessional practices, and\n\n378\n00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,050\nmaking it filter through that appropriate\nlens of, is this exam appropriate?\n\n379\n00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,170\nIs this real world appropriate?\n\n380\n00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,970\nYou in other words will know a lot of\nthings from the real world that may or\n\n381\n00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,330\nnot be focused on in the exam.\n\n382\n00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,300\nAnd what you often hear from people that\nare challenged by an exam like this,\n\n383\n00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,360\nis that they really did a poor\njob of time management.\n\n384\n00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,585\nThey did a poor job of knowledge\nmanagement, and as a result of one or\n\n385\n00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:22,505\nboth of those areas not lining up,\n\n386\n00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:25,805\nthey unfortunately get invited\nback to do it again a second time.\n\n387\n00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:28,485\nAnd we don't want that to be\nthe case with any of you.\n\n388\n00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:31,035\nAnd so make sure you're thinking\nabout how to be successful,\n\n389\n00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:33,580\nalong with how you're gonna\nmaster this material?\n\n390\n00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,910\n>> Now, one thing I want to make\nsure we touch on before we wrap up,\n\n391\n00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,750\nis that the CISSP certification is not for\neveryone.\n\n392\n00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,730\nAnd I kind of alluded to this,\nearlier in the segment,\n\n393\n00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,220\nwhere I said, if you're just getting\nstarted, if you're interested in\n\n394\n00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,820\npursuing a career in IT security,\nthe CISSP is not a starting point.\n\n395\n00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,570\nCISSP is a finish point.\n\n396\n00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,000\nSo if you're just getting started,\n\n397\n00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,380\nyou might want to look at some of\nthe other certifications that we have,\n\n398\n00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:03,560\nlike the CompTIA Security+ or ISC Squared,\nthe SSCP, that's a great starting point.\n\n399\n00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,980\nSSCP is really designed for someone\nwith a year of experience, but someone\n\n400\n00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,742\ngoing into the CISSP is expected to\nhave a far greater amount of experience.\n\n401\n00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:16,140\nAnd so I just got up here on the screen\nsome of the different types of\n\n402\n00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,620\npeople that might seek this.\n\n403\n00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,280\nBut if you look down the list, you'll\nsee that word manager a couple times.\n\n404\n00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,310\nThese are people who are working full time\nin IT security that are moving up to that\n\n405\n00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,460\nhigher level in their career,\nthat's really what the CISSP is all about.\n\n406\n00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,573\n>> [COUGH] It is, and beyond the CISSP\nyou made reference in the fact that it's\n\n407\n00:22:34,573 --> 00:22:36,610\nnot a starting point or\nrather and end point.\n\n408\n00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,390\nAnd what I think is also important is,\n[COUGH]\n\n409\n00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,960\nif you could scroll down just a little\nbit on that page while we're talking.\n\n410\n00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,980\nBelow this area, advance beyond the CISSP,\nif you could bring that up for\n\n411\n00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,500\njust a minute.\n\n412\n00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,770\nSo the other thing that's\ninteresting about ISC squared and\n\n413\n00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,230\nabout this certification, is that CISSP in\nit of itself is a tremendous achievemen.\n\n414\n00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,600\nThe gold standard, the pinnacle of\ninformation security management.\n\n415\n00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,420\nThere are over 100,000 CISSPs certified\nin the world today, and it is by and\n\n416\n00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,040\nfar and away the single most important\ncertification we have in our industry\n\n417\n00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,650\nin this particular regard.\n\n418\n00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,963\nBut having said that, there are areas\nyou go out beyond the CISSP.\n\n419\n00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:16,045\nAnd these are what are called\nthe concentration areas and so\n\n420\n00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:19,570\nyou can see ISSAP,\nwhich is the architecture professional.\n\n421\n00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,420\nThe EP, the Engineering Professional,\nthe MP the Management or\n\n422\n00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,930\nManagerial Professional.\n\n423\n00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:28,540\nYou must first hold the CISSP in order\nto then go on and attain one of these.\n\n424\n00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,050\nWhat we want you to do is really have a\nfull sense of what a career in information\n\n425\n00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,070\nsecurity management and\n\n426\n00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,310\ninformation security as\na practitioner may mean for you?\n\n427\n00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,460\nAnd becoming a CISSP is not an end point\n\n428\n00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,780\nin that professional development arch for\nyou.\n\n429\n00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,690\nBut rather is a very,\nvery important plateau that you reach, and\n\n430\n00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,320\ncelebrate success around.\n\n431\n00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,450\nAnd build the foundation of\nadditional successes from.\n\n432\n00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,016\nBut there are other places to go,\nand other things to do.\n\n433\n00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,677\nAnd so while this is a very,\nvery important milestone in your career,\n\n434\n00:23:57,677 --> 00:24:01,588\nshould you choose to pursue it and\nultimately be successful at it- You will\n\n435\n00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:06,000\nhave other opportunities to pursue\nadditional certification out beyond this.\n\n436\n00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,690\nWe're not really gonna get into what\nthese credentials mean today, nor\n\n437\n00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,830\nare we gonna really touch on them\nanywhere in this set of discussions.\n\n438\n00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,550\nBut at least an awareness of the fact\nthat there are other opportunities inside\n\n439\n00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,850\nof your professional development arc,\n\n440\n00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,670\nyou do need to bring CPEs to\nthe table in order to stay certified.\n\n441\n00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:27,640\nAnd the idea here is that as a CISSP,\nor even as an SSCP as Don mentioned,\n\n442\n00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,630\nas a starting point, you have to bring a\ncertain amount of professional development\n\n443\n00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,770\nto your career arc as you go through and\nstay a certified professional.\n\n444\n00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,680\nWhen you certify as a CISSP, you have\na three year lifecycle on your credential.\n\n445\n00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,310\nAnd what that means is ultimately,\nthat every three years you will be\n\n446\n00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,960\nasked to validate that you have achieved\na certain amount of additional knowledge\n\n447\n00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,270\nthrough continuing education\nin your career field.\n\n448\n00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,130\nAnd as a result of that, you will then,\n\n449\n00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,750\nI think it's right there,\nit's what you're looking for.\n\n450\n00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,620\n>> I know, I can't seem to find it.\n\n451\n00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,415\n>> 120 CPEs, right?\n\n452\n00:24:57,415 --> 00:24:57,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n453\n00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,200\nSo we want, we're gonna have 120 CPEs,\nultimately,\n\n454\n00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,460\nContinuing Professional Education\ncredits that are available to you.\n\n455\n00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,550\nMeaning you, as a professional,\nhave to go out and find opportunities,\n\n456\n00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,760\nattend conferences, read articles,\nengage in projects.\n\n457\n00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,120\nThere's a million ways to earn CPEs.\n\n458\n00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,600\nYou have to do 120 every three years,\nwhich means 40 a year, and\n\n459\n00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,460\nyou report those in and randomly you may\nor may not be audited by ISC squared.\n\n460\n00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,080\nAuditing just simply means you\nhave to document what you did.\n\n461\n00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,740\nOther is code of ethics we subscribe to\nas information security professionals.\n\n462\n00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,470\nPart of that means you will report\naccurately and honestly your activities,\n\n463\n00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,250\nand as a result, be able to validate them.\n\n464\n00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,690\nThere's a small fee as you can see,\nevery year, of $85.00 currently.\n\n465\n00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,600\nFor your annual membership fee,\nthat's what the AMF is for.\n\n466\n00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,420\nAnd so once you do that,\nyou don't have to re-certify,\n\n467\n00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,410\nyou don't have to retake this\nexam as long as you stay current.\n\n468\n00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,560\nThere are people, believe it or not,\n\n469\n00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,560\nthat actually choose to take this\nexam every three years to re-validate\n\n470\n00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,200\ntheir skills, and that is fine and\nthere's nothing wrong with that, but\n\n471\n00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,820\nyou do have the option to simply I'll\noffer these credits up, have them audited,\n\n472\n00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,950\nmake sure they are valid, and\nthen continue on your certification path.\n\n473\n00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,780\nI've been an ISC2,\na proud member of the ISC2 community,\n\n474\n00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,270\nin terms of being an information security\nprofessional for well over a decade, and\n\n475\n00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:14,700\nI took my exams like everybody else\ndoes at some point in their career, but\n\n476\n00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,600\nI did not go back and\nchoose to retake them.\n\n477\n00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,940\nI chose to do what most people do,\nI will say.\n\n478\n00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,660\nWhich is have perhaps less\nresistance than others.\n\n479\n00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,185\nWhich is to continue to amass CPE credits\nevery year, report them faithfully and\n\n480\n00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:28,935\ndutifully.\n\n481\n00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:31,825\nI do the same thing in my other\nprofessional certifications\n\n482\n00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:32,945\nthat require it.\n\n483\n00:26:32,945 --> 00:26:35,025\nI am an auditor, for instance,\na certified auditor,\n\n484\n00:26:35,025 --> 00:26:40,315\nso in my Osaka based credentials that I\nhold there, I have to report CPEs as well.\n\n485\n00:26:40,315 --> 00:26:43,855\nAnd so it's the same process, and\nas I said, there's a very long list of\n\n486\n00:26:43,855 --> 00:26:47,655\nthe activities you can engage in that will\nallow you to maintain and gather CPEs.\n\n487\n00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:49,565\nSo just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n488\n00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:52,920\nAnd the good news is most of what you\ndo everyday in a professional practice,\n\n489\n00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,430\nmeaning, doing your job will\nqualify you at some level for CPE.\n\n490\n00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,610\nSo, it's not as if you necessarily\nneed to go out of your way\n\n491\n00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,460\nin order to gather them.\n\n492\n00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,980\nBut it is a requirement, you do wanna\nmake sure you are aware of that as part\n\n493\n00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,090\nof the overall knowledge we're\ngathering here initially.\n\n494\n00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,470\n>> Yeah, I don't think most people\nwant to sit in that testing booth for\n\n495\n00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,090\nanother six hours after doing it once.\n\n496\n00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,950\n>> No, no, no.\n\n497\n00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,380\nNo, it is a long day,\nlet's put it that way, and it is one that.\n\n498\n00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,540\nIt really test your metal,\nas an individual,\n\n499\n00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,590\nas a practitioner, as a professional.\n\n500\n00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,760\nIt makes you really understand\nthe value of what you do every day, but\n\n501\n00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,970\nit is not by any means unachievable and\nunattainable.\n\n502\n00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:33,830\nPeople that go through certification exams\nhopefully are prepared for the outcome,\n\n503\n00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,370\nmeaning they have practiced and\nprepared for success.\n\n504\n00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,230\nAnd if you put the time in up front,\ngo through the training materials with us.\n\n505\n00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,040\nDo the additional work that's required to\nreally study and master this material.\n\n506\n00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,090\nYou will be successful, and\nyou will be successful on your first try.\n\n507\n00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,960\nI am not going to promise you that.\n\n508\n00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,590\nBut I am going to tell you strongly,\n\n509\n00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,810\ngiven the experience I have over\nalmost two decades of doing\n\n510\n00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:58,150\nthis professionally as an educator, that\npeople that prepare, will be successful.\n\n511\n00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,790\nBut you gotta do the work.\n\n512\n00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,480\nAnd you gotta prepare seriously.\n\n513\n00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,240\nAnd you gotta understand\nhow to be successful.\n\n514\n00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,180\nAnd that's gonna be very important.\n\n515\n00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,670\n>> All right, well I think that's a pretty\ngood overview of the certification, and so\n\n516\n00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,360\nI just wanted to give everybody a chance\nto kinda learn a little bit more about\n\n517\n00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,780\nCISSP, see what it's about, and\ndetermine if it's right for you.\n\n518\n00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,510\nIf you wanna pursue it, if this is one of\nyour goals and you're working towards it,\n\n519\n00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,390\nwell, stay tuned, because we're\nabout to launch our whole series.\n\n520\n00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,580\nWe're gonna move through\nall of the ten domains and\n\n521\n00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,600\ncover all the different information,\nreally go into that in depth.\n\n522\n00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,990\nIt's a great learning experience even\nif you don't ultimately take the exam.\n\n523\n00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,500\nIt is a wealth of knowledge.\n\n524\n00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,375\nIt's very useful, very practical, and\neasy to apply in your work environment.\n\n525\n00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:38,533\nTake advantage of it, and\nwe hope to see you then.\n\n526\n00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,077\n>> See you soon.\n\n527\n00:28:40,077 --> 00:28:44,540\n[MUSIC]\n\n",
