take a moment and introduce\nyou to a new certification that we're\n\n4\n00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,420\nbeginning to film today,\nit's the CISSP, and\n\n5\n00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,440\nI shouldn't call it a new certification\ncuz it's been around quite a while.\n\n6\n00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,960\nBut if you're not familiar with it,\nthe CISSP It's just the certified.\n\n7\n00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,540\nLet's see if I can get this right.\n\n8\n00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,840\nCertified Information Systems\nSecurity Professional.\n\n9\n00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,590\nI only had to look at my notes once.\n\n10\n00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,900\nAnd it is a very well known and\n\n11\n00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,585\nvery well respected certification\nin the IT Security Community.\n\n12\n00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:40,285\nIt is a high level certification.\n\n13\n00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:43,315\nIt's not like some introductory\ngetting started in security.\n\n14\n00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:46,285\nThis is for people who have been in\nthe field for quite some time and\n\n15\n00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:47,895\nhave a high level of experience.\n\n16\n00:00:47,895 --> 00:00:51,510\nAs a result we didn't wanna just\nshoot this with our normal staff.\n\n17\n00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,930\nWe decided to bring in resident expert\nAdam Gordon to assist us in covering.\n\n18\n00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,131\n>> Are you implying I'm not part of\nthe normal, I'm gonna put that in quotes,\n\n19\n00:00:59,131 --> 00:00:59,891\nin normal staff.\n\n20\n00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:02,973\n[CROSSTALK] I'm abnormal, or\nextra normal, I'm not sure which.\n\n21\n00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:04,467\n[LAUGH]\n>> I'm willing to go out on a limb, and\n\n22\n00:01:04,467 --> 00:01:05,815\nsay you are anything but normal.\n\n23\n00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,110\n[LAUGH]\n>> And thank you sir,\n\n24\n00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,090\nI do appreciate that characterization.\n\n25\n00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:12,200\n>> We definitely appreciate\nyou coming out and helping us.\n\n26\n00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,790\n>> Absolutely.\n\n27\n00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:16,890\n>> And Adam, you know, why don't you\njust take a brief moment to just kind of\n\n28\n00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,070\ntell everybody a little bit about\nyourself and then introduce us to CISSP.\n\n29\n00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,000\n>> Sure, absolutely.\n\n30\n00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,190\nSo first of all good morning,\ngood day, good afternoon or\n\n31\n00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:27,740\ngood evening depending on where you are in\nthe world and when you may be seeing this.\n\n32\n00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,990\nBut For those of you that perhaps\nhave never been associated or\n\n33\n00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,990\nheard much about the CISSP as\na credential may not know peers or\n\n34\n00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,570\ncolleagues or\nco-workers that hold this certification.\n\n35\n00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,950\nIt's considered to be by anybody in\nthe information security field the gold\n\n36\n00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:50,890\nstandard for information security\nmanagement, and really the top in terms of\n\n37\n00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,840\nhow you look at the pinnacle, or the\npyramid of certification and knowledge.\n\n38\n00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,930\nReally sitting at the top, right up there\nwith the industry leading certifications,\n\n39\n00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,050\nto validate your skills\nboth as a practitioner,\n\n40\n00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,620\nbecause you have to have at least five\nyears of practical hands on proven and\n\n41\n00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,840\ndemonstrable experience in two or\nmore of the ten bodies of knowledge areas.\n\n42\n00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,800\nWhat we call the common bodies of\nknowledge, are the domains and\n\n43\n00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,700\nwe'll talk about those in a few minutes.\n\n44\n00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,870\nBut you have to have two of the five\nminimum, and represent knowledge.\n\n45\n00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,550\nIn two of those five areas, but\n\n46\n00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:25,580\nalso because it brings together\nall the different areas\n\n47\n00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,540\nthat a security professional,\nboth as a practitioner and a manager\n\n48\n00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,015\nwill actually have to have knowledge of in\norder to do their job day in and day out.\n\n49\n00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:35,775\nAt the strategic as well\nas at the tactical and\n\n50\n00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:38,265\nthe operational levels of an organization.\n\n51\n00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:42,955\nAnd so most people that hold CISSP as a\ncredential are gonna be holding it because\n\n52\n00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:46,835\nthey've advanced through the ranks, they\nhave been practitioners at some point and\n\n53\n00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:49,745\nat that point in their career\nwhere they made the transition and\n\n54\n00:02:49,745 --> 00:02:54,130\nbecame a little more senior started\nfocusing on managerial related duties\n\n55\n00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,220\nmade believe that understood that\nin order to validate those skills\n\n56\n00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,370\nthere are many certifications that\ncan help along the way to do that,\n\n57\n00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,070\nperhaps a PMP certification for instance\nas a Project Management Professional.\n\n58\n00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,020\nPerhaps something like ITIL, which is\na framework certification that builds\n\n59\n00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,200\nIT foundation knowledge\naround customer service.\n\n60\n00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,540\nBut at the end of the day, you still have\nto have the information security focus\n\n61\n00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,520\nreally in this kind of a role to be able\nto show the business, and create, and\n\n62\n00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,730\nthe mind of the business the value\nyou bring as a manager and\n\n63\n00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,280\na more senior thought leader.\n\n64\n00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,835\nAnd so what I do in my practice\noutside of doing IT and\n\n65\n00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:34,830\ndoing IT in the real world\noutside of a studio such as this.\n\n66\n00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:39,470\nWhere we spend time talking a lot about\nhow to do these things to help you\n\n67\n00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,610\nhave better understanding and also to help\neducate you about what the opportunities\n\n68\n00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,000\nare with certifications like this.\n\n69\n00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,880\nI spend time in my practice in\nthe real world as both an educator and\n\n70\n00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,730\na trainer that's how I make my living.\n\n71\n00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,010\nI have for probably close to\n30 years now as a teacher,\n\n72\n00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,830\nboth in academia as well as\nin the professional world.\n\n73\n00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,940\nAnd so at one point I was an academic,\ntrue and tried in the sense that I taught\n\n74\n00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,310\nat university, but these days, and for\nmany many years, close to probably 17 or\n\n75\n00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,830\n18 years now, I've been in the public\nsector teaching for universities and\n\n76\n00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,140\nteaching their people, but teaching also\nfor just about anybody you could think of.\n\n77\n00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,620\nAnd I teach for a wide array and\nwide variety of people all over the world.\n\n78\n00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,360\nI do so both in the public and\nprivate space.\n\n79\n00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,330\nAnd I'm a consultant.\n\n80\n00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,680\nI make my living at the end of\nthe day helping people understand how\n\n81\n00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,820\nto do the things that we're going to spend\nthe rest of our show today and throughout\n\n82\n00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,320\nall the episodes associated with this\nparticular topic talking to about.\n\n83\n00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,920\nAnd so I write on these topics,\nI blog on these topics,\n\n84\n00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,300\nI write books on these topics, I speak\non these topics around the world, and\n\n85\n00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,220\nI spend a lot of time with customers\nhelping them to understand\n\n86\n00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,490\ntheir technologies,\nwhether it's in the Microsoft space,\n\n87\n00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,480\nwhether it's in the VMware space, Cisco\nCitrix, policy, procedure, you name it.\n\n88\n00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,830\nI spend time working\nin all of those areas.\n\n89\n00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,280\nAnd so we probably would wanna talk for\na few minutes and may wanna put up on\n\n90\n00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,420\nthe screen what some of those areas are,\nthe ten bodies of knowledge.\n\n91\n00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,840\nAnd maybe just quickly\nif we could briefly,\n\n92\n00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,760\nI'll walk through them for everybody.\n\n93\n00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,420\nWe wanna introduce them to you, make sure\nthat you're comfortable with them, and\n\n94\n00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,670\nthen as well, maybe just narrate\nthrough quickly at a high level.\n\n95\n00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,700\nWhat you'll expect as you watch some\nof these episodes going forward,\n\n96\n00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,430\nand hopefully you'll have the opportunity\nto watch all of them over time and\n\n97\n00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,270\ngo through this entire area with us,\nbut the CISSP CBK as you can\n\n98\n00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,940\nsee has ten domains, access control\nis listed as the first one here.\n\n99\n00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,130\nIn no particular order the sense of\nimportance, urgency, focus or priority.\n\n100\n00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,720\nThey're all equally important.\n\n101\n00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,150\nWe're just listing them out based on\nthe brochure that [INAUDIBLE] has been\n\n102\n00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,820\nmarketed around distributing, and\n\n103\n00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,260\ndiscussing the information\nabout this certification.\n\n104\n00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,180\nSo access control, you'll see here,\nare we going to zoom in, or we going to.\n\n105\n00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:54,547\nI think we're okay like that if you\nwant but, [CROSSTALK] okay, maybe not.\n\n106\n00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:56,010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n107\n00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,640\nthis is live TV by the way, boys and\ngirls, in case you didn't realize that.\n\n108\n00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,310\nSo we could see Access Control.\n\n109\n00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,530\nWe're talking about basically\nthis idea of all the things,\n\n110\n00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,660\nas that says there on the screen.\n\n111\n00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,560\nA collection of mechanisms.\n\n112\n00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,880\nWorking together to focus us on and\nfocus us in\n\n113\n00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,670\non the idea of if we could just kind of do\none of these and spin around in real time.\n\n114\n00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,780\n>> My assumption that it would zoom in and\nzoom out and instead it flips upside down.\n\n115\n00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,810\n>> It rotated in and out.\n\n116\n00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,480\nAll right.\nSo.\n\n117\n00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,450\n>> Keeping people on their toes.\n\n118\n00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,530\n>> It is.\nAnd it's all good.\n\n119\n00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,820\nSo access control.\n\n120\n00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,660\nThis idea of all the things that\nare working together to create a secure\n\n121\n00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,450\nenvironment, help us protect the assets\nthat are part of the information security\n\n122\n00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,100\npractice, in the business.\n\n123\n00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,350\nYou'll see some of the bullet points.\n\n124\n00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,990\nThere are things that are very high level,\nwe focus on in that domain.\n\n125\n00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,320\nThe concepts, methodologies,\ntechniques of access control,\n\n126\n00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,220\nwe introduce the concepts these concepts\nof confidentiality, integrity, and\n\n127\n00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,220\navailability as the cornerstones the\ntouchstones of the information security.\n\n128\n00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,090\nWe talk about of them in everyone\nof the domains at some level.\n\n129\n00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,650\nAll of them will be present in\nsome form in almost every domain.\n\n130\n00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:01,010\nWe don't talk about availability,\nfor instance,\n\n131\n00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,030\nin the cryptography domain really,\nwe focus on confidentiality and integrity,\n\n132\n00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,210\none of the only areas where we\ndon't see all three represented.\n\n133\n00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,120\nAnd so as we look at this overall list\nof ten areas we're gonna spend time on,\n\n134\n00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,560\nwant you to be thinking, and\nwe will obviously define for you later on.\n\n135\n00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,700\nWhat confidentiality, and\n\n136\n00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,180\nintegrity, and availability really mean\nin relation to each of these areas.\n\n137\n00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,120\nBut be thinking about these high level\ntopics in relation to those ideas.\n\n138\n00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,080\nAnd so conceptual ideas,\ntechniques, attacks, effectiveness.\n\n139\n00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,370\nHow do we set up, maintain,\n\n140\n00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,280\nmonitor, administer day to day\naccess control mechanisms?\n\n141\n00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,920\nWell we move to telecommunications and\n\n142\n00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:41,220\nnetwork security we're focusing on\na traditional networking architecture.\n\n143\n00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,790\nSo how do we build a network\nfrom the ground up?\n\n144\n00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,920\nWhat are the designs?\n\n145\n00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,380\nWhat are the logical, physical,\n\n146\n00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,260\nand technical elements we\nbring into the design?\n\n147\n00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,769\nHow do we work through a model such as\nthe OSI model or the Four-layer DoD,\n\n148\n00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:54,803\nTCP/IP model.\n\n149\n00:07:54,803 --> 00:07:59,946\nIn order to better understand\narchitecture, what are the role\n\n150\n00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:06,262\nof protocols, ports, technologies,\nand solutions such as DMZs, right?\n\n151\n00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:08,842\nFirewalls, things of this\nnature will be discussed.\n\n152\n00:08:08,842 --> 00:08:13,220\nAnd we will obviously broadly stretch\nthat out across the entire architecture.\n\n153\n00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,470\nBoth from the local area as well as in\nthe wide area into our perspective.\n\n154\n00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,330\nSo literally from the LAN to the WAN and\nback again.\n\n155\n00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,190\nInformation security governance and\nrisk management focuses on\n\n156\n00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,680\nmore of the policy areas associated\nwith information security management.\n\n157\n00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,000\nWe're really looking there at\nsecurity governance and policy and\n\n158\n00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,779\nthe guides that it provides to us in\nterms of the ways in which we're able to\n\n159\n00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,812\nwork through the thought process of\nbecoming a focal point for information.\n\n160\n00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:45,205\nAnd really this idea of awareness\nwithin the business and\n\n161\n00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:49,190\namong the user communities that\nare making up the community.\n\n162\n00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,107\nOr the information security management\nfocus, the community of interest that\n\n163\n00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:55,509\nthe business or\nyour practice may be focused on.\n\n164\n00:08:55,509 --> 00:09:00,152\nSo classification and ownership of data,\nthe ideas of risk management, business\n\n165\n00:09:00,152 --> 00:09:04,395\nimpact analysis and how we see the two\nworking together to help us to create,\n\n166\n00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:08,441\nnot only awareness, but guidance\naround that awareness from a policy,\n\n167\n00:09:08,441 --> 00:09:11,535\nfrom a standards, and\nfrom a guideline perspective.\n\n168\n00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:15,030\nAnd we will talk about those things and\nhow they all come together.\n\n169\n00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:19,154\nSoftware development security, we refer\nto the idea of a software development or\n\n170\n00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:21,150\na system development life cycle.\n\n171\n00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,160\nYou can see SDLC is listed there\nas one of the sub bullet points.\n\n172\n00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,916\nAll the control elements included\nwithin the software and/or system life\n\n173\n00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:33,853\ncycle to build a holistic secure solution,\nstart to finish.\n\n174\n00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:37,894\nFrom the idea of really thinking\nthrough it from the inception phase.\n\n175\n00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:41,711\nThinking through the strategies\nassociated with aligning value and\n\n176\n00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:46,052\nbusiness requirements all the way through\nto the proof of concept, the actual\n\n177\n00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:50,280\ntactical steps involved with defining and\nthen building an architecture.\n\n178\n00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,790\nAnd then actually managing and\nmanipulating that system,\n\n179\n00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,279\nmonitoring it in real time through its\nend of life cycle as we cycle it down and\n\n180\n00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,240\nreplace it in whatever that\nform may be over time.\n\n181\n00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,890\nAnd so that entire system life cycle\nis what we will speak about here.\n\n182\n00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,510\nVery interesting topic, one of the topics\nwhere a lot of the practitioners that\n\n183\n00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,870\ncome in looking to certify as CISSPs may\nor may not have a lot of background.\n\n184\n00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,310\nThis is one of those areas that you either\ndo this and you really do it for a living,\n\n185\n00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,310\nunderstand it.\n\n186\n00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,608\nTypical roles that we would\nsee as job holders here.\n\n187\n00:10:21,608 --> 00:10:24,920\nMaybe business analysts,\nmaybe project managers,\n\n188\n00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,490\na PMO type of people that focus on change,\nfocus on portfolio management.\n\n189\n00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:35,330\nCertainly business analysts that will do\nusage acceptance testing, UAT, that would\n\n190\n00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:40,570\nbe focused on universal languages such as\nUML for modeling business case scenarios.\n\n191\n00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,720\nThese are people that tend to focus in and\n\n192\n00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,730\nreally have an understanding\nof these areas.\n\n193\n00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,821\nIf you have a background with\nagile scrum or waterfall,\n\n194\n00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:51,048\nas methodological solutions\naround cycle development,\n\n195\n00:10:51,048 --> 00:10:54,870\nyou probably have a specialty area,\nand a knowledge area here.\n\n196\n00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,160\nBut if you're not in that space,\n\n197\n00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,920\nthis is one of those areas where we\nspend time helping you to understand it.\n\n198\n00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,080\nYou get familiar with it enough certainly\nto understand the material to ultimately\n\n199\n00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,700\nget ready to and indeed hopefully pass\nthe CISSP exam when you're ready.\n\n200\n00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,010\nBut you may not spend a lot of\ntime doing this kind of work\n\n201\n00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,820\nin your day to day practice and\nthat's okay.\n\n202\n00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,620\nYou don't have to be\nan expert in all these areas.\n\n203\n00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,760\nYou don't even have to\nlike all these areas.\n\n204\n00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,360\nAlthough we would want to encourage\nyou to certainly be aware of them.\n\n205\n00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,210\nAnd be focused on them in the relation to\nthe value they may add to the business,\n\n206\n00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,840\nand the issues associated with things\nlike threat and vulnerability and\n\n207\n00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,730\nrisk that all of them\nbring in to our practice.\n\n208\n00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,380\nBut you don't have to do SDLC\nin order to understand it.\n\n209\n00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,380\nAnd so be aware of the fact that there\nwill be some things you like on the menu,\n\n210\n00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,630\njust like anything else,\nsome things you may not be as happy with.\n\n211\n00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,560\nSome things you put off to the side and\ngo, there's absolutely no way.\n\n212\n00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,245\nBut at the end of the day,\nyou have to have some level of comfort and\n\n213\n00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:52,672\nknowledge in all ten of these areas to\nbe successful at passing the CISSP exam.\n\n214\n00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:56,220\nThen after that you go back to the real\nworld in terms of your practice.\n\n215\n00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,970\nYour focus on your day to\nday activities in your jobs.\n\n216\n00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,800\nAnd you will then further specialize and\n\n217\n00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,490\nfurther broaden your\nknowledge in key areas.\n\n218\n00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,210\nAnd others may, as a result,\nnot be as much of a focus for you.\n\n219\n00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:12,110\nCryptography, the idea of applying the\nprinciples, as it says, their means and\n\n220\n00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,690\nmethods of disguising information to\nensure not just authenticity, but\n\n221\n00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,425\nintegrity, and ultimately confidentiality.\n\n222\n00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:21,975\nAnd so\nwe wanna really focus on keeping data\n\n223\n00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:25,455\naway from people that don't need to see\nit, don't have the right to see it here.\n\n224\n00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:29,665\nBut ensuring proof of origin,\nensuring integrity in our data,\n\n225\n00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:33,265\nnon repudiation in our data streams,\nwhich is proof of origin.\n\n226\n00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:37,965\nAnd so things such as digital signatures,\nthings such as hashing, PKI,\n\n227\n00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,285\npublic key infrastructure,\nall of that is discussed here.\n\n228\n00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:42,955\nAnd we will spend time going through and\n\n229\n00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:47,170\nhelping you to better understand the way\nin which this kind of a solution\n\n230\n00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,730\ncan be built into the architecture\nof your systems from the ground up.\n\n231\n00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,820\nWe take a look at security\narchitecture and design.\n\n232\n00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,090\nThe principle structures and\nstrategies that help us monitor and\n\n233\n00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,020\nsecure not only operating\nsystems as it says there, but\n\n234\n00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,790\nall of the building blocks and\ncomponents of our network.\n\n235\n00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,570\nSo the equipment, the software,\nthe logical, physical, and\n\n236\n00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,220\ntechnical controls that\nare brought to bear there.\n\n237\n00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,880\nSo things such as virtualization.\n\n238\n00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,325\nThings such as cloud computing,\nbig topic today, often misunderstood,\n\n239\n00:13:16,325 --> 00:13:20,900\nmisrepresented, and not always very\neasily identified and defined.\n\n240\n00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,030\nGood marketing concept.\n\n241\n00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,910\nVery unsure of what that may\nmean in our world sometimes.\n\n242\n00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,300\nBut what are security models?\n\n243\n00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,080\nRight?\nWhat are vulnerabilities and threats?\n\n244\n00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,220\nWhat are countermeasures\nwe can bring to bear?\n\n245\n00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,660\nAnd how do we build security\nin from every level and\n\n246\n00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,550\nevery angle of our design\nfrom the ground up?\n\n247\n00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,130\nOperational security.\n\n248\n00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,620\nThis is where we tend to see a lot of\npeople having background in one of\n\n249\n00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,366\nthese areas.\n\n250\n00:13:42,366 --> 00:13:46,265\nSuch as operational security,\nwhere we see that most people have some\n\n251\n00:13:46,265 --> 00:13:49,982\nsort of exposure to physical security,\nanother area down below.\n\n252\n00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:53,794\nAnd we kind of blend these two together,\nwhere we talk about how we do resource\n\n253\n00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:57,903\nprotection, incident response, and then\nwhat are the things that are associated\n\n254\n00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:02,264\nwith that from a prevention and a tracking\nand vulnerability management perspective.\n\n255\n00:14:02,264 --> 00:14:04,958\nAnd so that's what we see\nin operational security.\n\n256\n00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,310\nBCP, business continuity planning,\nDRP, disaster recovery planning,\n\n257\n00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,340\nanother area that is usually a specialty\nof certain people in a business.\n\n258\n00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,810\nThis is the area where we talk about\n\n259\n00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,540\nhow do we deal with\nthe possibility of an impact?\n\n260\n00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,300\nAnd then if we do have this threat,\nthis vulnerability,\n\n261\n00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,370\nthis risk become realized,\nwhat do we do to get back to normal?\n\n262\n00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,430\nAnd so, we look at the what if,\n\n263\n00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,940\nand then we talk about what will we\ndo now, in order to return to normal.\n\n264\n00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,297\nAnd so, we'll talk about\nthe differences in these approaches,\n\n265\n00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:40,204\nthe modeling that takes place,\nthe business impact analysis, and the risk\n\n266\n00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:44,499\nmanagement that has to take place, as well\nas the awareness that has to take place.\n\n267\n00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:49,399\nNot just on the part of the practitioner,\nbut on the part of every person that plays\n\n268\n00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,782\nsome role in the business in terms\nof what their role is in this plan.\n\n269\n00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:58,820\nAnd when we talk about BCP,\nwe talk about DRP, we talk about this idea\n\n270\n00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,520\nthat it comes down to being aware of\nwhat should happen at critical moments\n\n271\n00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,730\nto make sure that bad things are not\nhappening because we're not aware of them.\n\n272\n00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,070\nAnd so we'll talk more about this and\nhow this works.\n\n273\n00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,030\nPretty fun discussion,\n\n274\n00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,800\nactually a lot of really interesting\nstuff that goes on there.\n\n275\n00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,860\nLegal, regulatory, investigative,\nand compliance concerns and areas.\n\n276\n00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,230\nWhat are legal issues?\n\n277\n00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,870\nWhat are the processes from\na forensics standpoint, for instance,\n\n278\n00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,450\nthat we go through to manage through\nperhaps the investigation of an incident,\n\n279\n00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,110\nor an event or a crime?\n\n280\n00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,250\nHow do we measure what is\ngoing on through logging and\n\n281\n00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,740\nhow do we measure things\nthrough evidence gathering?\n\n282\n00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,190\nSo, chain of custody of evidence,\nsteps involved with that.\n\n283\n00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,150\nWill be very interesting and, obviously,\na part of our conversation there.\n\n284\n00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,835\nThis is the area where most people\nlook at what we do as CISSP's and\n\n285\n00:15:45,835 --> 00:15:48,783\nthink, well I see that on\nreality TV all the time, or\n\n286\n00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:52,335\nI see that on TV shows cuz that's\nthat whole CSI thing, right?\n\n287\n00:15:52,335 --> 00:15:56,946\nThat's where you guys walk around\nwith all the cool technology and\n\n288\n00:15:56,946 --> 00:16:00,087\nmaybe carry guns and\nget to ride in cool cars.\n\n289\n00:16:00,087 --> 00:16:03,912\nQuite the opposite actually as you will\nhear me go on about when we get into\n\n290\n00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:05,054\nthese discussions.\n\n291\n00:16:05,054 --> 00:16:08,508\nIt is very fascinating work,\nit's work I love to do.\n\n292\n00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:12,699\nIt's work that anybody that has a passion\nfor that area of our field will tell you\n\n293\n00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:16,100\ncan be incredibly fascinating,\nincredibly rewarding.\n\n294\n00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,710\nBut it is very detail oriented,\nit is very precise, it is very focused and\n\n295\n00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:23,860\nunfortunately to burst your bubble,\nit can be a little bit\n\n296\n00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,690\ntedious in the sense that it's not quite\nas exciting as you may think it is.\n\n297\n00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,048\nYou sit in a cube of some sort, in a room,\nwherever that may be, working on this\n\n298\n00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:36,498\ninformation more so, than typically doing\nit in the field the way you see on TV.\n\n299\n00:16:36,498 --> 00:16:40,805\nAnd we don't tend to have the million\ndollar AV suite associated with our\n\n300\n00:16:40,805 --> 00:16:41,960\nworkspaces.\n\n301\n00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,940\nSo we don't get to perhaps play with some\nof those toys that you may see on TV, but\n\n302\n00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,870\nwe do a lot of really interesting\nthings in this kind of an error.\n\n303\n00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:53,791\nSo we'll talk about what does go on and\nwhat those particular items may be?\n\n304\n00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,565\nAnd then finally, physical security.\n\n305\n00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:59,240\nPhysical/Environmental Security,\nas you can see down there.\n\n306\n00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,190\nThis is where we talk about things\nlike where do we build the building,\n\n307\n00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,010\nthat will house the dad and\nhow should it be designed?\n\n308\n00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,010\nWhat kind of systems does it need?\n\n309\n00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,419\nFrom external gateways such fences,\nand guard posts, and\n\n310\n00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:16,988\na closed circuit TV and dogs and lighting,\nto what do we need on the inside?\n\n311\n00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:20,510\nSo this is where we talk about\nthings like, do we have man traps?\n\n312\n00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,160\nAnd if we have a man trap, do we then also\nhave monitoring on either side of it?\n\n313\n00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,750\nEither manually driven, somebody who's\nliterally watching you, make you sign at\n\n314\n00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,900\na desk as a guard or as an Automator where\nwe have some sort of scanning system.\n\n315\n00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,820\nSo a biometric concern there,\nand things like that.\n\n316\n00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,620\nSo this is where we get into these kinds\nof discussions, this is where we talk\n\n317\n00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,750\nabout how to build and\nhow to designed these secure environments?\n\n318\n00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,908\nSo this overall, take together is\nthe ten bodies of knowledge or\n\n319\n00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:50,072\nthe ten domain areas,\nthat make up the focal point of the CISSP.\n\n320\n00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:53,440\nSo want to encourage you to be thinking\nabout, what it takes to become a CISSP.\n\n321\n00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,530\nYou're gonna need to become at some level,\nas we've said, conversant with and\n\n322\n00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,130\ncomfortable with this material.\n\n323\n00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,140\nWe're gonna spend a lot of time, both\nmyself and my co-host as we work through\n\n324\n00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,260\nthese episodes and these areas with you,\nhelping you to better understand them.\n\n325\n00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,710\nBut we're also gonna make sure,\nhopefully, that you have some questions.\n\n326\n00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,910\nAnd along the way you ask us those, and\nI know Don is always very good about\n\n327\n00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,310\nsetting us up to deal with people\nthat may be in the chat room, and\n\n328\n00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:19,110\nmay have questions that\nthey wanna proffer to us.\n\n329\n00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:23,900\nWhat I think will be valuable for you, and\nwhat I think will be very interesting for\n\n330\n00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,320\nyou to do as you go through this material,\nas we help work through it with you,\n\n331\n00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,070\nis to make sure that you figure\nout how to personalize this?\n\n332\n00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,070\nSo what I mean is, bring it down to\nyour level in your world and help you to\n\n333\n00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:38,870\nunderstand, what something like a security\npolicy means, because it's what you do.\n\n334\n00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,070\nAnd your example of whatever\na security policy is in your world,\n\n335\n00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,810\nwill help you to better\nunderstand this material.\n\n336\n00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,580\nSo look for\nthose places to engage, look for\n\n337\n00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:50,190\nthose places to make it personal, look for\nthe kind of things that will help you to\n\n338\n00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:54,660\nbetter understand what challenges you\nmay face as you prepare for this exam.\n\n339\n00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,380\nAsk those questions, but\nalso seek out that knowledge.\n\n340\n00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,460\nPay attention to the things we offer,\nopportunities and tips for\n\n341\n00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,740\nyou to follow up.\n\n342\n00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,310\nAnd most importantly, as we work through\nthis material, think about as I said,\n\n343\n00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:09,080\nhow you prepare to study for\nthis kind of an exam?\n\n344\n00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,560\nWe'll talk more about that or\nthe methodology is at some point.\n\n345\n00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,870\nBut at a high level, 250 questions,\nmultiple choice exam.\n\n346\n00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,290\nYou'll back in the old day,\nback in the old school days,\n\n347\n00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,110\nthis was a paper based exam.\n\n348\n00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,880\nYou sat for six hours in a room.\n\n349\n00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,340\nYou did a Scantron bubble sheet where\nyou had to bubble in your answers,\n\n350\n00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,580\nmuch like we would have done on any of\nthe standardized tests you may have taken,\n\n351\n00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,960\nif you took testing at some point\nin your early academic career.\n\n352\n00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,000\nNow, it is computer based, so it is\na little bit of a different experience.\n\n353\n00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,600\nStill six hours in length however,\nstill 250 questions,\n\n354\n00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,320\nstill one of the longest\nprofessional exams in our industry.\n\n355\n00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,100\nStill often thought of by anybody who's\ngone through it, as being both one of\n\n356\n00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,750\nthe most difficult but\nalso something that they didn't expect.\n\n357\n00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,420\nWhen you often hear from people about what\nthey did in the exam, and how they kinda\n\n358\n00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,170\nwent through what they think, that's how\nyou know I spent all this time studying.\n\n359\n00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,875\nIt was as tough as I thought it would be,\nbut it was fair.\n\n360\n00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,865\nBut it was also not what I expected.\n\n361\n00:20:03,865 --> 00:20:07,515\nAnd it was a little bit different, didn't\nreally see some of those questions coming,\n\n362\n00:20:07,515 --> 00:20:08,967\nthey were out of left field maybe.\n\n363\n00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:12,650\nOr I thought it was going to be like this,\nand I really saw it this way.\n\n364\n00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,780\nSo it's all multiple choice driven.\n\n365\n00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,240\nWhat that means is at the end of the day,\n\n366\n00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,320\nyou have a series of\nquestions you must answer.\n\n367\n00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,980\nSome of them will be scenario based, so\nthere are scenario based exam solutions\n\n368\n00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,000\nthese days that were not in older\nversions of the exam, but there are now.\n\n369\n00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,480\nMeeting a series of questions built\naround a topographical map of knowledge,\n\n370\n00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,540\ntypically a couple of paragraphs that\nexplain a story or some sort of set of\n\n371\n00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,360\nevents to you which are then asked to\nanswer a series of questions about.\n\n372\n00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,550\nBut at the end of the day,\nthis is what an exam means.\n\n373\n00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,290\nIt means sitting in a room, and\nbringing that knowledge to the fore, and\n\n374\n00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,210\napplying it appropriately within the\nscenario that you're given on the screen.\n\n375\n00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,520\nIt does also mean for\nyou, to be very careful,\n\n376\n00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,630\nbringing in that external knowledge\nthat we all know we all have, and\n\n377\n00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,780\nwe all master in our normal\nprofessional practices, and\n\n378\n00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,050\nmaking it filter through that appropriate\nlens of, is this exam appropriate?\n\n379\n00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,170\nIs this real world appropriate?\n\n380\n00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,970\nYou in other words will know a lot of\nthings from the real world that may or\n\n381\n00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,330\nnot be focused on in the exam.\n\n382\n00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,300\nAnd what you often hear from people that\nare challenged by an exam like this,\n\n383\n00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,360\nis that they really did a poor\njob of time management.\n\n384\n00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,585\nThey did a poor job of knowledge\nmanagement, and as a result of one or\n\n385\n00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:22,505\nboth of those areas not lining up,\n\n386\n00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:25,805\nthey unfortunately get invited\nback to do it again a second time.\n\n387\n00:21:25,805 --> 00:21:28,485\nAnd we don't want that to be\nthe case with any of you.\n\n388\n00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:31,035\nAnd so make sure you're thinking\nabout how to be successful,\n\n389\n00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:33,580\nalong with how you're gonna\nmaster this material?\n\n390\n00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,910\n>> Now, one thing I want to make\nsure we touch on before we wrap up,\n\n391\n00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,750\nis that the CISSP certification is not for\neveryone.\n\n392\n00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,730\nAnd I kind of alluded to this,\nearlier in the segment,\n\n393\n00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,220\nwhere I said, if you're just getting\nstarted, if you're interested in\n\n394\n00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,820\npursuing a career in IT security,\nthe CISSP is not a starting point.\n\n395\n00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,570\nCISSP is a finish point.\n\n396\n00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,000\nSo if you're just getting started,\n\n397\n00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,380\nyou might want to look at some of\nthe other certifications that we have,\n\n398\n00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:03,560\nlike the CompTIA Security+ or ISC Squared,\nthe SSCP, that's a great starting point.\n\n399\n00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,980\nSSCP is really designed for someone\nwith a year of experience, but someone\n\n400\n00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,742\ngoing into the CISSP is expected to\nhave a far greater amount of experience.\n\n401\n00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:16,140\nAnd so I just got up here on the screen\nsome of the different types of\n\n402\n00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,620\npeople that might seek this.\n\n403\n00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,280\nBut if you look down the list, you'll\nsee that word manager a couple times.\n\n404\n00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,310\nThese are people who are working full time\nin IT security that are moving up to that\n\n405\n00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,460\nhigher level in their career,\nthat's really what the CISSP is all about.\n\n406\n00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,573\n>> [COUGH] It is, and beyond the CISSP\nyou made reference in the fact that it's\n\n407\n00:22:34,573 --> 00:22:36,610\nnot a starting point or\nrather and end point.\n\n408\n00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,390\nAnd what I think is also important is,\n[COUGH]\n\n409\n00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:42,960\nif you could scroll down just a little\nbit on that page while we're talking.\n\n410\n00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,980\nBelow this area, advance beyond the CISSP,\nif you could bring that up for\n\n411\n00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,500\njust a minute.\n\n412\n00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,770\nSo the other thing that's\ninteresting about ISC squared and\n\n413\n00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,230\nabout this certification, is that CISSP in\nit of itself is a tremendous achievemen.\n\n414\n00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,600\nThe gold standard, the pinnacle of\ninformation security management.\n\n415\n00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,420\nThere are over 100,000 CISSPs certified\nin the world today, and it is by and\n\n416\n00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,040\nfar and away the single most important\ncertification we have in our industry\n\n417\n00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,650\nin this particular regard.\n\n418\n00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,963\nBut having said that, there are areas\nyou go out beyond the CISSP.\n\n419\n00:23:12,963 --> 00:23:16,045\nAnd these are what are called\nthe concentration areas and so\n\n420\n00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:19,570\nyou can see ISSAP,\nwhich is the architecture professional.\n\n421\n00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,420\nThe EP, the Engineering Professional,\nthe MP the Management or\n\n422\n00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,930\nManagerial Professional.\n\n423\n00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:28,540\nYou must first hold the CISSP in order\nto then go on and attain one of these.\n\n424\n00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,050\nWhat we want you to do is really have a\nfull sense of what a career in information\n\n425\n00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,070\nsecurity management and\n\n426\n00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,310\ninformation security as\na practitioner may mean for you?\n\n427\n00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,460\nAnd becoming a CISSP is not an end point\n\n428\n00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,780\nin that professional development arch for\nyou.\n\n429\n00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,690\nBut rather is a very,\nvery important plateau that you reach, and\n\n430\n00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,320\ncelebrate success around.\n\n431\n00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,450\nAnd build the foundation of\nadditional successes from.\n\n432\n00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,016\nBut there are other places to go,\nand other things to do.\n\n433\n00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,677\nAnd so while this is a very,\nvery important milestone in your career,\n\n434\n00:23:57,677 --> 00:24:01,588\nshould you choose to pursue it and\nultimately be successful at it- You will\n\n435\n00:24:01,588 --> 00:24:06,000\nhave other opportunities to pursue\nadditional certification out beyond this.\n\n436\n00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,690\nWe're not really gonna get into what\nthese credentials mean today, nor\n\n437\n00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,830\nare we gonna really touch on them\nanywhere in this set of discussions.\n\n438\n00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,550\nBut at least an awareness of the fact\nthat there are other opportunities inside\n\n439\n00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,850\nof your professional development arc,\n\n440\n00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,670\nyou do need to bring CPEs to\nthe table in order to stay certified.\n\n441\n00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:27,640\nAnd the idea here is that as a CISSP,\nor even as an SSCP as Don mentioned,\n\n442\n00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,630\nas a starting point, you have to bring a\ncertain amount of professional development\n\n443\n00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:35,770\nto your career arc as you go through and\nstay a certified professional.\n\n444\n00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,680\nWhen you certify as a CISSP, you have\na three year lifecycle on your credential.\n\n445\n00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,310\nAnd what that means is ultimately,\nthat every three years you will be\n\n446\n00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,960\nasked to validate that you have achieved\na certain amount of additional knowledge\n\n447\n00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,270\nthrough continuing education\nin your career field.\n\n448\n00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,130\nAnd as a result of that, you will then,\n\n449\n00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,750\nI think it's right there,\nit's what you're looking for.\n\n450\n00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,620\n>> I know, I can't seem to find it.\n\n451\n00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,415\n>> 120 CPEs, right?\n\n452\n00:24:57,415 --> 00:24:57,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n453\n00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,200\nSo we want, we're gonna have 120 CPEs,\nultimately,\n\n454\n00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,460\nContinuing Professional Education\ncredits that are available to you.\n\n455\n00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,550\nMeaning you, as a professional,\nhave to go out and find opportunities,\n\n456\n00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,760\nattend conferences, read articles,\nengage in projects.\n\n457\n00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,120\nThere's a million ways to earn CPEs.\n\n458\n00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,600\nYou have to do 120 every three years,\nwhich means 40 a year, and\n\n459\n00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,460\nyou report those in and randomly you may\nor may not be audited by ISC squared.\n\n460\n00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,080\nAuditing just simply means you\nhave to document what you did.\n\n461\n00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,740\nOther is code of ethics we subscribe to\nas information security professionals.\n\n462\n00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,470\nPart of that means you will report\naccurately and honestly your activities,\n\n463\n00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,250\nand as a result, be able to validate them.\n\n464\n00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,690\nThere's a small fee as you can see,\nevery year, of $85.00 currently.\n\n465\n00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:41,600\nFor your annual membership fee,\nthat's what the AMF is for.\n\n466\n00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,420\nAnd so once you do that,\nyou don't have to re-certify,\n\n467\n00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,410\nyou don't have to retake this\nexam as long as you stay current.\n\n468\n00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,560\nThere are people, believe it or not,\n\n469\n00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,560\nthat actually choose to take this\nexam every three years to re-validate\n\n470\n00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:55,200\ntheir skills, and that is fine and\nthere's nothing wrong with that, but\n\n471\n00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,820\nyou do have the option to simply I'll\noffer these credits up, have them audited,\n\n472\n00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,950\nmake sure they are valid, and\nthen continue on your certification path.\n\n473\n00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,780\nI've been an ISC2,\na proud member of the ISC2 community,\n\n474\n00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,270\nin terms of being an information security\nprofessional for well over a decade, and\n\n475\n00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:14,700\nI took my exams like everybody else\ndoes at some point in their career, but\n\n476\n00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,600\nI did not go back and\nchoose to retake them.\n\n477\n00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,940\nI chose to do what most people do,\nI will say.\n\n478\n00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,660\nWhich is have perhaps less\nresistance than others.\n\n479\n00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,185\nWhich is to continue to amass CPE credits\nevery year, report them faithfully and\n\n480\n00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:28,935\ndutifully.\n\n481\n00:26:28,935 --> 00:26:31,825\nI do the same thing in my other\nprofessional certifications\n\n482\n00:26:31,825 --> 00:26:32,945\nthat require it.\n\n483\n00:26:32,945 --> 00:26:35,025\nI am an auditor, for instance,\na certified auditor,\n\n484\n00:26:35,025 --> 00:26:40,315\nso in my Osaka based credentials that I\nhold there, I have to report CPEs as well.\n\n485\n00:26:40,315 --> 00:26:43,855\nAnd so it's the same process, and\nas I said, there's a very long list of\n\n486\n00:26:43,855 --> 00:26:47,655\nthe activities you can engage in that will\nallow you to maintain and gather CPEs.\n\n487\n00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:49,565\nSo just make sure you're aware of that.\n\n488\n00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:52,920\nAnd the good news is most of what you\ndo everyday in a professional practice,\n\n489\n00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,430\nmeaning, doing your job will\nqualify you at some level for CPE.\n\n490\n00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,610\nSo, it's not as if you necessarily\nneed to go out of your way\n\n491\n00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,460\nin order to gather them.\n\n492\n00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,980\nBut it is a requirement, you do wanna\nmake sure you are aware of that as part\n\n493\n00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,090\nof the overall knowledge we're\ngathering here initially.\n\n494\n00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,470\n>> Yeah, I don't think most people\nwant to sit in that testing booth for\n\n495\n00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,090\nanother six hours after doing it once.\n\n496\n00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:12,950\n>> No, no, no.\n\n497\n00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,380\nNo, it is a long day,\nlet's put it that way, and it is one that.\n\n498\n00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,540\nIt really test your metal,\nas an individual,\n\n499\n00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,590\nas a practitioner, as a professional.\n\n500\n00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,760\nIt makes you really understand\nthe value of what you do every day, but\n\n501\n00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,970\nit is not by any means unachievable and\nunattainable.\n\n502\n00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:33,830\nPeople that go through certification exams\nhopefully are prepared for the outcome,\n\n503\n00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,370\nmeaning they have practiced and\nprepared for success.\n\n504\n00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,230\nAnd if you put the time in up front,\ngo through the training materials with us.\n\n505\n00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,040\nDo the additional work that's required to\nreally study and master this material.\n\n506\n00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,090\nYou will be successful, and\nyou will be successful on your first try.\n\n507\n00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,960\nI am not going to promise you that.\n\n508\n00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,590\nBut I am going to tell you strongly,\n\n509\n00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,810\ngiven the experience I have over\nalmost two decades of doing\n\n510\n00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:58,150\nthis professionally as an educator, that\npeople that prepare, will be successful.\n\n511\n00:27:58,150 --> 00:27:59,790\nBut you gotta do the work.\n\n512\n00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,480\nAnd you gotta prepare seriously.\n\n513\n00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,240\nAnd you gotta understand\nhow to be successful.\n\n514\n00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,180\nAnd that's gonna be very important.\n\n515\n00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,670\n>> All right, well I think that's a pretty\ngood overview of the certification, and so\n\n516\n00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:11,360\nI just wanted to give everybody a chance\nto kinda learn a little bit more about\n\n517\n00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,780\nCISSP, see what it's about, and\ndetermine if it's right for you.\n\n518\n00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,510\nIf you wanna pursue it, if this is one of\nyour goals and you're working towards it,\n\n519\n00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,390\nwell, stay tuned, because we're\nabout to launch our whole series.\n\n520\n00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,580\nWe're gonna move through\nall of the ten domains and\n\n521\n00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,600\ncover all the different information,\nreally go into that in depth.\n\n522\n00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,990\nIt's a great learning experience even\nif you don't ultimately take the exam.\n\n523\n00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,500\nIt is a wealth of knowledge.\n\n524\n00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,375\nIt's very useful, very practical, and\neasy to apply in your work environment.\n\n525\n00:28:35,375 --> 00:28:38,533\nTake advantage of it, and\nwe hope to see you then.\n\n526\n00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,077\n>> See you soon.\n\n527\n00:28:40,077 --> 00:28:44,540\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

00:00:14,440\nI am Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n4\n00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,161\nHow are you doing Adam?\n\n5\n00:00:15,161 --> 00:00:16,751\n>> I'm doing good, how about you?\n\n6\n00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:17,960\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,710\nWe are going to talk about some of\nthe things, since we've got Adam here,\n\n8\n00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,040\nwe're gonna talk about some of the things\nthat we need to do to maybe get ready,\n\n9\n00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,910\nsign up for, and get our certification.\n\n10\n00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,460\nWe've gone through a bunch\nof different episodes.\n\n11\n00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,640\nWe've gone over our SSCPU.\n\n12\n00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,450\nWe've gone through some CISSP and now,\nwe're gonna try to help you guys out with\n\n13\n00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,170\nwhen you finally do get ready\nto go get that certification.\n\n14\n00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,860\nSome things that might help you.\n\n15\n00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,700\n>> All right, so\nyeah let's talk a bit about that.\n\n16\n00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,220\nSo the idea here is really just\nto give you a sense, right.\n\n17\n00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,260\nWe've given you all the knowledge.\n\n18\n00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,030\nObviously that's gonna be very critical.\n\n19\n00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,110\nBut knowledge by itself without context\nunfortunately is not gonna always be\n\n20\n00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,840\nthe right mix and give us the right\nset of tools we need to be successful.\n\n21\n00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,110\nSo what does that process look like?\n\n22\n00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,060\nOne of the most asked questions\nI get when I do CISSP or\n\n23\n00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,260\nSSCP classes is, okay, so\nI know I've got to come in and study,\n\n24\n00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,610\nI know I've got this big book,\ngot to go through all this material.\n\n25\n00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,630\nBut what happens when I'm done?\n\n26\n00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,150\nBetween the time and I'm done,\nthe time I've become a CISSP,\n\n27\n00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,270\nwhat does that really look like?\n\n28\n00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,660\nAnd so we thought it would be a good idea\nto spend a couple minutes talking about\n\n29\n00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,190\nthat with you.\n\n30\n00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,920\nThe general process is actually\nvery straightforward today.\n\n31\n00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,880\nIt's actually more so\ntoday than it used to be,\n\n32\n00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,480\nbecause it used to be you'd\nhave to register for an exam.\n\n33\n00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,500\nWas paper based, it had to be scheduled,\n\n34\n00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,180\nit was run through an open series\nof schedules throughout the year.\n\n35\n00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,650\nWorldwide or maybe through a special\nevent depending on whether or\n\n36\n00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,960\nnot you were actually\ndoing a private event.\n\n37\n00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,476\nThese days, you just go in and\ntake it computer based.\n\n38\n00:01:35,476 --> 00:01:38,487\nThe down side is with the old system you\nused to have to wait a couple of weeks\n\n39\n00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:41,271\nto find out your results because\nit was all paper based, Scantron.\n\n40\n00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:43,865\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> These days, not like that.\n\n41\n00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:45,165\nThese days you find out immediately.\n\n42\n00:01:45,165 --> 00:01:49,160\nSo you know you sit there for four or\nfive, six hours, depending on the exam.\n\n43\n00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,740\nAnd when you're done, you get your results\nright away, so that's the good news.\n\n44\n00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,360\nSo the process is fairly straightforward.\n\n45\n00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,240\nYou're gonna have to go out,\n\n46\n00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,880\nand you're gonna have to complete\nthe self-study process, whatever that is.\n\n47\n00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,620\nTake a class,\n\n48\n00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:05,070\nstudy on your own, doesn't really matter\nat the end of the day how you get there.\n\n49\n00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,390\nWhat matters is that you\nfeel you're prepared, and so\n\n50\n00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,880\nwhen you're prepared you're then\ngonna go and register for the exam.\n\n51\n00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,500\nSo before we show you how to register for\n\n52\n00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,130\nthe exam, let's just quickly\ntake you out to the ISC website.\n\n53\n00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:15,920\n>> Sure.\n>> Can we ask you to\n\n54\n00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,170\nbring that up real quick?\n\n55\n00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,490\nAnd so Mike is on the ISC website.\n\n56\n00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:27,080\nSo this is ISC, the number 2, www.ISC2.org\nand ISC2.org on the main site.\n\n57\n00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,470\nMike went up to the training sub menu\nright there, went over to resources,\n\n58\n00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,300\nwent down to testing and assessment.\n\n59\n00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,670\nThat is where he is right now.\n\n60\n00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,830\nAnd then under testing and assessment\nwe wanted to show you the study scope\n\n61\n00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:43,580\nself assessment exam simulation tool\nthat ISC squared has in market.\n\n62\n00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,070\nThey have put together a resource tool.\n\n63\n00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,050\nCan we zoom it just a little?\n\n64\n00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,600\nIs that possible?\n\n65\n00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,920\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Do a little zoom there?\n\n66\n00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,060\n>> Tell me where you want to go.\n\n67\n00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,900\n>> And just like there, yeah.\n\n68\n00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,530\nSo everybody can kind\nof see the information.\n\n69\n00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,250\nSo for SSCP there are 50 questions there\nyou can use as a sample to go through and\n\n70\n00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,440\ntest yourself on.\n\n71\n00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,190\nFor CISSP and\nthose are 100 questions there.\n\n72\n00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,450\nThere are other ISC squared exams that\nare part of the assessment as well.\n\n73\n00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,880\nBut you can go through and see those.\n\n74\n00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,250\nAnd so you register for this,\n\n75\n00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,450\nthey're just gonna get some basic\ninformation from you, create an account.\n\n76\n00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,460\nOnce you go in there you're\nable to go through and\n\n77\n00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,720\ndo this online real time self assessment.\n\n78\n00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,730\nIt's gonna give you the ability\nto kind of test your knowledge.\n\n79\n00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,552\nGet a sense of the kinds of questions\nthat you may be facing on the exam.\n\n80\n00:03:24,552 --> 00:03:26,241\nI'm going to walk though\nsome of those question\n\n81\n00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:27,687\ntypes with you here in a couple minutes.\n\n82\n00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:30,122\nAnd as a result then really kind\nof point out the strengths and\n\n83\n00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:32,170\nweaknesses you have within\nyour study process.\n\n84\n00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,965\nSo this is one of the tools that\nI think is very valuable for\n\n85\n00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:35,975\nyou to take a look at.\n\n86\n00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:38,165\nMaybe just hit the register button\nthere real quick we'll show everybody\n\n87\n00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:38,695\nwhat's involved.\n\n88\n00:03:38,695 --> 00:03:41,215\nWe're not going to go through it of\ncourse but just quickly show you.\n\n89\n00:03:41,215 --> 00:03:43,785\nIt's pretty straight\nforward you can see there.\n\n90\n00:03:43,785 --> 00:03:46,355\nThis is just the product catalogs\njust shows you the number of\n\n91\n00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:47,470\nquestions available.\n\n92\n00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,190\nSo for CISSP you'll see there,\nright set one,\n\n93\n00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,340\nthere's different sets you can go in for.\n\n94\n00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,830\nNow this is if you're going\nto actually buy them.\n\n95\n00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,080\nThis is not for the assessment where\nyou can do it online for free.\n\n96\n00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,340\nThis is if you want to actually buy\nthe tool to use it as a kind of self study\n\n97\n00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,160\nguide fully.\n\n98\n00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,770\nBut if you go through up at the top,\nyou can see that SSCP is there as well.\n\n99\n00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,310\nIf you go through up at the top,\n\n100\n00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,240\nwhat you'll find if you zoom back\nout you can log-in up there.\n\n101\n00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,560\nSo you can actually go up to the top,\nyou can create one.\n\n102\n00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,170\nYou can go ahead and create an account\nthere and you can actually go in.\n\n103\n00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,630\nYou see self-assessment.\n\n104\n00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,390\nSecond menu item down there.\n\n105\n00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,161\nThat's the the product.\n\n106\n00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:21,120\nHow do I go up right there?\n\n107\n00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,590\nSo self assessments, so you can go in\nyou'll see there, do the demo, and\n\n108\n00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,300\nthen the demo, right.\n\n109\n00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,660\nThe demo's gonna be the one that actually\nallows you to be able to go through and\n\n110\n00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,450\nto do this.\n\n111\n00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,540\nAnd so you can go in and\nkinda just walk through that on your own.\n\n112\n00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,140\nAnd then you'll be able\nto see how it works.\n\n113\n00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,630\nYou might not have clicked on it.\n\n114\n00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,500\nSo, you're able to go through and\nregister.\n\n115\n00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,870\nOnce you do that, you have the account and\nyou're able to go in.\n\n116\n00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,460\nSo the other thing we want to\ndo is go back to the IC website.\n\n117\n00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,620\nJust hit back twice.\n\n118\n00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,380\nHit the back, and then, oops, go there.\n\n119\n00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:47,900\nOkay, yeah.\n\n120\n00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,890\nAnd go back to training.\n\n121\n00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:50,800\nThat's training.\n\n122\n00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,800\nAnd then on your training\nover to resources.\n\n123\n00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,920\nAnd down at the bottom you'll see, no I'm\nsorry, you're not trying to get providers.\n\n124\n00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,560\nI'm looking at it from far away.\n\n125\n00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,580\nYeah, so it's the exam outline.\n\n126\n00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,300\nIt's up the top there.\n\n127\n00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,070\nSo this'll show you the exam content,\nthe resource for\n\n128\n00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,620\nthe exam outline, what's called the CIB,\nthe Candid Information Bulletin.\n\n129\n00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,550\nSo, you can actually pull\ndown the information,\n\n130\n00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,140\nreally see the breakdown by\nsection as to what's there,\n\n131\n00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,740\nagain for us to see SSCP and or CISSP,\nwe'll be able to see both there.\n\n132\n00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,370\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n133\n00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,020\nAnd then also if you are gonna\nactually register for the exam,\n\n134\n00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,070\nyou wanna do it online.\n\n135\n00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,240\nThe exam is offered through secure\ntesting sites, so you can go out and\n\n136\n00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,060\nregister with the vendor that runs them.\n\n137\n00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,840\nSo you can go out and\ngo to the testing website.\n\n138\n00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,720\nLiterally just Google how do I take\nthe CISSP exam or something like that, and\n\n139\n00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,980\nyou obviously will be able to find the\nlink there and be able to get online and\n\n140\n00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,150\nregister for it.\n\n141\n00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:48,610\nIf you just go to, if you want to go to,\nwhat is it, just do a quick Google search.\n\n142\n00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:49,420\nI don't remember the URL.\n\n143\n00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,910\nI was gonna give it to you\noff the top of my head.\n\n144\n00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,590\nI just don't remember what it is but\nyou just quickly do a Google search.\n\n145\n00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,690\nYou know, how do I register for\nCISSP and it'll come right up and\n\n146\n00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,630\nwe'll be able to just take you out to\nthe site real quick and show it to you.\n\n147\n00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:06,480\nYou'll see not for CISA, but yet\nregister for ISC Exam or Seminars.\n\n148\n00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,670\nYou can go through, that's through\nthe Examination Register, right there,\n\n149\n00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,420\nyou can actually see it.\n\n150\n00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,350\nSo right off the ISC website, if you\njust hit that, it'll take you there and\n\n151\n00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,700\nit'll take you out to the Pearson Vue.\n\n152\n00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,730\nI just couldn't remember the URL for\nPearson Vue.\n\n153\n00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,230\nIt'll take you out to the Pearson Vue\nwebsite and the Pearson Vue website\n\n154\n00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,060\nis going to be the secure testing\nvenue that ISC is partnering with.\n\n155\n00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,361\nAnd you register online through them.\n\n156\n00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:27,732\nYou have to create a account and\n\n157\n00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:30,849\nthey have certain secure testing\ncenters scattered around the U.S.\n\n158\n00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,349\nthat will allow you to effectively do\nthat and actually through out the world.\n\n159\n00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:35,753\nSo you can go in and do that.\n\n160\n00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:37,855\nAll the information you need\nis right there on the site.\n\n161\n00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,895\nThat's pearsonview.com/isc2.\n\n162\n00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:43,745\nYeah, I just couldn't\nremember what the URL was.\n\n163\n00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:45,335\nSo you can see it there, and\nit'll take you through and\n\n164\n00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:46,825\nlet you sign in and do all that.\n\n165\n00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:50,560\nSo, just to give you the background\non where to go, the actual nuts and\n\n166\n00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,940\nbolts of the exam.\n\n167\n00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,490\nThe exam is up to six hours in length,\n\n168\n00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,970\n250 questions, multiple-choice and\nscenario-based, so just be aware of that.\n\n169\n00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,380\nIt is done online so\nyou have to book basically an entire day\n\n170\n00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,390\nto go do this exam, so\njust be aware of that.\n\n171\n00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,910\nYou will get your results in real time.\n\n172\n00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,380\nWhen you're done you'll find out pass or\nfail right there.\n\n173\n00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,050\nHopefully it will be pass once\nyou go through it the first time.\n\n174\n00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,780\nAnd the exam is costing just around $500\nnow for you to be able to go in and do, so\n\n175\n00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,660\njust be aware of that also, all right?\n\n176\n00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,510\nSo there are kind of a set of question\ntypes that we just want to make you aware\n\n177\n00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,572\nof in the sense of understanding kind\nof questions you may approach and\n\n178\n00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:26,750\nmay be approached with in the exam.\n\n179\n00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,750\nI will break them up in a couple\ndifferent categories and\n\n180\n00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,580\njust walk through the conceptual\nidea of what they are.\n\n181\n00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,350\nI would call the first ones\ndetailed knowledge questions.\n\n182\n00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,238\nMeaning you're going to be asked\nto basically go in depth and\n\n183\n00:07:36,238 --> 00:07:38,795\ndescribe the technology or\nprinciple at some level.\n\n184\n00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:43,322\nSo something like maybe, what level\nthe OSI model can something happen at or\n\n185\n00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:45,029\nwhere something happen at.\n\n186\n00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:47,587\nFor instance you know what\nlevel can a packet be\n\n187\n00:07:47,587 --> 00:07:50,020\ncorrected on the bit\nlevel on the OSI model.\n\n188\n00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,220\nMaybe a question you would see.\n\n189\n00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:51,895\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so\n\n190\n00:07:51,895 --> 00:07:54,053\nwe want to make sure we understand\nwhat level that occurs at.\n\n191\n00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:56,573\nIs it level two, level three,\nlevel four whatever So\n\n192\n00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:59,324\nthis is what we would call\na detailed knowledge question.\n\n193\n00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:02,955\nKnowledge of the model in this case,\nwhat happens in the model.\n\n194\n00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:04,570\n>> Right.\n>> What goes on at those levels\n\n195\n00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,570\nis gonna be the key to being successful.\n\n196\n00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,070\nSo detail knowledge questions,\n\n197\n00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,610\nyou're gonna want to make sure\nyou understand those, and\n\n198\n00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,600\nyou've mastered that knowledge to really\nthen understand how to approach answering.\n\n199\n00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,590\nThe next kind of category,\nnext grouping of questions.\n\n200\n00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,570\nWill be something I would\ncall sub set questions.\n\n201\n00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,139\nSo this is where at least two of the\nanswers are right on the group of four,\n\n202\n00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:26,480\ntypically that you are presented with.\n\n203\n00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,542\nBut one of them is gonna be\nmore right than the other.\n\n204\n00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:30,415\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So yeah,\n\n205\n00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:33,880\nwe'll say typically there's one\nright answer on the screen.\n\n206\n00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,988\nBut there could be more\nthan one right answer.\n\n207\n00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:37,928\n>> Right.\n>> The question is which one is the most\n\n208\n00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:39,650\nright that we are looking for.\n\n209\n00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,320\nAnd what we say is most right is what we\nmean is typically we call this, I tend to\n\n210\n00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,510\ncall this a roll up question when I\ndiscuss this with students and I teach.\n\n211\n00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,650\nMeaning if it is the broadest of\nthe answers that we think is right,\n\n212\n00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,755\nthe other answer although it is\nright can exist up underneath it.\n\n213\n00:08:54,755 --> 00:08:57,060\n>> Right.\n>> It can be rolled up underneath it.\n\n214\n00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,245\nThen I would go with the broader one.\n\n215\n00:08:58,245 --> 00:08:59,310\n>> Right.\n>> I would go with the one that is\n\n216\n00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,820\nthe broadest because it is the most right.\n\n217\n00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,857\nBecause it encompasses the other one and\nso I would call this like a roll up or\n\n218\n00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:05,700\na sub set type.\n\n219\n00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:08,855\nSo we wanna make sure\nthat we're aware of this,\n\n220\n00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:11,355\nbecause this type of question\nis often asked on the exam.\n\n221\n00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:15,075\nYou will see a lot of questions where the\nwording is going to imply that there could\n\n222\n00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,565\nbe more than one right answer.\n\n223\n00:09:16,565 --> 00:09:18,265\n>> Right.\n>> Your mind is gonna kinda tell you hey,\n\n224\n00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:19,850\nI think there's more than one here.\n\n225\n00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,900\nAnd if we can roll one up under the other,\ngo with that one.\n\n226\n00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,160\nRight?\nNo urban myths and\n\n227\n00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,770\nlegends by the way about\nthe right answer always being C.\n\n228\n00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,210\nRight?\nOr making a smiley face or\n\n229\n00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,700\nanything like that.\n\n230\n00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,220\nWhatever that is we don't care about that.\n\n231\n00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,194\nWe just want to make sure we get the\nbroadest answer possible as being right.\n\n232\n00:09:35,194 --> 00:09:37,660\n>> Right.\n>> Third one I would say is around\n\n233\n00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,518\ntoo much information.\n\n234\n00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:41,050\nRight?\nThey're gonna try to flood you with all\n\n235\n00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,480\nthis extraneous stuff in the question\nto make you go off on a tangent.\n\n236\n00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,690\nAnd, by the way, the wrong answers have\nbeen crafted, so if you go down that\n\n237\n00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,135\nalley, pull that information in,\nyou're gonna get the wrong answer there.\n\n238\n00:09:51,135 --> 00:09:53,310\n>> Right.\n>> We want to grab the right answer.\n\n239\n00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,050\nWanna to so by zeroing in on the the most\ncritical elements of the question.\n\n240\n00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,630\nSo I call this Critical Reading, or\nI call these Critical Reading Questions.\n\n241\n00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,400\nBecause you have to separate the fluff,\nthe garbage,\n\n242\n00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,955\nby critical reading from what's really\ncritical to answer the question.\n\n243\n00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:08,700\n>> Right.\n>> And so\n\n244\n00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,642\nif they have these long-winded paragraphs.\n\n245\n00:10:10,642 --> 00:10:12,400\nRight?\nWhere they go through, and\n\n246\n00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,195\nthey ask you or tell you a whole\nbunch of stuff, a whole story.\n\n247\n00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:16,410\n>> Yeah.\n>> But there's only one or\n\n248\n00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,890\ntwo lines that are really critical.\n\n249\n00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,480\nSally went to the store,\nit was a bright, sunny day.\n\n250\n00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,370\nShe road her blue bike and\nshe had her pink helmet on, but\n\n251\n00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,530\nher mother gave her only $2.50 and\nshe had a list of five things to buy.\n\n252\n00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,005\nWell, what's critical there?\n\n253\n00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:31,175\n>> Right.\n>> Went to the store,\n\n254\n00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:32,015\n$2.50, five things to buy.\n\n255\n00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:33,740\n>> Right.\n>> The fact that she had the colored\n\n256\n00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,640\nthing going on?\n\n257\n00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,620\nTotally irrelevant, right,\nwe just don't care.\n\n258\n00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,337\nBright sunny day, who cares, good for\nher, really not important for you unless\n\n259\n00:10:40,337 --> 00:10:43,890\nthe questions all about what kind of\nweather was there on her way to the store,\n\n260\n00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,881\nin which case, then I'm 100% wrong.\n\n261\n00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:47,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And, you should just go off and\n\n262\n00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:50,680\nanswer that question\nthe way you normally would.\n\n263\n00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,440\nBut since it's not normally\ngonna be about weather.\n\n264\n00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,280\n>> Right.\n\n265\n00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,150\n>> That's what we call an Extraneous Fact.\n\n266\n00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,470\nIt is designed to trick you\nto draw your attention away\n\n267\n00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,320\nfrom the most important elements that\nare buried somewhere in the narrative.\n\n268\n00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,140\nSo you have to understand\nhow to read critically.\n\n269\n00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,890\nIt's very very important to do that.\n\n270\n00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,700\nSo a lot of times you'll see a lot\nof numbers in a question like this.\n\n271\n00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,830\nA lot of detail being\nthrown all over the place.\n\n272\n00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,050\nNarrow your focus,\n\n273\n00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,150\nclear your mind, sit down, read that\nquestion, make sure you understand it.\n\n274\n00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,958\nIf you have to read it twice,\nread it twice.\n\n275\n00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:22,130\nThe two probably most important pieces\nof advise I can offer you about getting\n\n276\n00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,232\nready for an exam like this is clearly\nfirst and foremost time management.\n\n277\n00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:26,960\nRight?\nGot\n\n278\n00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,875\nto know where you are at\nall times around the clock.\n\n279\n00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,850\n>> Yeah.\n>> The clock is in the upper right\n\n280\n00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,740\ntypically or upper left of your screen.\n\n281\n00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,650\nIt's gonna be ticking down to zero.\n\n282\n00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,035\nDoesn't tick up to six hours,\nticks down to zero.\n\n283\n00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:40,030\n>> Right.\n>> In the case of the SSCP,\n\n284\n00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,718\nit's three hours.\n\n285\n00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:43,160\nSo, it's gonna tick down\nto zero from 180 minutes.\n\n286\n00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,230\nSo you have to keep an eye on the clock.\n\n287\n00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,310\nThe other thing is, you are not gonna\nrun out of time, if you're smart.\n\n288\n00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,670\nAnd I often tell my student this,\nand you gotta know this.\n\n289\n00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,020\nYou gotta believe.\n\n290\n00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,040\nYou just gotta believe.\n\n291\n00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,540\nRight?\n\n292\n00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,520\nIf you just believe, it'll be okay.\n\n293\n00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,180\nIf you can manage your time effectively,\nand\n\n294\n00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,720\ndo what I'm about to share\nwith you as a thought process.\n\n295\n00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,060\nYou are not gonna run out of time, but\nyou gotta believe you're not going to, or\n\n296\n00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,860\nyou're gonna wind up thinking you will and\n\n297\n00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,090\nof course we kind of know we psych\nourselves into doing things.\n\n298\n00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,390\n>> Yup.\n>> And all of sudden we are kind of in our\n\n299\n00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,070\nmind thinking we are going\nto run out of time.\n\n300\n00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:15,832\nI mean all of a sudden boom.\n\n301\n00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:17,490\n>> Sure enough.\n>> There's the clock, it's run out and\n\n302\n00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,740\nwe didn't know where the time went.\n\n303\n00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:24,880\nSo you're gonna go through and\nyou're gonna do three passes.\n\n304\n00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,540\nThree.\n\n305\n00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,070\nThree separate passes on this exam.\n\n306\n00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:29,320\nLet me share with you this methodology.\n\n307\n00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,960\nSo you're gonna go through the first time,\nwhether it's the SSCP for\n\n308\n00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,830\n125 questions which is what\nthe bank is for the exam.\n\n309\n00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,010\nOr it is CISSP with 250 questions.\n\n310\n00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,600\nObviously, half\nthe questions half the time,\n\n311\n00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,200\ndouble the questions double the time.\n\n312\n00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,690\nDoesn't really matter.\n\n313\n00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,960\nWhatever it is, you're gonna go through,\nfirst pass and this is electronic so\n\n314\n00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,840\nyou're sitting in front\nof a computer screen.\n\n315\n00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,400\nYou're gonna be able to mark questions and\ncome back to them.\n\n316\n00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,200\nSo what that means is,\nyou're gonna go through.\n\n317\n00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,840\nYou're gonna read each question,\nyou've got to read each question,\n\n318\n00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,130\nat least one time.\n\n319\n00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,590\nMake sure you understand what\nyou're being asked to answer.\n\n320\n00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,650\nIf you have to read it twice, do that.\n\n321\n00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,900\nAnd then, intelligently,\n\n322\n00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,280\nlogically, thoughtfully,\nanswer that question if you can.\n\n323\n00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,360\nIf you've answered it and\nyou know for a fact you're done...\n\n324\n00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,920\nMark that question in your mind.\n\n325\n00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,030\nSomehow come up with a plan.\n\n326\n00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,780\nNow there's different ways to do this.\n\n327\n00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:19,660\nWhen it was paper based, I used to tell\nmy students use a system like circles for\n\n328\n00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,025\nones you have to go back to, scratch\nthrough the ones you're good, whatever.\n\n329\n00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:24,030\n>> Right.\n>> You're not gonna do that in\n\n330\n00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,100\nthis kind of exam.\n\n331\n00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,880\nThe ones you're gonna mark are gonna be\nthe ones that you have to come back to\n\n332\n00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,050\nthat you haven't answered.\n\n333\n00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:31,230\nSo you are given scratch paper.\n\n334\n00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,350\nYou can, if you want, just make notes\nof the numbers that you're good with.\n\n335\n00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,700\nWhat I typically tell people is\ndon't even bother with that.\n\n336\n00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,465\nJust don't mark the ones that you've\nalready answered and you're good with.\n\n337\n00:13:39,465 --> 00:13:41,140\n>> Right.\n>> And only mark the ones that you've got\n\n338\n00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,740\nto come back to.\n\n339\n00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,830\nThat way the ones that don't\nshow up on the review for\n\n340\n00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,680\nitems marked are the ones\nyou've already answered.\n\n341\n00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,260\nSo, I would make one\npass through the exam,\n\n342\n00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,010\nknock off as many as you can\nknock off in that first pass.\n\n343\n00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:56,640\nAnd at that point you're probably\nsomewhere around the 70 to 75,\n\n344\n00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,880\nmaybe 80% mark, hopefully.\n\n345\n00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,550\nMeaning you've answered about 70 to 80%\nof the questions in that first run.\n\n346\n00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,310\nSo that'll give you\nsomewhere around a quarter,\n\n347\n00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,920\nmaybe less than a quarter, one fifth,\nsomething like that, left.\n\n348\n00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,670\nSo what you're then gonna do is,\nyou may get up take a quick break,\n\n349\n00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,140\ngo to the bathroom at that point.\n\n350\n00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:11,650\nIt's up to you.\n\n351\n00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,580\nIf you're doing the SSCP Exam,\nthree hours.\n\n352\n00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,570\nI would suggest that you\ndon't get out of your seat.\n\n353\n00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You have to\n\n354\n00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,600\nfigure out a way to go through it,\nto just get through it in three hours.\n\n355\n00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,860\nMake sure you go to\nthe bathroom right before.\n\n356\n00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,650\nDon't drink anything right before.\n\n357\n00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:26,460\nAnd, just make sure you go in there and\ntake care of business.\n\n358\n00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,383\nDon't get out of your chair.\n\n359\n00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:29,440\n>> Right.\n>> Cuz the process of taking a break\n\n360\n00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,080\nis gonna eat up several minutes,\nand that's time you need.\n\n361\n00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,050\nIn the CISSP exam,\nyou have a lot more time to play with.\n\n362\n00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,530\nYou may want to think about getting up,\ntaking a small break halfway through.\n\n363\n00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:38,870\nBut that's up to you.\n\n364\n00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,560\nBut with a three hour exam,\nI would stay put.\n\n365\n00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,520\nI would just get done and\nget out of the chair when you're finished.\n\n366\n00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,250\nSo I would do that first pass.\n\n367\n00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,430\nI would then go back.\n\n368\n00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,140\nRight?\n\n369\n00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,380\nI would look at all the ones that I marked\nthat I did not answer on the first try.\n\n370\n00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,832\nAnd the trick there with answering\nthem successfully is the following.\n\n371\n00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:55,600\nYou're gonna read the question,\nthink through the answer,\n\n372\n00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,300\ndecide whether you can answer it or not.\n\n373\n00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,320\nDon't spend more than about 30 seconds\ntrying to figure out an answer.\n\n374\n00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,195\n>> Right.\n>> If you can't come up with it in 30\n\n375\n00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,230\nseconds, you're not\n\n376\n00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,095\ngonna answer that question no matter how\nmuch time you spend on it right now.\n\n377\n00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:09,055\n>> Right.\n>> So as a result, mark it and move on.\n\n378\n00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:13,690\nThis is gonna optimize you to focus on\nthe ones you can knock-off right away.\n\n379\n00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:16,480\nGet through all of those,\nwhich is the bulk of the exam.\n\n380\n00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,300\nRight?\nThen you're gonna come back and\n\n381\n00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,970\nhave somewhere between a half to\nmaybe a quarter of your time left,\n\n382\n00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,310\nif you do it the right way.\n\n383\n00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,610\nAnd as a result of that, you're now gonna\ngo back and be able to spend a minute or\n\n384\n00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,930\ntwo on these questions.\n\n385\n00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,030\nYou've already read once.\n\n386\n00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,580\n>> Right.\n>> You got to read them again,\n\n387\n00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,330\nnow you're going to take your time and\ntry to figure out which ones\n\n388\n00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:37,370\nare the ones you have to answer, which are\nthe ones you can ignore in the sense of\n\n389\n00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,530\nwhich answers are wrong, and you're\ngonna agonize your way through that.\n\n390\n00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,115\nNow again, time management.\n\n391\n00:15:42,115 --> 00:15:44,865\nDon't spend more than a minute on\nthese questions at this point.\n\n392\n00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:49,004\nIf you can't answer them at that point,\nleave the check mark marked.\n\n393\n00:15:49,004 --> 00:15:51,748\nWhen you answer this question,\nuncheck it, so it no longer is marked,\n\n394\n00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:53,601\nit goes into the okay\nI've answered it column.\n\n395\n00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:54,577\n>> Right.\n\n396\n00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:56,086\nSecond pass through the exam.\n\n397\n00:15:56,086 --> 00:15:58,635\nYou're gonna hopefully eliminate\nthree quarters of the ones that were\n\n398\n00:15:58,635 --> 00:15:59,150\non that list.\n\n399\n00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,580\nYou're down to a small pool.\n\n400\n00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,950\nMaybe 15, 20, 25 questions,\nsomething like that.\n\n401\n00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,510\nThird pass.\n\n402\n00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,790\nKeeping an eye on the clock.\n\n403\n00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,780\nThese are the questions that you probably\njust don't really know the answers to,\n\n404\n00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,789\nno matter how hard you try.\n\n405\n00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:14,090\nYou're gonna agonize, but you're never\ngonna be confident about answering.\n\n406\n00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,050\nSo I'm not suggesting you guess.\n\n407\n00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,730\nWhat I am suggesting is that you\neliminate the obvious wrongs,\n\n408\n00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,860\nin every answer block that you get.\n\n409\n00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,850\nAnd then based on what's left,\nmake the best possible choice, and\n\n410\n00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,860\ndo your best to answer as\nmany as you can correctly.\n\n411\n00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,645\nThe trick is don't leave\nany questions unanswered.\n\n412\n00:16:30,645 --> 00:16:34,085\nBecause for a fact, every one you\nleave unanswered is one you got wrong.\n\n413\n00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:34,860\n>> Yeah.\n\n414\n00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,870\n>> Let me put it that way.\n\n415\n00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,660\nSo answer them all.\n\n416\n00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,770\nEven if you've gotta guess.\n\n417\n00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,600\nAnswer them.\n\n418\n00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,180\nThe worse that will happen\nis you're still getting it\n\n419\n00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:40,780\nwrong-\n>> Right.\n\n420\n00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,435\n>> But it's no more wrong,\nif you guess than if you leave it blank.\n\n421\n00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:44,180\n>> Right.\n\n422\n00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,490\n>> But if you don't answer it,\nthe only thing you can be assured of,\n\n423\n00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,670\nis that you're not gonna get credit for\nthat question.\n\n424\n00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,870\nSo make sure you know that.\n\n425\n00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,600\nUnderstand also that we've\nseen questions on these exams.\n\n426\n00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,928\nMeaning of the 125, 250 you get,\n\n427\n00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:59,600\nsomewhere between 10 to 20,\nmaybe 25 questions, depending on\n\n428\n00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,690\nthe exam are gonna be questions that\nare not counted towards your total.\n\n429\n00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,340\nThey are new exam questions,\nnew exam types that are being seated.\n\n430\n00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:11,380\nThey are being entered there for\nyou to try out in effect a blind test.\n\n431\n00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,790\nYou don't know which ones they are.\n\n432\n00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,545\nBut you're not being held accountable for\nthem.\n\n433\n00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:16,040\n>> Right.\n>> So out of that 125,\n\n434\n00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,329\nyou may really only have 115 questions\nthat are scored is what I'm getting at,\n\n435\n00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,455\nbut you don't know which ones they are.\n\n436\n00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:24,460\nYou don't know how many there are?\n\n437\n00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,990\nSo you have to answer them all, but\nthe pool is actually smaller than that.\n\n438\n00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,545\nAnd so then, you have to go through and\nyou gotta get a 700 out of 1,000.\n\n439\n00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:35,200\n70% overall to pass the exam.\n\n440\n00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,850\nThat's the cut score.\n\n441\n00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,990\nSo if you can answer 70% of those\nquestions correctly, and you know for\n\n442\n00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,870\na fact two hours in you've got 70% right,\nguess what?\n\n443\n00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,483\nYou're done.\n\n444\n00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:46,250\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Go home.\n\n445\n00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,430\nIf you're that good.\n\n446\n00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,165\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n447\n00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:52,390\n>> As Client Eastwood would say,\nare you feeling lucky, punk?\n\n448\n00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,370\n>> No.\n\n449\n00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,960\n>> Are you?\n\n450\n00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,400\nSo it's much better when Dirty Harry\ndoes it, than when I do it but\n\n451\n00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,750\nyou get the general idea.\n\n452\n00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,292\nSo if you're that good, awesome.\n\n453\n00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:06,552\nFor 500 bucks you like to gamble, get out\nof the chair, hit the I'm Done button,\n\n454\n00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:07,220\ngo find out.\n\n455\n00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,230\nSpin the wheel.\n\n456\n00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:12,700\nBut if you're not that confident, and I\ndon't know anybody that's that confident,\n\n457\n00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,460\nthen you wanna make sure you\ntake the full measure of time.\n\n458\n00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,960\nThere's no awarded medal for\nfinishing quickly.\n\n459\n00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,499\n>> Right.\n>> The only medal you get is for\n\n460\n00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:21,956\nfinishing correctly-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n461\n00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:22,571\n>> And that is for\n\n462\n00:18:22,571 --> 00:18:24,230\ngetting your certification.\n\n463\n00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,100\nAnd nobody knows your score but\nyou, by the way.\n\n464\n00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,520\nAnd you don't even know your score,\nyou just know you passed or failed.\n\n465\n00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,380\nYou'll know a score, but you're not\nreally gonna know what that means.\n\n466\n00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,110\nSo you're gonna know you passed.\n\n467\n00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,970\nBack in the day, when this was all paper\nbased, you got a letter in the mail and\n\n468\n00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,340\nan email basically said,\nhey congratulations.\n\n469\n00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,910\nAnd that's basically what it is.\n\n470\n00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,100\nSo you don't know your score,\nand it doesn't really matter.\n\n471\n00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,500\nThe point is, you know you passed.\n\n472\n00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,520\nAnd so that's the goal, is to pass.\n\n473\n00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,390\nSo understand, how to manage your time.\n\n474\n00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,110\nUnderstand how to answer\nthese question types.\n\n475\n00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,880\nThe other type, the fourth type,\nthat I wanted to talk about,\n\n476\n00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,678\nis this idea of simulation questions.\n\n477\n00:18:55,678 --> 00:19:00,230\nYou're gonna get these\nconceptual simulations,\n\n478\n00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,700\nwhat we call scenario questions.\n\n479\n00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,570\nThey're not simulations.\n\n480\n00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,350\nYou're not going and\nphysically doing something.\n\n481\n00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,927\nThey're conceptual simulation,\nmeaning they're scenario questions.\n\n482\n00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:10,179\nYou're gonna be given a scenario, and\nyou are gonna be painted a picture,\n\n483\n00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:12,160\na couple paragraphs of information.\n\n484\n00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,340\nAnd there will be a bank of questions,\nfour, five, six or\n\n485\n00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,610\nseven, married to this scenario that you\nhave to answer based on all the facts.\n\n486\n00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,370\nAnd so\nthis is a relatively new type of testing\n\n487\n00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,980\nquestion given the fact we\nmoved to electronic format.\n\n488\n00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,070\nThe last couple years,\nthis is what we're seeing.\n\n489\n00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,390\nAnd so these scenario questions\nare becoming very big,\n\n490\n00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,070\na very big part of the exam.\n\n491\n00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,070\nYou are gonna see them, and\nyou do have to be prepared to answer them.\n\n492\n00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,130\nGo and read scenario questions.\n\n493\n00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,520\nFind them offline,\nin review books, et cetera.\n\n494\n00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,170\nGet familiar with the types of\nquestions that are being offered.\n\n495\n00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:44,100\nGet familiar with the ways\nto deal with them.\n\n496\n00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,400\nWith scenario questions,\nwhat I often recommend is,\n\n497\n00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,750\nyou have to make the critical information\nto understand how to answer them.\n\n498\n00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,560\nScenario typically, is available to\nyou as you answer each question,\n\n499\n00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,460\nyou can refer to it.\n\n500\n00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,720\nThere's like, a little pull-out tab.\n\n501\n00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,080\nYou go back and see-\n>> Bring a backup.\n\n502\n00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,138\n>> It much like you have in the in\nthe Microsoft exam, things like that.\n\n503\n00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:02,740\nSo you could see it, but\nyou have to keep referring back to it.\n\n504\n00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,520\nSo you do have typically, some notepaper,\na dry-erase board or whatever.\n\n505\n00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,910\nYou may want to jot down some quick facts.\n\n506\n00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,250\nBut just kind of keep it straight,\nso you don't mix your scenarios up.\n\n507\n00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,181\nOtherwise, you wind up answering.\n\n508\n00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:13,501\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Oh yeah, no, it was this!\n\n509\n00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:15,092\nAnd it's all garbled up.\n\n510\n00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:17,330\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So just be aware of that.\n\n511\n00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,260\nThere are no interactive questions in the\nsense you're going to be shown something,\n\n512\n00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,100\nyou have to do something,\ndoesn't exist on this kind of an exam.\n\n513\n00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,450\nIt's all multiple choice in your questions\nthat have to deal with just scenarios and\n\n514\n00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,450\nthings of that nature.\n\n515\n00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,260\nSometimes you get these really\nstraightforward questions.\n\n516\n00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,510\nJust what I call them as so\n\n517\n00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,904\nobvious questions-\n>> Right.\n\n518\n00:20:32,904 --> 00:20:34,600\n>> Because literally they are.\n\n519\n00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600\nWhat is letter two of the OECD Model?\n\n520\n00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,110\nIt's just one of those so obvious ones,\nyou're almost looking at it going,\n\n521\n00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,715\nno, I've looked under the table.\n\n522\n00:20:41,715 --> 00:20:43,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Where's the camera?\n\n523\n00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,190\nYou guys are kidding me, right?\n\n524\n00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,460\nThis is like a question, if I don't answer\nthe wrong way or the right way I fail,\n\n525\n00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,310\nand there's no way to answer it.\n\n526\n00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,010\nNo, it's not that.\n\n527\n00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,200\nSometimes, and\nI'm not saying there's a lot of these, but\n\n528\n00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,520\nyou may get a few in your exam depending\non the pool where they just really are so\n\n529\n00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,488\nobvious, you're almost\nsecond-guessing yourself.\n\n530\n00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:01,130\n>> Right.\n>> Don't second-guess yourself.\n\n531\n00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,190\nThey are obvious, and\nit's just the way it is.\n\n532\n00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,460\nThey're kind of a give me,\nbut you get a few of those.\n\n533\n00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,180\nSo be aware of that and never,\nnever second guess yourself.\n\n534\n00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,780\n>> Right.\n>> Don't change those answers.\n\n535\n00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,490\nCan't stress that strongly enough.\n\n536\n00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,837\nPeople that change answers tend to fail.\n\n537\n00:21:15,837 --> 00:21:17,200\n>> Yep.\n\n538\n00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,840\n>> Believe it or\nnot your subconscious mind,\n\n539\n00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,095\ndoes a really good job of jumping in\nthere and saving you from yourself.\n\n540\n00:21:22,095 --> 00:21:23,650\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And it knows the answer,\n\n541\n00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,650\nit's kinda thinking through and\n\n542\n00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,130\nit goes oh yeah, I know it, Adam kept\ntalking about that it's layer two.\n\n543\n00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,080\nThrows it out there, although you may\nnot consciously realize what it is.\n\n544\n00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,860\nBut it's paying attention, it's the note\ntaker that's in there when you're not.\n\n545\n00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,230\nSo go with your gut, so to speak,\ndon't change those answers.\n\n546\n00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,310\nThe only time, the only time I ever tell\nstudents it's okay to change an answer,\n\n547\n00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,350\nis if you see a question later on,\nand you may get this.\n\n548\n00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:51,390\nYou may get a question like number 5, and\nthen your number 200 has the answer for\n\n549\n00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,730\nnumber 5, you just didn't know what it\nwas, you guessed, you weren't sure, you\n\n550\n00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,680\nremembered and go, oh my God, wait no that\nquestion clearly says it's gonna be this.\n\n551\n00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,470\nAnd you go back and you change it, but\n\n552\n00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:05,560\nunless it's one of those where it's\nA equals B, and B tells you what A is.\n\n553\n00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,570\nAnd it's very rare,\n\n554\n00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,310\nbecause the science writing exams, it's\nthe science making sure we don't expose\n\n555\n00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:15,110\nanswers on those other questions that\ntell you how to answer other ones.\n\n556\n00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,020\nSo that we don't give you those hints.\n\n557\n00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,180\nIt's called psychometrics,\n\n558\n00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,360\nthe whole idea of understanding how to all\nthis, measuring the metrics around it.\n\n559\n00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,620\nTypically, very rare do you see\nthat on occasion, yeah maybe,\n\n560\n00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,710\nevery once in a while you do.\n\n561\n00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,900\nIf you see that, that's the only time, the\nonly time that it's okay, to go back and\n\n562\n00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,190\nthink about changing an answer.\n\n563\n00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,550\nWhen you have irrefutable proof in\n\n564\n00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,510\nanother question-\n>> Right.\n\n565\n00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,290\n>> That it is gonna be a different\nway than you put it on paper.\n\n566\n00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,350\nBut other than that,\ndo not change answers.\n\n567\n00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,990\nChances are good you're actually\ntaking the right answer off.\n\n568\n00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:44,340\nAnd putting in, potentially,\nwhat is gonna be a wrong answer.\n\n569\n00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:46,940\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n570\n00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,080\nSo hopefully this little run through, has\nhelped you to get some perspective, and\n\n571\n00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,300\nby the way, same conceptual ideas for\nSSCP and CISSP.\n\n572\n00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,660\nIt doesn't matter which of\nthe two tests you're doing.\n\n573\n00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,870\nThe framework is the same.\n\n574\n00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,510\nThe number of questions is as we said,\nhalf for SSCP, amount of time is half, but\n\n575\n00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,190\nit's the same concept, you're sitting in a\nroom answering questions under the gun so\n\n576\n00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,910\nto speak, for three to six hours.\n\n577\n00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,500\nHaving to get at least 70%\nright in order to pass.\n\n578\n00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,480\nAnd you're gonna have\nthe same kind of questions,\n\n579\n00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,790\nthroughout that experience that\nwe just talked about here.\n\n580\n00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:17,170\nRight, the roll ups,\nthe very technically difficult questions,\n\n581\n00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,210\nthe questions that may be so\nobvious sometimes,\n\n582\n00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:23,090\nthat they trick you into thinking\nthey're not really that easy.\n\n583\n00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,060\nSo just think about different categories.\n\n584\n00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:28,280\nMake sure you are thinking through,\nhow to deal with those?\n\n585\n00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,920\nPractice, definitely important.\n\n586\n00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,030\nPractice going through exam questions.\n\n587\n00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,940\nThere is lots of review material out\nthere, we talked about the study scope.\n\n588\n00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,530\nOption with ISC Squared.\n\n589\n00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,880\nThere are books out there\nthat have review questions.\n\n590\n00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,780\nThere are websites out there that\nmay be of interest to you also.\n\n591\n00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,314\nDo me a favor.\nOne other\n\n592\n00:23:42,314 --> 00:23:42,814\nwebsite\n>> Yep.\n\n593\n00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:44,670\n>> That I wanna bring up for everybody.\n\n594\n00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,130\nWill be valuable for you.\n\n595\n00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:46,959\nJust go if you could.\n\n596\n00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,245\nC-C cure.\n\n597\n00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:49,119\nSo three c's.\n\n598\n00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,007\nC-C-C cure.\n\n599\n00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:53,963\nC-C-C-U-R-E.org, I believe it is.\n\n600\n00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,440\n>> One too many C's.\n\n601\n00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,410\n>> Not four.\nYeah, there we go, cccure.org, and\n\n602\n00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,890\nI think it's dot org.\n\n603\n00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,528\nThere we go.\n\n604\n00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:03,090\nYeah.\n\n605\n00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:08,948\nSo cccure.org, CCCure is gonna be another\none that has really good online resources,\n\n606\n00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:12,920\nobviously, they've got a bunch\nof different stuff here.\n\n607\n00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,739\nThey've grown a lot, they used to be\nreally focused primarily around CISSP and\n\n608\n00:24:16,739 --> 00:24:18,910\nsecurity, but there's other stuff there.\n\n609\n00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:23,560\nBut a really good reference site for you,\ncould be helpful for you as a resource.\n\n610\n00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,850\nAnd they do have study books and\nguides and test questions.\n\n611\n00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:32,510\nThere's all sorts of stuff, tutorials\nthere, quizzes, so also very good for\n\n612\n00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,330\nyou to take a look at.\n\n613\n00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,250\nCould be a really good site for\nyou to get some questions from.\n\n614\n00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,600\nTypically one you often\nhear people talk about.\n\n615\n00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,140\nWhen they talked about, hey,\nwhere am I gonna get questions?\n\n616\n00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,980\nHow am I studying?\n\n617\n00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,320\nThey often talk about this site.\n\n618\n00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,660\nIt's very well-known, been around for\na long time, very reputable.\n\n619\n00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,310\nSo maybe a site that may\nbe valuable to you as well.\n\n620\n00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,170\n>> Very good.\n\n621\n00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,230\nVery good.\n\n622\n00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,848\n>> All right. Yep. >> All right.\n\n623\n00:24:50,848 --> 00:24:52,360\nWell, Adam I sure do\nappreciate that information.\n\n624\n00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,910\nI hope you guys appreciate it as well.\n\n625\n00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,090\nThat should give you a little bit\nof a what to do, like Adam said.\n\n626\n00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,340\nBut when you get done\nwatching these videos.\n\n627\n00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,200\nWatching all these episodes.\n\n628\n00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,700\nGoing back and studying.\n\n629\n00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,980\nHow do I get ready to actually sign up and\ntake that exam?\n\n630\n00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,670\nSure do appreciate your time and\nyour information.\n\n631\n00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:12,089\nYou guys, stay tuned for\nmore specials coming your way.\n\n632\n00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:15,294\n[MUSIC]\n\n633\n00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:19,083\n[SOUND]\n\n",

00:00:37,980\nAnd welcome back!\n\n4\n00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,440\nTo another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,200\nI'm your host Don Pezet,\ntoday with Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n6\n00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,030\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n7\n00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,130\n>> Good, good.\nHowdy, everybody.\n\n8\n00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,610\n>> It's another bright, sunshiney day,\n\n9\n00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,720\nand we are gonna spend it\ntrapped in this dark studio.\n\n10\n00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,780\n>> I was gonna say,\nit's not sunny in here.\n\n11\n00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,630\nIt's bright, but it's not sunny.\n\n12\n00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,780\n>> So we are gonna be diving right\nback into the world of CISSP and\n\n13\n00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,170\nprobably one of the more important\ntopics for any security professional,\n\n14\n00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,750\nwhich is access control right?\n\n15\n00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,110\nHow do we keep people out and\n\n16\n00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,200\nallow people in without compromising\nthe security and integrity of our data?\n\n17\n00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,290\nSo big topic, very important and something\nwe're gonna spend a good bit of time on.\n\n18\n00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,295\nSo Adam where do we\nwanna start on this one?\n\n19\n00:01:16,295 --> 00:01:20,124\n>> Well we wanna start talking about just,\nand you set the stage for\n\n20\n00:01:20,124 --> 00:01:23,970\nus properly in a sense of talking about\nthe over all concept which is keep people\n\n21\n00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,780\nout or allow people in based on\nwhat it is that they're doing,\n\n22\n00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,750\nwhat it is that the owner\nof the data is gonna want\n\n23\n00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,462\nthem to be able to do versus\nperhaps what bad people want to do.\n\n24\n00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:39,390\nAnd so we have three categories, three\nthings we want to think about as we start\n\n25\n00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,220\ntalking about access controls which will\nbe ownership of data, who owns the data,\n\n26\n00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,210\nwho has the rights to it, and\nas a result who gets to control\n\n27\n00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,590\naccess at some level is based on\nmodels that we will talk about.\n\n28\n00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,500\nThings like discretionary access control\nversus mandatory access control.\n\n29\n00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,952\nWe'll deal with who the data owner is and\nwhat kind of access they will grant.\n\n30\n00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:03,140\nWe will talk about the people that\nuse the data, so who are going\n\n31\n00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:08,270\nto be the consumers of the data that\nthe owner is gonna set up access for.\n\n32\n00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,622\nAnd then we want to focus\non as a third audience, or\n\n33\n00:02:10,622 --> 00:02:14,430\nat least as a third way of thinking of\nthis, the people that don't belong there.\n\n34\n00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,570\nRight, if we know who does belong\nthere by extension we know who\n\n35\n00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,465\ndoesn't belong there.\n\n36\n00:02:18,465 --> 00:02:23,646\nRight so, I think about, growing up I used\nto watch, you may have done this as well,\n\n37\n00:02:23,646 --> 00:02:27,560\nI don't know, but many of us as kids,\ndepending on what era you grew up in,\n\n38\n00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,690\nyou would have seen Sesame Street,\nyou would've seen, in the US anyway,\n\n39\n00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,410\nthere was another one called the Electric\nCompany that was really, really big.\n\n40\n00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,930\nQue Pasa USA was really big here at\nleast in the US anyway in the 70's.\n\n41\n00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,290\nIt was also big in Latin America.\n\n42\n00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,960\nThese shows, when you grew up\nas a kid back during that time,\n\n43\n00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,650\nthey taught you skills about things like\nhow to count and all that kind of stuff.\n\n44\n00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,180\nAnd everybody knows Elmo today and\nthose kind of, the Muppets,\n\n45\n00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,760\nin general those kind of things.\n\n46\n00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,570\nBut, when you watched\nthose kind of shows and\n\n47\n00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,210\nSesame Street, another one I guess,\nthat also was a big one.\n\n48\n00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:08,165\nWe saw one of the episodes where one of\nthe things that they did I think it was\n\n49\n00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:11,255\nElmo that might have come out and done it,\nhe would do this matching thing and\n\n50\n00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:13,365\nbe like which one of these\nthings is not like the other?\n\n51\n00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:15,515\nWhich one of these things does not belong?\n\n52\n00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:19,435\nAnd so it was a lot more effective when\nyou were a kid singing along but anyway,\n\n53\n00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:22,205\nthe point is when we think about\nsecurity we think about which\n\n54\n00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:25,875\none of these things is in a group,\nwhich one of these things does belong?\n\n55\n00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,545\nWhich one of these things\nis not in a group,\n\n56\n00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:29,300\nwhich one of these things does not belong?\n\n57\n00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,390\nBecause that's really haw we start\nthinking about access control, right?\n\n58\n00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,420\nWho gets in, who doesn't get in is\ntypically based on role, based on group,\n\n59\n00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,100\nbased on a setting of some kind, and\nbased on the ownership of the data, and\n\n60\n00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,460\nthe visibility of what that data can and\ncannot do.\n\n61\n00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:46,940\nSo wanna have that kind of in our minds,\nright, as we think about this.\n\n62\n00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,190\nWe also want to be thinking about\nthe three pillars of information security\n\n63\n00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,080\nthat we always spend time talking about in\neach of these areas as we start to lay out\n\n64\n00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,020\nthe thoughts around things\nlike access control.\n\n65\n00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,790\nNo discussion would be complete\nunless we frame it in relation to\n\n66\n00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,170\nthe confidentiality of the data.\n\n67\n00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,194\nSo keeping data safe and secure for\npeople who do need to see it, but\n\n68\n00:04:07,194 --> 00:04:11,250\nkeeping it away from that third group of\npeople that shouldn't have access to it.\n\n69\n00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,270\nWe think about integrity of data, so,\nintegrity is gonna be making sure the data\n\n70\n00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:19,400\nhas not been modified,\nboth data at rest and data on the wire.\n\n71\n00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,010\nAnd then also availability of data.\n\n72\n00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,800\nMaking sure the data is\ngoing to be available\n\n73\n00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,620\nto that second group of people that\nare suppose to consume and use the data.\n\n74\n00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,560\nBut during the times and under the ways or\nthrough the mechanisms and\n\n75\n00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,150\nwith the proper controls in place\nthat the data owner has put there to\n\n76\n00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,020\nensure the confidentiality and\nto ensure the integrity of that data.\n\n77\n00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,300\nSo we always want to be\nfocused on thinking about and\n\n78\n00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,720\nunderstanding confidentiality, integrity,\nand availability as the framework\n\n79\n00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,360\nwith that integricity or something.\n\n80\n00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,818\n>> You could argue that maybe I don't\nuse the word integrity very much.\n\n81\n00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:00,105\n[LAUGH]\n>> Maybe you don't.\n\n82\n00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:01,820\nCould be a problem, right?\n\n83\n00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,630\nAlright, so keep an eye on\nthe vocabulary list as we go.\n\n84\n00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,390\nMake sure Don is a good actor.\n\n85\n00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,172\nRight, in the sense that he's\nspelling things correctly.\n\n86\n00:05:12,172 --> 00:05:16,230\nAll right, so we are talking about subject\nand object when we talk about data and\n\n87\n00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,400\naccess control.\n\n88\n00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,480\nSome other key terms that we want\nto make sure we're familiar with,\n\n89\n00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,200\nvery important kind of begins\nour discussion around data.\n\n90\n00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,940\nThe idea of the subject,\nthe subject is going to be the user.\n\n91\n00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,450\nSo when we think of the subject, we are\nthinking about effectively an end user or\n\n92\n00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,590\nanybody who wants to access the data.\n\n93\n00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,200\nAnd when we think about the object,\n\n94\n00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,720\nwe are thinking about the data typically\nthat the subject would like to see.\n\n95\n00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,030\nAnd so we often talk about access\ncontrol in terms of subjects and objects\n\n96\n00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,280\ninteracting with one another, and what\nlevel of access we are granting, right?\n\n97\n00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,610\nSo, we wanna make sure we understand\nthe vocabulary, the terminology,\n\n98\n00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,950\nbecause it is very important to us.\n\n99\n00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,790\nAnd a lot of these conversations will take\nplace in relation to subject and object.\n\n100\n00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,310\nWe'll be talking about that,\nso just be aware of that.\n\n101\n00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,690\nWe have different degrees of,\nobviously, access controllers.\n\n102\n00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,690\nAs we think about confidentiality,\nintegrity, availability,\n\n103\n00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,230\nwe think about the fact that we can give,\nor perhaps through shades of gray,\n\n104\n00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,980\ngive access control to different groups or\ndifferent subjects\n\n105\n00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,400\nbased on the objects they want to\ninteract with in different ways.\n\n106\n00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,998\nAnd so for an example, somebody who is\ngonna be given a read-only access to data,\n\n107\n00:06:25,998 --> 00:06:30,130\nwill be able to see data, but\nis not gonna be able to edit the data.\n\n108\n00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,135\nAnd so while they can see it, they won't\nreally be able to interact with it fully.\n\n109\n00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:39,660\nWhereas somebody who is going to be given\nthe rights to maybe be a contributor for,\n\n110\n00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,290\nthink about maybe a webpage or\nsomething like that.\n\n111\n00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,150\nA contributor will have rights to read, so\n\n112\n00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,180\nthey have read only, but they have\nmore than what read only would grant.\n\n113\n00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,190\nAnd as a result, they can not just\nread but they also can modify and\n\n114\n00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,395\nthey can add data as well\nas probably place data,\n\n115\n00:06:57,395 --> 00:07:01,215\nwhatever we may call that particular\ncontroller, that particular permission.\n\n116\n00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:04,615\nSo, as a result, they will roll\nup permissions up underneath\n\n117\n00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:08,515\nthat particular association, being a\nmember of the contributor group or having\n\n118\n00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:13,630\nthe contributor right, and they will have\na larger or higher level permission.\n\n119\n00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,120\nSo we're talking about\ndifferent graded levels or\n\n120\n00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,270\ndifferent gradations of access and this is\nsomething that's a theme that often comes\n\n121\n00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,280\nup as we start to talk about\naccess control as well.\n\n122\n00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,730\nSo let's identify some thought\nprocesses and terminology here.\n\n123\n00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,010\nWe've already started to do that,\nbut specifically four key things.\n\n124\n00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,250\nOur focus on rather, I should say.\n\n125\n00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,950\nWe want to identify, no pun intended here,\nthe words identification as a process.\n\n126\n00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,620\nSo what is identification?\n\n127\n00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,243\nRight, what is authentication?\n\n128\n00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:46,364\n[COUGH] What is authorization?\n\n129\n00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:48,448\nI have a lot of T-I-O-N going on, and\n\n130\n00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:52,746\nthen accountability because these are the\nfour operational terms that we use and\n\n131\n00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:56,050\nwant to think about as we start\ntalking about access control.\n\n132\n00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,949\nAnd so identification, operational terms\nare just terms that we just want to make\n\n133\n00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:03,370\nsure we have a kind of a background with.\n\n134\n00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,800\nSo we'll just pretty all that up there for\na minute.\n\n135\n00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,239\nSo, identification is gonna be this idea,\nor\n\n136\n00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:17,380\nthis process of being able to see who\nsomebody is when we think about a subject.\n\n137\n00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,560\nSo, we think about a user.\n\n138\n00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,980\nSo, this describes the ability for\na user to be able to\n\n139\n00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:28,110\nclaim that they are somebody and validate\nwho they are through another process.\n\n140\n00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,955\nWhen I pull out my license and\nshow somebody my license,\n\n141\n00:08:31,955 --> 00:08:35,705\nI'm identifying myself as Adam Gordon,\nfor instance.\n\n142\n00:08:35,705 --> 00:08:40,075\nSo, identification is helping us to\ndetermining the identity, not of a user,\n\n143\n00:08:40,075 --> 00:08:41,255\nlet's use the word subject.\n\n144\n00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:46,295\nLet's get people that are playing along\nwith us here and listening, let's get\n\n145\n00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:49,015\nthem used to the language because\nthe language is gonna be very important.\n\n146\n00:08:49,015 --> 00:08:53,995\nSo, determining the identity of a subject\nis what identification can help us to do.\n\n147\n00:08:53,995 --> 00:08:59,020\nAnd what we should do is probably,\nlet's think\n\n148\n00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,440\nof identification as\nthe first step in a process.\n\n149\n00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,610\nBecause typically we ask you to identify\nbefore we ask you to then authenticate and\n\n150\n00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,470\nthen to authorize.\n\n151\n00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,970\nSo we kind of say, who are you?\n\n152\n00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,336\nWe challenge you in some way.\n\n153\n00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:17,430\nYou have to then provide some sort\nof credential that will allow us to\n\n154\n00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,270\nengage in authentication.\n\n155\n00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,210\nWhich, if it's done successfully,\nwill then let you authorize.\n\n156\n00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,810\nAnd then if that is successful,\n\n157\n00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,660\nwe then are gonna access the data in\nwhatever form we are given permission to.\n\n158\n00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,220\nAnd then accountability is brought in,\nbecause then we can track what you're\n\n159\n00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,930\ndoing, and obviously understand\nwhat's happening there.\n\n160\n00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,020\nSo, when we talk about authentication,\n\n161\n00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:42,370\nwe are talking about this idea of being\nable to validate a user's identity.\n\n162\n00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,000\nSo when they provide identification, we\nhave to validate the subject's identity.\n\n163\n00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,368\nAnd so this is important because\nauthentication can take several forms.\n\n164\n00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:52,880\nIt could be a challenge\nresponse of some kind.\n\n165\n00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,270\nIt could be a biometric authentication,\nwhere we provide some sort of either\n\n166\n00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:03,610\nunique identifier or some sort of\ncombination of factors, have no r.\n\n167\n00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,515\nWe'll talk more about these in a while,\nbut\n\n168\n00:10:05,515 --> 00:10:08,650\nwe'll combine factors of\nidentification together\n\n169\n00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,680\nin order to create a secure environment or\na more secure environment as we scale up.\n\n170\n00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,720\nAuthorization takes place where we take\n\n171\n00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,210\nthe authentication information that\nhas been provided by the subject and\n\n172\n00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:26,060\nwe validate that against a directory of\nsome kind, an LDAP directory, most likely.\n\n173\n00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,530\nLDAP standard is x.500, so\n\n174\n00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,000\nwe probably just wanna throw\nthat out there really quickly.\n\n175\n00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,920\nThat will validate the access\n\n176\n00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,660\nthat the subject is requesting against\na directory, an LDAP directory.\n\n177\n00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,480\nAnd LDAP is important as a reference\nbecause it is a protocol\n\n178\n00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,550\nthat is the standard for\ndirectory services today.\n\n179\n00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:50,870\nSo, lightweight directory access\nprotocol is what LDAP will stand for.\n\n180\n00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:58,640\nAnd it will be the [LAUGH]\n>> It's early in the morning.\n\n181\n00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,620\n>> It is, I know it is.\n\n182\n00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,230\nAnd it is x.500 is the standard for\ndirectory for\n\n183\n00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,240\nLDAP directory services, x.500.\n\n184\n00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,990\nSo, that is the LDAP standard.\n\n185\n00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,290\nWhen we say LDAP, we are not talking\nnecessarily about Microsoft's LDAP,\n\n186\n00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,700\nwe're talking generically\njust about an LDAP solution.\n\n187\n00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,095\nMicrosoft implements LDAP as many,\nmany other vendors do today.\n\n188\n00:11:21,095 --> 00:11:25,240\nBut they all use the x.500 standard for\nLDAP, just so you're clear.\n\n189\n00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,740\nAnd then we have accountability.\n\n190\n00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,440\nAnd accountability is about making\nsure the access controls are applied\n\n191\n00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,240\nto the subjects and\n\n192\n00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,670\nthe objects appropriately as well\nas tracking what is going on there.\n\n193\n00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,930\nSo we will keep an eye on subjects\ncoming in to access objects.\n\n194\n00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,252\nWe will probably do some auditing.\n\n195\n00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:45,480\nWe will probably have some sort of\nmechanism to ensure that they are not\n\n196\n00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,140\ngetting into data that they don't\nbelong seeing, things of that nature.\n\n197\n00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,552\nSo, accountability is all about making\nsure that the system is working the way\n\n198\n00:11:52,552 --> 00:11:56,480\nthat it should and that we're not allowing\npeople in when they don't belong there.\n\n199\n00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,930\nSo, not granting subject access to\nan object that is not authorized and\n\n200\n00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,228\nthat we are tracking authorized\naccess when we allow people in.\n\n201\n00:12:05,228 --> 00:12:08,850\nSo we're gonna apply or\ntalk about applying access controls\n\n202\n00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,240\nto this process overall and talk about\ndifferent mechanisms to do that.\n\n203\n00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,020\nBut this is the overarching\nthought process, right?\n\n204\n00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:18,210\nThis is kind of the framework\nat a high level that we use, and\n\n205\n00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,870\nthen we pin a bunch of\nstuff to as we go through.\n\n206\n00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,393\nI should probably mention the idea\nof a race condition real quickly,\n\n207\n00:12:23,393 --> 00:12:25,100\njust as a little side note.\n\n208\n00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,350\nIt's called a race condition.\n\n209\n00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,390\nA race condition is when processes\nare gonna try to carry out\n\n210\n00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:36,690\nwhatever activity they have been set to\ndo on some sort of a shared resource.\n\n211\n00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,080\nBut they do so in an incorrect order.\n\n212\n00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,490\nAnd so\nthe idea is that we ma have two processes,\n\n213\n00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,350\nlet's just assume they're labeled x and y.\n\n214\n00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,980\nIf x is always supposed\nto execute before y, and\n\n215\n00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,470\nwe see y going before x on a shared\nresource they both operate against,\n\n216\n00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,870\nthen we would say that we\nhave a race condition.\n\n217\n00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:00,270\nAnd so this idea is that if we authorize\nbefore authentication, as an example,\n\n218\n00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,010\nright, that would be a race condition and\nthat would be bad because if we authorize\n\n219\n00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,130\nyou before we know who you are, that\nis not the proper way to do it, right?\n\n220\n00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,840\nWe should always know what\nthe authentication information is from\n\n221\n00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,380\nthe subject before we authorize\nthat subject to gain access.\n\n222\n00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,660\nSo we never want to authorize\nbefore we authenticate.\n\n223\n00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:26,390\nIf we allow authorization to take\nplace prior to authentication,\n\n224\n00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,620\nwe have a race condition.\n\n225\n00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,100\nThis will be a bad thing.\n\n226\n00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,590\nIf you think about Speed Racer,\nanother old TV reference.\n\n227\n00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,240\nDid you ever see the Speed Racer cartoons?\n\n228\n00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,055\n>> I hated that show.\n\n229\n00:13:35,055 --> 00:13:36,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> You hated that show?\n\n230\n00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,490\nOh, Don, you're killing me.\n\n231\n00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,680\nSo, the movie, eh, not so good, right?\n\n232\n00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,590\nThe movie was a few years ago.\n\n233\n00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,770\nIt wasn't all that great, but\nthe old cartoons, the kind of 1970s.\n\n234\n00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:49,570\nI think they were Japanese drawn cartoons.\n\n235\n00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,020\nYou do some of the great animation and\nanime and stuff.\n\n236\n00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,250\nBut you have this cartoon.\n\n237\n00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,490\nI remember watching it in\nthe mornings before I used to get\n\n238\n00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,480\nready to go to school and stuff.\n\n239\n00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,450\nYou didn't like Speed Racer?\n\n240\n00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,200\n>> I saw it more than a few times and\nI did not like it.\n\n241\n00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,900\n>> I think I'm going to have to leave and\ncome back.\n\n242\n00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,790\nThat just shattered me for this session.\n\n243\n00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,370\nI don't know if I can continue.\n\n244\n00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:12,160\nSo anyway, with Speed Racer, he was always\nzooming in his car the Mach 5, and he\n\n245\n00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,160\nwas always going off and doing this crazy\nstuff and he had all this gear in the car.\n\n246\n00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,273\nHe could jump ahead of people and\n\n247\n00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,510\ndo all sorts of crazy things\nwhile he was chasing them.\n\n248\n00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,635\nSo, the idea behind race\nconditions are that things have to\n\n249\n00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:24,080\nhappen in a certain order.\n\n250\n00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,930\nI have absolutely no idea why we just went\ninto the Speed Racer thing other than\n\n251\n00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,380\nrace conditions, Speed Racer.\n\n252\n00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,870\nThe train of thought just went off\nthe cliff on that one, so I apologize.\n\n253\n00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,440\nIt's in a smoking ruin at\nthe bottom of the ravine right now.\n\n254\n00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,180\n>> I'm just waiting to see how you\nwork like HR Puff N Stuff in this\n\n255\n00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,689\nor [LAUGH]\n>> You know Puff the Magic Dragon was\n\n256\n00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:43,151\ngonna be coming up later when we\nwere gonna talk about some things.\n\n257\n00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:45,355\nBut we'll put that off to the side for\nnow.\n\n258\n00:14:45,355 --> 00:14:48,300\n[LAUGH] All right, so when we talk\nabout race condition, important for\n\n259\n00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,930\nyou to know what a race condition is.\n\n260\n00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,520\nIt's a knowledge point, a vocabulary term.\n\n261\n00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,890\nOne of those things that you definitely\nwant to make sure you're comfortable with\n\n262\n00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,870\nas you're gonna scale up and\n\n263\n00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,380\nbegin to think about answering\nquestions in this area.\n\n264\n00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,310\nWant to understand the flow of\nidentification, authentication,\n\n265\n00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,410\nauthorization, and accountability.\n\n266\n00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,210\nWanna make sure we're\ncomfortable with that as well.\n\n267\n00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,710\nAll right, so we obviously then see that\nsubjects and objects interact together and\n\n268\n00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,870\nwe have this model in order\nto kind of drive that.\n\n269\n00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,450\nSo having said that then, remember\nthat we talk about different grades or\n\n270\n00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,940\nways in which we authenticate.\n\n271\n00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,225\nWe can talk about weak authentication,\nstrong authentication.\n\n272\n00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:25,930\nMulti-factor authentication\ntends to be stronger.\n\n273\n00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,730\nAnd we'll talk about some of these\nthings as we continue to go.\n\n274\n00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,340\nWhen we talk about the ideas\nbehind access control,\n\n275\n00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,560\nwe're talking about taking this framework\nand now applying it to some models.\n\n276\n00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,145\nWhether we talk about things like perhaps\na discretionary-axis control model or\n\n277\n00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:45,940\na mandatory-axis control model,\nwe'll start laying these out.\n\n278\n00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,019\nBut we just wanna make sure that\nwe're thinking about those things and\n\n279\n00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,324\nwe understand what they are,\n\n280\n00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,840\nbecause these models that we're gonna\ntalk about are gonna be very important.\n\n281\n00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,840\nAnother term we just wanna\nthrow on the screen real quick,\n\n282\n00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,710\njust a vocabulary term that we'll get\nto later on in one of our other areas.\n\n283\n00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,441\nWe'll talk about it in the networking and\n\n284\n00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:05,370\ntelecommunications section when we\ntalk about web services as well.\n\n285\n00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,750\nBut you ought to throw up a cookie.\n\n286\n00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,740\nAnd this is idea of a cookie, real quick\nas we talk about access control, we talk\n\n287\n00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,010\nabout credentials and information that\nmaybe used to authenticate and authorize.\n\n288\n00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,480\nSo, how do we define a cookie?\n\n289\n00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,270\nWhat do we wanna put up there for\na cookie?\n\n290\n00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:24,990\n>> So it is a not necessarily secure way\nof repeatedly identifying a subject.\n\n291\n00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,490\n>> Okay.\nSo\n\n292\n00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,100\na not necessarily secure way,\nrepeatedly identifying a subject.\n\n293\n00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,390\nSo that's good but\nlet's refine that a little bit.\n\n294\n00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,700\nLet's use some refined\nflour to make our cookies.\n\n295\n00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,290\nAnd so let's think about what this is,\nright?\n\n296\n00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,980\nSo the idea here, and\nDon's absolutely right.\n\n297\n00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,700\nHe has nailed the definition, but let's\nadd something in that's really critical.\n\n298\n00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,670\nWhich is that it's stored in a text file.\n\n299\n00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,870\nI wanna make sure we know\nit's stored in a text file.\n\n300\n00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,910\nAnd what it is is typically,\nagain not secure, but\n\n301\n00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:53,480\na cookie is just credential\ninformation stored in a text file.\n\n302\n00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,430\nUsually on your machine locally that\nwill be used to identify repeatedly,\n\n303\n00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,170\nas Don said, a user.\n\n304\n00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,660\nSo you see these things in\nweb sites typically, right?\n\n305\n00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,020\nWe use them and we cache the credential,\nand then allow people to just auto log\n\n306\n00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,740\nback in or jump to a landing page\nof some kind by using this cookie.\n\n307\n00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,425\nSo it's a little tag\nthat sits in the system.\n\n308\n00:17:14,425 --> 00:17:17,155\nSo we wanna make sure the key there\nis that we know it's a text file.\n\n309\n00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:19,475\nVery, very important to be aware of that.\n\n310\n00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:22,405\nAnd, obviously cookies can be good for\ncertain things,\n\n311\n00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:25,385\nbut we know they're normally not gonna\nbe very secure, as you pointed out.\n\n312\n00:17:25,385 --> 00:17:26,838\nAnd, not good long-term, right?\n\n313\n00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:29,870\nWe don't wanna have them sitting\non our system, and available for\n\n314\n00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,020\npeople to then pick up our session and\nuse as you pointed out there,\n\n315\n00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,280\nwhere our websites can track multiple\nsession access across pages, and\n\n316\n00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,660\nthat can be a bit of a challenge,\nright, for subjects.\n\n317\n00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,220\nSo just wanna make sure we're\naware of that, all right?\n\n318\n00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,510\nWe also talk about Single Sign On\nsystems here, what we call SSO,\n\n319\n00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,170\nas part of access control.\n\n320\n00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,340\nSingle Sign On or\n\n321\n00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,445\nwhat's commonly referred to as SSO,\nthis is log in Access my new technology.\n\n322\n00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:59,865\nAnd so the idea here, \"log in ponce\"\n[LAUGH], log in once access many.\n\n323\n00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:03,255\nAnd so the general statement there means\nthat with a single sign-on system.\n\n324\n00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:04,735\nWe all use these today by the way.\n\n325\n00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:09,505\nWe're used to, in Windows for instance,\nproviding a username and a password, or\n\n326\n00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,715\nsome sort of credential,\n\n327\n00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:15,210\nit may be a smart card based or\nsome sort of a biometric based solution.\n\n328\n00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,980\nBut the idea is once we log in,\n\n329\n00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,640\nwe have access to all the resources\nthat based on our user token, our\n\n330\n00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,750\nsubject token that is generated in other\nwords, we are gonna be given rights to.\n\n331\n00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,211\nIn the old days of having to access all\nthe network resources with each individual\n\n332\n00:18:30,211 --> 00:18:33,501\nlog on being required with a username and\npassword to do so.\n\n333\n00:18:33,501 --> 00:18:35,160\nhave really come and gone.\n\n334\n00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,776\nThat was the windows 9 X days.\n\n335\n00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:38,230\nSo the good old days right?\n\n336\n00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,690\nWindows 95, Windows 98.\n\n337\n00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:45,620\nThat incredible and awesome\noperating system Windows Millennium.\n\n338\n00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,400\n>> That one was awesome.\n\n339\n00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,930\n>> That's what happens when you have\na company that has nothing to do for\n\n340\n00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,550\ntwo years in a dead cycle but\nputs out a product anyways.\n\n341\n00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:56,590\nAnd so when we think about Windows 95,\nWindows 98, if you remember,\n\n342\n00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,570\nyou would constantly be processing\nauthentication requests or\n\n343\n00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,520\nbe prompted for authentication as a user\nwhen you want to access the network share.\n\n344\n00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,720\nOh, I gotta log in again.\n\n345\n00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,330\nOh, I want to print, I gotta authenticate.\n\n346\n00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,720\nThat kind of thing.\n\n347\n00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,090\nWe don't see that happening, right?\n\n348\n00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,150\nImagine what life would be like today if\nyou had to authenticate every time you\n\n349\n00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,700\nwent through a doorway of some kind.\n\n350\n00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,110\nIt wouldn't really be\nvery easy to deal with.\n\n351\n00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,930\nAnd so these single sign on systems\nhave become very very valuable for\n\n352\n00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,350\nus in terms of time saving devices.\n\n353\n00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,650\nBut a lot of times, we can now have\nsome potential issues as a result.\n\n354\n00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,460\nRight?\nPeople can grab someone else's credential,\n\n355\n00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,580\nget in and see everything in theory.\n\n356\n00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,370\nAll the object access,\n\n357\n00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,560\nin other words, that a subject may be\ngranted is tied to that single sign on.\n\n358\n00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,370\nSo there are some liabilities there.\n\n359\n00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:43,310\nWe just wanna make sure we're\ncomfortable with that idea as well.\n\n360\n00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,590\nWe also wanna be aware of user\nprovisioning here, and the idea of how we\n\n361\n00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,496\nautomate user or subject provisioning\nto use our terminology properly.\n\n362\n00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:52,550\nBut you have to think of them as users,\nobviously, but\n\n363\n00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,240\nwe want you to know them as subjects.\n\n364\n00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,320\nThe idea of being able to create,\ntypically through an automated fashion,\n\n365\n00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,290\nuser accounts or\nsubjects in a system in real time.\n\n366\n00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,690\nSo users that are on boarding,\nthe old fashion way of doing it was that\n\n367\n00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,650\na domain admin or IT administrator of\nsome kind would have rights to go in and\n\n368\n00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,160\ncreate user accounts and\nyou may still do this by the way.\n\n369\n00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,830\nIn your world,\nthere's officer in small systems.\n\n370\n00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:22,020\nYou may just audit, you may just go in,\nyou may be that IT person that\n\n371\n00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:26,030\ncreates user accounts because the business\nis small enough that you can do that.\n\n372\n00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,670\nBut in very large businesses,\nthousands, tens of thousands of users,\n\n373\n00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:34,550\nyou don't have people sitting around in\nthe directory just waiting, effectively,\n\n374\n00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,970\nto create user accounts on demand.\n\n375\n00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,760\nYou have automated,\n\n376\n00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:40,780\nwhat are called ERP systems, that are\ntypically used to automate this process.\n\n377\n00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,640\nAnd so as a result, we do user\nprovisioning, we typically see this as\n\n378\n00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,810\nbeing an automated solution that\nhas to have logic built in and\n\n379\n00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,350\nbe managed in such a way\nthat we can assign\n\n380\n00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:56,720\nsubject access to objects using whatever\nmodels that we wanna ultimately apply.\n\n381\n00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,950\nSo this is very important,\n\n382\n00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:02,240\nbecause we have to make sure we do so in\na way that is going to be secure, right?\n\n383\n00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,860\nVery important.\n\n384\n00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,350\nThe other thing we wanna throw out\nhere is just some vocabulary and\n\n385\n00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,539\nterms to be aware of will\nbe federated identity.\n\n386\n00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,930\nFederation, the idea\nof federated identity.\n\n387\n00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,170\nIt's very very big today, this idea of\nbeing able to create trust across multiple\n\n388\n00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:21,650\nsystems, between businesses for\nsubjects to access objects, users\n\n389\n00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:26,240\nto access data, is what we talk about\nwhen we talk about federated identity.\n\n390\n00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,260\nSo trust between multiple systems right,\nwhere subjects are able to access objects.\n\n391\n00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,420\nSo subjects, yeah, can access objects.\n\n392\n00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:35,920\nVery good.\n\n393\n00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:41,900\nSeparate systems, right.\n\n394\n00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,560\nSo for instance,\n\n395\n00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,510\nif you have two businesses that are\npartnering together and they wanna grant\n\n396\n00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:51,580\naccess to each other's users, they may\nuse a federated system in order to do so.\n\n397\n00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,030\nVendors that come into\nyour business from outside\n\n398\n00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,020\nmay come in under a federated\nidentity solution.\n\n399\n00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,050\nMerger and acquisition, M and A.\n\n400\n00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,600\nA lot of the times when we see M and\n\n401\n00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,220\nA activity taking place, we will see\nfederation being brought to bear.\n\n402\n00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,320\nTo merge the directory systems and\n\n403\n00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,730\nbridge them for a period of time until we\ndecide what we are gonna do with them.\n\n404\n00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,130\nWe go out and buy a company,\nor they buy us.\n\n405\n00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,950\nWe have to now integrate mail systems and\nbuy print and all that kind of stuff.\n\n406\n00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,380\nRight so, a lot of times they're\nmade to be kept separate.\n\n407\n00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,550\nBut there are more senior people\nthat have to cross those divides.\n\n408\n00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,910\nAnd so we set up federated solutions\nin order to facilitate this.\n\n409\n00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,890\nSo, again, just one of those things\nthat you may wanna be aware of,\n\n410\n00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,440\nmay want to think about here.\n\n411\n00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,860\nWe also wanna think about some access\ncontrol in relation to mark-up languages.\n\n412\n00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,760\nWhat kind of language,\n\n413\n00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,040\nprogrammatic languages, are being\nused to drive access control today?\n\n414\n00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:44,020\nAnd so, we have extensible mark-up\nlanguage, XML, being used.\n\n415\n00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,818\nWe see XML in a lot of systems today.\n\n416\n00:22:48,023 --> 00:22:52,980\n[SOUND] We have [SOUND] SPML.\n\n417\n00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,390\nS P M L is the acronym there.\n\n418\n00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,389\n>> That's pleasant\n>> That is isn't it,\n\n419\n00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:00,229\nI'd like some S P M L for lunch.\n\n420\n00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:05,538\nSo Service provisioning markup\n\n421\n00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:10,063\nlanguage is SPML, right?\n\n422\n00:23:10,063 --> 00:23:13,343\nThis is gonna allow us to exchange\nour provisioning data for\n\n423\n00:23:13,343 --> 00:23:17,540\nusers between systems, that we are P\nsystems, for instance, may exchange\n\n424\n00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,868\nthe data that's used to effectively set\nusers up in real time automatically,\n\n425\n00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:25,320\nusing SPML, that's where you\ntend to see this going on.\n\n426\n00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,515\nWe also have SAML.\n\n427\n00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:29,290\nS-A-M-L.\n\n428\n00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,539\nSo the security assertion\nmark-up language.\n\n429\n00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,640\nThis is another very popular language,\nit's used a lot.\n\n430\n00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,450\nThis is gonna be an XML standard, so\n\n431\n00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:42,790\nit's used alongside XML to drive\nauthentication and authorization.\n\n432\n00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,750\nSo these are some of\nthe languages that we will see.\n\n433\n00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:49,464\nWe also will typically see\nthe transmission of SAML related data,\n\n434\n00:23:49,464 --> 00:23:52,840\nunder a framework called SOAP,\nfor instance.\n\n435\n00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,210\nSo SOAP, which will be\nthe Simple Object Access Protocol.\n\n436\n00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,215\nSOAP is going to be a specification\nthat allows us to basically\n\n437\n00:24:02,215 --> 00:24:06,945\ndeal with how we would transmit data, SAML\ndata specifically more often than not, so\n\n438\n00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:11,390\nthis is also a very often a popular item\nthat we tend to see a lot of out there.\n\n439\n00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:15,040\nSo these are some of the different items,\nlanguages, and also some\n\n440\n00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,890\nof the control elements that take place\naround this idea of access control.\n\n441\n00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,240\nAgain, put all this into perspective for\nyou, we're throwing out a bunch terms and\n\n442\n00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,140\nideas as we define them or list them for\nyou that you're gonna have to become\n\n443\n00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,100\nfamiliar with in this area\nof the knowledge base right.\n\n444\n00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,640\nAnd this particular area of the domains\nof knowledge that you're going to want to\n\n445\n00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,890\nmake sure you have mastery of,\nhave some background with.\n\n446\n00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,630\nYou may have never dealt with any\nof these markup languages, right.\n\n447\n00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:44,011\nMost of us don't sit around and\nreally deal with much XML.\n\n448\n00:24:44,011 --> 00:24:46,025\nYou may have never heard of SPML or\n\n449\n00:24:46,025 --> 00:24:49,820\nSAML unless you are doing\neither assertion based and\n\n450\n00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,760\ntoken based authentications solutions, or\nif you are creating federated identities.\n\n451\n00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,250\nSo, if you don't do that stuff,\n\n452\n00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,770\nyou're probably not going to\ncome across these languages.\n\n453\n00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,760\nAnd that's fine.\n\n454\n00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,720\nNothing wrong with that.\n\n455\n00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,030\nYou could still be a CISSP, and\nbe a very good security practitioner.\n\n456\n00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,300\nBut you have to just go out and\n\n457\n00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:09,540\neducate yourself a little bit on\nwhat these things represent and\n\n458\n00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:13,300\nwhere they fit in to the overall\nmatrix of securities we talk about.\n\n459\n00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,920\n>> And if you're like me,\n\n460\n00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,595\nyou might have worked with some\nof these and wish you hadn't.\n\n461\n00:25:17,595 --> 00:25:18,095\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n462\n00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:19,540\nYou might have been scarred for\n\n463\n00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,340\nlife as you can see, right?\n\n464\n00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:24,910\nDon not liking Speed Racer, direct\nresult of being exposed to XML as a kid.\n\n465\n00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,380\nI mean, that's what happens.\n\n466\n00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,190\n>> I like XML.\n\n467\n00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,760\nSAML, boy.\n\n468\n00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,590\nJust the nature of getting two\ndisparate systems to integrate.\n\n469\n00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,950\nIf you have a mainframe and\na Microsoft vacuum directory and\n\n470\n00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,356\nyou want to share credentials between\nthose, that's what SAML's designed for,\n\n471\n00:25:40,356 --> 00:25:41,970\nbut that's a complex task.\n\n472\n00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,790\nIt's not something a small\nbusiness is going to do,\n\n473\n00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,280\nbut enterprises do it everyday.\n\n474\n00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,950\nIt takes a lot of planning,\na lot of resources,\n\n475\n00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,320\nthe end result is really worth it,\nbut boy it's a lot of work.\n\n476\n00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,000\n>> It is.\nIt is.\n\n477\n00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,090\nWe're gonna get on that right\nafter this as a matter of fact.\n\n478\n00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,750\nBetween now and the next break we're\ngonna go and integrate a mainframe and\n\n479\n00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,760\na

00:26:21,530\nissues that come in here as well.\n\n492\n00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,200\nKind of a separate area,\ntalk a bit about biometrics.\n\n493\n00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,740\nIntroduce the general idea and\n\n494\n00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,420\ntalk first about how we deal with\nan idea of biometric solutions.\n\n495\n00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,900\nYou've heard me in this episode\ntalk a little bit here and\n\n496\n00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,698\nthere about factored authentication.\n\n497\n00:26:34,698 --> 00:26:37,030\nOne factor, multi-factor,\n\n498\n00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:41,130\nthis idea of things that we have,\nthat we know, and that we are.\n\n499\n00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,560\nWe don't wanna write that down yet,\nbecause we're gonna come back to that.\n\n500\n00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,760\nBut the things that we are, are really\nwhere we deal with biometrics, and\n\n501\n00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,830\nthis is something unique to an individual,\nright?\n\n502\n00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:54,890\nSo my fingerprint scan,\nmy handprint, my signature dynamic,\n\n503\n00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:59,880\nthings like that, are all gonna be\nbiometric-related identifiers or\n\n504\n00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,700\nfactors of identification that I can use.\n\n505\n00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,590\nAnd the idea here is that they are unique\nthings, unique to the individual,\n\n506\n00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:10,430\nto the subject, and so as a result,\nwe can use them as very secure ways\n\n507\n00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,720\nof authenticating, and\nthen ultimately granting authorization.\n\n508\n00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,230\nSo first thing to think about,\nwhen we talk about biometric systems,\n\n509\n00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,640\nwe talk about this idea of accepting\npeople in based on registration, and\n\n510\n00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,580\nthen granting access, right?\n\n511\n00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,070\nIdentify, authenticate,\nauthorize, same concept.\n\n512\n00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,050\nBut if we do so\nin a way that perhaps doesn't\n\n513\n00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:35,000\nyield a 100% accurate results all the\ntime, we can get what are known as errors.\n\n514\n00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,740\nAnd so we have two different kinds\nof errors we want to identify with\n\n515\n00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,700\nbiometrics.\n\n516\n00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:44,000\nWe have what are known as Type 1 errors,\nand Type 2 errors, and these\n\n517\n00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,170\nare gonna be important we wanna definitely\nmake sure we're aware of what they are.\n\n518\n00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:50,180\nA Type 1 error is what's\nknown as a false reject.\n\n519\n00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,760\nA false reject.\n\n520\n00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,755\nA Type 2 is a false accept.\n\n521\n00:27:55,755 --> 00:28:00,550\n[COUGH]\nNow of the two kinds of errors, right?\n\n522\n00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,820\nLet's To play a little game, right?\n\n523\n00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,600\nSo I think two kinds of\nerrors we have there.\n\n524\n00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,868\nClearly, one is gonna be a little\nbit worse than the other.\n\n525\n00:28:07,868 --> 00:28:10,060\nA Type 2 error, or\n\n526\n00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:15,370\nfalse accept, is always gonna be\na worse solution to have to deal with,\n\n527\n00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:21,280\nbecause what happens there\nis that we allow people in.\n\n528\n00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:25,360\nThe subject is, big word there,\nright, inadvertently.\n\n529\n00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,003\n>> I know and I spelled it wrong.\n\n530\n00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:27,997\n>> You're stepping up.\nAnd you spelled it wrong on top of it.\n\n531\n00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,370\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But you made the attempt which is good.\n\n532\n00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,890\nRight?\nSo the subject is inadvertently\n\n533\n00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,870\nauthenticated.\n\n534\n00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,080\nWe actually instead of inadvertently,\nmaybe we wanna put incorrectly.\n\n535\n00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,050\nRight?\nBecause\n\n536\n00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,910\nit really is that they don't belong\nthere but they get in anyway.\n\n537\n00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,900\nThat is what a false accept is.\n\n538\n00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,980\nIt may happen just due to\naccidental something or other, but\n\n539\n00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,350\nclearly whatever the pattern match\non the biometric was supposed to be,\n\n540\n00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,000\nwe were able to fool it enough that we\ngot in even though we don't belong there.\n\n541\n00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,480\nAnd so Type 2 errors for the subject\nis really bad because if we accept\n\n542\n00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,150\npeople that don't belong in the system,\nwe're granting bad actors access,\n\n543\n00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,790\nthat is a bad thing.\n\n544\n00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,790\nFalse reject, yes that is an issue.\n\n545\n00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,830\nWe don't want people that do truly\nbelong there being rejected so\n\n546\n00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,890\nwe're effectively denying subject access\n\n547\n00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:19,270\nto the system when they actually\ndo authenticate and should go in.\n\n548\n00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:23,450\nHowever, having said that, of the two\nI would rather deal with people that\n\n549\n00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,925\nare upset that belong in the system that\ndidn't get in, than deal with people that\n\n550\n00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:31,325\ndon't belong there creating problems for\nme as a security manager, right?\n\n551\n00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:32,815\nSo we talk about these\ntwo types of errors.\n\n552\n00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:35,845\nThen we have to talk about what's\nknown as the Crossover Error Rate.\n\n553\n00:29:35,845 --> 00:29:37,325\nThe Crossover Error Rate, or\n\n554\n00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:41,640\nwhat's known as the CER,\njust the acronym for that is CER.\n\n555\n00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,070\nThat is going to be where we see the Type\n1 and Type 2 errors coming together.\n\n556\n00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:50,030\nSo imagine a grid,\nkind of an XY axis in a grid.\n\n557\n00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:52,410\nWe're going to draw something out\nhere really quickly, I think.\n\n558\n00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,200\nThere we go.\n\n559\n00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,000\nAnd we're gonna see Type 1\nerrors maybe arcing this way.\n\n560\n00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,620\nSo coming up one way.\n\n561\n00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,370\nYeah, yeah, kinda like that.\n\n562\n00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,140\nThey'll go up.\nAnd\n\n563\n00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,940\nthen we're gonna see Type 2 errors\nkind of coming from another\n\n564\n00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,510\ndirection just arcing as well.\n\n565\n00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,040\nIt doesn't matter Matter how.\n\n566\n00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,990\nSo, the point is right where those\ntwo cross, almost just to the left,\n\n567\n00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,270\njust to the left of the median there,\nof the line.\n\n568\n00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,360\nRight there in the intersection\nbetween the two,\n\n569\n00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,430\nis where we're gonna see\nthe Crossover Error Rate, or the CER.\n\n570\n00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:26,070\nThe point on the grid where the Type 1 and\nType 2 errors are basically going to be,\n\n571\n00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:30,260\nat that point where they cross or match\nup, that is the Crossover Error Rate.\n\n572\n00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,280\nThat is where the number of Type 1 and\nnumber of Type 2 errors, effectively if\n\n573\n00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:39,050\nyou think about it right, is going\nto be where we see the matching up.\n\n574\n00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,940\nAnd so the idea is that we\nwanna lower that CER rate.\n\n575\n00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,510\nWe wanna lower that Crossover Error Rate\nas low as possible because if we draw it\n\n576\n00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,432\nout or bring that down, you can see that\nthe Type 1 and Type 2 errors are going\n\n577\n00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:54,590\ndown right, if we think about the fact\nthat as this goes down the line, right?\n\n578\n00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,992\nSo as we see, just draw an arrow down or\n\n579\n00:30:56,992 --> 00:31:00,170\nsomething just to indicate that we\nwant to get it is low as possible.\n\n580\n00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,580\nWhen we see the CER coming down,\nthe ranking or the number.\n\n581\n00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,180\nLet's say maybe that's a, if we gridded\nthat out and have some sort of scale, and\n\n582\n00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,170\nsaid one, two, three,\nwith hash marks or something.\n\n583\n00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,400\nSo if we said that basically,\nthat was maybe a three or\n\n584\n00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,350\na four where we crossed over,\nright, something like that?\n\n585\n00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:16,928\nSo you could do it like that.\n\n586\n00:31:16,928 --> 00:31:20,070\nIf the [COUGH]-\n>> So\n\n587\n00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,810\nthis would be like the example of bad.\n\n588\n00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,510\nAnd then as we start to bring it down,\nwe'd be more like\n\n589\n00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,750\n>> We'd wanna see a crossing.\n\n590\n00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,890\nSomething like that.\n\n591\n00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,530\n>> Something like that.\n\n592\n00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,110\n>> Right, lowering.\n\n593\n00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,730\nYeah, or even there.\n\n594\n00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,580\nBecause what we're seeing now is\nthat we're seeing it going down.\n\n595\n00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,430\nAnd as we see it going down we see that\nthe CER, the Crossover Error Rate,\n\n596\n00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:39,820\nis lower which means that what we\nare probably seeing is less Type 2 errors.\n\n597\n00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,660\nHopefully is what we're hoping for.\n\n598\n00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,660\nWe don't want to see those\nfalse accepts happening.\n\n599\n00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,850\nRight, we could see false\nrejects being high.\n\n600\n00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,020\nWe are concerned but not as concerned.\n\n601\n00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,270\nWe definitely don't want to see\nthe false accepts going up.\n\n602\n00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:51,210\nThat would be bad.\n\n603\n00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,920\nSo lowering Type 2 errors\nlowers the CER in other words.\n\n604\n00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,670\nSo just something to think about,\njust something to be aware of.\n\n605\n00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:01,713\nAll right, so obviously managing that CER,\nmanaging that Crossover Error Rate,\n\n606\n00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:02,590\nvery important.\n\n607\n00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,601\nWanna make sure we just get\na little note on that there, and\n\n608\n00:32:05,601 --> 00:32:09,040\nwe'll give Don a second to type up and\nsummarize for us.\n\n609\n00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,820\nAll right, very good.\n\n610\n00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,330\nAnd we have that [COUGH]\nkind of Jackson Pollock,\n\n611\n00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:16,570\nAndy Warhol graphic that we put together.\n\n612\n00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,040\nDon's gonna be signing some of those and\n\n613\n00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,130\nwe're gonna be giving those away\nas gifts in future episodes.\n\n614\n00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:21,410\n>> That's right, printing lithographs.\n\n615\n00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,300\n>> So stay tuned.\n\n616\n00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,280\nRight, we'll be printing lithographs, so\nstay tuned for that, right, obviously.\n\n617\n00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,990\nVery important to come back and\ntake a look at.\n\n618\n00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,500\nWhen we do come back, we'll continue our\nconversations around access control.\n\n619\n00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,940\nContinue talking about\nnot only biometrics, but\n\n620\n00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,480\na lot of other stuff that goes\ninto access control that will\n\n621\n00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,100\nhelp you not only become a better\nsecurity professional, but\n\n622\n00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,500\nto keep the bad guys out, and\nmost importantly, lock the good guys in.\n\n623\n00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,600\nThat's really what we\nwanna try to achieve.\n\n624\n00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,211\n>> All right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\nwe're gonna stop and take a break.\n\n625\n00:32:46,211 --> 00:32:49,732\nWhen we get back,\nmore CISSP action after this.\n\n626\n00:32:49,732 --> 00:32:57,595\n[MUSIC]\n\n627\n00:32:57,595 --> 00:32:59,241\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n628\n00:32:59,241 --> 00:33:02,894\nSo we left off talking about biometrics\nand we're going to pick right back up and\n\n629\n00:33:02,894 --> 00:33:06,490\nI think this is the part where we hit our\nlaundry list of all our assorted types of\n\n630\n00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,161\nbiometrics.\n\n631\n00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:08,970\n>> We do, we do.\n\n632\n00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,920\nSo let's start going through that list.\n\n633\n00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,565\nI know we had put a couple\nup just last time.\n\n634\n00:33:12,565 --> 00:33:15,700\nJust kind of had rattled off a few,\nbut let's build a new list and\n\n635\n00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,390\njust kinda do it.\n\n636\n00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,450\n>> Yep.\n>> Yeah, we'll just\n\n637\n00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,070\nkinda do it down there.\n\n638\n00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,170\nIt's not a problem.\nSo let's start with fingerprints.\n\n639\n00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,220\nRight and fingerprints,\nthe most common one,\n\n640\n00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,400\nmost people when you talk about\nbiometrics they think about fingerprints.\n\n641\n00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:29,410\nSo very, very easily captured, right?\n\n642\n00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:32,310\nWe can just do a quick scan\non a fingerprint reader.\n\n643\n00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:36,830\nThey are going to store, or when we do\nstore fingerprints, we store all the data\n\n644\n00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,050\non the fingerprint, so the actual\nfingerprints themselves are stored\n\n645\n00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,800\ndigitally, can get a little big, so we\nhave a lot of them in a system, obviously.\n\n646\n00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,780\nEach data file we start adding them up,\ncan be a little bit big to manage, but\n\n647\n00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:53,520\nthey are considered to be probably one of\nthe most widely used biometric solutions\n\n648\n00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,330\nbut not necessarily the most secure.\n\n649\n00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,486\nThey are relatively easy to fool\nby comparison of some others.\n\n650\n00:33:58,486 --> 00:34:03,132\nSo there have been studies done where\nengineers and security practitioners have\n\n651\n00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:07,912\ngone ahead and lifted fingerprints, put\nthem into agar jello, or agar molds, and\n\n652\n00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:11,324\ncreated fingers, in effect,\nwith the fingerprint on it,\n\n653\n00:34:11,324 --> 00:34:16,273\nthen use them to fool scanners perhaps\nsometimes as much as 60-70% of the time.\n\n654\n00:34:16,273 --> 00:34:19,395\nOne study that was done it was\nclose to 80% on the failure rate.\n\n655\n00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:22,300\nSo these are things that they're\n\n656\n00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,450\nnot necessarily considered\nto be the most secure thing,\n\n657\n00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:30,760\nso those of you that have that fingerprint\nscanner on your iPhone, good for you.\n\n658\n00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,010\nThat's gonna work out real well for you.\n\n659\n00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,120\nYou may have seen Beverley Hills Cop,\nwhere, remember,\n\n660\n00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,480\nAxel Foley lifts the fingerprint\noff the matchbook and\n\n661\n00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,110\ndoes it with the little superglue right in\nthe lizard container or whatever it was.\n\n662\n00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,720\nSo that kind of stuff happens, right?\n\n663\n00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,070\nBecause fingerprints are basically made\nwith oil, and so you can bind to that and\n\n664\n00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,290\nthen you can read it as a result,\n\n665\n00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:55,430\nso just keep that in mind but fingerprints\nare considered to be a biometric solution.\n\n666\n00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:59,090\nPalm scanning where we will\nbasically scan the palm of the hand.\n\n667\n00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,280\nRight?\nSo we will put this on to a scanning\n\n668\n00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,400\nplate of some kind and scan the palm.\n\n669\n00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,000\nWe have the ridges and\nthe creases in the palm.\n\n670\n00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,930\nIf you look at the palm it's almost\na macrocosm of what you would see on\n\n671\n00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,590\nthe fingerprint.\n\n672\n00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,760\nRight?\nIt's not the same, of course,\n\n673\n00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,700\nbut has the same kind of patterns and\nstylings in it and so\n\n674\n00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:19,440\npalm scanning is also considered to be\na biometric solution as is hand geometry.\n\n675\n00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,910\nA little bit different in the sense that\nhand geometry scans the hand but looks at\n\n676\n00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:28,520\nthe width and the depth and the thickness\nof the fingers and all the different\n\n677\n00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,070\nmeasurement points not just the actual\nunderlying geometry of the palm itself.\n\n678\n00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,929\nSo want to make sure we are aware of that.\n\n679\n00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,600\nWe have retina scanning.\n\n680\n00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:41,268\nRetina scanning will shoot a little\nbeam of light into the eye, and\n\n681\n00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:45,460\nwill take a picture of and scan the\nretina, the blood pattern or blood vessel\n\n682\n00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,482\npattern that is the back of the eyeball,\nis what the retina represents.\n\n683\n00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:53,612\nPeople get a little freaked out sometimes\nby this, because you have to put your head\n\n684\n00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:57,152\ninto the reader device, there is a beam\nof light that comes out at you and\n\n685\n00:35:57,152 --> 00:36:01,164\nyou might be a little concerned somebody's\nshooting a beam of light into your eye\n\n686\n00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:04,121\nthat may not be the thing you\nwant to start out your day with.\n\n687\n00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:10,630\nBut again, a little tv reference,\nif you've ever seen, [COUGH] what is it?\n\n688\n00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,190\nNot CSI, NCIS, right?\n\n689\n00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:17,550\nThe NCIS program where they have that\nretina scanner that is used to get into\n\n690\n00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,700\nthe secure areas, like the MTAC area\nwhere they do secure communications and\n\n691\n00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,940\ndownstairs in the basement where they\nhave all their forensic stuff going on,\n\n692\n00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,390\nthey always have the retina scanner.\n\n693\n00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,030\nSo they have to put their\nup against the reader.\n\n694\n00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,270\nWe see the little blue light beam that\ncomes out and kinda scans down the eye.\n\n695\n00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:36,360\nSo that's what we're talking about with\nretina scanning, considered to be very,\n\n696\n00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,270\nvery secure.\n\n697\n00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:40,050\nAlmost impossible to fake a retina scan.\n\n698\n00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,160\nThey are unique,\nas unique as fingerprints.\n\n699\n00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,370\nYou might have seen minority report, that\nmovie, right, that great cinemagraphic\n\n700\n00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:53,170\nmasterpiece with Tom Cruise, but in\nMinority Report, if you've seen the movie,\n\n701\n00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,540\nif not, by the way, spoiler alert,\nbecause we're about to ruin it for you.\n\n702\n00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,840\nBut if you have seen it, you remember\nthe eyeball scan that was done, right,\n\n703\n00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,790\nto get in?\n\n704\n00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:06,490\nAnd if you remember that,\nthey're scanning either the retina or\n\n705\n00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,930\niris depending on what\nthey were scanning for.\n\n706\n00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,460\nBut the idea was that he takes\nthe eyeballs, right, and holds them up\n\n707\n00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:16,670\nin the baggie, right, against the scanner\nto get into the secure lab facility or\n\n708\n00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,910\nwhatever he was looking to\ndo to get that person out.\n\n709\n00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:23,720\nSo retina scans considered to be very,\nvery secure, hard to fake.\n\n710\n00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,630\nIris scans as well, same thing.\n\n711\n00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:28,040\nThe Iris scan is the colored\nportion of the eye.\n\n712\n00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,490\nThat is surrounding the pupil.\n\n713\n00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,850\nSo when you say you have blue eyes,\nor green eyes or\n\n714\n00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,190\nwhatever it is we're talking\nabout the color of the iris.\n\n715\n00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,270\nWhat are yours there?\n\n716\n00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,260\nYou've got like a greenish hazel.\n\n717\n00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,800\n>> Yup.\nMine are several.\n\n718\n00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,770\n>> Is that a hazel thing going on, right?\n\n719\n00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,490\nI'm a light brown by the way, right.\n\n720\n00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:45,045\nJust in case you were wondering.\n\n721\n00:37:45,045 --> 00:37:47,620\n>> I like long walks on the beach.\n\n722\n00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,665\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> Long walks on the beach, I'm a virgo,\n\n723\n00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:51,850\nI like white wine.\n\n724\n00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n725\n00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,560\nwe have iris scans, right?\n\n726\n00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,570\nMake sure we know that.\n\n727\n00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:00,330\nOf the biometric systems, by the way,\nof all the systems we use,\n\n728\n00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:05,450\niris scans are considered to be the most\naccurate, the most accurate, all right.\n\n729\n00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,600\nSo of all the ones that\nare employed today,\n\n730\n00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,800\niris scans are considered\nto be the most accurate.\n\n731\n00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,370\n>> So just be aware of that because\nthe iris itself is a very unique pattern\n\n732\n00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:19,250\nof ridges and furrows and just the pattern\nof the way it's made up is so unique it is\n\n733\n00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:23,170\nconsidered to be absolutely impossible for\nthat to be duplicated today.\n\n734\n00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,420\nSo, contrary to what you see\non Mission Impossible and\n\n735\n00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,820\nsome of these other things,\nin the real world,\n\n736\n00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:33,040\noutside of Hollywood, we don't have\nthe technology to duplicate an iris scan.\n\n737\n00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,600\nSo, if you do an iris scan,\nit's considered to be infallible today.\n\n738\n00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,800\nThat doesn't mean by the time you watch\nthis, in the next five minutes that\n\n739\n00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,400\nsomebody won't have figured out\nhow to actually trip us up there.\n\n740\n00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,870\nSignature Dynamics.\n\n741\n00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:47,325\nSignature Dynamics,\nsigning on a pressure-pad,\n\n742\n00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:52,425\nwe look at the force you're using,\nthe inclination of where you press down,\n\n743\n00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:55,094\nwhere you lighten up on your signature,\n\n744\n00:38:55,094 --> 00:38:59,744\nthe whole process of just all the data\npoints and measurements there.\n\n745\n00:38:59,744 --> 00:39:03,006\nBut the physical motions when you're\nactually signing are turned into\n\n746\n00:39:03,006 --> 00:39:06,662\nelectrical signals and then basically\nare captured and rendered as a pattern.\n\n747\n00:39:06,662 --> 00:39:08,730\nAnd then you have to\nreproduce that pattern.\n\n748\n00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:13,240\nObviously, if you damage your arm or\nin some way modify,\n\n749\n00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,590\npeople get injured all the time,\nif you break your wrist, things like that,\n\n750\n00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:20,580\nthese particular ones like signature\ndynamics can get thrown off as can key\n\n751\n00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:25,330\nstroke dynamics where we measure the way\nyou're typing and how much you're typing.\n\n752\n00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,870\nWe typically give you a paragraph or\n\n753\n00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:30,470\na couple of sentences you have to\ntype in to the system to register.\n\n754\n00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:33,370\nAnd then we have you type in\nsomething to get back in.\n\n755\n00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:35,310\nAnd we look at that and we measure that.\n\n756\n00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,780\nIf you damage your hands in any way,\nor damage your eyes so\n\n757\n00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,860\nmaybe you're not able to see obviously,\nthings like that.\n\n758\n00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,950\nThese kinds of systems can get thrown off.\n\n759\n00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:47,140\nAnd so, we have to adjust for that,\nand we have to be aware of that.\n\n760\n00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,710\nAs people age, by the way, right?\n\n761\n00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:52,100\nIf they develop arthritis, or\nthings like that that also can damage and\n\n762\n00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:55,264\ncan implement a situation where\npotentially we have a mismatch and\n\n763\n00:39:55,264 --> 00:39:57,710\nwe may not be getting in\nwhen we're supposed to be.\n\n764\n00:39:57,710 --> 00:40:02,463\nYou gotta remember, I used to play racquet\nball a lot when I was in college and\n\n765\n00:40:02,463 --> 00:40:04,630\nI'd always be breaking fingers.\n\n766\n00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,614\nI mean, it's the kinda thing,\nyou're running into a wall,\n\n767\n00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:08,800\nyou're not paying attention,\nit's always breaking my fingers.\n\n768\n00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,892\nWhen I played soccer as well as grabbing\na ball as a goalie I'd always be jamming\n\n769\n00:40:12,892 --> 00:40:15,080\nmy fingers and things would happen.\n\n770\n00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:19,180\nWhen you use technology like this that\nbecomes an issue because obviously you\n\n771\n00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,020\ncan't sign, you can't type, I can't type\nanyways so it doesn't really matter.\n\n772\n00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,220\nI'm that hunter and pepper.\n\n773\n00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,990\nI'm the one who learned how to\nbasically type by doing this and\n\n774\n00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,230\nI never really learned.\n\n775\n00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,540\nSo I would not be a good candidate for\na key stroke dynamic system because\n\n776\n00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,420\nyou really wouldn't be able\nto register me properly.\n\n777\n00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:33,920\nRight?\n\n778\n00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,170\nI'd be the guy who fails,\n\n779\n00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:39,070\nI'd have to go to summer school to learn\nhow to do Keystroke Dynamics, right?\n\n780\n00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,740\nSo, Keystroke Dynamics, we have that.\n\n781\n00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,750\nWhat about Voice Prints?\n\n782\n00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,240\nWe have Voice Print there, as well.\n\n783\n00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,860\nSo Don, you were sharing an interesting\nstory with me during the break about your\n\n784\n00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,390\nforay into biometrics and\nvoice print technology.\n\n785\n00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,440\n>> Yeah that was my first\nexposure to biometrics.\n\n786\n00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,030\nI was telling Adam during the break, I had\na Star Trek Deep Space Nine screen saver.\n\n787\n00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:03,120\nAnd this was back in college, and it would\nlock your screen and the way you would\n\n788\n00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,690\nunlock was by doing basically voice\nrecognition, you would say something.\n\n789\n00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,256\n>> So did you use something\nlike make it so number one or-\n\n790\n00:41:09,256 --> 00:41:10,330\n>> [LAUGH] You\n\n791\n00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:11,490\nknow I don't really remember.\n\n792\n00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:13,280\nProbably something like live long and\nprosper.\n\n793\n00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,180\n>> Live long and prosper.\n\n794\n00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,850\n>> But I was telling Adam how my older\nbrother could nail it every time.\n\n795\n00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,220\nHe could walk in and say something and\nit would unlock the screen and\n\n796\n00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,540\nit wasn't a big deal.\n\n797\n00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:27,740\nThis was 18 years ago,\nso things have changed\n\n798\n00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:32,260\na lot since then but the technology\nis not necessarily the most accurate.\n\n799\n00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,060\nAnd it's another one that's fairly easy to\nfool because you can have recordings of\n\n800\n00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,000\nvoices and things that can\nbe very difficult to detect.\n\n801\n00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,450\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n802\n00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:43,110\nWe do facial scan or\nfacial recognition technology as well.\n\n803\n00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,360\nWe hear about that a lot today with some\nof the stuff going on like big events like\n\n804\n00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,370\nthe Olympics and\nairports where there's a lot of traffic.\n\n805\n00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:53,490\nSome of the biggest airports in the world\nare using facial recognition technology to\n\n806\n00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:55,280\nscan for people that are for\n\n807\n00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,340\nwhatever reason,\nneeding to talk to law enforcement.\n\n808\n00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,740\nHand topography.\n\n809\n00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,350\nHand topography, another one.\n\n810\n00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:05,280\nHand topology will look\nat different peaks and\n\n811\n00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,640\nvalleys of the hand\nDid I say hand topology?\n\n812\n00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,280\nI meant hand topography, I'm sorry.\n\n813\n00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,850\nHand topography,\nI had it right the first time.\n\n814\n00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,611\nI was reading a note I had on the screen.\n\n815\n00:42:12,611 --> 00:42:14,191\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> And I'm talking and\n\n816\n00:42:14,191 --> 00:42:15,644\nwalking at the same time.\n\n817\n00:42:15,644 --> 00:42:19,743\nNot my best set of features here, but the\nidea is that while hand geometry looks at\n\n818\n00:42:19,743 --> 00:42:22,820\nthe size and\nwidth of the individual hand and fingers.\n\n819\n00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,380\nHand topography is going to look at\nthe peak and valleys of the hand.\n\n820\n00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,780\nSo we look at a 360 degree\nmeasure of the hand and\n\n821\n00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,604\nwe look at the overall\nstructure of the hand.\n\n822\n00:42:34,245 --> 00:42:36,085\nWhat is the valley here?\n\n823\n00:42:36,085 --> 00:42:37,855\nAnd the peak here between the fingers?\n\n824\n00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,885\nSo you see the hand put out on a reader.\n\n825\n00:42:39,885 --> 00:42:43,565\nI think we actually did a picture\ngrab of this last time we talked\n\n826\n00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:45,462\nabout biometrics and SSCP right?\n\n827\n00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:46,592\nWe showed the reader.\n\n828\n00:42:46,592 --> 00:42:48,552\n>> Yeah.\n>> We had that scan where the plate,\n\n829\n00:42:48,552 --> 00:42:52,752\nit's a plate with some\npins sticking up in it and\n\n830\n00:42:52,752 --> 00:42:56,412\nthen it actually is allowed to scan over\nthe hand and see what's going on there.\n\n831\n00:42:56,412 --> 00:43:00,042\nWe'll bring a picture up real quick and\njust show you what something looks like.\n\n832\n00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:02,372\nYou could see that one there,\nthe green one.\n\n833\n00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:03,362\nThere might be a good one.\n\n834\n00:43:03,362 --> 00:43:03,862\nThat's just the.\n\n835\n00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,950\nWhich one?\n>> Yeah, that one right there.\n\n836\n00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,651\nYou can see almost a 3DA,\nYou can see there,\n\n837\n00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:12,378\nthe Millennium Falcon Cockpit Replicator.\n\n838\n00:43:12,378 --> 00:43:14,225\n>> That's interesting.\n\n839\n00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:16,730\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Keeping with the space age theme.\n\n840\n00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:20,440\nBut as you can see there as we\ndo a scan the hand is held up.\n\n841\n00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,590\nThe squares that are highlighting\nare the data points\n\n842\n00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:25,680\nthat are being read to\nunderstand the data.\n\n843\n00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,520\nThat's just one way of looking at it.\n\n844\n00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,270\nNow you put it up against a translucent\nreader pad of some kind or\n\n845\n00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:33,380\na plate and this is what's going on,\nthe scan goes down and\n\n846\n00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,480\nbasically sees all this information.\n\n847\n00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,020\nThe one with the hand underneath\nthe time clock there.\n\n848\n00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,570\nRight up, up,\ntwelve o'clock go up from there.\n\n849\n00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,020\nYeah that one,\nlet's take a look at that one.\n\n850\n00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:45,130\nSo that also is a hand scanner, so\nyou can see you're putting the hand in.\n\n851\n00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:48,770\nThere is a, basically a scan\nthat takes place on the plate.\n\n852\n00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:53,400\nAnd then you're able to derive from\nthat what that information is.\n\n853\n00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,500\nAnd you can see it's instructing you\nto basically put your fingers around\n\n854\n00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,900\nthe posts that are sticking\nup on the reader.\n\n855\n00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,130\nThere's some metal posts there.\n\n856\n00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,960\nYou have to place your fingers there as\nguides so it basically can then scan and\n\n857\n00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,190\nget the right geometry of the fingers\nas it moves around the hand.\n\n858\n00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,050\nSo, this kind of the stuff\nthat we're seeing, right.\n\n859\n00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:14,340\nYou see these in more secure offices,\n\n860\n00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,330\nenvironments where there are,\ntypically, high secure areas.\n\n861\n00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,940\nYou know, Disney World, of all places,\nis using biometric technology.\n\n862\n00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,390\nThey have for several years now.\n\n863\n00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:24,490\nThey're using a fingerprint scanner and\n\n864\n00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,940\nyou're being asked to scan your\nfingerprint and tie to to your pass.\n\n865\n00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,560\nSo that way you can get in and if you lose\nyour pass, we can identify who you are and\n\n866\n00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,490\nthey don't let people back in the park.\n\n867\n00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:35,130\nSo it's happening all over the place.\n\n868\n00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,760\nLot of these high end office buildings,\nwhenever I'm in New York or\n\n869\n00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,850\nBoston, I go to the Microsoft offices or\nthe VMware offices, for instance.\n\n870\n00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,810\nYou have to go through some sort\nof solution like this, typically,\n\n871\n00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:48,270\nbecause they have security in\nthe lobby to get into the elevator.\n\n872\n00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,680\nSo you gotta go through and scan,\nand you'll find out who you are,\n\n873\n00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,520\nthat kind of thing.\n\n874\n00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,540\nI always say I'm you,\nby the way, when I go in.\n\n875\n00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,525\n>> Well,\nthat'll get you kicked out of some places.\n\n876\n00:44:56,525 --> 00:44:57,970\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n877\n00:44:57,970 --> 00:44:58,630\nYeah.\n\n878\n00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,060\nYeah.\nThey threw me out on the curb the last\n\n879\n00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:00,760\ntime I tried that.\n\n880\n00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,650\nAll right.\n\n881\n00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,110\nSo just make sure you're familiar\nwith this kind of technology.\n\n882\n00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:07,430\nWe have our laundry list of biometrics.\n\n883\n00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:10,450\nWanna make sure, again, that you're\nthinking about the fact that you're gonna\n\n884\n00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:14,160\nwanna go back, really review these,\nunderstand a little bit about them.\n\n885\n00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160\nGroup them together.\n\n886\n00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,210\nFor instance the things that\nhave to do with the hand and\n\n887\n00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,800\nthe fingerprint, understand\nthe differences there, subtle differences.\n\n888\n00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,090\nBetween the types, like hand topography\nand hand geometry for instance, right,\n\n889\n00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,850\nso just want to make sure we know that.\n\n890\n00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:31,130\nWant to make sure that we are thinking\nabout iris versus retina scanning,\n\n891\n00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:33,010\nunderstand the difference there.\n\n892\n00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:35,700\nWant to make sure that we understand\nthe difference between signature and\n\n893\n00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:36,890\nkeystroke dynamic.\n\n894\n00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:40,530\nAnd we want to know that the iris\nscan is considered to be the most\n\n895\n00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,570\nsecure scan today, right?\n\n896\n00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:43,410\nWe talked about that.\n\n897\n00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:47,000\nThe most accurate, which means if\nyou translate that, the most secure.\n\n898\n00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,430\nBecause if it's the most accurate,\nobviously it does not allow for\n\n899\n00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:53,540\na lot of false accept so as a result, we\nwanna make sure we understand that, right?\n\n900\n00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,740\nSo just some things to think about there.\n\n901\n00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,030\nWhen we talk about biometrics,\nwe're talking about things that we are.\n\n902\n00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,690\nWhat about things that we know?\n\n903\n00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,380\nSo let's talk about passwords for\na couple minutes.\n\n904\n00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:06,200\nSo passwords, pretty important, right?\n\n905\n00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,410\nWe use them, they're ubiquitous,\nthey're everywhere today.\n\n906\n00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:09,980\nThey have been for many, many years.\n\n907\n00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:10,560\nAll right.\n\n908\n00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:16,030\nWhether they're a small group of alpha and\nor alphanumeric characters and\n\n909\n00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:20,120\nwhether they are long or small depending\non the complexity requirement.\n\n910\n00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,950\nNot so important, right?\n\n911\n00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,200\nSomething we are, right?\n\n912\n00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,841\nAnd a password will be under the category\nof something we have, right?\n\n913\n00:46:28,841 --> 00:46:30,150\nExcuse me, something we know.\nPardon me, something we know\n\n914\n00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,570\nGlad that you're autocorrecting for\nme in real time.\n\n915\n00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:33,310\n>> I knew what you meant.\n\n916\n00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:33,995\n>> Exactly.\n\n917\n00:46:33,995 --> 00:46:35,310\n[LAUGH] That's what's important, right?\n\n918\n00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:36,990\nIt was still a four letter word.\n\n919\n00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:38,220\nSo something we know.\n\n920\n00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,460\nPasswords can take a variety of forms.\n\n921\n00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,750\nThey may be five characters,\n50 characters, something in between.\n\n922\n00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,020\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n923\n00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:48,950\nAlphanumeric can make up,\nspecial characters may or may not be used.\n\n924\n00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:52,600\nBut the idea is this is going to\nbe a protected string of some kind\n\n925\n00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,780\nthat is used to authenticate a subject.\n\n926\n00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:01,410\nPasswords are considered to be the most\noften used security mechanism today,\n\n927\n00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,320\nby the way,\neven though we are moving away from them.\n\n928\n00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,250\nLots of other things that can be used, but\n\n929\n00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,320\nthey are considered to be,\nbecause they are so widely deployed,\n\n930\n00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:14,380\nthe most common method of authentication\nin use today, just so you know that.\n\n931\n00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:17,270\nNow, speaking of passwords, let's talk\nabout some of the attacks that we,\n\n932\n00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:21,640\nas hackers, will put on our bad,\nblack hacker hats for a minute.\n\n933\n00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,510\nWe ought to get some black baseball\ncaps or something we throw on,\n\n934\n00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,830\nmaybe a white hat or a gray hat.\n\n935\n00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:28,540\nAnd we can switch between the two here.\n\n936\n00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,870\nSo let's talk about some attacks\nthat we may carry out and\n\n937\n00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:33,960\nsome things we may try to do if\nwe're going after passwords.\n\n938\n00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,200\nHow do we get them, right?\n\n939\n00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,610\nSo electronic monitoring, right?\n\n940\n00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:40,890\nWhen they go out try to just snoop and\npull those passwords off the wire or\n\n941\n00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:42,010\nout of the air.\n\n942\n00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:44,940\nSo there was all the rage about a year and\na half ago or\n\n943\n00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,870\nso, people in coffee shops were\nbeing told hey don't log in,\n\n944\n00:47:48,870 --> 00:47:51,290\ndon't do this stuff because\nsomebody might be using Firesheep.\n\n945\n00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:54,508\nRight, so you have a scanning,\nthe wireless scanning plug-in for\n\n946\n00:47:54,508 --> 00:47:58,120\nthe The platform, the browser platform\nthat would allow you to basically,\n\n947\n00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,545\ngrab passwords in sessions.\n\n948\n00:47:59,545 --> 00:48:02,654\nIn real time, there's a lot of\nthis kind of stuff that goes on,\n\n949\n00:48:02,654 --> 00:48:07,130\nso monitoring on the wire is something to\nthink about, sniffers, basically, exactly.\n\n950\n00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:10,380\nCain and Abel is a wireless\nsniffer out there, Kismet.\n\n951\n00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,630\nThere's all these different ones.\n\n952\n00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,270\nCain and Abel is kind of old school.\n\n953\n00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:16,495\nBut Kismet is out there,\nit's another wireless, Linux based,\n\n954\n00:48:16,495 --> 00:48:19,028\nwireless scanning solution,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n955\n00:48:19,028 --> 00:48:21,742\nAccess the password file if\nwe could just get in, and\n\n956\n00:48:21,742 --> 00:48:23,727\naccess the password file in some way.\n\n957\n00:48:23,727 --> 00:48:26,102\nWe could basically get the passwords,\nright?\n\n958\n00:48:26,102 --> 00:48:28,480\nPeople may store them,\nthey'd be able to get them.\n\n959\n00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,030\nWe may get the encrypted or\nhash version of them,\n\n960\n00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:35,440\nand have to try to work our magic on them,\nso different ways to do that.\n\n961\n00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,060\nSo if we target there, we're typically\ntargeting the authentication server there.\n\n962\n00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,624\nSo the LDAP directory server typically\nis what's targeted to get that.\n\n963\n00:48:42,624 --> 00:48:47,668\nIn Linux,\nit would be the /etc/shadow password file.\n\n964\n00:48:47,668 --> 00:48:50,206\nIf we're using Shadow,\nit's because it's encrypted.\n\n965\n00:48:50,206 --> 00:48:52,668\nIf we're not,\nit's just the /etc/passwd file.\n\n966\n00:48:52,668 --> 00:48:56,066\nDirectory will be either /etc/passwd or\n/etc/shadow in Linux.\n\n967\n00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,810\nIn Windows,\nit is just going to be the in the LSA,\n\n968\n00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,860\nthe local security authority module.\n\n969\n00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:05,290\nIt will be basically the SAM hive in\nthe registry that we are targeting there.\n\n970\n00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:11,350\nSo in Windows, it would be inside the LSA,\nthe local security authority module,\n\n971\n00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,080\nwould be the SAM hive inside the registry.\n\n972\n00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,810\nThat's what we would be looking for\nthere, right?\n\n973\n00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,256\nThat dark, scary place we don't go and\nwe don't ever mention.\n\n974\n00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:21,954\n>> I'm trying to remember,\nthat's in C:\\Windows, widows, nice.\n\n975\n00:49:21,954 --> 00:49:23,993\n>> Widows, it's a new operating system.\n\n976\n00:49:23,993 --> 00:49:26,780\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's in the security folder, isn't it?\n\n977\n00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,960\nHere, let's find out on my machine.\n\n978\n00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,989\n>> Sure, so, Don's going to go\ntake a field trip here real quick.\n\n979\n00:49:30,989 --> 00:49:35,768\nSo while he's doing that,\nwe're going to, remember now,\n\n980\n00:49:35,768 --> 00:49:39,525\nyou're running newer OS, they've moved it.\n\n981\n00:49:39,525 --> 00:49:42,845\n>> I think it's C:\\Windows\\Security.\n\n982\n00:49:42,845 --> 00:49:46,711\nI think it did used to be in just\nSecurity, now it's in Databases.\n\n983\n00:49:46,711 --> 00:49:49,615\n>> Right,\ncuz it's security.stb down there,\n\n984\n00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:52,006\ncuz that was the file wherever it was.\n\n985\n00:49:52,006 --> 00:49:53,780\n>> I'll just add them both for\ncompleteness.\n\n986\n00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:55,200\n>> Okay, for completeness.\n\n987\n00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,896\nAll right, so\nwe're gonna just throw that out there.\n\n988\n00:49:57,896 --> 00:49:59,934\nThat's really just reference for\nyou, by the way.\n\n989\n00:49:59,934 --> 00:50:04,148\nYou don't need to know that path\nto figure out where it is, per se.\n\n990\n00:50:04,148 --> 00:50:07,750\nMeaning, if you're gonna answer some\nquestions about it, you're probably not\n\n991\n00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,560\ngonna be asked about how do you find it\nin one operating system versus the other.\n\n992\n00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,900\nBut you just wanna be\naware of where it is.\n\n993\n00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,580\nIt's good to know where it is, right?\n\n994\n00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:16,450\nBrute force attacks, we can go in and\n\n995\n00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:20,640\njust start literally hacking\naway at the password file,\n\n996\n00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,720\ntrying to figure out what's in there by\nconstantly logging in until we get match.\n\n997\n00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,318\nSo brute force attacks are maybe\ntools that could be used for that.\n\n998\n00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:30,946\nL0phtCrack, which was an old\nschool tool not available anymore.\n\n999\n00:50:30,946 --> 00:50:33,216\nL-0, yeah, there you go.\n\n1000\n00:50:33,216 --> 00:50:34,047\nL-0-p-h-t.\n\n1001\n00:50:34,047 --> 00:50:34,929\nL0phtCrack.\n\n1002\n00:50:34,929 --> 00:50:39,190\nL0pht Heavy Industries got bought out and\nthey're gone, but a very good tool.\n\n1003\n00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:42,040\nThere's many other password cracking\ntools out there, by the way.\n\n1004\n00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,260\nDictionary attacks.\n\n1005\n00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:45,670\nWe could go out, and\nwith a brute force attempt.\n\n1006\n00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:48,477\nTypically these password crackers\nlet you operate in multiple modes.\n\n1007\n00:50:48,477 --> 00:50:53,946\nWe could load a dictionary's pre-compiled\nlist of passwords that we would use.\n\n1008\n00:50:53,946 --> 00:50:57,620\nTypically text files that\nwould just be loaded.\n\n1009\n00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,680\nAnd so we would load them into the attack\nsoftware and just automate that attack,\n\n1010\n00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,740\nhave it auto-logon.\n\n1011\n00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:08,140\nI used to, when I was doing this\nfull-time, and I still do penetration\n\n1012\n00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:12,240\ntest work and assessment work, and teach\nhacking classes, and things like that.\n\n1013\n00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,790\nSo I would go out and create dictionary\nlists or get my own, compile it together.\n\n1014\n00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:18,750\nBut you would use some crazy,\nbizarre stuff sometimes.\n\n1015\n00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:21,962\nYou would go out and\nget like names of wine growing regions.\n\n1016\n00:51:21,962 --> 00:51:24,459\nYou would get names of wines,\nand beers, and scotches.\n\n1017\n00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,480\nThere would be things like cigars.\n\n1018\n00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,140\nAnd we would take all this crazy stuff and\nput it in these lists.\n\n1019\n00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,440\nBecause you never knew what people\nwould be using as passwords.\n\n1020\n00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:33,090\nRight?\n\n1021\n00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,226\nAnd depending on the part of the world\nyou're in, you would have all this stuff.\n\n1022\n00:51:35,226 --> 00:51:39,354\nBack in the 80s, porn star names\nwere a real popular one for a while.\n\n1023\n00:51:39,354 --> 00:51:41,123\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We had that going on.\n\n1024\n00:51:41,123 --> 00:51:42,586\nWe had a list of all that kind of stuff.\n\n1025\n00:51:42,586 --> 00:51:44,840\nSo, social engineering, good times.\n\n1026\n00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,340\nRight?\nGood times.\n\n1027\n00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,590\n>> Yeah.\n>> Social engineering.\n\n1028\n00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:47,250\nThat's another one.\n\n1029\n00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,840\nSocial Engineering would be where we try\nto gather information by tricking somebody\n\n1030\n00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,090\ninto giving us the password.\n\n1031\n00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:57,920\nSo, we may send them an email\nsaying we're from support,\n\n1032\n00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,020\nwe need to get on the phone with them\nin order to reset their account.\n\n1033\n00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,480\nSomething's gone wrong, and\nwe need their username and\n\n1034\n00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,520\npassword in order to get into\nthe system to contact them.\n\n1035\n00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,040\nCould they please provide it?\n\n1036\n00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,670\nIf they do, then boom,\nwe've got it, and we're in and\n\n1037\n00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,890\nof course they never get the phone call,\nright?\n\n1038\n00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:13,970\nThey're sitting around waiting.\n\n1039\n00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:16,590\nThere's really no person on the other\nend that's looking to do that.\n\n1040\n00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:20,250\nBy the way,\njust a time out on the talk-track here for\n\n1041\n00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:22,520\na minute, let's talk real world for\njust a second.\n\n1042\n00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,530\nSo social engineering,\nprobably one of the most important\n\n1043\n00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:29,110\nareas we focus on in information\nsecurity management today.\n\n1044\n00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:33,562\nNot because it is less important or more\nimportant than anything else around it,\n\n1045\n00:52:33,562 --> 00:52:37,434\nbut because it happens so\nfrequently to people in our organizations.\n\n1046\n00:52:37,434 --> 00:52:40,476\nAnd awareness is gonna be\nthe key to deal with this here.\n\n1047\n00:52:40,476 --> 00:52:43,649\nBut today if you think about\nwhat is happening in your world,\n\n1048\n00:52:43,649 --> 00:52:47,198\ninside your production environments,\nin your businesses today,\n\n1049\n00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:50,180\nthis is one of the most\nprevalent attacks we face.\n\n1050\n00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:51,657\nAnd banks have gone to the trouble now.\n\n1051\n00:52:51,657 --> 00:52:56,294\nCredit card companies, gone through the\ntrouble now, of telling people flat-out,\n\n1052\n00:52:56,294 --> 00:53:00,375\nwe don't ever send out email to you\nrequesting you to give account numbers.\n\n1053\n00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:02,174\nRight?\nWe know your account number.\n\n1054\n00:53:02,174 --> 00:53:03,062\nWe don't need you to give it to us.\n\n1055\n00:53:03,062 --> 00:53:05,366\nWe don't want you to use your user name\nand password to login to a website.\n\n1056\n00:53:05,366 --> 00:53:06,307\nWe know it.\n\n1057\n00:53:06,307 --> 00:53:06,886\nWe store it.\n\n1058\n00:53:06,886 --> 00:53:07,571\nWe manage it.\n\n1059\n00:53:07,571 --> 00:53:08,930\nWe don't need it, right?\n\n1060\n00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:11,660\nSo when you get those\nemails from the bank.\n\n1061\n00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,250\nRight?\nQuote, unquote.\n\n1062\n00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,940\nOr you get them from the credit\ncard company saying, hey,\n\n1063\n00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:18,030\nwe need you to submit information.\n\n1064\n00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,580\nRight?\nThey don't ever communicate\n\n1065\n00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,250\nwith you that way.\n\n1066\n00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:21,720\nIt's in your terms of service.\n\n1067\n00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,670\nAnd they tell you,\nif we want you we will call you.\n\n1068\n00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:26,160\nWe will find you.\n\n1069\n00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,550\nWe may send you an email\nsaying please call us, but\n\n1070\n00:53:28,550 --> 00:53:32,460\nwe will not ask you to submit\ninformation over an email.\n\n1071\n00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,970\nAnd so as a result, you have to really\neducate your users about what's going on.\n\n1072\n00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:40,860\nOne of the most prevalent attack vectors\nwe face today is social engineering.\n\n1073\n00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:44,130\nOutside and in the wild as we say,\nin the business environment.\n\n1074\n00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:45,150\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1075\n00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:45,830\nAll right.\n\n1076\n00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:47,192\nTime back in.\nLet's go back to our talk-track.\n\n1077\n00:53:47,192 --> 00:53:48,490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right?\n\n1078\n00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:49,330\nRainbow tables.\n\n1079\n00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,300\nLet's talk about rainbow tables.\n\n1080\n00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,930\nAnother really big one here that we\nwanna make sure we're focused on.\n\n1081\n00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,230\nSo rainbow tables, also very important.\n\n1082\n00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:59,880\nThis is gonna be a collection of\nhashed passwords that are basically\n\n1083\n00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,280\nin the table, if you will,\nthe results of the hash.\n\n1084\n00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,890\nSo somebody's gone through and compiled\nthem, taken a whole bunch of passwords.\n\n1085\n00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:09,340\nAgain, they take your\ndictionary list basically,\n\n1086\n00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,830\nthey run them through a hash solution.\n\n1087\n00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:14,780\nWe're gonna do a little live demo\nof this for you right now, I think.\n\n1088\n00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:18,290\nAnd basically what's going to happen is\nthey output the hash of each password.\n\n1089\n00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:19,260\nPut it in the table.\n\n1090\n00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:22,110\nAnd have the equivalent of\nwhat the password is, and\n\n1091\n00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:23,810\nas a result you can just do a lookup,\n\n1092\n00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:27,980\nin effect, with a tool that lets you find\nthe password equivalent in the hash.\n\n1093\n00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,167\nAnd now you have a match.\nAnd you know what the password is, so\n\n1094\n00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:31,840\nI'm gonna turn it over to Don here.\n\n1095\n00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,063\nWe're just going to talk through a little\ndemo here real quickly for you and\n\n1096\n00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:35,204\nDon's going to show you how to set up.\n\n1097\n00:54:35,204 --> 00:54:39,418\n>> So the dictionary attack is the most\nrealistically performed of these.\n\n1098\n00:54:39,418 --> 00:54:41,426\nAnd that's where they\ncreate a dictionary file.\n\n1099\n00:54:41,426 --> 00:54:44,085\nSo if I say,\nwhat are some common passwords?\n\n1100\n00:54:44,085 --> 00:54:45,959\nThere's the good old password123.\n\n1101\n00:54:45,959 --> 00:54:47,463\nThere's 123456.\n\n1102\n00:54:47,463 --> 00:54:48,096\nRight?\n\n1103\n00:54:48,096 --> 00:54:50,325\nPasswords like this that we\nknow people use people use.\n\n1104\n00:54:50,325 --> 00:54:53,580\nAnd they'll basically run that\nthrough a hashing program.\n\n1105\n00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,350\nI'll just take Karen's hasher here.\n\n1106\n00:54:55,350 --> 00:55:00,145\nI'll do password123.\n\n1107\n00:55:00,145 --> 00:55:01,365\nActually, let me zoom in this way.\n\n1108\n00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:03,989\nMagic.\nWith this way I get two mouse cursors,\n\n1109\n00:55:03,989 --> 00:55:05,858\nwhich gives me double the power.\n\n1110\n00:55:05,858 --> 00:55:06,455\n>> Awesome!\n\n1111\n00:55:06,455 --> 00:55:10,391\n>> So anyhow, I get password123,\nand we just hash it.\n\n1112\n00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:15,130\nAnd so, there's the hash for\nwhat password123 looks like.\n\n1113\n00:55:15,130 --> 00:55:18,175\nAnd I'm just gonna add\nthat to my list here.\n\n1114\n00:55:18,175 --> 00:55:19,509\nSo that's that one.\n\n1115\n00:55:19,509 --> 00:55:22,336\nAnd then I will continue,\nand do the other words.\n\n1116\n00:55:22,336 --> 00:55:24,756\nNow obviously,\nthis could take a long time.\n\n1117\n00:55:24,756 --> 00:55:28,790\nBecause you've gotta do this for\nevery single password that you're hashing.\n\n1118\n00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:31,530\n>> And every single hash algorithm, right?\n\n1119\n00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:35,570\nBecause remember, the other issue\nis is you're cutting and pasting.\n\n1120\n00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:38,130\nDon is using MD5 if I see correctly there,\nright?\n\n1121\n00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:38,800\n>> Yes.\n\n1122\n00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,104\n>> So he's using MD5 right now,\nwhich is putting out a 128 bit hash,\n\n1123\n00:55:42,104 --> 00:55:44,460\nwhich is what you're\neffectively seeing there.\n\n1124\n00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:48,932\nWe would have to run this exact same\nhashing table creation solution, or\n\n1125\n00:55:48,932 --> 00:55:53,847\nrainbow table creation solution,\nfor SHA, and SHA-512, SHA-256,\n\n1126\n00:55:53,847 --> 00:55:57,836\net cetera, because each hash\ncomes out at separate bit levels.\n\n1127\n00:55:57,836 --> 00:56:00,163\nAnd as a result,\nyou may have the right password, but\n\n1128\n00:56:00,163 --> 00:56:02,283\nyou may not be looking at\nit with the right hash and\n\n1129\n00:56:02,283 --> 00:56:04,900\nas a result you may not realize\nyou have the right password.\n\n1130\n00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,620\n>> Yeah.\n\n1131\n00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,180\nBut the cool part is,\nonce you've built that table,\n\n1132\n00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:10,880\nif you get ahold of somebody's\npassword database, right?\n\n1133\n00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,953\nThat if they've got the hashed\npassword stored you can't,\n\n1134\n00:56:15,953 --> 00:56:18,157\ndid I steal your thunder?\n\n1135\n00:56:18,157 --> 00:56:20,189\n[LAUGH] You can't reverse that, right?\n\n1136\n00:56:20,189 --> 00:56:23,360\nYou can't take a hash and\nturn it into the password.\n\n1137\n00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,880\nBut if we just run\nthe hashes down our list,\n\n1138\n00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:29,300\nour table, and find a hash that matches?\n\n1139\n00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:32,350\nWe now know that that's password 123,\nor it's 123456.\n\n1140\n00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:35,290\nNow, a dictionary attack I'd say is\nthe most realistic because I can\n\n1141\n00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:38,490\ncome up with a list of terms and generate\nthe hashes in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n1142\n00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:41,760\nBut there are hardcore people\nout there that basically say,\n\n1143\n00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,500\nokay, let's generate some hashes.\n\n1144\n00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:48,535\nLet's do A, B, C, D, and\nthen they go all the way to Z.\n\n1145\n00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:53,035\nAnd then they say alright,\nlet's do AA, AB, AC,\n\n1146\n00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:58,625\nall the way to AZ and continue on as they\nbuild out from the possible combinations\n\n1147\n00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:02,490\nof just one character, and then two\ncharacters, and then three and so on.\n\n1148\n00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:06,320\nAnd they build these massive tables,\nthe idea being that they contain\n\n1149\n00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,570\nevery possible combination for\neight characters or ten characters.\n\n1150\n00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:15,330\nAnd so you'll see websites like,\nI thought I had pulled it up, I guess not.\n\n1151\n00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:20,250\nLike Freerainbowtables.com,\nthe leading name.\n\n1152\n00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:20,970\nDid I type it wrong?\n\n1153\n00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:21,470\nI did.\n\n1154\n00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:23,570\nSo freerainbowtables.com where you go and\n\n1155\n00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:26,400\nyou can download these tables where\nthey've already done the hashes.\n\n1156\n00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,210\nThey've extended thousands of hours of\ncomputing time to generate these tables\n\n1157\n00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:33,500\nand the tables are massive.\n\n1158\n00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,799\nLet me zoom in on this.\n\n1159\n00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,790\nSo you'll see, like here,\nthe MD5 rainbow tables, all right?\n\n1160\n00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:45,450\nIf we want it to be alpha-numeric, or this\none, yeah, alpha-numeric with spaces but\n\n1161\n00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:51,480\nnot other special characters, it's 24\ngigabytes just for that one rainbow table.\n\n1162\n00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,450\nIf you want to start bringing in special\ncharacters into that and things like that.\n\n1163\n00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:58,570\nSo here they've got mixed alpha and\nnumeric.\n\n1164\n00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:02,970\nOh, they don't have a mixed\nalphanumeric with symbols.\n\n1165\n00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:04,790\nSo lowercase alphanumeric.\n\n1166\n00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:07,740\nYou'll see some of these get really big.\n\n1167\n00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:08,580\n425 gigabytes.\n\n1168\n00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,970\nThis one's a terrabyte.\n\n1169\n00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:12,260\nThese are massive tables.\n\n1170\n00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:16,260\nBut when you've got them, all the hashes\nare there, you just take somebody's hash\n\n1171\n00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,560\npassword and run it down the list and find\na match and now you know their password.\n\n1172\n00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,800\nOr you know a collision,\ndo we want to get into that?\n\n1173\n00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,020\n>> No, not really.\n\n1174\n00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:24,720\n>> That's face talk.\n\n1175\n00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,570\nSo anyhow, but you know something\nthat will pass as their password.\n\n1176\n00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:32,660\nAnd you've basically, I'll say,\ndecrypted the password.\n\n1177\n00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:33,500\nBut you really haven't, right?\n\n1178\n00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,900\nYou just matched a hash.\n\n1179\n00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:35,540\n>> Right.\nSo\n\n1180\n00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,440\nyou basically can provide\nthe authentication requirement,\n\n1181\n00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,300\nyou can pass that test to log in.\n\n1182\n00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:42,480\nBut you don't need to know anything else.\n\n1183\n00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,520\nYou just need to know that\nyou've matched it in effect.\n\n1184\n00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:45,650\nSo, that's what's important.\n\n1185\n00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:49,620\nSo, this can be really,\nreally interesting stuff, but\n\n1186\n00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:52,610\nagain this is one little area\nof one little thought process.\n\n1187\n00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,630\nIt's a much broader which\nwe attack password lists or\n\n1188\n00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:59,150\npotentially get password lists, is to\nuse something like Rainbow Tables and,\n\n1189\n00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:04,730\nyou know that gets us into the broader\nconversation just around this idea.\n\n1190\n00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:06,700\nThere you go, right,\nof just being able to see all this.\n\n1191\n00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,940\nSo there's this whole sub-culture\nout there, obviously right?\n\n1192\n00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:12,980\nYou can look for these things, you can\nfind them, we have tools that do this.\n\n1193\n00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,910\nWe can potentially set up systems that\nwill then allow us to do the automated\n\n1194\n00:59:16,910 --> 00:59:17,430\ncomparison.\n\n1195\n00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,360\nA few years back,\nif you remember LinkedIn,\n\n1196\n00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,840\nwe talked about this\nduring the break as well.\n\n1197\n00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,290\nIf you remember, LinkedIn was attacked and\n\n1198\n00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:28,150\nsomebody was able to grab their password\nhash database and put it out on the wire.\n\n1199\n00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:31,100\nAnd so everybody was concerned\nbecause their passwords were exposed.\n\n1200\n00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,500\nWell, the password really wasn't exposed.\n\n1201\n00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,280\nWhat was exposed was the hashes.\n\n1202\n00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:38,582\nBut if you had rainbow tables, you could\ngo find what those password equivalents\n\n1203\n00:59:38,582 --> 00:59:41,758\nmay have been,\ndepending on how secure your password was.\n\n1204\n00:59:41,758 --> 00:59:45,097\nAnd as a result, you could effectively\nlog in as somebody, get their account and\n\n1205\n00:59:45,097 --> 00:59:46,925\nyou know, obviously become them, right?\n\n1206\n00:59:46,925 --> 00:59:50,472\nWhich would be really exciting,\nif I could become you on LinkedIn, right?\n\n1207\n00:59:50,472 --> 00:59:53,630\nBut you'd first have to be on\nLinkedIn become I could become you.\n\n1208\n00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:56,260\nSo I could create an account for you.\n\n1209\n00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:00,070\nSo just keep in mind that these are the\nways, these are the mechanisms that\n\n1210\n01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:03,350\nwe've just been talking about that we\ncan use to attack, potentially, and\n\n1211\n01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,320\ngain access to passwords.\n\n1212\n01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:09,840\nAlright, very good, so I think we've put\nto bed another perfectly good episode.\n\n1213\n01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,550\n>> Alright well let's stop here.\n\n1214\n01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,410\nWhat's next on our agenda?\n\n1215\n01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:16,430\nIs it, do we got the authentication\nmodels or something?\n\n1216\n01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:20,200\n>> We're gonna get in, we're gonna talk\na little bit about token synchronization,\n\n1217\n01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,002\nmemory cards, that whole stuff.\n\n1218\n01:00:22,002 --> 01:00:24,540\nYou know, smart cards,\nhow do we deal with that?\n\n1219\n01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:28,210\nWe're also going to talk about\nthis idea of need to know, right?\n\n1220\n01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:29,350\nWhat do you need to know?\n\n1221\n01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:30,980\nWe're focusing on what you need to know.\n\n1222\n01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:33,339\nCurb rose, right,\nwe'll come up with curb rose, and\n\n1223\n01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:37,270\nonce we get done with that we'll\nget into the mechanisms for\n\n1224\n01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:40,640\nauthentication of the models but, that'll\nbe coming up after all that conversation.\n\n1225\n01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,300\n>> Awesome.\n\n1226\n01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,370\nAlright so lots of stuff coming up.\n\n1227\n01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:47,386\nStay tuned, we'll be\n\n1228\n01:00:47,386 --> 01:00:52,666\nback after this [SOUND].\n\n1229\n01:00:52,666 --> 01:00:54,066\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1230\n01:00:54,066 --> 01:00:58,169\nSo in the last segment we ended talking\nabout passwords and if you thought we were\n\n1231\n01:00:58,169 --> 01:01:02,600\ndone, you're sadly mistaken because we've\ngot a lot more to talk about passwords.\n\n1232\n01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,500\n>> It never ends.\n\n1233\n01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,640\nIt never ends.\n\n1234\n01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,330\n>> And that comes part and parcel with\nbeing the most popular method for\n\n1235\n01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,258\nauthenticating users.\n\n1236\n01:01:10,258 --> 01:01:12,860\nSo let's just jump right back into it and\nsee what damage we can do.\n\n1237\n01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:16,250\n>> Great.\nSo I know we put together an additional\n\n1238\n01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:19,650\nforay on the list there, just a lot of\nadditional stuff you want to throw out.\n\n1239\n01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:21,877\nSo starting with some vocabulary\nterms you want to walk through and\n\n1240\n01:01:21,877 --> 01:01:23,460\nmake sure you're comfortable with.\n\n1241\n01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,440\nThe idea of clipping level, right?\n\n1242\n01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:27,500\nAnd so what a clipping level is,\nit's basically just a threshold.\n\n1243\n01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,480\nIt's an idea of a measurement\nof some kind we're gonna take.\n\n1244\n01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,410\nFor above or below it,\nwe may have activity associated with that.\n\n1245\n01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:37,100\nSo we may say we wanna generate\nsome sort of an alert, or\n\n1246\n01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,990\nsome sort of an activity will be logged.\n\n1247\n01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:41,790\nBut a clipping level is just old\nschool language for threshold so\n\n1248\n01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:42,690\nthat's all it really is.\n\n1249\n01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:45,560\nSo, know the vocabulary, know the term.\n\n1250\n01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,930\nRight?\n\n1251\n01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:49,020\nHate the player,\ndon't hate the game, as they say.\n\n1252\n01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:50,300\nOr hate the game, don't hate the player.\n\n1253\n01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:55,958\nSo, measurement of a certain amount,\nwhatever it may be, of a foreign activity.\n\n1254\n01:01:55,958 --> 01:02:00,270\nPassword checker, a password checker\nis going to be a tool that typically is\n\n1255\n01:02:00,270 --> 01:02:04,810\nused by a security professional to check\nthe strength, the validity, of a password.\n\n1256\n01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:08,620\nSo if we have a complexity rule\nin place that says it must be at\n\n1257\n01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:12,780\nleast eight characters, alpha-numeric,\nwith one special character used,\n\n1258\n01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:15,280\nthe password checker would\nenforce that logic and\n\n1259\n01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,680\nvalidate the passwords based on the logic\nor the rules that are used to assign them.\n\n1260\n01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,110\nPassword cracker is a tool\nthat will be used by a hacker,\n\n1261\n01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,920\ntypically, to try to break passwords.\n\n1262\n01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,260\nWe mentioned Loft Crack in a prior episode\nas an example of a password cracking tool.\n\n1263\n01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,244\nThere are many of them out there, but\n\n1264\n01:02:31,244 --> 01:02:36,100\nyou would use a tool like that to hack,\neffectively, or break passwords.\n\n1265\n01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:39,970\nA cognitive password is one that\nis based on fact or opinion.\n\n1266\n01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:42,170\nSo this is going to be something where,\nfor instance,\n\n1267\n01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:45,120\nwe traditionally see this referred\nto as security questions.\n\n1268\n01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,990\nWhen you call up your credit card company,\nor the cable company, or whoever\n\n1269\n01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:53,170\nyou're dealing with and to say, so Mr.\nGordon what's your mother's maiden name?\n\n1270\n01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:58,260\nOr can you tell me, you know,\nyour first pet's name?\n\n1271\n01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:59,380\nSomething like that.\n\n1272\n01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:01,525\nOr where you went to school,\nwhere you were born, wherever,\n\n1273\n01:03:01,525 --> 01:03:05,475\nthose are cognitive passwords, right,\nthey are fact based or opinion based.\n\n1274\n01:03:05,475 --> 01:03:06,455\nHow happy are you today?\n\n1275\n01:03:06,455 --> 01:03:09,475\nRight, that would be\na great cognitive password.\n\n1276\n01:03:09,475 --> 01:03:10,695\nToday I'm feeling unhappy,\n\n1277\n01:03:10,695 --> 01:03:15,325\nwell sorry yesterday you weren't and we\nhave that on file so we can't let you in.\n\n1278\n01:03:15,325 --> 01:03:16,897\nSo not as important really,\n\n1279\n01:03:16,897 --> 01:03:20,108\nprobably not as easily used\nwhen you think about opinion,\n\n1280\n01:03:20,108 --> 01:03:24,580\nbut obviously when we focus on fact they\nare going to be useful, in that respect.\n\n1281\n01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:28,130\nThe downside with cognitive passwords is,\nsomebody can find the facts out then,\n\n1282\n01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:29,910\nin effect,\nthey know what your password is.\n\n1283\n01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:32,020\nSo, we ask for mother's maiden name,\n\n1284\n01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:34,410\nbut that's not something\nthat's that hard to find.\n\n1285\n01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:39,600\nAnd we ask for something that may or\nmay not be common knowledge and so\n\n1286\n01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:43,820\nthe challenge becomes when we take these\nthings that aren't readily available,\n\n1287\n01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,950\nat least if you know where to look,\nanyway, then that could be an issue.\n\n1288\n01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,900\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n1289\n01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:49,750\nOne time passwords.\n\n1290\n01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:52,853\n>> I don't know if you saw on\nthe chat room, MSG suggested\n\n1291\n01:03:52,853 --> 01:03:57,327\na Gmail password checker, right, that\nyou can go and and post your password.\n\n1292\n01:03:57,327 --> 01:03:58,087\nHe'll check it.\n\n1293\n01:03:58,087 --> 01:03:59,007\nHe says it's safe.\n\n1294\n01:03:59,007 --> 01:04:00,007\n>> And he'll let us know.\n\n1295\n01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:00,967\n>> I would do that.\n\n1296\n01:04:00,967 --> 01:04:04,070\nThat's, he's online,\nhe must be trustworthy, right?\n\n1297\n01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:06,230\nHe's one of our viewers, he must be.\n\n1298\n01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:08,340\n>> Got a name, not just guest.\n\n1299\n01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:12,190\n>> [LAUGH] He's got a name,\nso we must trust him, right?\n\n1300\n01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:13,850\nYou over there in the corner.\n\n1301\n01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:14,446\n>> All right.\n\n1302\n01:04:14,446 --> 01:04:18,150\nSo one-time passwords,\none-time passwords, we call these,\n\n1303\n01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:21,170\noften referred to as dynamic\npasswords as well, So,\n\n1304\n01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:24,200\nyou know we talk about in cryptography,\nand in the cryptography section,\n\n1305\n01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:28,050\nthe idea of a one time crypto-system,\nbeing a one-time pad.\n\n1306\n01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:29,980\nBeing the most secure,\nbecause if it's set up and\n\n1307\n01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:33,080\nused properly,\nyou can't actually replicate the code.\n\n1308\n01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,685\nAnd a one-time password is basically,\n\n1309\n01:04:34,685 --> 01:04:37,575\nthat same concept just shrunk\ndown to authentication.\n\n1310\n01:04:37,575 --> 01:04:39,255\nIt's only generated and used once.\n\n1311\n01:04:39,255 --> 01:04:43,085\nAnd as long as you don't re-use them and\nthe key space, the generation space and\n\n1312\n01:04:43,085 --> 01:04:46,080\nthe algorithms used to generate\nthe passwords is large enough.\n\n1313\n01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,060\nWe don't have to worry\nabout them being repeated.\n\n1314\n01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:49,520\nThere are no collisions,\n\n1315\n01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,840\na term that we used off to the side\nduring one of our discussions earlier.\n\n1316\n01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,980\nAs long as there are no collisions,\nthen we should be good.\n\n1317\n01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,940\nLet's talk about token devices\na little bit, and what tokens are.\n\n1318\n01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:01,650\nSo I know we had a picture that I\nthink we are just quickly throw up.\n\n1319\n01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,210\n>> Sure.\n\n1320\n01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:04,980\n>> For our audience there,\njust make sure you guys have seen these.\n\n1321\n01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:06,390\nYou may or may not be familiar with them.\n\n1322\n01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:07,315\nYou may not use them.\n\n1323\n01:05:07,315 --> 01:05:08,730\nThey're very popular, but you know,\n\n1324\n01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:11,210\nyou may not be using them\ngiven the kind of work you do.\n\n1325\n01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:12,380\nBut you could see, right?\n\n1326\n01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:16,254\nNo marketing support here from our\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] like every picture.\n\n1327\n01:05:16,254 --> 01:05:20,160\nThis episode brought to you by,\nthe lovely folks at R-S-A.\n\n1328\n01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,770\nSo you can see here that\na typical R S A crypto token or\n\n1329\n01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:26,100\nencrypto key,\nmay look something like this.\n\n1330\n01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,640\nThere are different types depending\non what it is you're looking to do.\n\n1331\n01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,180\nSynchronous verses asynchronous.\n\n1332\n01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,760\nWe'll talk about the token\ntypes here in just a minute.\n\n1333\n01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,490\nBut you know,\nit's basically a USB key fob right?\n\n1334\n01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:39,580\nYou can wear it on a key chain or\na little lanyard of some kind.\n\n1335\n01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:43,500\nAnd you can, as you see there's\ntoken generation going on there.\n\n1336\n01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:47,380\nSo the identifier is generated\nin the LCD display there.\n\n1337\n01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:50,390\nTypically about every 30 seconds or\nso it will rotate.\n\n1338\n01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:53,350\nIf this is a time synchronized solution.\n\n1339\n01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:56,160\nIf this is not, you can see\na little bars will count down for\n\n1340\n01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,130\nthe length of duration of the time\nthat the key is good for.\n\n1341\n01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:01,820\nMaybe 30 seconds, maybe a minute,\nmaybe two minutes.\n\n1342\n01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,070\nYou can vary the timing on these.\n\n1343\n01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:06,890\nDepending on how secure and\nhow close you wanna manage that for\n\n1344\n01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:09,010\njust how often you want\npeople to be able to get in.\n\n1345\n01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:12,390\nOne of the frustrating things when you use\nthose things is you have like a 30 second\n\n1346\n01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:14,720\nwindow and\nyou're fumbling when you try to type it.\n\n1347\n01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,990\nYou keep missing the window.\n\n1348\n01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:19,950\nSo they have to be a long enough window\nso, you can actually get in, but every so\n\n1349\n01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:20,770\noften right?\n\n1350\n01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:22,440\nThat kind of thing, you mean this one.\n\n1351\n01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,040\nSome of these have buttons where you\nactually will generate the actual\n\n1352\n01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:29,110\nchallenge response,\ndepending on the kind of system it is.\n\n1353\n01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,490\n>> Let me see if I can\nfind one with a button.\n\n1354\n01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:33,310\n>> Yeah.\nSo some of them may, oh look,\n\n1355\n01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:34,420\nmy old Blackberry's in there.\n\n1356\n01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:35,730\nLook at that, that awesome.\n\n1357\n01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:36,680\nLook at that, that's my old Blackberry.\n\n1358\n01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,700\n>> That's actually a really\ngood point there, though.\n\n1359\n01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,520\nIs that the tokens don't\nhave to be physical.\n\n1360\n01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,370\n>> They can be logical.\n\n1361\n01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:42,910\nThe software based in Blackberrys.\n\n1362\n01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:44,530\n>> Yep and RSA had that software.\n\n1363\n01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:46,660\nI know I've used that company before.\n\n1364\n01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,400\nGoogle authenticator is similar.\n\n1365\n01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,300\nThey've got that.\n\n1366\n01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,050\nYou know one that has\na button is the yubico.\n\n1367\n01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:52,550\n>> Okay.\n\n1368\n01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,185\n>> I don't know if you've\never used yubico or not?\n\n1369\n01:06:55,185 --> 01:06:56,495\n>> We'll bring that up.\n\n1370\n01:06:56,495 --> 01:06:57,375\nI am familiar with it.\n\n1371\n01:06:57,375 --> 01:06:58,715\nI haven't used it, but\nI am familiar with it.\n\n1372\n01:06:58,715 --> 01:06:59,775\nSo, yeah we could see there,\n\n1373\n01:06:59,775 --> 01:07:03,335\nprobably just a good example of one, where\nyou actually will press that button, and\n\n1374\n01:07:03,335 --> 01:07:06,065\nwhen you do that it will then\ngenerate the challenge for you.\n\n1375\n01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:09,915\nIt generates the key for\nyou to submit to authenticate.\n\n1376\n01:07:09,915 --> 01:07:11,315\nObviously, these have to be synchronized.\n\n1377\n01:07:11,315 --> 01:07:13,015\nThis key has to be synchronized.\n\n1378\n01:07:13,015 --> 01:07:15,745\nOr this part of the system has to\nbe synchronized with the server,\n\n1379\n01:07:15,745 --> 01:07:17,245\nthe authentication server,\non the back end.\n\n1380\n01:07:17,245 --> 01:07:20,520\nWe're going to talk briefly about\nthat whole process right now.\n\n1381\n01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:24,270\nSo lots of different opportunities there,\nlots of different variety.\n\n1382\n01:07:24,270 --> 01:07:27,720\nSo the idea there is to have this\nsystem be a two part solution.\n\n1383\n01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:32,010\nThere is a fob or some sort of key held\nby the user who wants to authenticate.\n\n1384\n01:07:32,010 --> 01:07:35,150\nAnd then there is an authentication\ninfrastructure on the back end\n\n1385\n01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:37,770\non the server side that's\nmaintained at the business\n\n1386\n01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:40,350\nthat is used to authenticate\nthese incoming requests or\n\n1387\n01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:44,430\nto issue challenges and responses in order\nto be able to broker that conversation.\n\n1388\n01:07:44,430 --> 01:07:46,840\nSo let's go back to our notes.\n\n1389\n01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:50,630\nAnd let's actually, just bring up\nthis idea that we've outlined for\n\n1390\n01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:52,560\nyou here of the different token types.\n\n1391\n01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:53,890\nSo we have synchronous tokens.\n\n1392\n01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:55,650\nThey are synchronized in some way.\n\n1393\n01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:59,840\nCounter synchronization, and\nor time synchronization.\n\n1394\n01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,060\nCounter synchronization as we spoke about,\n\n1395\n01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:06,590\nthe user initiates the creation of the one\ntime password by pushing the button.\n\n1396\n01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:08,560\nSo the UBI token that we\njust looked at for instance,\n\n1397\n01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,320\nwould be a good example of\ncounter synchronization.\n\n1398\n01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,090\nTime synchronization was the first\nitem we looked at with RSA.\n\n1399\n01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:17,530\nWhere we would see you know,\nthe challenge synchronization item.\n\n1400\n01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:22,170\nThe token, if you will, key that's being\ngenerated there, being in the window for\n\n1401\n01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:24,610\n30 seconds, whatever the bar was.\n\n1402\n01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:27,500\nAnd then asychronist tokens\nare challenge response.\n\n1403\n01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:31,080\nThe server sends out, or\nthe user sends out a challenge.\n\n1404\n01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,330\nEither way,\nit just depends on how it's set up.\n\n1405\n01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:36,780\nAnd as a result, we get back a response\nthat is linked to the authentication\n\n1406\n01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:41,280\nprocess that links basically, the unique\nID of the user's token with the challenge.\n\n1407\n01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,860\nCombines the two into a hash that is sent.\n\n1408\n01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:47,350\nWe basically, look at the hash on\nthe far side, to replicate it,\n\n1409\n01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:48,080\nto make sure it's good.\n\n1410\n01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,710\nAnd as a result, we then can\nactually see what that looks like.\n\n1411\n01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:55,300\nSo, we wanna make sure we understand\nthe process that an asynchronous solution\n\n1412\n01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,340\ndoes some sort of challenge and response.\n\n1413\n01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,960\nThere's varying ways of implementing this.\n\n1414\n01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,120\nThe technology itself is not so\ncritical as just distinguishing between\n\n1415\n01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:06,170\nthe challenge response\nconcept is asynchronous and\n\n1416\n01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:10,460\ncounter and/or time based synchronization\nbeing used with synchronous solutions.\n\n1417\n01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,490\nAnd as Don mentioned and\nI mentioned as well, you know,\n\n1418\n01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:15,640\nwe see these in a variety of different\nareas, software and hardware based.\n\n1419\n01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,440\nThey're very prevalent.\n\n1420\n01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:18,750\nYou're easily able to see them\nwhen they're hardware based.\n\n1421\n01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:21,500\nYou may not realize software\nsynchronization tokens are being used,\n\n1422\n01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:25,530\nbecause they're just running in the\nbackground on someone's machine typically.\n\n1423\n01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:27,670\nAll right?\nA lot of VPN clients would use these kinds\n\n1424\n01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:32,000\nof solutions software based sometimes to\nbe able to authenticate systems as well.\n\n1425\n01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,110\nWe have a a pass phrase.\n\n1426\n01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:38,630\nInstead of a password, pass phrase\nwill literally be a sentence or\n\n1427\n01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:39,930\nsome sort of phrase.\n\n1428\n01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,290\nThe dog is blue.\n\n1429\n01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:43,510\nI like pie, whatever it may be.\n\n1430\n01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:48,170\nThat is what we're gonna use as our pass\nphrase, instead of a password to get in.\n\n1431\n01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:49,550\nRight?\n\n1432\n01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:50,930\nI like the number four.\n\n1433\n01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:53,890\nRight?\n[LAUGHS] Yeah, exclamation point, right.\n\n1434\n01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:57,330\nYou will then use that,\nwhatever that is, in lieu of a password.\n\n1435\n01:09:57,330 --> 01:09:58,530\nA little bit more complex.\n\n1436\n01:09:58,530 --> 01:09:59,160\nRight.\nObviously, more\n\n1437\n01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:03,060\ncharacters gotta have the sequencing,\nthe capitalization, all that correct.\n\n1438\n01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:05,890\nAnd it becomes a more complex\nway of doing authentication.\n\n1439\n01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:09,220\nAnd you know, used in some more complex,\nmore secure systems too.\n\n1440\n01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:10,755\nThey are a little easier to remember.\n\n1441\n01:10:10,755 --> 01:10:11,717\n>> They are.\n>> Cuz if you think\n\n1442\n01:10:11,717 --> 01:10:12,856\nabout the elements, right?\n\n1443\n01:10:12,856 --> 01:10:13,901\nWe've got capital letters.\n\n1444\n01:10:13,901 --> 01:10:15,067\nWe've got lower case letters.\n\n1445\n01:10:15,067 --> 01:10:17,640\nWe've got special characters,\nthe spaces, the exclamation point.\n\n1446\n01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:18,890\nWe got a number, right?\n\n1447\n01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:21,330\nAll the elements of a complex password,\nbut\n\n1448\n01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:23,590\nit's not as hard to remember\nas a jumbled up mess.\n\n1449\n01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:24,590\nBecause it's just a sentence.\n\n1450\n01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:25,870\nAnybody can remember that.\n\n1451\n01:10:25,870 --> 01:10:29,290\n>> Jumbled up mess,\nis that an official security term?\n\n1452\n01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:30,630\n>> Jumbled up mess?\n\n1453\n01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:31,460\nYeah.\n\n1454\n01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:32,840\n>> It's official scripture that we use,\na jumbled up mess.\n\n1455\n01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:34,410\n>> Isn't that on the objectives somewhere?\n\n1456\n01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:35,130\n>> It is.\nIt is.\n\n1457\n01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:39,930\n>> But the other negative though is you do\nexpose yourself to dictionary attacks and\n\n1458\n01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:42,630\nthings, if someone has a reasonable\n\n1459\n01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:44,080\nexplanation of what\nthat password might be.\n\n1460\n01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,610\nSo, So we do have to be sensitive there.\n\n1461\n01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:47,240\n>> Okay.\n\n1462\n01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,080\nWe ought to be sensitive.\n\n1463\n01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:52,880\nWe're a warm and sensitive kind\nof sensitive security, right.\n\n1464\n01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,280\nSo memory cards,\nlet's talk about memory cards.\n\n1465\n01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,205\nIt is Friday, is it not?\n\n1466\n01:10:57,205 --> 01:11:01,500\n[LAUGH] Memory cards hold information\nwith no processing capabilities in them.\n\n1467\n01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:03,310\nWhen we talk about memory cards,\nwe wanna juxtapose,\n\n1468\n01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:04,770\ncompare these to smart cards, right?\n\n1469\n01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:07,060\nAnd the idea here is that\na memory card is basically,\n\n1470\n01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:10,760\njust bulk memory storage,\nreally no processing capabilities at all.\n\n1471\n01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,400\nSo no-hard wired antennas,\n\n1472\n01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:17,700\nno processing of any kind, no on-board\nmicrochips that can do processing.\n\n1473\n01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:18,630\nIn the card.\n\n1474\n01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:20,730\nIt's like a USB stick in effect.\n\n1475\n01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:21,930\nIt just is storage.\n\n1476\n01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:24,340\nAn SD card is probably\na better example of that.\n\n1477\n01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:26,890\nOne of the micro SD cards\nyou may put in your phone\n\n1478\n01:11:26,890 --> 01:11:29,870\nto store stuff would be a memory card,\nas an example.\n\n1479\n01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:32,600\nOr in your computer depending\non the format you use.\n\n1480\n01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:34,450\nSmart cards on the other hand, right?\n\n1481\n01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:37,940\nAre going to be cards that have\nprocessing on-board capabilities.\n\n1482\n01:11:37,940 --> 01:11:41,780\nSo digital IDs that are used\nembedded inside of the chips.\n\n1483\n01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:44,430\nThe digital certificates,\nand digital identities.\n\n1484\n01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:48,010\nGovernment, military cards in the US\nare referred to as CAC cards.\n\n1485\n01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:48,960\nCAC cards.\n\n1486\n01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,840\nAnd those cards have embedded\nsmart chips in them.\n\n1487\n01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,420\nCredit cards, a lot of credit cards today,\nall the rage in Europe.\n\n1488\n01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:58,825\nEspecially, will have embedded\nsmart chip technology in them, so\n\n1489\n01:11:58,825 --> 01:12:00,086\nwe'll see those there.\n\n1490\n01:12:00,086 --> 01:12:04,270\nMy Microsoft ID for instance, has\na smart card embedded in the back of it.\n\n1491\n01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:08,690\nSo those kind of things, you can see the\nchip right up there, like any of those.\n\n1492\n01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:13,000\nThat is a smart card reader, and the smart\ncard reader typically USB device,\n\n1493\n01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,870\nthat is going to think\nsomebody labeled that,\n\n1494\n01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:16,475\notherwise we would have\nknown what that was.\n\n1495\n01:12:16,475 --> 01:12:19,580\n[LAUGH] And so the smart card reader,\nyou put the smart card in.\n\n1496\n01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:22,680\nWe can then authenticate through\nthe credential that is stored\n\n1497\n01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:23,820\non the smart card.\n\n1498\n01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:25,680\nSmart cards can be two types.\n\n1499\n01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:29,120\nThey may be contactless or\nthey may be contact based, right?\n\n1500\n01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:35,550\nAnd so a contactless smart card, or\na contact based, or a contact card.\n\n1501\n01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:39,460\nThe contact card is gonna be a card that\nmust be held up against the strike plate\n\n1502\n01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:44,760\nto draw energy from the strike plate,\nto spin up long enough, basically.\n\n1503\n01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,690\nTo be able to be powered\non to do its processing.\n\n1504\n01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:52,360\nSo it has no way of being able to draw\nenergy down, and to power up the card,\n\n1505\n01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,680\nunless we strike, literally hit,\nthe strike plate.\n\n1506\n01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,720\nSo we put those up against a reader,\n\n1507\n01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,540\na lot of times you're walking through,\nyou know, secure facilities,\n\n1508\n01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:03,960\nand you will see people putting their\ncards up against a metal plate.\n\n1509\n01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,052\nThat is a contact-based card.\n\n1510\n01:13:06,052 --> 01:13:09,990\nContactless-based cards are cards\nthat have antennas in them.\n\n1511\n01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:11,750\nYou can see them on the screen there, and\n\n1512\n01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:17,070\ncontactless cards will be also sometimes\nreferred to as prox, or proximity cards.\n\n1513\n01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:20,770\nYou get within a couple of feet of the\nreader, depending on the sensitivity of\n\n1514\n01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:25,090\nthe system, and the antenna that's\nimbedded in the card, will affectively\n\n1515\n01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:29,130\ndraw power down from the little field\nthat is emanating out of the reader.\n\n1516\n01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:31,940\nAnd will power up long enough\nto pass your credential.\n\n1517\n01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,990\nSo because we call these prox cards,\n\n1518\n01:13:33,990 --> 01:13:38,040\nwhich you often see, as people walk down\nthe hall in these secure environments.\n\n1519\n01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:41,020\nAnd thet will just wave with their wallet,\nor their badge,\n\n1520\n01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:43,930\ndepending where they have it, kind of wave\nit in the air, maybe within a foot or\n\n1521\n01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:47,200\ntwo of the door reader, and\nthen it will unlock and open up.\n\n1522\n01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:48,640\nYou can see on the screen there,\n\n1523\n01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,610\nthat the antenna is embedded\ninside the body of the card.\n\n1524\n01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:52,930\nAnd we also have a chip.\n\n1525\n01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:54,460\nThe smart chip is embedded there as well.\n\n1526\n01:13:54,460 --> 01:13:57,970\nYou know, these cards are then sealed,\nso this is on the inside of the card.\n\n1527\n01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:00,730\nThere's a sandwich of the polymers\nthat are made and sealed.\n\n1528\n01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:03,200\nThen you can pry them open,\nbut you gotta work at it.\n\n1529\n01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,960\nIt's not the easiest thing to break.\n\n1530\n01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:07,210\nAnd a lot times we do that\nto break the antenna, and\n\n1531\n01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:08,750\nrender the card useless as a result.\n\n1532\n01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,480\nSo just be aware of that as well.\n\n1533\n01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,560\nBut this is the difference between\nthe two kinds of cards that we see.\n\n1534\n01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,100\nThere's another example of one there.\n\n1535\n01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:16,730\nRight?\n\n1536\n01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:19,555\nSo we just want to make sure that we're\ncomfortable with this idea of contact,\n\n1537\n01:14:19,555 --> 01:14:20,520\ncontactless.\n\n1538\n01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:23,560\nAnd smart card versus memory cards, right?\n\n1539\n01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,610\nVery, very important to\nthink about as well.\n\n1540\n01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:29,940\nSo some attacks against smart cards, that\nwe could see generating information for\n\n1541\n01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:32,910\nus, either through some sort\nof surreptitious attack.\n\n1542\n01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:36,650\nIf we grab the card, right, and take it\nand try to probe it or do things with it.\n\n1543\n01:14:36,650 --> 01:14:38,000\nSo three attacks there.\n\n1544\n01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,250\nWe have the fault generation solution,\nwhere we can try to generate\n\n1545\n01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:48,030\nfaults in the systems that are reading\nthe cards, and the cards themselves.\n\n1546\n01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:51,920\nWe can go in, for instance, and see if\nthe implementation of the algorithms that\n\n1547\n01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,690\nare being used, perhaps are faulty.\n\n1548\n01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:57,860\nIf the card, every fifth, or tenth,\nor 20th time, kicks out an error, and\n\n1549\n01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:01,590\ngenerates some sort of a problem,\nmaybe it'll pick up on that pattern.\n\n1550\n01:15:01,590 --> 01:15:03,050\nSo different ways of doing this.\n\n1551\n01:15:03,050 --> 01:15:05,510\nWe have side channel attacks,\nwhere we can come in and\n\n1552\n01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:09,090\nlook at differential power analysis, for\ninstance, where we look at the power\n\n1553\n01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:13,130\ncycles that are being used to power up the\ncards, and is there a way to disrupt that?\n\n1554\n01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:15,140\nAnd if we disrupt it, maybe manipulate it,\n\n1555\n01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:18,360\ncould we keep the card powered\non an extra second or two?\n\n1556\n01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,950\nOut beyond the window where it would\nnormally power up and present the data.\n\n1557\n01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:25,210\nAnd if so, can we then probe and\nget the data out of the card.\n\n1558\n01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:27,160\nThese are the different\nthings that we may do.\n\n1559\n01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:31,150\nThere's micro-probing, where we\nactually open the card itself, and\n\n1560\n01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:33,200\nwe go and\nattack the underlying electronics.\n\n1561\n01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:35,110\nSo we probe the antenna.\n\n1562\n01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:38,610\nWe probe the underlying smart\ncard technology with the chip.\n\n1563\n01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:40,990\nAnd we're looking for weaknesses, or\n\n1564\n01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,600\nperhaps attachment points\nwhere we can get in.\n\n1565\n01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,920\nAccess to the API code\nthat's running in the card,\n\n1566\n01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,900\nto see if we can somehow\nprogram it to give us stuff.\n\n1567\n01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:53,350\nThis stuff almost without exception, all\nof this, is done in a secure environment,\n\n1568\n01:15:53,350 --> 01:15:56,100\nsomewhere in a work bench,\nyou're not doing this in the wild.\n\n1569\n01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,710\nYou can't do this while somebody is\nwaving their card in the air at a reader.\n\n1570\n01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:00,470\nRight, it just doesn't work that way.\n\n1571\n01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:03,290\nYou gotta get the card,\nyou gotta put it up on a work bench.\n\n1572\n01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:06,410\nYou gotta basically attack it,\nby decompiling and\n\n1573\n01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:07,710\nfiguring out what's going on in there,\n\n1574\n01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:11,040\nto understand How to effectively\ngenerate information from them.\n\n1575\n01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:15,370\nThese attacks can be successful, but\nthey are very, very specialized.\n\n1576\n01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:18,090\nYou have to really understand\nthe architecture and\n\n1577\n01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:21,240\nthe inner workings of the system,\nto be able to generate information,\n\n1578\n01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:23,310\nby executing these kinds of attacks.\n\n1579\n01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:24,230\nJust be aware of that.\n\n1580\n01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,040\nSo let's talk about Cerberos.\n\n1581\n01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:32,200\nI know that we had thought about\nthe ideas behind all of the things that\n\n1582\n01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,530\nhave run up to a secure authentication\nsystem in our episodes here,\n\n1583\n01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:37,810\nas we've been developing\nthis discussion with you.\n\n1584\n01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:40,670\nWe've been talking about the different\nways in which we authorize,\n\n1585\n01:16:40,670 --> 01:16:43,320\nwe authenticate, and then we grant access.\n\n1586\n01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,910\nIn most modern directory\nbased systems today,\n\n1587\n01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:50,250\nCerberus is being used as one of those\nprimary drivers for this solution.\n\n1588\n01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:53,350\nWe have a URL there that\nwe've preloaded for you, or\n\n1589\n01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:56,540\nthat we are about to preload again,\nI should say, put that up there.\n\n1590\n01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:59,510\nIt's in the chat window for\nyou by the way, so you can see it there.\n\n1591\n01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:02,960\nAnd this is a graphic, we got this off\nof one of the Microsoft sites right?\n\n1592\n01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,050\nThe MSDN site.\n\n1593\n01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:07,260\nSo this is just gonna help us to\nillustrate how Cerberus works.\n\n1594\n01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:09,580\nYou know Microsoft did\nnot invent Cerberus, but\n\n1595\n01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:12,260\nthey have certainly taken it,\nimplanted it, and\n\n1596\n01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:16,010\nimplemented it into their directory\nservices since Windows 2000.\n\n1597\n01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:19,590\nSo it's been running for\nsome time now in one form or another.\n\n1598\n01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:24,187\nOriginal work done on Cerberos was\nknown as Project Athena at MIT,\n\n1599\n01:17:24,187 --> 01:17:26,750\nback in the '80s and the '90s.\n\n1600\n01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:29,950\nAnd, oh, there we go, perfect.\n\n1601\n01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,180\nWe think.\n\n1602\n01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:35,360\nSay, it looks good, but can we see it?\n\n1603\n01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,070\nAll right.\n\n1604\n01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:37,620\nWe do have this.\n\n1605\n01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:40,910\nThere is an RFC associated\nwith Cerberos as well.\n\n1606\n01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:43,840\nI don't remember the number off the top\nof my head, but we'll find that and\n\n1607\n01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,540\nput that out in the notes for\nyou as well at some point.\n\n1608\n01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:48,030\n>> Is it 1510?\nI've got 1510 stuck in my head.\n\n1609\n01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:48,570\n>> I wanna say 1510 or 1519.\n\n1610\n01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:50,020\nI don't remember which.\n\n1611\n01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:51,220\nIt's one of those two.\n\n1612\n01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:53,560\nBut either way,\nwe'll find the RFC for you, but\n\n1613\n01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:59,010\nlet's talk through what the steps are for\nCerberos, in terms of authentication.\n\n1614\n01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:03,450\nNow keep in mind this is a Microsoft\ndiagram, so these are going to look and\n\n1615\n01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:07,835\nfeel, and indeed are the way in which\nthis is done in the Microsoft world.\n\n1616\n01:18:07,835 --> 01:18:10,610\nCerberos generically,\nis used outside of Microsoft.\n\n1617\n01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:14,500\nIt is going to basically follow the same\nsteps, this is not a Microsoft centric\n\n1618\n01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,500\ndiscussion, I just want\nto make that clear.\n\n1619\n01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,380\nBut we do want to identify\nthe key components of the system,\n\n1620\n01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:21,260\nand then we will talk about how they work.\n\n1621\n01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:24,579\nWe may need to go to the top there,\nto see the KDC, I believe,\n\n1622\n01:18:24,579 --> 01:18:26,720\nin the authentication service.\n\n1623\n01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:31,580\nSo up at the top, we begin to build\nout Cerberos by installing a directory\n\n1624\n01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:32,730\nservice of some kind.\n\n1625\n01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:36,290\nRemember, ldap x.500\nis our standard there.\n\n1626\n01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:39,400\nSo in Windows this will be\na Microsoft domain controller.\n\n1627\n01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,550\nThe domain controller is the box,\nthe outer box.\n\n1628\n01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:46,730\nInside of it, as one of the things\nthat we put into it as a service.\n\n1629\n01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:48,482\nWe see Cerberos running.\n\n1630\n01:18:48,482 --> 01:18:52,240\nAnd Cerberos is substantiated inside\nthe domain controller, under the role of\n\n1631\n01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:56,150\nthe KDC, the key distribution center\nserver, is what we see there.\n\n1632\n01:18:56,150 --> 01:18:59,590\nSo the KDC is gonna be\nthe Cerberos functionality.\n\n1633\n01:18:59,590 --> 01:19:02,340\nThe KDC is made up of two sub-services,\n\n1634\n01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:05,970\nthe authentication service, and\nthe ticket granting service.\n\n1635\n01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:07,990\nThe AS and the TGS.\n\n1636\n01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:12,150\nThe authentication service will take\nthe initial conversation with the customer\n\n1637\n01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:13,360\ncoming in, the client.\n\n1638\n01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,430\nWe'll take a look at this\nflow here in a minute, and\n\n1639\n01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:18,700\nwill broker that conversation\naround validation of identity.\n\n1640\n01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:22,900\nThe authentication service will then\ntalk to the ticket granting service,\n\n1641\n01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:27,560\nin order to be able to insure,\nthat once we authenticate a user.\n\n1642\n01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:31,812\nThat user can request, and indeed be given\nan encrypted session key, and a ticket\n\n1643\n01:19:31,812 --> 01:19:36,245\ngranting key, or a ticket granting ticket,\nthat will then allow them to come back and\n\n1644\n01:19:36,245 --> 01:19:40,315\nrequest service tickets to initialize\nservice requests and use sessions with\n\n1645\n01:19:40,315 --> 01:19:44,840\nindividual machines, within the directory\nservice, within the forest somewhere.\n\n1646\n01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:48,200\nSo these are the building\nblocks of Kerberos up to, so\n\n1647\n01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:52,381\nthe KDC is not installed as a separate\nrole, referred to as a role,\n\n1648\n01:19:52,381 --> 01:19:55,840\nruns in the domain controller\nmade up of two services.\n\n1649\n01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:00,598\nBut we don't install this as a roll,\nthe way we would something like a web\n\n1650\n01:20:00,598 --> 01:20:05,060\nserver or file and print or\nUnix services or things like that.\n\n1651\n01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:10,110\nThe art and the science and the action\nof making a directory service, setting\n\n1652\n01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:14,540\nup a domain, building a domain controller\ninside of Windows brings with it the KDC.\n\n1653\n01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:18,527\nIt's automatically put in as part\nof the DCpromo process, right?\n\n1654\n01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:21,300\nWhere we do the implementation\nof the directory service.\n\n1655\n01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,690\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n1656\n01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:24,730\nThose of you that may be out\nthere thinking okay, so now,\n\n1657\n01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:26,460\nI have to go add this as a role.\n\n1658\n01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,880\nIf you built your domain controllers,\n\n1659\n01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:30,790\nyou're already running curb roast,\nyou already have this built in.\n\n1660\n01:20:30,790 --> 01:20:34,920\nNo additional work there on that\nside at least required to manage it.\n\n1661\n01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,819\nSo let's talk about the other\ncomponents of curb roast right.\n\n1662\n01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:41,230\nDown below were we have a work station.\n\n1663\n01:20:41,230 --> 01:20:43,090\nIt doesn't really matter what it is.\n\n1664\n01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:45,110\nA work station will be\na member of the directory.\n\n1665\n01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:46,320\nA member of the domain.\n\n1666\n01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,260\nIn order to use Curbrow.\n\n1667\n01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,930\nSo, we can see they\nare joined to the domain.\n\n1668\n01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:51,450\nAnd we will have a server.\n\n1669\n01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:55,970\nAgain a member of the domain that will be\nsomewhere else inside the infrastructure\n\n1670\n01:20:55,970 --> 01:20:59,620\nthat ultimately we will want to\nattach to and get services from.\n\n1671\n01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:02,340\nAnd so the way the Curbrow\nworks is the following.\n\n1672\n01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:06,330\nThe user, down at the bottom, on what we\ncall the client there at the work station,\n\n1673\n01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:08,970\nis going to go ahead and log on.\n\n1674\n01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:11,770\nSo step one,\nas you can see there, goes up to,\n\n1675\n01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:15,520\nthe log on request goes up to\nthe authentication service.\n\n1676\n01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,670\nIt goes through the LSA,\nthe Local Security Authority,\n\n1677\n01:21:18,670 --> 01:21:22,290\nwhich is the security module that runs\non the Windows based operating systems.\n\n1678\n01:21:22,290 --> 01:21:25,030\nIt's part of the modular\narchitecture of Windows.\n\n1679\n01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:27,650\nAnd so\nthe LSA is found on every Windows device.\n\n1680\n01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:31,000\nSo there's an LSA implementation\nthere on the work station,\n\n1681\n01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,260\none on the domain controller.\n\n1682\n01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,317\nThere is one also over on\nthe server on the right.\n\n1683\n01:21:34,317 --> 01:21:34,830\nAs you will see,\n\n1684\n01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:38,680\nit's just the local module that runs\nthe security kernel in Windows.\n\n1685\n01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:42,180\nWe send our authentication request\nout through that mechanism.\n\n1686\n01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:46,413\nSo we're at a log on screen, user name and\npassword to log into the domain.\n\n1687\n01:21:46,413 --> 01:21:49,880\nMay add in our biometrics with Smart Card,\nwherever it may be.\n\n1688\n01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:55,400\nSo we do that and we send that information\nover the wire up to the main controller.\n\n1689\n01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:59,508\nThe authentication service intercepts\nthat log on request, takes it,\n\n1690\n01:21:59,508 --> 01:22:00,728\nlooks at it, right?\n\n1691\n01:22:00,728 --> 01:22:02,540\nSays okay, who are you?\n\n1692\n01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:04,310\nNow, you've identified yourself.\n\n1693\n01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:05,850\nCan we authenticate you?\n\n1694\n01:22:05,850 --> 01:22:07,680\nThat's the next step in our process.\n\n1695\n01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:09,454\nSo we're authenticating there.\n\n1696\n01:22:09,454 --> 01:22:12,407\nSo provided that that happens.\n\n1697\n01:22:12,407 --> 01:22:15,610\nIf we have provided, in other words,\ncredentials that can be authenticated.\n\n1698\n01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:16,730\nAnd let's talk quickly,\n\n1699\n01:22:16,730 --> 01:22:19,340\njust about what happens inside\nthe directory to authenticate.\n\n1700\n01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:22,070\nSo what happens is the user\npresents with their username and\n\n1701\n01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:25,580\npassword which is hashed by the LSA.\n\n1702\n01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:28,550\nWe don't actually send the username and\npassword over the wire.\n\n1703\n01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:31,860\nWe send a hash, a representation\nof that from our prior episode.\n\n1704\n01:22:31,860 --> 01:22:33,420\nIf you remember, we went through and\n\n1705\n01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,930\nshowed you how to generate\na rainbow table with hashes.\n\n1706\n01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:41,010\nBut basically, we use a cryptographic\nalgorithm to represent that information.\n\n1707\n01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:43,220\nSend out a fix bit representation.\n\n1708\n01:22:43,220 --> 01:22:46,320\nWe compare the hash that is\nbeing received from the user\n\n1709\n01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,340\nalong with the hash that\nis stored in the directory.\n\n1710\n01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:49,760\nIf the two match, right?\n\n1711\n01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:50,560\nWe have a lock.\n\n1712\n01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:51,610\nWe know it's good.\n\n1713\n01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:53,720\nWe don't know who's on the other\nend of the wire by the way.\n\n1714\n01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:56,950\nIt may not be Don or\nAdam as authenticated users.\n\n1715\n01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:59,100\nIt could be somebody impersonating us.\n\n1716\n01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:00,790\nSo that is not unfortunately,\n\n1717\n01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:04,930\ngoing to be part of this process if it's\njust a username and a password by itself.\n\n1718\n01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:07,920\nIf we add a second\nfactor of authentication\n\n1719\n01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:11,040\nas we set some sort of biometric\nsolution like an iris scan.\n\n1720\n01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:15,080\nWe can authoritatively say,\nthat it really is Adam as opposed to Don.\n\n1721\n01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,695\nBut either way, we are simply hashing\nthe username and the password.\n\n1722\n01:23:18,695 --> 01:23:20,423\nSending that hash over and then,\n\n1723\n01:23:20,423 --> 01:23:24,640\ncomparing the hash up in\nthe authentication service inside the KDC.\n\n1724\n01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:29,160\nIf we find that to be a match,\nwhat happens is we send back information.\n\n1725\n01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,460\nThe bi-directional arrow flow.\n\n1726\n01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:33,370\nDon's gonna draw another\narrow in there for us.\n\n1727\n01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:34,560\nWe see the arrow coming back.\n\n1728\n01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:40,160\nThe user the client down at the bottom\nnow, has been authenticated.\n\n1729\n01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:43,820\nAnd now, in the same process,\nthey are going to acquire credentials.\n\n1730\n01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:45,790\nSo the authentication request has gone up.\n\n1731\n01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:48,403\nStep three down there is that\nthey acquire credentials.\n\n1732\n01:23:48,403 --> 01:23:54,160\nThe acquiring I should say, excuse me of\nthe credentials means that effectively\n\n1733\n01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:58,680\nwhat happens is the authentication\nservices said yes you are valid, talks to,\n\n1734\n01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:01,690\nand you might want to put an arrow\nbetween authentication service and\n\n1735\n01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:03,685\nticket granting service right there for\nus up top.\n\n1736\n01:24:03,685 --> 01:24:07,000\nSo these two are going to have\na bi-directional conversation.\n\n1737\n01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,180\nBasically, the authentication\nservice says, yeah, the user's good.\n\n1738\n01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:12,250\nThe ticket-granting service says, okay.\n\n1739\n01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:14,740\nAnd it issues an encrypted session key\n\n1740\n01:24:14,740 --> 01:24:18,440\nalong with a ticket-granting ticket\nto the user for their credential.\n\n1741\n01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,710\nThis actually gets\nissued down to the user,\n\n1742\n01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:25,200\ngets attached to their user token, as\npart of the generation of authentication\n\n1743\n01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:28,050\ninformation that is given to\nthe user to grant access.\n\n1744\n01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:32,690\nAnd then, the client, the end user now,\nhas the ability to start interacting with\n\n1745\n01:24:32,690 --> 01:24:37,280\nCerberus based directory services and\nCerberus based directory objects, right?\n\n1746\n01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:41,400\nData and\nhardware within the directory service.\n\n1747\n01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,680\nAnd so now, that's steps one\nthrough three, in effect, right?\n\n1748\n01:24:44,680 --> 01:24:45,840\nWe've done all that.\n\n1749\n01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:51,870\nNow, what we have to do is, we have\nto go out and request another ticket.\n\n1750\n01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:55,050\nWe just got what's known\nas a ticket granting ticket\n\n1751\n01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:56,850\nalong with our encrypted session key.\n\n1752\n01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:58,920\nWe now have to use that\nticket granting ticket,\n\n1753\n01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:03,110\nwalk back up to the authentication service\nand the ticket granting service and\n\n1754\n01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:05,670\nrequest what are known as service tickets,\nright?\n\n1755\n01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:07,670\nWhere we're gonna go out and\nget a separate ticket,\n\n1756\n01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:11,830\nthat will allow us effectively to go get\na web service down at the bottom lower\n\n1757\n01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:15,890\nright, or an email service, or\nsome sort of service we want to consume.\n\n1758\n01:25:15,890 --> 01:25:18,520\nMaybe it's DNS, maybe it's DHCP,\nwe don't know what it is.\n\n1759\n01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:23,120\nBut it'll some sort of service, and so we\nsend another request up there in orange.\n\n1760\n01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:25,800\nThe ticket granting service is\nnow going to be getting, and\n\n1761\n01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:26,990\nthe authentication services,\n\n1762\n01:25:26,990 --> 01:25:32,400\ngetting from us are encrypted session key,\nalong with our ticket granting ticket.\n\n1763\n01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,650\nSo the effect that we send back\nthe representation of that information and\n\n1764\n01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:37,300\nsay, hey, it's me.\n\n1765\n01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,740\nI now actually,\nwant to do business with you.\n\n1766\n01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:41,580\nI have the right to do business with you.\n\n1767\n01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:43,950\nNow, I want to request services.\n\n1768\n01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:46,040\nSo that's what's happening now.\n\n1769\n01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:49,040\nAnd so once that happens,\nwe get back in step five.\n\n1770\n01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,500\nStep five's the ticket request.\n\n1771\n01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,170\nWe get back at the end of that.\n\n1772\n01:25:52,170 --> 01:25:57,190\nThe ability now to go out and make\na request for services off to the right.\n\n1773\n01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:00,358\nAnd so we're now,\ngiven another encrypted session key and\n\n1774\n01:26:00,358 --> 01:26:04,600\nservice ticket that will then allow\nus to go out and request services.\n\n1775\n01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:08,950\nAnd so now in step six, we make\na request out to whatever server, or\n\n1776\n01:26:08,950 --> 01:26:11,210\nend point we want to get services from.\n\n1777\n01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:16,950\nThis could be an end point device\nthat is running this service.\n\n1778\n01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:20,281\nIt could be an actual physical box, right?\n\n1779\n01:26:20,281 --> 01:26:21,440\nSo it could be an actual virtual box.\n\n1780\n01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,500\nIt doesn't really matter what it is,\ncould be a file to print,\n\n1781\n01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:27,930\ncould be DNS running on a router, or DNS\nrunning, excuse me, rather, on a firewall.\n\n1782\n01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:30,760\nOr could be DHCP running on a firewall,\nor a router,\n\n1783\n01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,970\nwireless router access device,\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n1784\n01:26:33,970 --> 01:26:36,410\nSo the idea there is we're\ngonna make that request.\n\n1785\n01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:39,960\nWe are then going to, as you can see,\nin step six, make the request.\n\n1786\n01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:42,870\nStep seven,\nwe go out to the local security authority.\n\n1787\n01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:45,230\nThis is within the box that\nwe're requesting from.\n\n1788\n01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:49,990\nAnd we do the process of validating our\ncredential, making sure the encrypted\n\n1789\n01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:54,400\nsession key along with the service ticket\nthat we have been granted, or validated so\n\n1790\n01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:56,310\nwe can access the right service.\n\n1791\n01:26:56,310 --> 01:27:00,760\nWe may be requesting DHCP or DNS services,\nbut this box may not have DNS.\n\n1792\n01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,840\nIt may have to forward it out and\nyou get it from somewhere else.\n\n1793\n01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:05,160\nSo, we'll do the dance there.\n\n1794\n01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,460\nAnd then assuming everything\nis good at the bottom,\n\n1795\n01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,580\nI think under the yellow\narrow there at the bottom.\n\n1796\n01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:10,470\nStep nine.\n\n1797\n01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:11,810\nWe have a response coming back.\n\n1798\n01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:14,050\nYeah, I think you're just\nkind of on top of it there.\n\n1799\n01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:15,720\nWe have our response coming back.\n\n1800\n01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:20,840\nAnd then we consume the service, assuming\nthat we were able to use that service.\n\n1801\n01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:23,320\nNow what we also want to\nunderstand about Kerberos is,\n\n1802\n01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:26,760\nthis is a time-based\nticket stamping system.\n\n1803\n01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,790\nSo much like when you go to a parking\ngarage and they issue a ticket, and you\n\n1804\n01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:33,320\nhave to stamp that ticket for time access,\nand then hours later you come back,\n\n1805\n01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,490\nyou pay based on the prorated amount\nof time you've been in the garage.\n\n1806\n01:27:36,490 --> 01:27:38,940\nSame concept,\nexcept we're not parking cars.\n\n1807\n01:27:38,940 --> 01:27:40,410\nWe're requesting services.\n\n1808\n01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:42,750\nSo when we get those tickets,\nthey are timed stamped.\n\n1809\n01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:43,410\nWhich means that,\n\n1810\n01:27:43,410 --> 01:27:46,870\nif we are not doing time synchronization,\nwe are going to have a problem.\n\n1811\n01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:48,540\nSo I'll remind you.\n\n1812\n01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:53,340\nWe've talked about this in some of our\nprior episodes in another program in SSCP.\n\n1813\n01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:55,318\nIf you're interested in that information,\n\n1814\n01:27:55,318 --> 01:27:58,550\nI encourage you to watch those episodes\nthere in the networking section.\n\n1815\n01:27:58,550 --> 01:28:02,081\nWe will be talking about the same\nconcept in the network and\n\n1816\n01:28:02,081 --> 01:28:05,270\ntelecommunications area\nof CISSP in future shows.\n\n1817\n01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:09,210\nBut we talk about protocols,\nand specifically the NTP,\n\n1818\n01:28:09,210 --> 01:28:13,030\nNetwork Time Protocol, that is used\nin order to do time synchronization.\n\n1819\n01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:15,060\nThis will be running on port 123.\n\n1820\n01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:18,057\nAnd this is going to allow\nus to be able to go out and\n\n1821\n01:28:18,057 --> 01:28:21,535\nuse time synchronization to\nvalidate our time stamps.\n\n1822\n01:28:21,535 --> 01:28:25,300\nNow the key with Kerberos is that you\nmust keep the domain controllers,\n\n1823\n01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,430\nthe KDCs, time synchronized.\n\n1824\n01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:31,100\nThey must be within a five minute\nwindow of synchronization by default.\n\n1825\n01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:33,970\nAgain, this is a variable solution,\ncould be modified.\n\n1826\n01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:37,230\nWe can use tools like Kerbtray,\nwhich is a management tool for\n\n1827\n01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:40,870\nKerberos to look at the tools, or\nthe tickets rather, that are granted.\n\n1828\n01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:43,840\nWe also could modify this as group policy.\n\n1829\n01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:47,330\nBut we have a five minute time drift\nvariable here that we can allow for.\n\n1830\n01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:52,020\nIf we get outside the five minute window,\nwe actually see what is known as a denial\n\n1831\n01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:54,820\nof service attack being carried\nout because we can decouple,\n\n1832\n01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:56,600\ndesynchronize these domain controllers.\n\n1833\n01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,040\nNow it's very easy to fix this problem.\n\n1834\n01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,310\nJust simply resynchronize all\nthe domain controllers and\n\n1835\n01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:02,760\neverything starts working again.\n\n1836\n01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,130\nBut if you desynchronize,\n\n1837\n01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:08,180\nif you get outside that five minute\nwindow, literally everything you do stops.\n\n1838\n01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:11,680\nNo transmission of information back and\nforth inside the system.\n\n1839\n01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,410\nNobody can log in and authenticate.\n\n1840\n01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:17,248\nNobody can access resources, because no\nway to authenticate that origination point\n\n1841\n01:29:17,248 --> 01:29:19,500\nfor the ticket based on the time.\n\n1842\n01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:23,060\nWe also want to understand as we wrap\nup our conversation with Kerberos here,\n\n1843\n01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:26,130\nthat these tickets are time stamped for\na period of time.\n\n1844\n01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:29,330\nThe default carrying solution,\nthe time solution,\n\n1845\n01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:34,510\nthe TTL in the system when you spin it up\nis typically seven days plus one session,\n\n1846\n01:29:34,510 --> 01:29:38,150\nwhich can be up to seven and a half\ndays depending on how you architect it.\n\n1847\n01:29:38,150 --> 01:29:41,990\nAnd so as a result, if I stay logged in\nfor up to seven days, for an entire week,\n\n1848\n01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:47,140\nI may not actually have to go back and\nrequest another encrypted session key and\n\n1849\n01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:50,040\nanother ticket granting ticket\nto start the process off.\n\n1850\n01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,140\nI request service keys\nas I go along the way.\n\n1851\n01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:54,775\nSo I can keep that key and\n\n1852\n01:29:54,775 --> 01:29:58,465\nthat session key as well at that ticket\ngranting ticket for up to a week.\n\n1853\n01:29:58,465 --> 01:29:59,665\nBut if I log out,\n\n1854\n01:29:59,665 --> 01:30:02,865\nI then obviously re-engage in this\nprocess every time I log back in.\n\n1855\n01:30:02,865 --> 01:30:04,055\nNow keep in mind also,\n\n1856\n01:30:04,055 --> 01:30:08,302\nfrom a security standpoint here,\nbased on Windows security specifically and\n\n1857\n01:30:08,302 --> 01:30:13,012\nthe way we issue or create the tokens for\nusers as they log in.\n\n1858\n01:30:13,012 --> 01:30:17,538\nTokens are static, which means that if you\nlog on, your user information, your sum\n\n1859\n01:30:17,538 --> 01:30:21,646\ntotal of you as a user, your permissions,\nyour group member memberships.\n\n1860\n01:30:21,646 --> 01:30:25,073\nAll the stuff you can do,\nis generated for you in a token,\n\n1861\n01:30:25,073 --> 01:30:30,075\ngiven to you with what's called a UUID,\nUniversally Unique ID within the forest,\n\n1862\n01:30:30,075 --> 01:30:34,238\nand is attached to your user session,\nlogically as you log in.\n\n1863\n01:30:34,238 --> 01:30:38,378\nThat's why SSO works, single sign-on,\nand all this other stuff we talk about.\n\n1864\n01:30:38,378 --> 01:30:42,448\nIf you have ever been in the position\nwhere you've had to change a user's\n\n1865\n01:30:42,448 --> 01:30:47,208\ngroup membership, a user's permissions to\ndo things, you've had to log them out and\n\n1866\n01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:49,868\nlog them back on in order to\nget that change to take effect.\n\n1867\n01:30:49,868 --> 01:30:51,808\nThe reason is the token is static.\n\n1868\n01:30:51,808 --> 01:30:52,598\nSame idea here.\n\n1869\n01:30:52,598 --> 01:30:54,038\nIf you don't log someone out,\n\n1870\n01:30:54,038 --> 01:30:56,590\nthose Kerberos keys stay\nactive until they log out.\n\n1871\n01:30:56,590 --> 01:30:58,640\nIf you change their permission,\nthey may or\n\n1872\n01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:01,460\nmay not be able to\naccess things logically.\n\n1873\n01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:04,340\nBut because they have that prior\npermission associated with\n\n1874\n01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:07,020\ntheir credential, that's not\ngonna change until they log out.\n\n1875\n01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:07,940\nAll right?\n\n1876\n01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:10,710\nSo understand all these things\nwhen we talk about Kerberos.\n\n1877\n01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:14,355\nThe ways we manipulate the system,\nimplement it, work with it,\n\n1878\n01:31:14,355 --> 01:31:15,720\ngenerate the tickets.\n\n1879\n01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:19,070\nAs well as understanding the weaknesses,\nthe liabilities of Kerberos\n\n1880\n01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:24,020\nthrough time synchronization\nare all gonna be very important.\n\n1881\n01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:24,761\n>> All right, well, Adam,\n\n1882\n01:31:24,761 --> 01:31:26,600\nI think that's a pretty good\nstopping point for us right there.\n\n1883\n01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:27,520\n>> It is.\n\n1884\n01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,340\n>> We've got more to\ngo on access controls.\n\n1885\n01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:34,090\nI know we've got a few different things\nlike access control models and stuff, but\n\n1886\n01:31:34,090 --> 01:31:35,600\nthis is a pretty good point to stop.\n\n1887\n01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,460\nSo what we'll do is\nwe'll break this up and\n\n1888\n01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:40,100\nwe'll actually have\nan Access Controls Part 2 episode.\n\n1889\n01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:41,220\nSo-\n>> Yay!\n\n1890\n01:31:41,220 --> 01:31:42,365\n>> So stay tuned for that.\n\n1891\n01:31:42,365 --> 01:31:45,340\nYeah, tons of Access Control\ninformation but\n\n1892\n01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:48,950\nit kind of goes back to reinforce\nhow important a topic this is,\n\n1893\n01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:53,095\nthat as security professional,\ncontrolling access is kinda your gig.\n\n1894\n01:31:53,095 --> 01:31:55,050\n[LAUGH]\n>> It's the bread and the butter,\n\n1895\n01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:55,880\nas we say, right?\n\n1896\n01:31:55,880 --> 01:31:57,370\nIf you get this wrong,\n\n1897\n01:31:57,370 --> 01:32:00,500\neverything else you build on top of\nit is just gonna be a house of cards.\n\n1898\n01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,260\n>> Yep.\n\n1899\n01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:02,710\nSo let's go ahead and wrap it up here.\n\n1900\n01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:03,850\nI do want to remind you guys,\n\n1901\n01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:08,910\nif you ever have any questions live during\nthe show, you can go to itpro.tv/live,\n\n1902\n01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:11,370\nand right beneath the video\nyou'll see the chat room.\n\n1903\n01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:12,810\nYou can post your questions there.\n\n1904\n01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:14,500\nWe monitor and answer during the show.\n\n1905\n01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:18,050\nAlso, if you have questions after the\nshow, if you're watching this recorded,\n\n1906\n01:32:18,050 --> 01:32:21,350\nyou can jump over to the Q&A\nsection at the top of every page.\n\n1907\n01:32:21,350 --> 01:32:23,490\nOn itpro.tv you'll see and\nlink that says Q&A.\n\n1908\n01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:24,830\nJust click on it.\n\n1909\n01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:26,400\nIt'll take you into our Q&A forums.\n\n1910\n01:32:26,400

00:00:40,190\nI'm Mike Roderick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n4\n00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,590\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n5\n00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,140\nI am awesome, Mike, how are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,090\n>> You know, it's just a great day.\n\n7\n00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,600\nIt's Friday, if you're watching this live,\nso that's a good thing.\n\n8\n00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,330\nAlthough, I think we plan on being\nhere all weekend as well so.\n\n9\n00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,320\n>> We never leave.\n\n10\n00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,270\nYou don't see it but there's a chain and\n\n11\n00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,000\na ball linking me to the off screen of the\npoll here that they keep me tethered to.\n\n12\n00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,680\n>> Again, welcome everybody.\n\n13\n00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,450\nWe got an exciting episode today.\n\n14\n00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,610\nWe are going to be going\nover access control.\n\n15\n00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,610\nI believe, this is actually part two.\n\n16\n00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,230\nHopefully, you guys saw\nthe previous episode.\n\n17\n00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:09,970\nSaw part one.\n\n18\n00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,030\nWe're just gonna dive right back in and\nkeep on going with some access control.\n\n19\n00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,470\nYou know speaking about access control.\n\n20\n00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,630\nLet's talk a bit more, we had left off in\nour prior episodes talking about among\n\n21\n00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,310\nother things curbarose, how curbarose\nworks, broke that process down for you.\n\n22\n00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,186\nHopefully you guys are feeling\na little bit more comfortable\n\n23\n00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:28,930\nwith that whole thing.\n\n24\n00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,410\nTalks a little bit about\ndirectory services.\n\n25\n00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,060\nGenerically ldaps,\nx500 based solutions and\n\n26\n00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,110\ntalked about a lot of\nthe underlined architect.\n\n27\n00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,980\nThe though processes associated\nwith access control.\n\n28\n00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,060\nWe wanna do now is go in and\n\n29\n00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:45,740\ntalk a little bit, drill down another\nlayer, talk about access control models.\n\n30\n00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,730\nSo take some of the stuff we've been using\nas building blocks, conceptual ideas,\n\n31\n00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,980\nstart building some ways in which\nwe apply access control to systems.\n\n32\n00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,647\nWe'll be talking about things like\ndiscretionary, mandatory, rule-based,\n\n33\n00:01:56,647 --> 00:02:01,150\nrole-based, content and context-dependent\naccess control mechanisms,\n\n34\n00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,140\namong other things that we will go\nthrough and talk about with you.\n\n35\n00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,370\nWanna take this opportunity,\nfirst though, to kind of frame,\n\n36\n00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,610\nsince this is a new show and\na new episode in a new show,\n\n37\n00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,770\nframe the conversation back to\nthe very beginning of Access Control.\n\n38\n00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:17,300\nIn case you haven't seen our first\nepisodes on this topic, remember we always\n\n39\n00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,140\ntalk about confidentiality, we talk about\nintegrity, we talk about availability.\n\n40\n00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,980\nWe talk about any of these areas for\ninformation security within CISP.\n\n41\n00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,900\nAnd we're really focusing\nhere on all three.\n\n42\n00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,670\nWe are talking about access control.\n\n43\n00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,290\nWe want to make sure how\nto safeguard information.\n\n44\n00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:37,110\nHow to provide integrity of information,\nas well as availability of information.\n\n45\n00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,650\nAnd so the access control model is really\na framework that helps us to understand\n\n46\n00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,190\nhow to do that and that's what were\nthinking about, what we're talking about\n\n47\n00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,580\nas we start building out some\ninformation and thought process here.\n\n48\n00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,100\nSo let's start with some of our notes.\n\n49\n00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,370\nYou know we've put some stuff together and\n\n50\n00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,680\nlet's put those up let's\ntalk about what they are.\n\n51\n00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,290\nSo, the discretionary\naccess control concept\n\n52\n00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,610\nis going to be making sure\nthat we have this idea...\n\n53\n00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,230\nThat, and we're used to this,\nby the way, right?\n\n54\n00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,480\nDiscretionary access control for\n\n55\n00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,230\nmost of us is probably the way we\nadminister most of our systems.\n\n56\n00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,570\nThis is a Windows-based traditionally,\na thought process around a Windows-based\n\n57\n00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:14,580\nmodel, so discretionary access control\nis gonna be where the owner of the data.\n\n58\n00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,070\nRight?\nIs going to say I have created a file or\n\n59\n00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,440\nsomething like that and I put it into\nthe system and I have set up and\n\n60\n00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,240\naccess control list and\nthen I am going to go ahead and\n\n61\n00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,960\nallow people access to it based on group\nmembership or some sort of criteria.\n\n62\n00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,550\nAnd maybe what we could do is do\na quick Windows Explorer look, so\n\n63\n00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:34,280\nmaybe just a Win E to bring up Explorer.\n\n64\n00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,580\nPick a file, doesn't matter,\nwe could do any of those.\n\n65\n00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,160\nAnd yeah,\njust do a quick properties there.\n\n66\n00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,520\nIf you go to the security area,\n\n67\n00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,635\nmaybe we'll just zoom in real quick for\na second.\n\n68\n00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:45,215\nWell we can see again, traditional\nWindows, traditional Linux models as well.\n\n69\n00:03:45,215 --> 00:03:48,245\nBy the way, you know,\nthis works in Linux, it just depends on\n\n70\n00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:51,035\nyour build of the operating system,\nwhat distributing you may be running.\n\n71\n00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:54,075\nYou may or may not have X Windows or\ngraphical overlay running in it.\n\n72\n00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:57,405\nThis may be more of a command line thing\nwhere you look at attributes on a file\n\n73\n00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,685\nto see security.\n\n74\n00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:01,595\nBut at the end of the day, this is\nbasically what you're going to see.\n\n75\n00:04:01,595 --> 00:04:03,945\nAnd so you'll see groups or\nusers are listed there.\n\n76\n00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:08,610\nHere we have a system group, you have Mike\nas the person who owns this particular,\n\n77\n00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,510\nwhatever this thing is, this notepad,\n[INAUDIBLE] that we're doing.\n\n78\n00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,930\nAnd so Mike's there and\n\n79\n00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,270\nwe have administrators there\ninside of Mike's system.\n\n80\n00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,295\nSo we could see that depending on who\nwe You hover over, you've got SYSTEM,\n\n81\n00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:21,925\nmaybe we'll go down and\nlook at you real quick as a user.\n\n82\n00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:22,885\n>> I'm gonna zoom out real quick.\n\n83\n00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:25,055\n>> Yeah, select, right, and\nthen just zoom back in, absolutely.\n\n84\n00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:26,013\n>> [CROSSTALK] so\nI can click on some things.\n\n85\n00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:26,975\n>> There we go, right.\n\n86\n00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,935\nSo we can see that the permission set may\nor may not change, because all three,\n\n87\n00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:32,940\nI have a feeling, of these are gonna have.\n\n88\n00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,425\nThe standard permissions we see.\n\n89\n00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But if we look at special permissions\n\n90\n00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,100\nif we were to drill down-\n>> Right.\n\n91\n00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,415\n>> Under advanced, we would actually\nbe able to see probably a difference.\n\n92\n00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:42,060\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n93\n00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,100\n>> Right?\nBecause we can see well,\n\n94\n00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,200\nthey actually all have full control.\n\n95\n00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,150\nSo there would be no difference there.\n\n96\n00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,440\n>> Yeah, you have to go in here-\n>> Well we could ask somebody.\n\n97\n00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,080\nIt doesn't really matter.\n\n98\n00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,760\nThe point is-\n>> Yeah, we could ask somebody.\n\n99\n00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,370\n>> We just know that we can assign\npermission here, as you see, and\n\n100\n00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,090\nif we scroll up.\n\n101\n00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,420\n>> A little tricky to do when\nI'm zoomed in quite that far.\n\n102\n00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,030\n>> Quite that far.\n\n103\n00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,550\nOkay, so when we do zoom back in,\nzoom out and\n\n104\n00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,045\nzoom back in rather, what we will find\nis that we have a list of permissions.\n\n105\n00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:04,040\nSo we basically can select them and\n\n106\n00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,870\nthen we have the discretion, hence\nthe term discretionary access control.\n\n107\n00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,330\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> To assign permissions\n\n108\n00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,510\nto an individual user,\nwhoever that may be.\n\n109\n00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,960\nAnd so we have full control, modify,\nread and execute, read write and\n\n110\n00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,350\nthen we may have special permissions\ndepending on whether we think that\n\n111\n00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,525\nthere may be a need to drill\nfurther down and be more granular.\n\n112\n00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:24,820\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n113\n00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,840\n>> And so we see for the user Don,\nwe see that there is read and execute and\n\n114\n00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,160\nread and write assigned.\n\n115\n00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,660\nAbsolutely.\n\n116\n00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,140\nAll right, very good.\n\n117\n00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,060\nSo this is what we would call\na discretionary access control\n\n118\n00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,390\n>> Only at the discretion\n\n119\n00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,780\nof the owner of the object, right?\n\n120\n00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,222\n>> At the discretion of\nthe owner of the object, right,\n\n121\n00:05:41,222 --> 00:05:42,810\nor somebody who's been\ndelegated that right.\n\n122\n00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,640\nSo the full control administrator could\ntake the, Use the take ownership property,\n\n123\n00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,970\nto take control and\nbecome creator owner and\n\n124\n00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,910\nthen that could re-assign\npermissions as well.\n\n125\n00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,740\nThat will be one of those special\npermissions that we didn't show but\n\n126\n00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,260\nwe did talk about the take\nownership permission.\n\n127\n00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,130\nThen mandatory access\ncontrol we call MAC Right?\n\n128\n00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,950\nOwner of the data mandates\nwho has access and\n\n129\n00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,390\nthe idea here is that data\nhas to be classified.\n\n130\n00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,420\nSo we have classification\nof data taking place.\n\n131\n00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,360\nWe label some different classifications.\n\n132\n00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,360\nYou may see there, secret,\ntop secret, things like that.\n\n133\n00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,662\nIt may or may not be that by the way.\n\n134\n00:06:15,662 --> 00:06:16,730\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You can come up with your own\n\n135\n00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,620\nclassification rankings, but\n\n136\n00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,540\nthe idea is that they will be specific\nto the data that you are using.\n\n137\n00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,570\nClassified by owner, we do what are called\nsensitivity labels to classify the data,\n\n138\n00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,030\nand then if you are looking\nat secret data,\n\n139\n00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,450\nyou must be in a group that has\nsecret access or above, right?\n\n140\n00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,965\nIf you are in a group that is, maybe, only\npublic data, you would not see secret,.\n\n141\n00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:36,181\n[CROSSTALK] For instance, right?\n\n142\n00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:38,060\nYou wouldn't get access to it,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n143\n00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,390\nSo then we have Role Based Access Control,\nwhat we call RBAC.\n\n144\n00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,440\nNow this is one of those areas I'll\njust quickly point out for those of you\n\n145\n00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,730\nthat are following along with us that we\nhappen to show an acronym there for all\n\n146\n00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,160\nthree of these, the acronym for role based\nis traditionally considered to be RBAC.\n\n147\n00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,280\nBut you'll notice right below we have\nrule based and there is no acronym,\n\n148\n00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520\nbecause in effect it\nwould be RBAC as well.\n\n149\n00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,670\nAnd so I've made reference to this\nin some of our earlier episodes and\n\n150\n00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,600\nsome of the other shows.\n\n151\n00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,980\nYou don't want to be\nfocussed on acronyms per se,\n\n152\n00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,890\nyou always want to be aware of what they\nare, but they will be spelled out for\n\n153\n00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:09,970\nyou in an exam like this so\nthat there is no confusion.\n\n154\n00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,917\nSo as a result, don't waste time studying\nand remembering what acronyms are.\n\n155\n00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:17,250\nSimply make sure that you understand\nthe concept we're talking about.\n\n156\n00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,810\nIf it's something very generic,\nvery basic like TCPIP as protocol,\n\n157\n00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,240\nright, we're going to assume you\nwould hopefully know what TCPIP is.\n\n158\n00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,090\nWe probably won't spell that out,\nbut it's pretty ubiquitous and\n\n159\n00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,870\neverybody understands it's protocol for\nnetwork access.\n\n160\n00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,990\nBut, for something like this,\nthere is a distinction.\n\n161\n00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,540\nSo let's focus on what it is,\nrole versus, this is rule based.\n\n162\n00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,920\nAnd role based is going\nto be that we have,\n\n163\n00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,850\nyou identified roles of\ngroups that we're members of.\n\n164\n00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,260\nWe listed a couple there.\n\n165\n00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,060\nBackup Administrator, right?\n\n166\n00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,578\nThere could be another one, like perhaps\nEnterprise Admin, in the Windows world,\n\n167\n00:07:50,578 --> 00:07:54,792\nor it could be a restore role, or\nit could be a file manager role.\n\n168\n00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,833\nThere's all these different roles.\n\n169\n00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:58,996\nSo these are going to be groups that\nwe are assigned to that give us rights\n\n170\n00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:00,230\nbased on that.\n\n171\n00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,083\nAnd this is a task based solution, right?\n\n172\n00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,720\nTask based period we are done.\n\n173\n00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,350\nPeriod was theirs, nothing else to say,\nthat was to create a full stop for\n\n174\n00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,145\nus there so they are task based.\n\n175\n00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:13,250\nWhere as rule based,\nrule based access control\n\n176\n00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,970\nis gonna be what we traditionally see\nin something like a gateway device,\n\n177\n00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,820\na border device, something such\nas a firewall, perhaps a router.\n\n178\n00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:26,980\nAn IDS or an IPS where we are going\nto have some sort of business logic,\n\n179\n00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,730\nsome sort of rule set that will\nallow us to then look at behavior,\n\n180\n00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,230\nlook at content, look at entered in\ntraffic and measure against expectation.\n\n181\n00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,960\nThat is what rule base will do.\n\n182\n00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,700\nYes or no is this matching the rule,\nis it not?\n\n183\n00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,290\nDo we allow?\n\n184\n00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,400\nDo we not allow?\n\n185\n00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,660\nAre you on the access list?\n\n186\n00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,370\nAre you not whatever that may be?\n\n187\n00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,170\nThese are the kind of things that we would\nbe thinking about when we think about\n\n188\n00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,010\nrule based.\n\n189\n00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,710\nSo just have a sense of that.\n\n190\n00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,570\nYou guys out there that are listening\nalong with us here or perhaps watching us\n\n191\n00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,940\nif it's not live later on,\nyou use this stuff all the time, right?\n\n192\n00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,830\nYou're always accessing files in a system\nwhen you're at work and even at home.\n\n193\n00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:03,450\nYou're always having discretionary\naccess control running.\n\n194\n00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,020\nYou may or\nmay not see mandatory access control.\n\n195\n00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,520\nBut role based axis control operates in\nthe Windows world all the time, right?\n\n196\n00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,560\n>> When you log on in that\nadministrator's group.\n\n197\n00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,465\n>> Or any group you're in.\n\n198\n00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:13,101\n>> [CROSSTALK] work, yeah.\n\n199\n00:09:13,101 --> 00:09:13,670\n>> Absolutely.\n\n200\n00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,220\nAnd then of course rule based,\nwe use as well all the time.\n\n201\n00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,741\nYou surf the internet, you access anything\nthrough some sort of a gateway device\n\n202\n00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:21,710\nyou're using or\nyou may not be aware of it of course.\n\n203\n00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,430\nBut you are transiting through some\nsort of rule based access control\n\n204\n00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,060\nsystem, right.\n\n205\n00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,990\nYou could actually even think\nabout the tolls on a highway.\n\n206\n00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,200\nYou know here in Florida we have\nthe turnpike for instance right?\n\n207\n00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,630\nWe have a lot of the highways, I-95 now\nhas toll lanes on it, things like that.\n\n208\n00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,300\nYeah.\n>> Right,\n\n209\n00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,590\nbee line expressway if you're\ngoing over towards Orlando and\n\n210\n00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,010\nTampa, that whole thing.\n\n211\n00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,630\nSo you know, all of those,\nwhen you have tollgates on a road and\n\n212\n00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,500\nyou have a sun pass right down here in\nFlorida anyway they're called sun passes,\n\n213\n00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,500\neasy pass in other parts of the country\ndepending on where you are.\n\n214\n00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,120\nAnd whatever you do, that automated toll\npayment system with the little box you\n\n215\n00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,880\nput up on your windshield,\nthe little sticker.\n\n216\n00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,000\nWhen you do that you go through\nthe fast pay lane, right,\n\n217\n00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,400\nso you're not being stuck having to\nwait to give change and whatever.\n\n218\n00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,520\nAt least in theory it's\nsupposed to be faster?\n\n219\n00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,770\nSo you get the person that\ngets into the wrong lane, and\n\n220\n00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:10,320\nhas to have the conversation about why\nthey can't pay more often than not.\n\n221\n00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,460\nWe call that a collision\npacket in a network.\n\n222\n00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,260\nWhen you do that, if everything goes well.\n\n223\n00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,470\nYou can tell I'm a very nice driver,\nany issues at all, love driving.\n\n224\n00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,124\nI never get [CROSSTALK] slow people.\n\n225\n00:10:22,124 --> 00:10:23,410\nBut if that does happen.\n\n226\n00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,530\nThen what would happen is you go through\nthat lane and the gate goes up and\n\n227\n00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,880\nyou're able to keep going.\n\n228\n00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,050\nThat's a rule based model.\n\n229\n00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,330\nBecause the rule is if you have the device\nand you've got money on the device,\n\n230\n00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,180\nand we can read it off your system as\nyou go by, we're going to allow you out.\n\n231\n00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,840\nIf you don't we're going to stop you,\nput the gate down and\n\n232\n00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,370\nobviously make everybody behind you\njust miserable while we wait for\n\n233\n00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,480\nyou to figure out how to be\na better driver next time.\n\n234\n00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,340\nSo don't be that person.\n\n235\n00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,070\nYou don't wanna be that person.\n\n236\n00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,830\n>> I mean they only start the signs like\na mile or two out from the tollbooth.\n\n237\n00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,850\n>> You know I found and maybe it's\na function of getting older, I dunno.\n\n238\n00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:00,190\nI mean I got a little bit more\nsnow on the roof than you do.\n\n239\n00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,100\n>> I'm getting there.\n\n240\n00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,358\n>> So when I think about this,\n\n241\n00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:06,600\nI remember when I started out driving\nwhen I was a kid at 15 years old.\n\n242\n00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,090\nBack in the day when I was growing up you\ncould get a license at 15 in Florida, and\n\n243\n00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,670\nso I was terrorizing streets\naround my house pretty early on.\n\n244\n00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,040\nBut I remember when I was\n\n245\n00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,120\ngrowing up driving 30 something years\nago at this point as a young teenager.\n\n246\n00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,420\nI would go out and you didn't have all\nthis automatic pay and all this stuff.\n\n247\n00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,380\nBut you go out.\n\n248\n00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,370\nYou learn how to be a good driver.\n\n249\n00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,140\nYou went through driver's\ned whatever it was.\n\n250\n00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:34,970\nYou didn't have cell phones back in that\npre cell phone day back in the old times.\n\n251\n00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,464\nAnd so if you wanted to make a phone\ncall you pulled off the road,\n\n252\n00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:38,230\nfound a pay phone.\n\n253\n00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,805\nYou got out of your car,\ndisconnected from the driving concept.\n\n254\n00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:44,057\n>> Give them a dime,\nhave some lose change in there.\n\n255\n00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:46,210\n>> I remember when they were a nickel.\n\n256\n00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,730\nYou know, yeah I go way back.\n\n257\n00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,440\nBut you know the idea there was you were\nnot distracted by all these other things.\n\n258\n00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,222\nSo if you were driving the only thing\nthat distracted you was the radio.\n\n259\n00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:56,061\n>> Yeah, the 8 track.\n\n260\n00:11:56,061 --> 00:11:56,760\n>> You know right.\n\n261\n00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,280\nThe H Track.\n\n262\n00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,980\nI actually had a photograph\nrecord player in mine.\n\n263\n00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,180\nMount it on a set of springs you\njust throw a record on there.\n\n264\n00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,190\nYou know you didn't have\nall this other stuff so\n\n265\n00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,230\ntoday when I'm driving and I see all these\npeople on the roads doing this stuff.\n\n266\n00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,320\nIt's amazing what you see.\n\n267\n00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,310\nYou see people putting on makeup.\n\n268\n00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,260\n>> Everything but driving.\n\n269\n00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,780\n>> And not just women either.\n\n270\n00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,000\nYou see people putting on makeup.\n\n271\n00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,670\nI'm sorry, it's Friday guys.\n\n272\n00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,170\nBut you see all this stuff and\nliterally I've seen crazy things.\n\n273\n00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,160\nI've seen people reading books.\n\n274\n00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,860\n>> Yes, and of course,\nthe texting and the calling.\n\n275\n00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,920\n>> Texting, and oh my God unbelievable.\n\n276\n00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,890\n>> Yeah anyway.\n\n277\n00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,123\nWe could go on for hours about that.\n\n278\n00:12:31,123 --> 00:12:33,360\n>> We could rename this whole\nsegment just call it traffic and\n\n279\n00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,590\njust talk about traffic.\n\n280\n00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,680\nAlright, let's get back to\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n281\n00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,780\nEnough divergent behavior here.\n\n282\n00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,990\nSo now that we understand\nthe basic roles involved, or\n\n283\n00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,970\nrather, the basic lay of the land\nif you will around the models for\n\n284\n00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,150\ndiscretionary mandatory role and\nrule based access control.\n\n285\n00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,390\nLet's build in some additional vocabulary.\n\n286\n00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:53,710\nThrowing a lot of terms that you hear,\nhaving you define a lot of things,\n\n287\n00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,170\nunderstand what they are.\n\n288\n00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,240\nRemember as you go back and prepare and\nstart thinking about answering questions,\n\n289\n00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,190\nthese vocabulary terms we're defining for\n\n290\n00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:03,000\nyou are going to be things\nyou want to make notes of.\n\n291\n00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,160\nYou want to be able to work with,\nunderstand the meaning of.\n\n292\n00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,540\nBe able to do in effect,\n\n293\n00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,909\nreproduce that knowledge as you\nare asked questions about it.\n\n294\n00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,670\nSo you see have constrained\nuser interface.\n\n295\n00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:16,210\nThis is a fancy term for\nsomething like a menu or\n\n296\n00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,540\na shell or something that is going\nto constrain, somehow constrict and\n\n297\n00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,738\nchange your view based on\nthe level of access you are given.\n\n298\n00:13:22,738 --> 00:13:25,740\n>> So they only see what they're allowed\nto do or what they have access to.\n\n299\n00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,150\nLike an atm or a machine, or-\n>> Like a banking machine.\n\n300\n00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,620\n>> Yeah.\nYou only see the buttons that you're\n\n301\n00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,710\nallowed to push depending on\nwhat you've authenticated with.\n\n302\n00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,930\n>> Absolutely.\nOr database view.\n\n303\n00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,720\nAnother way of thinking about that, right?\n\n304\n00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,070\nAccess control matrix,\n\n305\n00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,930\nsomething else that we want to make\nsure that we define here for you.\n\n306\n00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,270\nAn access control matrix is basically\ngonna be a table that we lay out subject\n\n307\n00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,220\nand objects in and look then at\naccess as a grid across those.\n\n308\n00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:51,010\nNow, let's remember from one of our\nearlier episodes what a subject is and\n\n309\n00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:51,800\nwhat an object is.\n\n310\n00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,530\nI think that Mike's going\nto load up a picture for\n\n311\n00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,150\nus just while I'm talking\nyou through this.\n\n312\n00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,560\nWe have a little graphic that\nwe put together there for\n\n313\n00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,120\nyou and that he has available.\n\n314\n00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,080\nYeah I think that is the one\nwe're going to go in and look at.\n\n315\n00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,550\nWe probably could just do it\nright from there but either way.\n\n316\n00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,960\nSo the idea there is\nthat we have subjects.\n\n317\n00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,000\nSo you'll see subject at the upper\nleft on top of the user list.\n\n318\n00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,390\nLarry Curly Mo Bob.\n\n319\n00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,740\nAnd we have objects.\n\n320\n00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,250\nAnd objects are going to be the data\nitems that we are looking for access on.\n\n321\n00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,750\nSubjects are the users so\nthe objects are right there.\n\n322\n00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,240\nFile one two three four.\n\n323\n00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,430\nSo in our language of\nsecurity a subject is a user.\n\n324\n00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,860\nAn object is the data that the user\nwants to be able to access.\n\n325\n00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,430\nAnd so in an access control matrix\nwhat we have is this overall\n\n326\n00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,430\nthought of subject and\nobject brought together.\n\n327\n00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,460\nIn the capability table what\nwe're looking at specifically\n\n328\n00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,010\nis what can the subject do to the object.\n\n329\n00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,755\nIn other words what kind of access\ndoes the subject have to the object.\n\n330\n00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:49,600\nAnd so what we see there for instance\nis that Curly on File2 has no access.\n\n331\n00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,310\nIf we kind of track over and down we\nsee that the intersection of those two.\n\n332\n00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,040\nThe intersection of the subject and\n\n333\n00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,580\nthe object is gonna be that\nwe have no access for Curly.\n\n334\n00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,780\nWhereas, although Mike kinda\nput an arrow through it but\n\n335\n00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,840\nnow that we can see it a little easier,\nfor file one we have full control.\n\n336\n00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,120\nRight, when we look at Curly,\nthat's File1,\n\n337\n00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,660\nand we see there that Curly\nhas full control to File1.\n\n338\n00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:15,520\nAnd so as we look across right,\nas we track across in the columnar view,\n\n339\n00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,700\non the axis control matrix of that way.\n\n340\n00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,360\nWhat we would call horizontally\nright tracking across.\n\n341\n00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,190\nIn the column view,\nexcuse me in the row view.\n\n342\n00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,050\nI keep saying column, column is different.\n\n343\n00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,450\nIn the row view.\n\n344\n00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,710\nTrack and cross I knew what I meant.\n\n345\n00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,780\nOf course there's nobody else who could\nfollow me and that's what I meant.\n\n346\n00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,780\nBut in the row view Curly going\nacross file one two three and four.\n\n347\n00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,690\nIn gray so, we can clearly see it.\n\n348\n00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:39,469\nIn the row view,\nwe're talking about this corresponding so\n\n349\n00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:41,422\nbasically the idea of the capability.\n\n350\n00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:46,060\nAnd so as we look at row view here and\nlook at Curly and what Curly can see and\n\n351\n00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,780\ndo across each of these data elements,\nacross each of these objects.\n\n352\n00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,420\nWe're talking about Curly's\ncapabilities as a user.\n\n353\n00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,156\nWhen we switch to the row view,\nright, up and\n\n354\n00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:59,333\ndown there File3,\nhighlighted in gray or File4.\n\n355\n00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:04,010\nSo as we go up and down we go vertical of\nthat is going to be the axis control list.\n\n356\n00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,080\nSo this is what we just\nlooked at actually earlier.\n\n357\n00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,063\nThe Windows area where we did\nthe quick little screen in,\n\n358\n00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:11,750\nand we were able to see\nthe properties on that file.\n\n359\n00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,910\nFile three,\nwe don't see an individual user only,\n\n360\n00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,830\nwe see multiple users Larry,\nCurly, Mo, and Bob.\n\n361\n00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,370\nBut what we see is the permission\nassociated with each one,\n\n362\n00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,480\nas we track down the access control list.\n\n363\n00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,250\nSo the access control\nmatrix brings together for\n\n364\n00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,240\nus in a xy axis-like environment,\nsubject and object, and\n\n365\n00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,320\nbrings together the capability,\nand the access control level, or\n\n366\n00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,870\npermission associated with it,\nas we look through that.\n\n367\n00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,820\nSo generically,\n\n368\n00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,740\nas we bring these together,\nwe talk about an access control matrix.\n\n369\n00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,520\nLet me focus on subject\nan object within there.\n\n370\n00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,100\nWant to make sure we understand that,\n\n371\n00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,050\nunderstand how to read an Access Control\nmatrix, understand that going\n\n372\n00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,950\nacross the row is capability, going up and\ndown will be Access Control this.\n\n373\n00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,910\nMaybe there in our notes\na capability table.\n\n374\n00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,290\nwe can put in brackets next to that row.\n\n375\n00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,190\nAnd then in brackets next to access\ncontrol list, we can put column,\n\n376\n00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,000\nand that will help everybody\nremember that, hopefully.\n\n377\n00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,630\n>> All right, very good.\n\n378\n00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:10,200\n>> All right so\nthen we have content dependent\n\n379\n00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,210\naccess control\n>> This is axis control that is focused on\n\n380\n00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,870\nthe content of the data, right?\n\n381\n00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,050\nSo we're thinking about content dependent,\nwe may be looking at data that is marked,\n\n382\n00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,120\nin some way labeled, much like it would\nhave been in a Mac solution, right?\n\n383\n00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,165\nData sensitivity labeling.\n\n384\n00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:27,152\n>> So this could be something like,\nmaybe we mark the data, and\n\n385\n00:17:27,152 --> 00:17:29,060\nsay this is data that has to do with hr.\n\n386\n00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,135\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n387\n00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:32,955\n>> This is data that has to do with\nfinances, or whatever it maybe.\n\n388\n00:17:32,955 --> 00:17:37,135\nAnd based on that content filter,\nwe're only able to see certain data\n\n389\n00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:42,115\nbased on our ability to interact wit those\ncontent groups, whatever they may be.\n\n390\n00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:46,835\nSo we can see that kind of a model,\nand familiar to us in certain areas,\n\n391\n00:17:46,835 --> 00:17:48,010\nin certain businesses.\n\n392\n00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,790\nPerhaps not widely used, or\ncertainly not as widely used as DAC, and\n\n393\n00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,450\nrole based, rDAC and rule based\naccess control mechanisms would be.\n\n394\n00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,060\n>> Seeing a little more in Windows\nwith their Dynamic Access Control, and\n\n395\n00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,050\nactually being able to look\nat some of the content,\n\n396\n00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:04,900\nand setting up some access\ncontrols based on that.\n\n397\n00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,500\n>> Right.\nWell, you know one of the places\n\n398\n00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,230\nwe would see it, would be in a pay\nkind of an economic dripping model,\n\n399\n00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,050\nin an app store where.\n\n400\n00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:16,260\nIf you pay and have a membership, you can\nget in and perhaps get certain things, but\n\n401\n00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,400\nif you don't, you're maybe not\nable to get certain things, right.\n\n402\n00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,536\n>> Right, yeah.\n>> So think about something like that,\n\n403\n00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:23,972\nthat would be a content dependent\nsolution, where if you pay a premium fee,\n\n404\n00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,488\nyou get access to other content.\n\n405\n00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:28,608\nWhereas, maybe a basic membership fee,\ngives you access to certain content.\n\n406\n00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,920\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Sirius XM for\n\n407\n00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,490\ninstance,\n>> Right.\n\n408\n00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,030\n>> Works this way.\n\n409\n00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,170\nIf you subscribe at the basic level,\nright?\n\n410\n00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:36,639\nYou're going to get 100 channels, whatever\nit is, but if you pay a premium, ou know,\n\n411\n00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:38,157\nyou get all the other stuff [CROSSTALK].\n\n412\n00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:42,460\nWhatever that other stuff will be, that's\na content dependent access control system.\n\n413\n00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,940\nContext dependent access control,\nis going to be dependent on\n\n414\n00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:52,120\nthe context of the use of the information\n>> So if you are for instance,\n\n415\n00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,700\naccessing it wirelessly from a guest\nlogon, you may have different\n\n416\n00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,680\naccess than if you're on the hardwired\nland internal, behind the firewall, right?\n\n417\n00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,730\nThey'll be context dependent.\n\n418\n00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:05,810\nSo that is what we're talking about.\n\n419\n00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:10,410\nIs really the frame of reference that\nthat information is being used through,\n\n420\n00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,120\nis the key we pivot on around\naccess control, right?\n\n421\n00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,660\nAll right, very good.\n\n422\n00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,250\nSo let's continue on with our\naccess control system, and\n\n423\n00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,060\nour conversation here access\ncontrol architecture.\n\n424\n00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,850\nLet's look at some implications in\nsome of these systems widely used.\n\n425\n00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,800\nWe have Radius, and\nunder radius we have some points.\n\n426\n00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,420\nWe'll talk through those in just a minute.\n\n427\n00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,980\nWe have TACACS and the version of TACACS.\n\n428\n00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,490\nTACACS, TACACS plus.\n\n429\n00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,870\nWe actually left off X TACACS,\nwhich is just the extended TACACS.\n\n430\n00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,150\nAnother earlier version of TACACS.\n\n431\n00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,700\nBut whatever it is,\nthis is just another one.\n\n432\n00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,280\nWe also have something called Diameter,\nwhich is actually yet\n\n433\n00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,150\nanother version of Radius.\n\n434\n00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,250\nThat is there as well.\n\n435\n00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,330\nKind of a radius like product.\n\n436\n00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,390\nAnd diameter's just another\none that does the same thing.\n\n437\n00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,460\nAs in the diameter of a circle, diameter.\n\n438\n00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,750\n>> Yeah,\nthey were clever with that one right?\n\n439\n00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,750\n>> Yeah, they were actually,\nbecause it was twice the radius,\n\n440\n00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,850\nso the goal behind that\n>> Twice as good.\n\n441\n00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:01,880\n>> Twice as good, that was the urban\nlegend behind the naming of Diameter,\n\n442\n00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,690\nwas that they named it that way\n>> So I wanted to show it twice as good.\n\n443\n00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:06,990\n>> Yeah.\n>> As Mike said as radius.\n\n444\n00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,040\nBeing a student of geometry like I am,\nyou know.\n\n445\n00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,400\nHa ha, very funny Frank,\nthat worked out very well.\n\n446\n00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,580\nSo, radius, let's talk about radius.\n\n447\n00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,590\nSo, radius is commonly referred to the\nsystems overall, commonly referred to as,\n\n448\n00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,990\nTriple A systems.\n\n449\n00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:22,990\nRight, AAA as you can see there, helps us\nto understand that we have, and again,\n\n450\n00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:27,830\nin no particular order, but particularly\nwe have the idea of authentication,\n\n451\n00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:31,880\nauthorization, and accounting,\nthe three A's that we talk about.\n\n452\n00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,400\nRemember from our prior discussions,\n\n453\n00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,450\nwe always have to authorize before we\nare going to give somebody access, right?\n\n454\n00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:45,030\nSo we're never gonna give somebody access,\nright, until we authenticate?\n\n455\n00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,930\nSo we're going to authenticate,\nwe're going to authorize, and\n\n456\n00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,460\nwe're going to do accounting or logic.\n\n457\n00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,880\n>> I mean you can't really authorize\nsomebody if you don't know who they are.\n\n458\n00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,370\nSo, successful authentication,\nkind of has to go first,\n\n459\n00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,460\nbefore, if I don't know who you are, how\ndo I know what permissions to give you, or\n\n460\n00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,760\nwhat permissions not to give you?\n\n461\n00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,210\n>> Absolutely, absolutely right.\n\n462\n00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,860\nSo, if you've ever snuck into a bar,\nas somebody who many be under age, and\n\n463\n00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,052\nnot belong there, and shame on you.\n\n464\n00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:10,011\n>> [CROSSTALK] Authentication process?\n\n465\n00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:11,367\n>> Not supposed to do that, right?\n\n466\n00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:12,880\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not that you would ever do that,\n\n467\n00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,180\nbecause all of you are gonna be CIS.\n\n468\n00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,140\nYou're supposed to act ethically, and\nthat would be unethical behavior.\n\n469\n00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,360\nBut if you know somebody,\nwho may have done that in the past,\n\n470\n00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,600\nyou skip the authentication process,\nand went directly to authorization.\n\n471\n00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,220\nObviously, you can bypass\nsome of these systems,\n\n472\n00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,030\nif the system is not designed\nto really focus on that.\n\n473\n00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:35,180\nSo if you did happen to get the good fake\nID, you might have been able to get in\n\n474\n00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,670\nwithout the bouncer's knowledge,\nor that kind of thing.\n\n475\n00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,949\nOr so I've heard,\nI've never done that kind of thing myself.\n\n476\n00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:43,685\nOf course not, not me.\n\n477\n00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:47,255\n[LAUGH]\nSo then we have RADIUS.\n\n478\n00:21:47,255 --> 00:21:48,495\nHow does RADIUS actually work?\n\n479\n00:21:48,495 --> 00:21:50,875\nRADIUS is based on the UDP protocol.\n\n480\n00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:55,880\nIt is connectionless,\nas a result of that, we see TACACS,\n\n481\n00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,903\nTACACS+, especially\nfocuses on the use of TCP.\n\n482\n00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:03,540\nConnection oriented, we'll kind of\ncompare the two, and walk up and down.\n\n483\n00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:08,280\nThe second point of comparison here is\nthatRradius will encrypt only the password\n\n484\n00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,020\nthat is used to authenticate\nfrom the client to the server.\n\n485\n00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,610\nThe rest of the traffic that\nflows through the Radius session,\n\n486\n00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,590\nonce you authenticate is\nnot going to be encrypted.\n\n487\n00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,950\n>> RIght.\n>> So obviously a big downside there.\n\n488\n00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,000\nSomebody snooping on the wire, and we're\nnot using alternate technologies such as,\n\n489\n00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,670\nan IP Sect tunneling solution, right,\nand some encryption on top of that.\n\n490\n00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,120\nOr something that's gonna\nobfuscate that traffic and\n\n491\n00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,040\nhide it, we're gonna have an issue.\n\n492\n00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,810\nAnd then with TACACS,\nTACACS+ we're encrypting all the traffic.\n\n493\n00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:38,200\nSo everything that's sent including the\nauthentication packets, are automatically\n\n494\n00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,300\nencrypted., And then the final one is\nthat Radius will work over point to point\n\n495\n00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,240\nprotocol Very limited in the sense that\nit doesn't work across everything,\n\n496\n00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,200\nwhereas TACACS plus works\nover multiple protocols.\n\n497\n00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,260\nAs a result,\na little bit more flexible, right?\n\n498\n00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,850\nCould be implemented on multiple systems,\nso\n\n499\n00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,620\nit's gonna work a little better for\nus in that way.\n\n500\n00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,760\nSo, these systems have a client and\na server side component.\n\n501\n00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,350\nSo, the client is gonna be first\ncoming in from the outside,\n\n502\n00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,580\nlooking for remote authentication in.\n\n503\n00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,550\nThe server is going to be\na server that is set up,\n\n504\n00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,730\nthat sits between the client\nprobably in the DMZ.\n\n505\n00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,840\nAnd then is allowed to basically\ntake incoming requests,\n\n506\n00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,295\nproxy it back to the Directory Server,\nthe LDAP server,\n\n507\n00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:21,155\nwhatever, will be on the inside\nfo the firewall, beyond the DMZ.\n\n508\n00:23:21,155 --> 00:23:24,315\nHave that communication back and\nforth to authenticate the user, and\n\n509\n00:23:24,315 --> 00:23:27,295\nthen allow the user coming\nin from the client site in,\n\n510\n00:23:27,295 --> 00:23:29,225\nonce that session has been established.\n\n511\n00:23:29,225 --> 00:23:32,635\nBut then all traffic flows through\nthis server, and is accounted for.\n\n512\n00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:36,345\nWe do the logging on it, to look at\ntimestamps on the connection point,\n\n513\n00:23:36,345 --> 00:23:39,190\nwhat kind of traffic is flowing,\nhow long was the session.\n\n514\n00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,650\nThere's different things\nwe can gather based on\n\n515\n00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,390\nthe kind of technology being used.\n\n516\n00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,180\nAnd Radius is an industry standard,\nby the way.\n\n517\n00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,110\nThere are many Radius-like products.\n\n518\n00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,530\nMicrosoft had their own versions of this.\n\n519\n00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,610\nCisco has their own versions of this.\n\n520\n00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,310\nThe Steelbelted Radius, for\ninstance, is a very popular,\n\n521\n00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,970\nwas a very popular Radius program.\n\n522\n00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,168\nThat was generic, meaning it was just\na third party vendor that made it.\n\n523\n00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:02,159\nSo just understand,\nthis is not a specific vendor thing,\n\n524\n00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,833\nbut rather this is a standard thing for\nhow we actually do this, right.\n\n525\n00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,958\nSo having said that.\n\n526\n00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,520\nRIght.\nYou may just want to make a note there.\n\n527\n00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,350\nThat's obviously going\nto be helpful to us.\n\n528\n00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,501\nSo having said that, the same concept,\nthe same thought process around diameter,\n\n529\n00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:19,500\nby the way, as we talked about really\npretty much does the same kind of thing.\n\n530\n00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,840\nWe may just want to note there\nthe diameter for authentication purposes\n\n531\n00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,220\nwill support PAP, so\nPAP is Password Authentication Protocol.\n\n532\n00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,080\nPassword sent in the clear,\nobviously not very secure.\n\n533\n00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,860\nCHAP, Challenge Handshake Authentication\nProtocol, little bit more secure,\n\n534\n00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,620\nwe do a hash of the password\ninstead of exposing it.\n\n535\n00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:41,140\nAnd EAP, Extensible Authentication\nProtocol, which is gonna allow for the use\n\n536\n00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,880\nof things that are extendable out beyond\nthe current definition of technology, so,\n\n537\n00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,550\nfor instance, smart cars,\nthings like that.\n\n538\n00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:50,100\nBiometrics could be incorporated there,\nso obviously that's gonna be very good.\n\n539\n00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,690\nWe have end to end protection of the\nauthentication information with diameter,\n\n540\n00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,920\nso we're encrypting and protecting\nthat information all the way through.\n\n541\n00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,330\nWe also have replay protection\nas a result of that.\n\n542\n00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,590\nSo man in the middle attacks are going\nto be very difficult to carry out\n\n543\n00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,730\nwith diameter.\n\n544\n00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:09,090\nAnd we are providing the same kind of\naccounting, same kind of AAA, if you will.\n\n545\n00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,010\nSolution is RADIUS and\nTACACS, TACACS+ does, but\n\n546\n00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,940\nwe have enhanced accounting, reporting and\nthen things like that with diameter.\n\n547\n00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,770\nIt's more up-to-date, more of a robust\nsystem that we see coming to bear there.\n\n548\n00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,450\nSo these are our three options,\nbasically, when we talk about access\n\n549\n00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:29,110\ncontrol systems that deal with\nextra-remote in kind of technology.\n\n550\n00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,850\nI know that we have our access\ncontrol layer spreadsheet.\n\n551\n00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,925\nWe had put this together.\n\n552\n00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:34,830\n>> Mm-hm, we do.\n\n553\n00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,010\n>> If we can bring that back up.\n\n554\n00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,150\nI know that we had made this available\nin one of our prior episodes,\n\n555\n00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,470\none of our prior shows.\n\n556\n00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,100\nWe put the URL for it in the chat window.\n\n557\n00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,780\nMaybe we can do this again.\n\n558\n00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,170\n>> We'll do the same for this one, yeah,\ndepending on which episode you watched.\n\n559\n00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,020\n>> Absolutely, just make that available.\n\n560\n00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,227\nDon't know if it's going to be the same\ngroup of people that we may or\n\n561\n00:25:50,227 --> 00:25:50,980\nmay not have there.\n\n562\n00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,620\nSo we'll just make those available,\nor make that available I should say.\n\n563\n00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,200\nIs that whole thing actually there we go.\n\n564\n00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,820\n>> No I'll double check\non that after the show.\n\n565\n00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,270\nThat looks a little long.\n\n566\n00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,229\nSomething like I wouldn't wanna click on.\n\n567\n00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:00,850\n>> [LAUGH] Exactly.\n\n568\n00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,540\n>> [LAUGH].\n>> What do you mean I'm going to\n\n569\n00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,595\nRomania for a three day holiday right?\n\n570\n00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:05,140\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n571\n00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,800\n>> Yeah, so\n\n572\n00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,210\nwe'll double check to make sure we're\ngiving you accurate information.\n\n573\n00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:13,510\nBut we did put this together, actually I\nwant to give credit where credit is due.\n\n574\n00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:17,630\nDon in his blue, celebrated blue\nperiod put this together for\n\n575\n00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,870\nyou guys and he was able to quickly\nput something together that helped us\n\n576\n00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:24,940\njust to understand the categories and\nthe kind of controls that would exist.\n\n577\n00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,420\nAnd we talked through this idea of\nthe physical, the technical and\n\n578\n00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,320\nthe administrative.\n\n579\n00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,560\nPreventative, detective,\n\n580\n00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,740\ncorrective, deterrent and recovery, all\nthe way across there as being categories.\n\n581\n00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,570\nAnd so we had different kinds of things\nthat we could be doing, focused on here.\n\n582\n00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,250\nAnd so when we talk about access control\nlayers, administrative controls, right.\n\n583\n00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,050\nAdministrative controls,\nthere are some down at the bottom there.\n\n584\n00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,040\nI think I see policy\nright at the very bottom.\n\n585\n00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,090\nMay want to go down and just scroll down\njust a little bit, see some of the other\n\n586\n00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,510\nadministrative controls there,\ncuz those hash marks are indicating no.\n\n587\n00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,770\nRight, so you can see there at the bottom,\nwe have things like policies,\n\n588\n00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:03,410\nseparation of duties, employee training,\ntesting, things like that.\n\n589\n00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,670\nThose are all administrative controls,\nand so those are controls\n\n590\n00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,390\nthat are gonna allow us, we tend to\nrefer to those as soft controls, right.\n\n591\n00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:14,000\nWe tend to see those as being things that\nwe implement, and then we help people to\n\n592\n00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,350\ntrain down around and\nto use that area right there, absolutely.\n\n593\n00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:21,530\nThat's one of our categories of control\ntypes or access control layers.\n\n594\n00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,060\nWe then have, I think our, whoa.\n\n595\n00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,053\n>> Sorry about that ladies and gentlemen.\n\n596\n00:27:25,053 --> 00:27:25,750\n>> I just got vertigo.\n\n597\n00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,269\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so, our next one.\n\n598\n00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:29,534\nPlease don't do that again.\n\n599\n00:27:29,534 --> 00:27:30,659\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, right.\n\n600\n00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,790\n>> So let's go back up, our next one is.\n\n601\n00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,220\nLet's do physical because it's easy,\nwe don't have to zoom in.\n\n602\n00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,290\nSo physical would be the top third,\nroughly there.\n\n603\n00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:43,950\nThings like locks, things like badges,\nlights, cameras, et cetera.\n\n604\n00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,320\nThese are physical controls.\n\n605\n00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,155\nWe often refer to those is hard\ncontrols as opposed to administrative\n\n606\n00:27:48,155 --> 00:27:49,265\nwhich were soft.\n\n607\n00:27:49,265 --> 00:27:52,165\nSo we see those as being controls that we\nimplement that we build something around\n\n608\n00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:55,535\nand that we can touch, reach out,\nfeel, see, interact with.\n\n609\n00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:57,615\nAnd then our middle category there,\ntechnical.\n\n610\n00:27:57,615 --> 00:28:01,735\nSometimes referred to as logical\ncontrols as well, because technical and\n\n611\n00:28:01,735 --> 00:28:05,325\nlogical are interchangeable terms\nin this particular language.\n\n612\n00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:08,735\nYou can see things such as Smart Cards,\nIDS and\n\n613\n00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:14,290\nIPS, data backups, routers,\nthe application of cryptography,\n\n614\n00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:17,280\nthese are technical or\nlogical controls that we apply.\n\n615\n00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,570\nAnd so we have control elements\nin each one of these areas.\n\n616\n00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,350\nAnd what this spread sheet helps us to\nunderstand is what these categorical\n\n617\n00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,770\nelements of control are, so\nwe describe a lock to a physical area.\n\n618\n00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,970\nBut then, to the right,\nwe see preventive, detective, corrective,\n\n619\n00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,470\ndeterrent, recovery.\n\n620\n00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:38,310\nWe also see that we can go across there,\nand\n\n621\n00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,470\nwe can place this\nparticular kind of control.\n\n622\n00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:42,010\nA lock, for instance, right?\n\n623\n00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:43,580\nWhich is an administrative, excuse me,\n\n624\n00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,970\nwhich is gonna be a physical control type,\ninto a category.\n\n625\n00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:51,025\nWe call it a preventative, or consider\nit to be, a preventative control type.\n\n626\n00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:55,410\nAnd so you wanna cross-reference\nthe control category and the control type,\n\n627\n00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,290\nto really look at this as a moving\ndocument that helps us to study, and\n\n628\n00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,600\nas a result, prepare our knowledge\nbased around the idea that we know\n\n629\n00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,876\nwhat the kind of control is and\nwhat kind of protection it's going.\n\n630\n00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:11,780\n>> Knowing that it's physical but then\nyou also have to know what type it is.\n\n631\n00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,382\nIs it preventative, detective, and so on.\n\n632\n00:29:13,382 --> 00:29:14,830\n>> Corrective, deterrent, absolutely,\n\n633\n00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,430\nvery important and so those are gonna\nbe good reference points for you.\n\n634\n00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:21,410\nThe spreadsheet helps you to\ndo that across this list.\n\n635\n00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,490\n>> Hm-mm.\n\n636\n00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,020\n>> Would be valuable for you to take a\nlook at and just make sure you're studying\n\n637\n00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,380\nthrough, and are comfortable\nwith how that discussion goes.\n\n638\n00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,340\nWhat most of you will find if you look\nat this list, and by the way, again,\n\n639\n00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,510\nbig disclaimer you're not exhaustive.\n\n640\n00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,750\nThere are other control\nelements you could put on here.\n\n641\n00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,240\nThese are pretty common ones,\nthis list could be\n\n642\n00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,800\nmuch much bigger depending on the kind\nof business you're in, right,\n\n643\n00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,120\nthe kind of security you have and\nthe things you focus on.\n\n644\n00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,710\nYou may have some of\nthe things on this list but\n\n645\n00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,570\nnot others, not everybody\nuses biometrics for instance.\n\n646\n00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,790\nBut most of us will have new access\ncontrol with some routers, but we may or\n\n647\n00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,850\nmay not have fences in\nfront of our property.\n\n648\n00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,730\nYou know,\nit just may not be something we do, right?\n\n649\n00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,780\nSo, it's going to be a mix and match here.\n\n650\n00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,570\nBut my point is,\nlook at this list as a starting point for\n\n651\n00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:05,670\nyou to have a better understanding of the\nkind of things that you may be looking at\n\n652\n00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,880\nin your production environments,\nright, in real time.\n\n653\n00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,400\nWhat are you managing\nwith security controls.\n\n654\n00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,214\nAnd if you're involved in\nthat aspect of the business,\n\n655\n00:30:12,214 --> 00:30:13,690\nyou already have\na knowledge of this stuff.\n\n656\n00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:14,410\nGreat.\n\n657\n00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,020\nIf you don't, no problem, right?\n\n658\n00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:19,400\nBut just understand that these are the\nelements that we would be focused on.\n\n659\n00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,150\nA CISSP will have working\nknowledge of these,\n\n660\n00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:26,200\nwill understand the conceptual idea\nbehind tiering our control types.\n\n661\n00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,690\nPhysical, technical, logical.\n\n662\n00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,810\nRemember, technical and\nlogical are the same.\n\n663\n00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,110\nPhysical, technical, logical and\n\n664\n00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:35,360\nadministrative, as well as the kind of\ncontrol element Preventive, detective,\n\n665\n00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,950\ncorrective, deterrent, and recovery,\nthat each of these controls represents.\n\n666\n00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,200\nSo we would see a give and\na take there on both, but you will,\n\n667\n00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,980\nas a security professional,\nas a CISSP, be asked to understand,\n\n668\n00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,420\nand be asked to apply, your knowledge\naround situations where we have to bring\n\n669\n00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,040\nthese kinds of controls into the business.\n\n670\n00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,670\nHow do we implement them,\nwhat kind of payback, what kind of ROI,\n\n671\n00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,520\nwhat kind of value are they\ngoing to bring to the business.\n\n672\n00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,170\nWhy would we choose, in other words,\nmotion detectors over cameras?\n\n673\n00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,980\nWhat would be the value there?\n\n674\n00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,910\nRight, one of them, in this case, both\nof them will be detective controls, but\n\n675\n00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,630\nyou can see maybe motion detectors and\nor cameras versus lights.\n\n676\n00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,650\nLights and\nfences are going to be deterrent controls.\n\n677\n00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,700\nAnd so are we looking to deter,\nor are we looking to detect?\n\n678\n00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,450\nAnd that's one of the questions\nwe would often wanna ask, right?\n\n679\n00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,390\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n>> So just be aware of that, and\n\n680\n00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,740\nhopefully use that thought\nprocess as you go through and\n\n681\n00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,740\ncompare some of this information back and\nforth, right?\n\n682\n00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,950\nI encourage you to download\nthat spreadsheet from the,\n\n683\n00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:33,730\nwe'll have it in the notes.\n\n684\n00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:34,400\nBut it's available to you.\n\n685\n00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,380\n>> We'll make sure it's in the notes and\nthe link is proper and everything.\n\n686\n00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,320\nIt's in a couple of our episodes.\n\n687\n00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,540\n>> It is.\n>> So anyone you get it from\n\n688\n00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,180\nit should be the same.\n\n689\n00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,320\nAll right, so I think we've Gone\nthrough a good amount of material.\n\n690\n00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,780\nProbably. [CROSSTALK] >> I think,\nit's time for a break.\n\n691\n00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,550\nWhy don't we do that?\n\n692\n00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,950\nLadies and gentlemen,\nwe're gonna take a quick break here.\n\n693\n00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,460\nGive you guys a chance to get up,\nstretch legs, get the blood flowing again.\n\n694\n00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,300\nAnd, we'll be right back in a few.\n\n695\n00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,300\nSee you then.\n\n696\n00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,167\nSee you in a few.\n\n697\n00:31:55,167 --> 00:32:02,710\n[MUSIC]\n\n698\n00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:05,753\nAll right.\nWelcome back everybody to our episode\n\n699\n00:32:05,753 --> 00:32:06,890\nwith our CISSP.\n\n700\n00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,550\nWe're gonna get back into it and\ncontinue talking about access controls.\n\n701\n00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:13,390\nWe're gonna talk about some more\nterminology that's gonna help us get\n\n702\n00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,950\nready for the exam as well as take\na look at a couple of examples and\n\n703\n00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,560\nsome tools we can use to monitor\nsome of this access control.\n\n704\n00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,250\n>> Okay, yes.\nVery good.\n\n705\n00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,050\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n706\n00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,770\nSo let's talk a little bit more\nabout some of the monitoring we do.\n\n707\n00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:28,350\nWe left off with a bunch of vocabulary\nterms we wanted to continue defining.\n\n708\n00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:29,860\nSo keystroke monitoring,\n\n709\n00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:34,100\nthis idea of being able to go through and\nfigure out what someone's typing.\n\n710\n00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,440\nSo as we're typing,\nwe're going to keep track of that.\n\n711\n00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,130\nYeah, obviously we could socially\nengineer that by doing what's\n\n712\n00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:39,760\ncalled shoulder surfing.\n\n713\n00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,570\n>> Shoulder surfing, yeah.\n\n714\n00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,670\n>> We physically just look\nover somebody's shoulder.\n\n715\n00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,310\nBut that may not be real effective, right,\nyou may not be able to see everything.\n\n716\n00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:49,180\nIt's kind of hard to remember all\nthose keystrokes in order, so\n\n717\n00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,360\nwe can use what are called\nkeystroke loggers.\n\n718\n00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:51,968\n>> Keystroke loggers yeah.\n\n719\n00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:56,900\n>> Maybe hardware or software based and we\ncould actually put a piece of hardware on\n\n720\n00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,300\nthe back of the machine if it's a desktop,\nmaybe USB device if it's a laptop.\n\n721\n00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,591\n>> The little teeny tiny things that\nyou might not even know are there.\n\n722\n00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:05,230\n>> Right.\nYou might not even realize that.\n\n723\n00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:09,000\nThey're pretty small typically and\nthey will create all this output.\n\n724\n00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,430\nThey actually capture\nevery key that we hit.\n\n725\n00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,540\nPut it into a text file typically,\nsave them and\n\n726\n00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:18,530\nthen maybe batch them or bulk exit them\noff the machine based on some sort of\n\n727\n00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:22,060\nremote access that's been established or\nsomebody may just come by and\n\n728\n00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,300\npick up the device after a period of time.\n\n729\n00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,960\nMaybe logging and\nthen just simply take it away.\n\n730\n00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,230\nSo there are a variety of ways\nto do keystroke monitoring.\n\n731\n00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:33,700\nWhat we want to understand is that this is\none of the many things that can be done to\n\n732\n00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,740\nnot only keep track of what people\nare doing, but also look for\n\n733\n00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,120\npatterns in access control.\n\n734\n00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,580\nAre they constantly accessing sites\nthey're not supposed to get into.\n\n735\n00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,730\nWe often think that\nkeystroke monitoring and\n\n736\n00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,210\nsome of the keystroke loggers are things\nthat may be hacking-related tools.\n\n737\n00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,390\nAnd they are, but they're also primarily,\n\n738\n00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,760\nand not just exclusively,\nin the hacker realm.\n\n739\n00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,370\nThey're used by security professionals to\ndo monitoring of systems that are either\n\n740\n00:33:57,370 --> 00:34:02,170\nin protected networks, maybe on isolated\nVLANS, or perhaps if somebody is under\n\n741\n00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:05,620\nsuspicion inside of a company,\nwanna keep track of what they're doing.\n\n742\n00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,480\nWe'll use keystroke monitoring to figure\nout what's going on with them when they're\n\n743\n00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,960\nunder investigation.\n\n744\n00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,040\nSo there's a lot of legitimating uses.\n\n745\n00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,690\n>> Right.\n>> Not just illegitimate uses,\n\n746\n00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,170\nbut a lot of uses we see for technology\nlike this on both sides of the house, so\n\n747\n00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,230\nyou just wanna think about that, right?\n\n748\n00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,260\nObject reuse, right,\nthis idea of being able to go in and\n\n749\n00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,370\nbeing able to look at media,\nwhatever it may be,\n\n750\n00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:30,730\nwhether it's a thumb drive, a hard drive\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n751\n00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,790\nWhatever the media is,\nCD-ROMs that are rewritable and\n\n752\n00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:38,630\nif we don't wipe them properly, and\nthere's data remnants, which is the term\n\n753\n00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:42,010\nwe use, we may want to write, we actually\njust capture that data remnants.\n\n754\n00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:45,830\nMay want to be something put down\nas either a bracket or a subpoint.\n\n755\n00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,850\nBut this idea of data remnants, which is\nthe remaining data that is left behind,\n\n756\n00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:53,360\nwhen we Inadvertently or\n\n757\n00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,900\non purpose wipe out the data put perhaps\ndon't do it the right way, and as a result\n\n758\n00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,980\nof that we then have this leftover data\nthat can become potentially compromising.\n\n759\n00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,810\nSomebody could find it,\nsomebody could see it.\n\n760\n00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,140\nSo just be aware of this, this idea of-\n>> First thing I do.\n\n761\n00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,100\n>> This is a problem.\n\n762\n00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,790\n>> First thing I do when somebody\nloans me the thumb drive,\n\n763\n00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,250\nlet's see what's on there.\n\n764\n00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,020\n>> Let's see what's on there.\n\n765\n00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,135\nMike is that guy just in\ncase you're wondering.\n\n766\n00:35:14,135 --> 00:35:17,140\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Look, pictures, how exciting, right.\n\n767\n00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,560\nWhat can I post on my webpage?\n\n768\n00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,577\nSo, not only that, but\ndo they maybe have good music, or\n\n769\n00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:24,549\nsoftware [CROSSTALK]\n>> Music from [CROSSTALK].\n\n770\n00:35:24,549 --> 00:35:26,470\n>> So you're-\n>> Every time I borrow Nat's thumb drive,\n\n771\n00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,680\nI always pick up a few new tunes.\n\n772\n00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,710\n>> Okay, so that's something.\n\n773\n00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,443\nRight? Right? He was doing the Britney\nSpears thing yesterday, wasn't he?\n\n774\n00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:33,617\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that's important, though, as well.\n\n775\n00:35:33,617 --> 00:35:34,466\nRight?\n\n776\n00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,534\nJust got an evil look\nfrom off camera here.\n\n777\n00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:37,490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n778\n00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,090\nSo just be aware of the fact that,\n\n779\n00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:42,260\nobviously, object reuse\ncan be a bit of an issue.\n\n780\n00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,650\n>> Right.\n>> The other thing to keep in mind, and\n\n781\n00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,740\nI think we talked about this\nin the SSCP shows that we were\n\n782\n00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,670\ndoing when we talked about this kind of\na topic, was this idea of getting rid of,\n\n783\n00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:53,870\nat the end of a life cycle, hardware.\n\n784\n00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:59,450\nObject reuse is an issue because if we get\nrid of that hardware, are we cleansing it?\n\n785\n00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,810\nAre we doing what's called\nsanitizing that hardware properly?\n\n786\n00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,670\nSo, you know, you don't think\nabout some of the obvious things\n\n787\n00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,640\nthat may have this information in it.\n\n788\n00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,766\nThings like multi-purpose copiers and\n\n789\n00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:14,370\nprinters today in offices that have\non-board storage, on-board hard drives.\n\n790\n00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,440\nHow are we going through and\n\n791\n00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,680\ncleaning those hard drives before\nwe allow them to be taken out?\n\n792\n00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,660\nWhat about routers?\n\n793\n00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,826\nRouters that have configs built into them?\n\n794\n00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:22,644\n>> Like control lists.\n\n795\n00:36:22,644 --> 00:36:25,040\n>> All that stuff,\nyou know you buy routers on eBay,\n\n796\n00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,870\nyou hear about this all the time,\nor wherever you buy them from.\n\n797\n00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,850\nAnd you get them, if they're used and they\nactually still have the running config, or\n\n798\n00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,630\nnot the running config rather,\nbut the config,\n\n799\n00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:37,690\nwhatever that config was that\nwas used stored in the memory.\n\n800\n00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:40,650\nAs a result of that, on the hard drive,\n\n801\n00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:43,590\nnot in the memory, but just stored\nin the device is what I mean to say.\n\n802\n00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:48,190\nBut they have have the config stored there\nand so as a result of that that config for\n\n803\n00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,420\nthat company which probably has\ninformation that may identify the company\n\n804\n00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,255\nor can easily be used to if you\nhave the external IP, for instance,\n\n805\n00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:55,310\nfar easier to find.\n\n806\n00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,920\nYou can go back and effectively figure\nout what that configuration was,\n\n807\n00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,150\nthe stored config, and\nyou may still find that same config is in\n\n808\n00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:06,390\nuse on their current technology, which\nfrom a hacker's perspective is great.\n\n809\n00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,410\nIf you buy phones or things like that,\npeople don't wipe them.\n\n810\n00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:11,130\nYou find all sorts of data in there.\n\n811\n00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:14,190\nSo all of this stuff around object\ndisposal is definitely an issue to\n\n812\n00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,160\nconsider.\n\n813\n00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,480\nAnd object for use is very,\nvery problematic.\n\n814\n00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:21,600\nThe only way for sure to make sure that\nwe know that something's been destroyed\n\n815\n00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,597\nwould be something like thermite, right?\n\n816\n00:37:23,597 --> 00:37:24,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We have a video we may\n\n817\n00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,720\nbe able to find it and\nshow it quick right?\n\n818\n00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,751\n>> Yes, yes, yes.\n\n819\n00:37:28,751 --> 00:37:29,254\n[LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n820\n00:37:29,254 --> 00:37:32,812\nif you've never had the opportunity to see\nsomething being destroyed with thermite,\n\n821\n00:37:32,812 --> 00:37:34,270\nboy is that a lot of fun, right?\n\n822\n00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,885\n>> I don't know what I'll come up with\nthis one, though, but [CROSSTALK]\n\n823\n00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:37,163\n>> Yeah, object destruction.\n\n824\n00:37:37,163 --> 00:37:38,501\nRight?\n\n825\n00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:40,940\nBut if we look at thermite,\nright, thermite, or\n\n826\n00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:46,120\nyou can probably just do like thermite and\nthen do like images and do videos.\n\n827\n00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,350\nThermite versus your car.\n\n828\n00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,755\nThat was probably a good one on YouTube.\n\n829\n00:37:48,755 --> 00:37:50,784\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Laptop versus thermite maybe we\n\n830\n00:37:50,784 --> 00:37:51,760\ncan look at that one.\n\n831\n00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,450\nSo something like that.\n\n832\n00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:57,480\nSo just watch this real quick,\nthis is probably interesting.\n\n833\n00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,290\nWe have the advertisement up there first.\n\n834\n00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,505\nAlright so you can skip now,\ngo ahead and skip the ad.\n\n835\n00:38:02,505 --> 00:38:04,285\n>> We can skip the ad real quick.\n\n836\n00:38:04,285 --> 00:38:08,780\nAnd what you'll see is something like\nthis, where somebody puts this up.\n\n837\n00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,535\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> As soon as we get to the part where he\n\n838\n00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:13,525\nactually does this, there we go.\n\n839\n00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:14,775\nHe does this part right here.\n\n840\n00:38:16,035 --> 00:38:22,880\nWhen you put thermite on something, what\nyou're doing is using a chemical reaction\n\n841\n00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,070\nthat is gonna burn so hot that it will\nbasically destroy anything it touches.\n\n842\n00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:28,790\nRight?\n\n843\n00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,720\nAnd so in the military, in government and\n\n844\n00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,950\nin these kind of situations where\nsomething has to be destroyed beyond any\n\n845\n00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:39,430\nusable, recognizable form they will\nattach thermite to something and\n\n846\n00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:43,340\nset it off and it will burn through\nanything it actually gets a hold of.\n\n847\n00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,150\n>> Put that on the hood of a car and\nit will go down through the engine block.\n\n848\n00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,550\n>> It will, and\nyou could see this is a slow burn.\n\n849\n00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,550\nHe did the slow lapse time here.\n\n850\n00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:53,680\nBut the idea is that basically\nthat's burning metal by the way.\n\n851\n00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,723\nSo what we're seeing right?\n\n852\n00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:57,720\n>> Let's see if we can find [CROSSTALK]\n>> Seeing where it totally goes up, right.\n\n853\n00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,360\nYou know you can see it burning through,\nright?\n\n854\n00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,220\nSo you can see it burning\nthrough in real time.\n\n855\n00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,180\nAnd that's why that white center of\nthe flame, white hot heat there, right?\n\n856\n00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,640\nSo we're talking about something that\nburns like plasma, it's very very hot.\n\n857\n00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,360\nIt's also a great little\nplace to put up for\n\n858\n00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,880\nyour fireplace graphic for the holidays.\n\n859\n00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,840\nYou can put that in there,\npretend that you got a fire going on.\n\n860\n00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,870\nSo using thermite, not for light or\nfaint-hearted by any means, and\n\n861\n00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,538\ncertainly not something\nyou wanna do at home.\n\n862\n00:39:26,538 --> 00:39:28,530\nLet's be 100% clear about this,\n\n863\n00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:31,230\nall kidding aside,\ndon't play with this boys and girls.\n\n864\n00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,450\nNot a good idea.\n\n865\n00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:36,640\nBut it is one of the key and few ways that\nwe can assure beyond any reasonable doubt\n\n866\n00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,060\nsomething has been destroyed.\n\n867\n00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,210\nWe have industrial grade shredders that\ncan actually take electronics equipment,\n\n868\n00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:44,300\ntake that apart and get rid of that.\n\n869\n00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,000\nWe melt things in gas furnaces if\nwe really want to get rid of them.\n\n870\n00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,761\nThere are ways to do this, but thermite is\ndefinitely one of those ways that you will\n\n871\n00:39:50,761 --> 00:39:53,250\nsee in the field when you\naccess to cool pyrotechnics.\n\n872\n00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,084\n>> Absolutely.\n[LAUGH]\n\n873\n00:39:54,084 --> 00:39:55,292\n>> So just be aware of that.\n\n874\n00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,626\nAll right, so\nwhat else do we have up there?\n\n875\n00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:57,333\n>> Fire, fire.\n\n876\n00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,792\n>> We have our, yes, [LAUGH] fire, fire.\n\n877\n00:39:58,792 --> 00:39:59,958\nYou remember Beavis and Butt-head?\n\n878\n00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:01,520\n[LAUGH]\n>> Beavis and Butt-head, absolutely.\n\n879\n00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,810\n>> Beavis and Butt-head, wow.\n\n880\n00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,360\nGood times, good times.\n\n881\n00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,310\nSo Tempest Shielding, right?\n\n882\n00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,310\n>> Right.\n\n883\n00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,810\n>> This idea that we have\nelectromagnetic radiance.\n\n884\n00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:14,260\nSo basically a field of electromagnetic\nradiation that emanates around devices.\n\n885\n00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:17,290\nSitting here at the podium right\nnow as we're talking, our laptops,\n\n886\n00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,990\nour tablet devices,\nthey are throwing off electrical signals.\n\n887\n00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,520\nAnd somebody within a 5 to 10 foot range,\n\n888\n00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,070\nif they ave the right gear, maybe even\nfurther out to up to maybe 50 to 60 feet,\n\n889\n00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:30,100\ncould pick up the emanations\nthat are coming off the screen.\n\n890\n00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,650\nAnd if you had the right kind of gear,\n\n891\n00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,210\nyou could see what I have\non my screen in real time.\n\n892\n00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:36,540\nYou wouldn't have to be looking at it,\nyou could reproduce it.\n\n893\n00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,600\nI think of one of the Tom Clancy\nmovies that they did,\n\n894\n00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,100\nI think it was Patriot Games.\n\n895\n00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,856\nWas the one where they had the guys\nin the hotel room in Colombia across\n\n896\n00:40:45,856 --> 00:40:48,730\nfrom the other meeting that was going on.\n\n897\n00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,162\nAnd they were pulling the signals in,\nlistening and\n\n898\n00:40:51,162 --> 00:40:53,270\nwatching to what was\nhappening in real time.\n\n899\n00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,530\nAnd so this the kind of stuff\nthat we have to deal with.\n\n900\n00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:59,930\nSo the way we block and prevent\nthis electromagnetic radiation from\n\n901\n00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,950\nemanating out is through what's\ncalled Tempest shielding, and\n\n902\n00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:06,300\nthis idea of understanding that one of the\nkey ways to do it is with a Faraday cage.\n\n903\n00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,961\nAnd Faraday, the name of the guy\nwho thought all this up and\n\n904\n00:41:08,961 --> 00:41:10,890\ncame up with this idea of how to build it.\n\n905\n00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:15,730\nBut wire mesh cages that are going to\ngo around an electrical device and\n\n906\n00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:19,980\nare going to effectively stealth or\nabsorb the electromagnetic radiation,\n\n907\n00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:24,510\nthe EMR that comes off the device, not\nallowing it to emanate beyond the device.\n\n908\n00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:28,340\nSo in secure networks you will see\nthat they build these things and\n\n909\n00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,580\nliterally a machine may be\nslid into a Faraday cage, and\n\n910\n00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,460\nthe door closed around it so\nthat it protects it.\n\n911\n00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,620\nYou may have it around\na monitor on a desk,\n\n912\n00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,980\nyou may have it around certain elements.\n\n913\n00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:42,810\nYou may put your laptop into, effectively,\na cage it sits on a desk to use it.\n\n914\n00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,510\nDifferent ways to think about this.\n\n915\n00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,744\nBut Faraday cages are used to basically\nblock this electromagnetic radiation that\n\n916\n00:41:48,744 --> 00:41:51,506\ncomes out, to provide Tempest shielding.\n\n917\n00:41:51,506 --> 00:41:54,580\nAnd with Tempest shielding,\nfrom an emanation security standpoint,\n\n918\n00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,070\nwe also have this idea of\nwhite noise generation.\n\n919\n00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,580\nWhere we will basically create\n\n920\n00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,110\na uniform spectrum of random electrical\nnoise that blocks out the noise in a room.\n\n921\n00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:08,280\nSo this is done in secure environments\nwhere we don't want to be able to hear\n\n922\n00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,790\nwhat's going on outside the room,\nwanna block that.\n\n923\n00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:14,290\nWhite noise generation is used in noise\ncancelling headphones by the way.\n\n924\n00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:17,705\nSo like the Bose headphones, things like\nthat will use white noise to generate\n\n925\n00:42:17,705 --> 00:42:20,462\na effective overlay on\nthe background noise you're hearing.\n\n926\n00:42:20,462 --> 00:42:24,312\nSo instead of all that stuff that's just,\ngoing on you basically hear nothing, or\n\n927\n00:42:24,312 --> 00:42:25,980\nwhatever that may be.\n\n928\n00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,520\nSo we have that.\n\n929\n00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,280\nWe also have this idea of what\nare called control zones.\n\n930\n00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,160\nControl zones are gonna be secure areas\nthat we set up that will effectively be\n\n931\n00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,700\nisolated from a variety of different\nmechanisms, logical and physical.\n\n932\n00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,725\nTo be able to effectively create a zone\nwhere we are totally in control,\n\n933\n00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:45,240\nknow everything going on, monitor for\nwhat we do and don't want to allow.\n\n934\n00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,303\nAnd so in the military and\n\n935\n00:42:46,303 --> 00:42:49,695\nin secure government installations you\nsee this idea of what are called SCIFs,\n\n936\n00:42:49,695 --> 00:42:52,900\nsecure communication in a room,\nsecure communication infrastructure.\n\n937\n00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,760\nWhere you go into this isolated room and\ninside the room,\n\n938\n00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,872\nwhatever's being done in there, there's\nusually electronic filtering that is\n\n939\n00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:02,930\nenabled once you close the door and\nturn on SCIF mode.\n\n940\n00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,030\nAnd as a result of that\nit will white out and\n\n941\n00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,940\nblack out any noise, any opportunity\nto do electronic eavesdropping.\n\n942\n00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,180\nSo we have white noise\ngenerators going on.\n\n943\n00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,460\nWe may have what are called tappers\nwhere if it's a room that has windows,\n\n944\n00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,580\na lot of these rooms are gonna\nbe totally isolated.\n\n945\n00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,720\nBut if there is a room for\n\n946\n00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,730\nsome reason that you're meeting in\nthat has a window in it, we will\n\n947\n00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:25,060\nuse a technology where literally they\nattach a mechanical device to the windows.\n\n948\n00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:29,168\nAnd they have it hitting, much like\na metronome will at a predetermined rate,\n\n949\n00:43:29,168 --> 00:43:32,480\nto effectively block and\ndisrupt the sound noises coming out.\n\n950\n00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,600\nBut also to block and disrupt somebody\npointing a laser at the window to get\n\n951\n00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,810\nthe vibration and\nthe sound that's coming in.\n\n952\n00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:40,410\nIt alternates the vibration\nfrequency on the glass,\n\n953\n00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,490\ndisrupting your ability to record\nthe sound waves from outside.\n\n954\n00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:46,240\nCuz that's what we do,\nwe'll shoot a laser at the glass.\n\n955\n00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,060\nThe glass will vibrate\nslightly when we're talking,\n\n956\n00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:52,588\nto effectively allow you to record and\nreproduce the sound from inside.\n\n957\n00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,490\nSo these tappers that are sitting\non these windows in secure\n\n958\n00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,920\nbuildings like embassies and\nthings like that,\n\n959\n00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,710\nthey will prevent you from being\nable to record that information.\n\n960\n00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:04,180\nYou get random background garbage noise,\nyou don't get the conversation.\n\n961\n00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,110\nSo SCIFs are gonna have these\nkinds of built in safeguards.\n\n962\n00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:11,270\nThey may be rooms literally in the middle\nof these incredibly highly secure\n\n963\n00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,830\nfacilities like embassies and\n\n964\n00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:17,190\nplaces like that, where they sit\nfloating on isolation springs.\n\n965\n00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,270\nSo they're up above the floor.\n\n966\n00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:21,140\nSo there's no way to get\nany kind of vibration or\n\n967\n00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:23,160\nany kind of indication of\nwhat's going on in the room.\n\n968\n00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,709\nThey're totally isolated.\n\n969\n00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,280\nThese are the kinds of things.\n\n970\n00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,270\nThe movie a couple years ago that\ncame out, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\n\n971\n00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,860\nYou may or may not have seen\nthat the John le Carre novel\n\n972\n00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,260\nthat was turned into a movie\nin the last couple of years.\n\n973\n00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,990\nIf you haven't had a chance to see it,\nreally, really interesting.\n\n974\n00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,560\nGreat book, really interesting\nmovie did a great job with it.\n\n975\n00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,360\nBut at some point in there,\nit's about the British secret service and\n\n976\n00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:48,440\nkind of what goes on through the 1970s,\n1980s with spy scandals.\n\n977\n00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,352\nIn that particular movie, at one point\nthey walk into, several points in\n\n978\n00:44:52,352 --> 00:44:56,977\nthe movie, several shots, they walk into\na secure communication facility, a SCIF.\n\n979\n00:44:56,977 --> 00:44:58,287\nAnd effectively they're walking up,\n\n980\n00:44:58,287 --> 00:45:00,820\nit's almost like a little trailer\nparked in the middle of the office.\n\n981\n00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,690\nThey walk up and go in,\nthey shut the door.\n\n982\n00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:04,230\nAnd it's up on isolation springs,\n\n983\n00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,820\nyou see the whole thing is\ntotally isolated from the floor.\n\n984\n00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,390\nSo this is the kind of thing we see.\n\n985\n00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:11,340\nIt may be a secure vault where you go in,\nthere's a communication bubble that\n\n986\n00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,840\nliterally comes down around it,\nwhites it out.\n\n987\n00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,370\nThere's all these different ways to do it.\n\n988\n00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,060\nThey're pretty cool places.\n\n989\n00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:21,503\nThere was even one NCIS episode on TV\nin the last couple years where they\n\n990\n00:45:21,503 --> 00:45:26,270\ngo into the director's office,\nDirector Vance, and he throws a switch.\n\n991\n00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:31,080\nA panel comes up, and they've got the\nlayout of the room and it shows unsecured.\n\n992\n00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,640\nAnd then it's got the switch he throws and\ngoes into SCIF mode.\n\n993\n00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,895\nAnd it comes down and got the red\nborder and it's secure all around it.\n\n994\n00:45:35,895 --> 00:45:38,000\nBut it says on the screen,\nyou can see it, SCIF mode.\n\n995\n00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,520\nAnd the whole thing is blacked out.\n\n996\n00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,160\nThere's no electronic communications\nthat can go in or out for total privacy.\n\n997\n00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,030\n>> See,\nI knew that show was ultra realistic.\n\n998\n00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,060\n>> Isn't it?\nYeah that kinda thing.\n\n999\n00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:47,060\n>> Yes, yes,\nI believe everything that's on it.\n\n1000\n00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,190\n>> So\nthat's why it is the best show on TV.\n\n1001\n00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:49,832\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what they say,\n\n1002\n00:45:49,832 --> 00:45:50,640\nit's the best show.\n\n1003\n00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,860\nThat's their tag line, best show on TV.\n\n1004\n00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,970\nAll right, so this is the kind of thing\nwe're talking about with control zones,\n\n1005\n00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:56,720\njust so you're aware of them.\n\n1006\n00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,830\nAgain, if you don't work in the areas\nin the world in the kind of\n\n1007\n00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:05,070\ntechnology areas and the business areas\nthat may require this kind of technology,\n\n1008\n00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,130\nyou may not have seen it.\n\n1009\n00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,110\nBut if you go out and do a Google search\nfor SCIF, you'll be able to find plans to\n\n1010\n00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:13,310\nbuild them, you'll find pictures of them,\nyou can find all sorts of stuff out there.\n\n1011\n00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:15,151\nThis is not like it's super secret, and\n\n1012\n00:46:15,151 --> 00:46:17,710\nas a result you can't find\nout what they look like.\n\n1013\n00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:19,390\nYou just may not see one in production,\n\n1014\n00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:22,150\nyou may not see one and\nget a chance to interact with one.\n\n1015\n00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,240\nThat doesn't mean you\ncan't find out about them.\n\n1016\n00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,750\nAnd so if you're interested, take a look.\n\n1017\n00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,220\nYou never know.\n\n1018\n00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:32,024\nAll right, so let's talk a bit about IDS\nand IPS, Network Intrusion Detection and\n\n1019\n00:46:32,024 --> 00:46:35,070\nhost-based Intrusion Detection Solutions.\n\n1020\n00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,360\nSo this idea of IDS,\n\n1021\n00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,270\nIntrusion Detection System,\nis an idea of a passive monitoring system.\n\n1022\n00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:43,110\nAnd when we talk about intrusion\nprevention, we'll have something to say\n\n1023\n00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:46,020\nabout that in a couple of minutes,\nthese are active monitoring systems.\n\n1024\n00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:50,530\nAnd the key difference between the two\nis whether we simply record information,\n\n1025\n00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:53,130\nright so passive monitoring,\nnetwork or host-based,\n\n1026\n00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,240\nwe'll talk about the difference.\n\n1027\n00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,450\nBut don't really take any action right?\n\n1028\n00:46:56,450 --> 00:47:00,010\nWe're not gonna go out and go active and\ntry to fight off an attack.\n\n1029\n00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,050\nNothing like that.\n\n1030\n00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:02,830\n>> Might set off some alerts maybe.\n\n1031\n00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,677\n>> We might set off some\nalerts absolutely, but\n\n1032\n00:47:04,677 --> 00:47:06,190\nthey sorta just take note of things.\n\n1033\n00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,976\nWe're really just gonna monitor,\n\n1034\n00:47:07,976 --> 00:47:11,727\nwhereas when we are talking more about\nthis idea of intrusion prevention,\n\n1035\n00:47:11,727 --> 00:47:14,780\nwe're talking about the next\nlayer down the defense model.\n\n1036\n00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:18,250\nSo we're talking about not just\nmonitoring, but then also reacting.\n\n1037\n00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:20,010\nAnd we're gonna talk about\nreacting with IDS's.\n\n1038\n00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,900\nSo you do wanna understand\nthis is considered a passive\n\n1039\n00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:28,400\nmonitoring technology, an IDS, real time\ntraffic analysis on the network side.\n\n1040\n00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,910\nSo when we do network intrusion detection\n\n1041\n00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:33,160\nwe're monitoring traffic\nflow across a network.\n\n1042\n00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,090\nTypically subnet of a network, so\n\n1043\n00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:37,330\ntypically one subnet area\nis what we're monitoring.\n\n1044\n00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:40,030\nWe have multiple monitors set\nout throughout the network.\n\n1045\n00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:42,710\nWhat we call these agents\nthat are deployed or\n\n1046\n00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:45,020\nsensors that are deployed\nthroughout the network.\n\n1047\n00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,290\nThey could be software based or\nhardware based.\n\n1048\n00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,809\nAnd then we are gonna monitor\nfrom different subnets and\n\n1049\n00:47:49,809 --> 00:47:50,833\npick up that traffic.\n\n1050\n00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:54,181\nSo we monitor and send that traffic\nacross the wire through one or\n\n1051\n00:47:54,181 --> 00:47:57,792\nmore uploads to a monitoring server,\na central server of some kind.\n\n1052\n00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:01,805\nWhere we will log that information,\nto then do analysis and reporting and\n\n1053\n00:48:01,805 --> 00:48:03,110\nthings of that nature.\n\n1054\n00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:08,140\nThe host-based intrusion detection system,\nwhat's called a HID.\n\n1055\n00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,770\nis gonna be software that is installed,\n\n1056\n00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:12,710\nthe agent is software-based,\ninstalled on a target machine.\n\n1057\n00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:14,740\nThe focus of that is\nmonitoring that machine-\n\n1058\n00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,490\n>> Just that one.\n\n1059\n00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,436\n>> And\nthe environment on that one machine, so\n\n1060\n00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,800\nwe will have multiple HIDS deployed,\nbased on what we wanna know.\n\n1061\n00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,090\nNot real time monitoring.\n\n1062\n00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:27,150\nWe are recording activity on the machine,\nbut then we're aggregating that, and\n\n1063\n00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:31,170\nperhaps then taking that, and\ntrying to see when that is going to,\n\n1064\n00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:33,370\non some sort of schedule, get uploaded.\n\n1065\n00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,970\nand that's really what we're talking\nabout, and Thinking about, there so\n\n1066\n00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:37,630\njust be aware of that.\n\n1067\n00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:39,930\nWhen we think about these\ntwo different models,\n\n1068\n00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:43,100\nwe then have to talk about different\nways in which these are setup.\n\n1069\n00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,200\nIn other words, what kinds or\ntypes, do we have for network and\n\n1070\n00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,850\nhost based IDSs out there.\n\n1071\n00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:52,000\nAnd so we wanna talk about the different\nkinds, or types that are there.\n\n1072\n00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,720\nSo we have Signature Based\nas a key category, and\n\n1073\n00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,900\nAnomaly Based, and\nyou can see both of those there.\n\n1074\n00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,420\nAnd then under Signature and Anomaly\nBased, we have some different types, so\n\n1075\n00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:02,580\nlet's just quickly talk\nthrough what those are.\n\n1076\n00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,970\nFor Signature Based,\nwe have Pattern Matching.\n\n1077\n00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:08,360\nAnd this is the idea that the pattern\nmatch must be kept up to date.\n\n1078\n00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,050\nThis is more often than not, seen for\nsomething like, for instance,\n\n1079\n00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,130\nyour antivirus software.\n\n1080\n00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,170\n>> Right.\n>> Your anti-malware,\n\n1081\n00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:15,440\nis gonna be a pattern matching solution,\n\n1082\n00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,340\nwhere you download pattern\nfiles from a vendor.\n\n1083\n00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,740\nThey're only as up to date, and only as\ngood as the last time they were updated.\n\n1084\n00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:24,750\nSo the challenge there, is if you\nhave zero-day exploits, that may or\n\n1085\n00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,670\nmay not be available as a pattern.\n\n1086\n00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,070\nWe're not gonna know that we're\nseeing abhorrent behavior.\n\n1087\n00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,130\nThis traffic is not gonna match up.\n\n1088\n00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:34,790\nAnd it may be streaming in for some time,\nuntil we realize there's a problem,\n\n1089\n00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:35,870\nmay not be aware of it.\n\n1090\n00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,680\nRight?\nSo that's definitely a downside to\n\n1091\n00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,490\npattern matching, right?\n\n1092\n00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:44,420\nStateful matching, instead of pattern,\nwe are pattern matching in a sense.\n\n1093\n00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:49,460\nbut we're not using a predetermined, a\nsequence of a predetermined pattern file,\n\n1094\n00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,000\ncalled a definition file.\n\n1095\n00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000\nInstead we are looking at network\ntraffic as it streams across, and\n\n1096\n00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,950\nbuilding a pattern based on this\nstatefulness of the traffic.\n\n1097\n00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:00,370\nMeaning looking at the sequencing\nacross the traffic, and\n\n1098\n00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:04,130\nas a result of that ,we are going to get\nto know, and have some information that we\n\n1099\n00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:07,340\ncan buildup around behavior\nin our database around this.\n\n1100\n00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,210\nBut, again, you're only as\ngood as the pattern traffics.\n\n1101\n00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,865\nThe pattern traffics,\nlet me try that again.\n\n1102\n00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:13,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let me invert that.\n\n1103\n00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,580\nThe traffic patterns that we are seeing,\nright?\n\n1104\n00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:19,030\nSo if we have not seen this kind of\nbehavior before, we're not gonna\n\n1105\n00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:22,270\nrealize perhaps that it is aberrant,\nthat there is something wrong with it.\n\n1106\n00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:26,220\nSo if we don't see a fragmentation\nattack having taken place before, and\n\n1107\n00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,110\nwe may not have a point of reference for\nthat.\n\n1108\n00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:32,160\nWe may not realize that fragmented\ndata coming in, that's being stitched\n\n1109\n00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,140\ntogether on the other side to create\nan attack vector, is a problem.\n\n1110\n00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,280\nWe might not be able to block that.\n\n1111\n00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,060\nWe may tag the packets,\nwhen they realize that there may or\n\n1112\n00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,930\nmay not be something wrong\nwith that offset, but\n\n1113\n00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:44,150\nwe may not know enough to aggregate them,\nand understand that's an attack.\n\n1114\n00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:47,520\nSo that's something, to just to think\nabout, and be aware of as well.\n\n1115\n00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,100\nThen we have anomaly based, right?\n\n1116\n00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,240\nAnomaly based solutions.\n\n1117\n00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,340\nThis is gonna look at the stream\nof traffic, these systems\n\n1118\n00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:56,350\nwill look at the stream of traffic,\nfrom several different vantage points,\n\n1119\n00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:59,310\ndepending on the kinds of anomaly\nbased solutions we look at.\n\n1120\n00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:04,230\nLooks at the stream, and then based on\nthe filtering we are doing, there's four\n\n1121\n00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:09,690\ncategories, we're gonna then try to zero\nin on traffic that somehow looks unusual.\n\n1122\n00:51:09,690 --> 00:51:10,350\nAnd as a result,\n\n1123\n00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:14,490\nagain much like a stateful match, on\nthe signature base pattern side, where we\n\n1124\n00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:18,690\nhave to have that pattern set up ahead of\ntime, that signature file has to be built.\n\n1125\n00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:20,090\nWe have to know what it is.\n\n1126\n00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,320\nSo, we have statistical anomaly based.\n\n1127\n00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,800\nSo, looking for,\nI think there could be statistical.\n\n1128\n00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,160\nOne of the ones there.\n\n1129\n00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,730\nSo, we could be looking for\nstatistical anomalies.\n\n1130\n00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:31,640\nThings that out, or are unusual in\nterms of their behavioral pattern.\n\n1131\n00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,470\nProtocol based anomalies, where raw\ntraffic and protocols right there,\n\n1132\n00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:36,590\nprotocol anomalies.\n\n1133\n00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:38,260\nWe could be looking at traffic overall,\n\n1134\n00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,950\nso looking at raw traffic\nwould be traffic based.\n\n1135\n00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,510\nCould also be looking at rule based.\n\n1136\n00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:48,340\nAnd we didn't write rule specifically, we\nlooked after said, we looked at expected\n\n1137\n00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:51,690\nbehavior, and look at expected\nbehavior is basically rule based.\n\n1138\n00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:52,840\nThat's what we would think.\n\n1139\n00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:55,390\nSo we have this idea of statistical.\n\n1140\n00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:57,780\nWe have this idea of protocol based,\ntraffic based,\n\n1141\n00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,160\nor rule based as anomaly vector.\n\n1142\n00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,170\nSo we can look at any one, or\nall of these, and we could then\n\n1143\n00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:07,490\nbegin to build the picture of what's going\non with our network traffic as a result.\n\n1144\n00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:10,320\nSo this is the kind of thought process.\n\n1145\n00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,970\nThese are the kind of architectures\nthat are used with IDS solutions.\n\n1146\n00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:17,010\nAnd so, when you are getting ready\nto go through this material.\n\n1147\n00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:20,900\nWant to make sure you know the two major\ncategories, signature and anomaly based.\n\n1148\n00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,280\nWant to make sure we know the two\nsignature based types, pattern and\n\n1149\n00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,570\nstateful, before anomaly based types.\n\n1150\n00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,230\nWe'll talk about traffic.\n\n1151\n00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,110\nRule based.\n\n1152\n00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:31,670\nWe're talking about signature,\nexcuse me, statistical based,\n\n1153\n00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:33,262\nand we're talking about protocol based.\n\n1154\n00:52:33,262 --> 00:52:34,620\n>> Right.\nJust wanna make sure we know\n\n1155\n00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,270\nwhat those are.\n\n1156\n00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:37,540\nIt's very important to\nbe thinking about those.\n\n1157\n00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,575\nIDS types as we summarize them,\nare valuable to us,\n\n1158\n00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,578\ncuz we have to really\nunderstand how they work.\n\n1159\n00:52:42,578 --> 00:52:46,370\nRight.\nAlright we also have this HIP,\n\n1160\n00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,950\nthe host-based IPS,\nwhat is called the HIP or HIPS.\n\n1161\n00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:53,170\nSo IPS solutions, generically,\nas Mike pointed out earlier,\n\n1162\n00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,610\nare gonna be able to go active, right,\nand are gonna be able to respond and\n\n1163\n00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:00,460\nbasically stop attacks,\nas well as alerting to them in real time.\n\n1164\n00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:04,680\nIPS, a few years back considered\nnext generation technology,\n\n1165\n00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,660\na little bit more mainstream today.\n\n1166\n00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,680\nBut they are going to be able to go live,\nand\n\n1167\n00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,420\nreact, not just for court, in real time.\n\n1168\n00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,380\nLet's talk about honey pots.\n\n1169\n00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,650\nWinnie the Pooh, and honey pots.\n\n1170\n00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:18,820\nWe also have something\ncalled the honey net,\n\n1171\n00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,700\nwhich is just a collection of honey pots,\nmay want to be aware of as well.\n\n1172\n00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:28,610\nBut I put down there a hacking magnet,\ninstead of anything else for honey pot,\n\n1173\n00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:31,930\nwhen we were talking about this, and Mike\nsaid what do you want to define this as.\n\n1174\n00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,520\nAnd I said hacking magnet, and\nhe said I like that, that's cool.\n\n1175\n00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,970\nThat should've been my lower third.\n\n1176\n00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,520\nHe said hacking magnet,\nthat would've been the one to go with.\n\n1177\n00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,110\nSo this idea of a honey pot,\n\n1178\n00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:44,280\nis one machine that is set up\nbasically as a sacrificial lamb.\n\n1179\n00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,370\nIt's a decoy on the network.\n\n1180\n00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:47,480\n>> Right\n>> It's not going to be well protected,\n\n1181\n00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,350\nwell locked down, well patched.\n\n1182\n00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:51,620\nJust enough,\ntypically to get people interested,\n\n1183\n00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:54,330\nbut not enough that's it's going\nto be really hard to break in.\n\n1184\n00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,520\nIt's not obvious, right.\n\n1185\n00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:56,320\nHopefully it's not obvious.\n\n1186\n00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,555\nIt depends on how you\nbuild your honey pots.\n\n1187\n00:53:57,555 --> 00:54:01,552\n>> [Laughter]\n>> And as a result of that,\n\n1188\n00:54:01,552 --> 00:54:04,567\nwe're looking to attract atackers, looking\nto attract, entice, we'll talk about this\n\n1189\n00:54:04,567 --> 00:54:06,930\nword entice and entrap,\nthe definition of these two in a minute.\n\n1190\n00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:10,760\nBut we're looking to entice hackers\ninto breaking into the system.\n\n1191\n00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,730\nUsing it as a crucible.\n\n1192\n00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:15,550\nReally look at it as something that\nwe can examine from different sides.\n\n1193\n00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:17,350\n>> Seeing the attack vectors.\n\n1194\n00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:21,150\nUnderstand the behavior, and\nas a result of that, what we can do,\n\n1195\n00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:24,970\nhopefully, is we can examine the ways\nin which they are breaking in.\n\n1196\n00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,800\nThen, hopefully, learn from that,\nand build better systems.\n\n1197\n00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,080\nSo a single machine put out there\non the net, is a honey pot.\n\n1198\n00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,060\nMultiple machines linked\ntogether would be a honet net.\n\n1199\n00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:34,900\nAnd the ideas, and\n\n1200\n00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:37,441\nby the way we should probably throw\nyou around out there, honeynet.org.\n\n1201\n00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:38,960\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> You may want to go out and\n\n1202\n00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,605\ntake a look at that.\n\n1203\n00:54:40,605 --> 00:54:43,650\nHoneynet.org is the you know,\nkind of the official site for\n\n1204\n00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:45,500\na lot of this work that goes on.\n\n1205\n00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,860\nOpen source,\nproject to do honey nets and honey pots.\n\n1206\n00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:49,970\nDefinitely valuable to you.\n\n1207\n00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:51,550\nTalk about it in my hacking classes.\n\n1208\n00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,090\n>> You can download from them too,\nand run it virtually.\n\n1209\n00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:53,720\n>> You can.\nAbsolutely.\n\n1210\n00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,190\nThey do have some, and a lot of these\nare built as virtual machines today.\n\n1211\n00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,618\nAbsolutely correct, right?\n\n1212\n00:54:57,618 --> 00:54:59,810\nBecause the old-fashioned\nway of doing things by hand,\n\n1213\n00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:02,630\nwhere we had to build it physically,\nthat is, somebody took it down and\n\n1214\n00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:05,380\nscrewed it up,\nIt was a lot more work to reset it.\n\n1215\n00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,480\nWith this, you just snapshot it.\n\n1216\n00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,380\n>> Restore point.\n\n1217\n00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,930\n>> Right.\nJust a restore point and back,\n\n1218\n00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:09,480\nthere you are.\n\n1219\n00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,100\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n1220\n00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,720\nSo be aware of honey pots.\n\n1221\n00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,870\nWe also want to talk about enticement and\nentrapment.\n\n1222\n00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:14,840\nLet's talk about this.\n\n1223\n00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,700\nThis is something important.\n\n1224\n00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,525\nThis will come up again,\nwhen we go through the legal, and\n\n1225\n00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:23,765\ncompliance, and regulatory section\nof knowledge around the SICSP.\n\n1226\n00:55:23,765 --> 00:55:25,475\nBut this idea of enticement and\nentrapment's,\n\n1227\n00:55:25,475 --> 00:55:28,945\nvery important as key knowledge areas,\nbecause we have to understand when we\n\n1228\n00:55:28,945 --> 00:55:33,590\nbuild systems like honey pots, whether or\nnot they are considered to be legal.\n\n1229\n00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:36,900\nAnd therefore can be used, and\nwe can gather information with them.\n\n1230\n00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,410\nOr potentially they\nare considered to be illegal.\n\n1231\n00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:40,690\nEntrapment is illegal.\n\n1232\n00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:42,100\n>> Right. Mm-hm. >> Enticement is legal.\n\n1233\n00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:46,333\nSo enticement is this idea of allowing\nsomeone to see enough of the system.\n\n1234\n00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:48,333\nWe can, you know,\nbasically invite them in.\n\n1235\n00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:52,688\nAnd then if we allow them, right,\nto see the system And they think, okay,\n\n1236\n00:55:52,688 --> 00:55:55,750\nwell maybe I'll go take a look,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1237\n00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:59,550\nSo is it okay to entrap them,\ninvite them in under false pretenses?\n\n1238\n00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:00,930\nNo, absolutely not.\n\n1239\n00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,180\nIs it okay to entice them?\n\n1240\n00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:06,060\nDangle just a little bit out there,\nget them interested, but then they have to\n\n1241\n00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:10,780\ntake the step across the threshold, and\nsay, I wanna do something to the system.\n\n1242\n00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:11,930\nThat is the difference.\n\n1243\n00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:13,110\nThat's really the pivot point.\n\n1244\n00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:14,350\nSo when we think about this,\n\n1245\n00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:19,490\nthe idea is that basically we can set\nup a system that entices somebody.\n\n1246\n00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:24,050\nThat allows them to make the decision for\nthemselves as to whether or\n\n1247\n00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:26,090\nnot they want to engage in this behavior.\n\n1248\n00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,630\nIf we do that, that's okay.\n\n1249\n00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:31,980\nIf we set up a system in such\na way that entraps them,\n\n1250\n00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:35,710\nthat brings them in,\nwhere the intruder is basically induced or\n\n1251\n00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:38,950\ntricked Into committing the crime,\nthat is not okay.\n\n1252\n00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,700\nAnd so you hear this raging debate\nall the time around a lot of things.\n\n1253\n00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,370\nThere's a lot of debate in the security\ncommunity around whether honeypots\n\n1254\n00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,710\nare enticement or entrapment mechanisms.\n\n1255\n00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:49,810\nYou were asking about that.\n\n1256\n00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:53,150\nWe were talking about that off\ncamera before the segment started.\n\n1257\n00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:56,616\nYou see this all the time around the way\nin which sting operations are run in law\n\n1258\n00:56:56,616 --> 00:56:57,320\nenforcement.\n\n1259\n00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:01,069\nSo things like undercover drug busts or\nprostitution busts,\n\n1260\n00:57:01,069 --> 00:57:06,925\nwhere they may send an agent or an officer\nundercover to elicit people to do buys or\n\n1261\n00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:09,130\nelicit people to engage in behavior.\n\n1262\n00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:14,090\nSo the trick there is, if they ask you,\nyou get a get out of jail free card.\n\n1263\n00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:16,220\nIf you ask them,\nyou get to go to jail, right?\n\n1264\n00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,170\nBecause if you say, hey,\nI want to buy something, or hey, how much,\n\n1265\n00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:22,520\nor whatever that context is,\nyou're eliciting them,\n\n1266\n00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,910\nyou're effectively saying to them, hey,\nI want to engage in this behavior.\n\n1267\n00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,510\nAnd so as a result, that is enticement.\n\n1268\n00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:31,280\nThey can dangle that\nundercover item out there,\n\n1269\n00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,366\nthe undercover officer offering\nthe drugs or whatever it is or\n\n1270\n00:57:34,366 --> 00:57:38,670\nperhaps prostitution, that kind of thing,\nmaking themselves available.\n\n1271\n00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:43,020\nBut if you engage in the discussion,\nand you ask about that\n\n1272\n00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,750\nservice that is supposedly made\navailable but not being advertised.\n\n1273\n00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:48,870\nYou are engaging in\nbehavior that is illegal.\n\n1274\n00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:49,903\nIt's enticement.\n\n1275\n00:57:49,903 --> 00:57:51,738\nWe can kind of tempt you, but\n\n1276\n00:57:51,738 --> 00:57:55,770\nwe can't make you do it without\nyour own free will involved.\n\n1277\n00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:59,681\nAnd if we entrap you, if we say to you,\nhey, look at this, I have this, and\n\n1278\n00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:01,690\nit's this much, and you want to buy.\n\n1279\n00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:04,380\nBut then no, you basically get\nout of jail free if you try it.\n\n1280\n00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,770\nAnd please,\ndo not put this to the test by the way.\n\n1281\n00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:09,250\nI want to be clear.\n\n1282\n00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:12,990\nLegal concepts here,\nvery clearly defined in law.\n\n1283\n00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,400\nWe understand the concepts,\ndo not want to put them to the test.\n\n1284\n00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,150\nSo we wanna understand them-\n>> Some really good defense\n\n1285\n00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:18,790\nlawyers out there.\n\n1286\n00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:20,250\n>> Absolutely.\nWe do wanna understand them from\n\n1287\n00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:23,120\nan information security management\nstandpoint because we do need to\n\n1288\n00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,100\nunderstand with something\nlike honeypots and\n\n1289\n00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:28,910\nhoneynets, where we stand on\nthe enticement, entrapment solution.\n\n1290\n00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:31,059\n>> And at this point, for the most part,\nthey do fall under enticement, right?\n\n1291\n00:58:31,059 --> 00:58:31,980\nI mean-\n>> We consider\n\n1292\n00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,876\nthem to be enticement items, where we are\nenticing you to come in and take a look,\n\n1293\n00:58:36,876 --> 00:58:38,830\nbut we're not entrapping you.\n\n1294\n00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:39,660\nWe're not entrapping you.\n\n1295\n00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,290\nSo we just wanna make sure we're thinking\nabout that and we understand that.\n\n1296\n00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,850\nIn general, define the terms,\nunderstand the terms, and\n\n1297\n00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:48,330\nplease make sure you know what they are.\n\n1298\n00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:50,770\nWith that, maybe just a couple more\nquick terms we'll throw out there.\n\n1299\n00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,740\nI think we captured them in the notes,\nbut it's okay.\n\n1300\n00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:55,350\nGenerically a network sniffer,\nwe're talking about honeypots and\n\n1301\n00:58:55,350 --> 00:58:56,190\nthings like that.\n\n1302\n00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:58,890\nOne of the ways we would examine what's\ngoing on is use a network sniffer to\n\n1303\n00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:02,980\ncapture the traffic that is going\nacross the wire, towards the honeypot,\n\n1304\n00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,470\nto see what it is.\n\n1305\n00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:08,200\nTo give an example, this may be\nMicrosoft's network monitor product.\n\n1306\n00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,565\nSolar Winds has network\n[LAUGH] whatever that was.\n\n1307\n00:59:11,565 --> 00:59:16,210\nSolar Winds has monitoring products out in\nmarket, all sorts of ones were there so\n\n1308\n00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:17,500\njust be aware of that.\n\n1309\n00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,250\nWe have some attack mechanisms\nthat we want to think of and\n\n1310\n00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,910\njust be aware of here that\nwe may see with honeypots.\n\n1311\n00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:27,180\nThings that may be used to\ntake the honeypot down.\n\n1312\n00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,820\nSo things like a dictionary attack,\nwe talked about this earlier.\n\n1313\n00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,300\nWe talked about password sniffing and\nthings like that.\n\n1314\n00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:37,160\nA dictionary attack would allow you to\nload a predetermined list of words and\n\n1315\n00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,360\nthen use it to try to break\nthe password and find out what it is.\n\n1316\n00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,990\nSo brute force attack would just\neffectively use software to throw any\n\n1317\n00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:47,270\ncombination of anything at\nthe system until we can get in.\n\n1318\n00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,520\nWe may be spoofing at logons, so\n\n1319\n00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:53,250\nmaybe masquerading as somebody, trying\nto get in by guessing their password.\n\n1320\n00:59:53,250 --> 00:59:56,470\nAll these would be things to consider,\nphishing and pharming.\n\n1321\n00:59:56,470 --> 01:00:01,075\nWe've talked about some social engineering\nissues in some of our other shows and\n\n1322\n01:00:01,075 --> 01:00:02,960\nsome of our other episodes.\n\n1323\n01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,170\nAnd so phishing, where we go out and\ntry to use social engineering to\n\n1324\n01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:10,640\ngather information, maybe via e-mail,\nmaybe via voice, something like that.\n\n1325\n01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,760\nPharming, where we will go out and\n\n1326\n01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,900\nwe will set up all sorts of solutions\nout at their websites, things like that,\n\n1327\n01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:20,280\nwhere we have fake frames running bad\ninformation people download from.\n\n1328\n01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,600\nAll sorts of things could be done,\n\n1329\n01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:25,570\na variety of different ways to go\nthrough and kind of think about this.\n\n1330\n01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:30,620\nSo just be aware about spear phishing,\nwhere we go after very large groups of\n\n1331\n01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:34,340\npeople generically is just phishing,\nspear phishing is very targeted, right?\n\n1332\n01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:37,670\nWe're gonna go after one specific\nkind of person or one person and\n\n1333\n01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:41,210\nthen we could talk about things like\nwhaling, where we go after very large C\n\n1334\n01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:45,280\nlevel, typically senior executives,\nvery popular in the financial industry,\n\n1335\n01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,540\nwhere we target bank presidents and\nthings like that.\n\n1336\n01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,310\nTrying to extort information from them.\n\n1337\n01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:51,670\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1338\n01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:53,810\nCould be some things that go on there.\n\n1339\n01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:57,630\nSo just some last minute vocabulary things\njust to throw out at you and for you to be\n\n1340\n01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:02,420\naware of in the access control area as we\nlook to round out our conversation here.\n\n1341\n01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,680\nThere's also vishing,\n\n1342\n01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:07,350\nwhich is the voice over IP phishing\nthat is being done these days.\n\n1343\n01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:09,355\nAnd there's a lot more\nout there obviously.\n\n1344\n01:01:09,355 --> 01:01:12,760\nAnd you could come up with\nall sorts of ones, but\n\n1345\n01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,600\nthese are the main ones that\nwe more often than not see.\n\n1346\n01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,860\n>> Very good.\n>> I think we've done a pretty good job of\n\n1347\n01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,220\ndiscussing access control.\n\n1348\n01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:19,800\n>> I think so.\n\n1349\n01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,390\nI think so.\n\n1350\n01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:23,970\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen, well that\nwraps up our show for access control.\n\n1351\n01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:27,180\nI hope you guys enjoyed the show, and\nremember, while you're watching the show,\n\n1352\n01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,320\nyou can always chat with\nus

00:00:34,381\nAnd welcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:37,351\nI'm your host, Don Pezet today with Mr.\nAdam Gordon.\n\n5\n00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:38,230\nHow's it going Adam?\n\n6\n00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,130\n>> It is going well.\n\n7\n00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,170\nHow about with you Don?\n\n8\n00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,900\n>> You can tell we're jazzed and\npumped up.\n\n9\n00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,710\nWe've got our finger guns at the ready.\n\n10\n00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,910\nAnd that is a-\n>> I'm gonna be a double shooter.\n\n11\n00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,530\n>> That is a sure sign of an awesome\nepisode of about to follow.\n\n12\n00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,440\n>> It is.\n>> [LAUGHS] Now we just need to work in\n\n13\n00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,340\nour jazz hands and our sparkle fingers.\n\n14\n00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,745\nIf we can get that into\nthe episode then we are golden.\n\n15\n00:00:57,745 --> 00:01:00,500\n[LAUGHS]\n>> Moose ears.\n\n16\n00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,425\n>> These are our secret hand codes.\n\n17\n00:01:02,425 --> 00:01:03,660\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> That let you know,\n\n18\n00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,030\nhelp we're in trouble save us.\n\n19\n00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,720\n>> Please.\n>> They're holding us prisoner in\n\n20\n00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,675\nthe studio on saturday.\n\n21\n00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:09,130\n[LAUGHS].\n>> Exactly.\n\n22\n00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,080\n>> All right, well,\nwe're ready to move into our next segment,\n\n23\n00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,830\nwhich is Telecommunications and Networking\nSecurity, or Network Security, sorry.\n\n24\n00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,050\nAnd it's a big topic, so\nthis is gonna be a multi-parters.\n\n25\n00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,050\nSo, let me just,\nI'll kill the anticipation and set us up.\n\n26\n00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,760\nWe're gonna have a cliffhanger\nof an ending, on this episode.\n\n27\n00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,680\nWe'll probably have to do two parts,\nmaybe even three is possible.\n\n28\n00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,970\nYou never know how long we're\ngonna jabber on sometimes.\n\n29\n00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,930\nBut at least two parts\nas we move through this.\n\n30\n00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,020\nSo we're gonna start out with some\nnetworking concepts today and\n\n31\n00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,210\nthen in our next episode we'll move\nforward and continue with those and\n\n32\n00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,180\ntry and wrap it up from there.\n\n33\n00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,430\nSo lots of stuff to get into.\n\n34\n00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,620\n>> All right.\nSo multi-part type networking.\n\n35\n00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,595\nI like the concept.\n\n36\n00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:50,120\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is gonna be interesting.\n\n37\n00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,950\n>> Divide and conquer.\n\n38\n00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,650\n>> Divide and conquer.\n\n39\n00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,030\nBreak some new ground here.\n\n40\n00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,170\nAlright, so\nhope everybody is interested in and\n\n41\n00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,101\nreally focused on this idea of,\nMTU equals zero, that's great.\n\n42\n00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:03,510\nIs focused on this idea\n[LAUGH] of networking and\n\n43\n00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,870\nsecurity as we're talking about this.\n\n44\n00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,197\nAnd so we've been going through\nthe CISSP bodies of knowledge.\n\n45\n00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:11,722\nRight?\nAnd obviously as we continue talking about\n\n46\n00:02:11,722 --> 00:02:15,100\nvarious topics, we're trying to\nbuild two levels of pictures.\n\n47\n00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,160\nAnd I quickly just want to paint a concept\nout for you to begin to talk about\n\n48\n00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,460\nnetworking, because the idea of networking\nis really about building architecture.\n\n49\n00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,470\nBuilding infrastructure in such\na way that things interlock.\n\n50\n00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,020\nRight?\nThey kind of mutually support each other.\n\n51\n00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,260\nAnd so this idea of building on prior\nknowledge, but then also having\n\n52\n00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,370\nkind of a vision, a strategy about\nwhere we wanna go is this overall plan.\n\n53\n00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,600\nSo, the overall plan,\n\n54\n00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,320\nas we know, is really ultimately\nto share knowledge with you.\n\n55\n00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,360\nHelp you to figure out\nhow to be successful.\n\n56\n00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,080\nBoth as a security professional,\nobtain your CISSP credential.\n\n57\n00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,370\nBut also, become a more well\nrounded IT professional.\n\n58\n00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,250\nGet a better understanding of some\nof these areas with knowledge,\n\n59\n00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,660\nthat you may not work with everyday.\n\n60\n00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,430\nRight?\nAnd so, most of us probably\n\n61\n00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,500\nhave a background, as Don and I do, for\ninstance, in one or more of these areas.\n\n62\n00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,140\nWe're probably somewhat comfortable with\na lot of them, but there maybe one or\n\n63\n00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,820\ntwo out of the bodies of knowledge of ten,\nthat make up CISSP,\n\n64\n00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,640\nthat we may not spend a lot of time with.\n\n65\n00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,510\nAnd we talked about this in\nsome of those other areas,\n\n66\n00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,340\nas we've done shows on\nsome of these things.\n\n67\n00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,050\nWe may be comfortable with networking and\nwe're gonna help you to explain that here.\n\n68\n00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,990\nBut you know, maybe you don't\ndo physical security every day.\n\n69\n00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,730\nMaybe cryptography is just not your thing.\n\n70\n00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,200\nAnd so that's okay.\n\n71\n00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,220\nSo we're gonna help you\nto walk through those.\n\n72\n00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,100\nCreate some guide posts.\n\n73\n00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,930\nSome milestones for\n\n74\n00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,080\nyou to help you understand\na measure of success along the way.\n\n75\n00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,530\nHelp you to figure out what to study.\n\n76\n00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,760\nAnd be successful as you face\nthat part of this challenge.\n\n77\n00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,935\nOf getting ready for the exam.\n\n78\n00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:41,930\nSo, what we're gonna do and focus on here\nis really in this particular discussion,\n\n79\n00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,050\nin this episode.\n\n80\n00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,340\nWe thought, we'd dive in and\n\n81\n00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,605\nstart talking about some network-related\nstuff specific to IP addressing.\n\n82\n00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:50,290\nSub-netting, goes through IPv4.\n\n83\n00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,780\nWhat is all that?\n\n84\n00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,100\nBut, I always wanna lay out\nthe beginning overview for us.\n\n85\n00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,110\nEspecially, this would begin\na new show with a new episode and\n\n86\n00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,110\na new focus on an area of knowledge.\n\n87\n00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,570\nAround the three cornerstones, or\n\n88\n00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,340\npillars of what we have been\nreferring to as information security.\n\n89\n00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,870\nRight?\nWe keep coming back\n\n90\n00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,950\nto these ideas of confidentiality,\nof integrity, and of availability.\n\n91\n00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,180\nAnd so, in this particular body\nof knowledge in this area,\n\n92\n00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,960\nwe're focusing clearly on networking and\nsecurity.\n\n93\n00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,090\nWe're gonna focus on confidentiality as we\ntalk about some of the things that relate\n\n94\n00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,090\nto how we securely transmit and\ntransfer data across the wire.\n\n95\n00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:26,820\nWhat we would call data on the wire,\ndata on the move.\n\n96\n00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,630\nSo when we build these architectures,\n\n97\n00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,250\nuse things like the OSI model to\nunderstand how to move data around,\n\n98\n00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,780\nwe wanna understand how to do that\nwith confidentiality in mind.\n\n99\n00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,780\nWhen we think about integrity,\nI wanna make sure we're thinking about\n\n100\n00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,160\ndata not being manipulated and in anyway\ntransformed without our knowledge.\n\n101\n00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,250\nSo things such as hashing, digital\nsignatures will come up in this area.\n\n102\n00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,870\nAnd well talk about some of that.\n\n103\n00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,180\nAnd availability is really about making\nsure that when data needs to be accessed,\n\n104\n00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,130\nIt is available to those that have\nthe requirement, the need, and\n\n105\n00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,560\nthe authorization to see it.\n\n106\n00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,630\nWe've talked about this in access control,\nin security operations.\n\n107\n00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,430\nWe talked about it in physical security.\n\n108\n00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,360\nSo, as much of a focus here.\n\n109\n00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,090\nRight?\nWe wanna be aware of availability,\n\n110\n00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,680\nbut really focusing on confidentiality,\n\n111\n00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,770\nfocusing on integrity through network\narchitecture, defense in depth, and\n\n112\n00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,250\nsome of those design elements\nthat we're gonna speak about.\n\n113\n00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,680\nAnd IP addressing and really\nunderstanding how to do IP addressing.\n\n114\n00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,910\nWhat and IP address means?\n\n115\n00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,770\nWhat subnets are?\n\n116\n00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,130\nThings of this nature that Don is gonna\nhelp us walk through over the next few\n\n117\n00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,260\nminutes are gonna be central to this idea\nof creature a secure environment for\n\n118\n00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,560\ninformation management.\n\n119\n00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,550\nBecause we can identify where information\nlives based on which networks it touches\n\n120\n00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,680\nand as a result which networks it\nmay not be able to transit across.\n\n121\n00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,370\nAll right, so these are important\nconcepts we're gonna start building out.\n\n122\n00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,460\nSo, how are we gonna start talking about\nIP address and where are we gonna jump in,\n\n123\n00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,560\nwhat should we do first?\n\n124\n00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,850\n>> Well, let's start really general.\n\n125\n00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,150\nRight?\nWith the fact that in order for\n\n126\n00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,075\ntwo computers to talk to each other\nthey've gotta have some kind of address,\n\n127\n00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:55,695\nsome kind of name,\nwhere they can find each other.\n\n128\n00:05:55,695 --> 00:05:58,885\nAnd in the old days of networking,\nwhere it was just a couple of computers in\n\n129\n00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:01,295\nthe same room,\nthis is a pretty simple process.\n\n130\n00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,135\nRight?\nSo there were tons of different\n\n131\n00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:06,860\nprotocols and methods for communicating\nthat used very simple addresses.\n\n132\n00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,990\nBut when you take\nthe Internet into account.\n\n133\n00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,112\nWhen you have millions upon millions of\ncomputers all across the world how can you\n\n134\n00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:18,233\npossibly expect to keep a directory of all\nthe machines that are out there that you\n\n135\n00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:19,586\ncan potentially talk to?\n\n136\n00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:20,340\nYou can't.\n\n137\n00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:20,967\nRight?\n\n138\n00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:24,200\nAnd so they had to create a new structure.\n\n139\n00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,990\nA new way of naming or\naddressing these machines.\n\n140\n00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,150\nSo that we can identify when somebody\nwas in the building with us or\n\n141\n00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,080\nif they were remote.\n\n142\n00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,060\nIf they were remote,\n\n143\n00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,590\nwhat's the best way to get there,\nall that had to be figured out.\n\n144\n00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,430\nAll right.\n\n145\n00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,960\nAnd this is stuff that wasn't\nthought about in 60s and\n\n146\n00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,670\n70s as networking was starting to emerge.\n\n147\n00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,200\nBut by the 80s and especially the 90s, the\nreality of it really started to sync in\n\n148\n00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,630\nthat we were gonna have networks\nthat were of a massive scale.\n\n149\n00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,700\nAll right?\n\n150\n00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,500\nSo, IP addressing,\nIP is the Internet Protocol and\n\n151\n00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,290\nwe'll hear it usually referred to\nby a stack name which is TCP IP.\n\n152\n00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:01,290\nBut IP by itself, just the Internet\nProtocol, is that addressing structure\n\n153\n00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,400\nthat lets us handle millions upon\nmillions, actually billions upon billions\n\n154\n00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,010\nof IPs of addresses,\nof machines that are out there to talk to.\n\n155\n00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:10,760\nSo this is,\n\n156\n00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,630\ntoday, the most common addressing\nstructure in the world by a long shot.\n\n157\n00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,785\nIt's not even a this has 52%,\nit's like some ridiculous\n\n158\n00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:25,210\n90-something percent of the addressing\nused out there is IPv4 based.\n\n159\n00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,620\nNow, we are starting to\nsee IPv6 creeping up,\n\n160\n00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,770\nwe'll talk about that a little bit later.\n\n161\n00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,800\nBut for now,\nwhat's prevalent in the real world, and\n\n162\n00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,520\nwhat's prevalent on the exam, is IPv4.\n\n163\n00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,710\nSo we want to take some time and\ntalk about that address structure.\n\n164\n00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,530\nHow the addresses work, what they're\nmade up of, and how we manipulate them.\n\n165\n00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,250\n>> All right, very good.\n\n166\n00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,838\nSo let's probably start by maybe throwing\nup what an IPv4 address is made up of in\n\n167\n00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:50,083\nterms of the components, and\ntalk about the structure.\n\n168\n00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,520\nAnd so Don's gonna put up pretty much\na standard address that we use a lot of\n\n169\n00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,400\ntimes as we start illustrating.\n\n170\n00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,068\nThis is gonna be a Class C address,\n\n171\n00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:59,900\nwe'll talk about IP address\nclasses little bit later on.\n\n172\n00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,324\nLet's not worry about that for\nnow, we will circle back to that.\n\n173\n00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:07,230\nBut a standard Class C address here,\nmade up of what we call four octets.\n\n174\n00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,520\nAnd let's start by building out\nthis idea of what an octet is,\n\n175\n00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,570\nhow it represents bits and ultimately\nhow it gets you, this idea of a 32 bit\n\n176\n00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,780\naddress, because clearly for an IPv4\nstructure, this is the magic number.\n\n177\n00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,730\nOne of the magic numbers, 255 will be\nanother magic number, for our bit count.\n\n178\n00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,690\nAnd we'll talk about some other numbers,\nthat are prevalent, and important here.\n\n179\n00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,120\nSo what I like to do normally, is I like\nto just have a sense of being able to\n\n180\n00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,130\nunderstand that each of the blocks, right?\n\n181\n00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,140\nEach of the octets are in\nthe dot decimal notation.\n\n182\n00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,430\nThe numbers followed by\nthe period represent a block and\n\n183\n00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,640\nDon is kinda writing that out for us.\n\n184\n00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,605\nAlthough, I think we missed a decimal\npoint there somewhere, right?\n\n185\n00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:46,930\n[LAUGH] As we go through,\nokay, there we go.\n\n186\n00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,760\n>> Let me write it this way, cuz this is\nas a human, that's what we see, right?\n\n187\n00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,320\nSo just like that.\n\n188\n00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,160\n>> Or what we call dot-decimal notation\nfor humans, and then machine, right.\n\n189\n00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,850\nWhich is gonna be binary, is what we\nsee on the bottom, absolutely correct.\n\n190\n00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,760\nAnd so the first comparison point is\nthat these two streams of numbers\n\n191\n00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,930\nactually represent the same information.\n\n192\n00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:08,480\nBut just really it's a question\nof who the audience is and\n\n193\n00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,730\nwhat the filter is that we use to see it.\n\n194\n00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,930\nAnd so what we can see and\nwhat we can understand is that above,\n\n195\n00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,660\nright, we have what's called\ndot decimal notation or\n\n196\n00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,280\ndecimal dot notation but really\nreferred to as dot decimal notation.\n\n197\n00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,440\n>> We'll put it your way.\n\n198\n00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,310\n>> And then, [LAUGH] it's not a problem.\n\n199\n00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,690\n>> I will defer to you.\n\n200\n00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,280\n>> Okay, and\nthen below we have a binary notation.\n\n201\n00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,240\nWhat is machine readable,\nor machine friendly.\n\n202\n00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,900\nAnd so the ideas we can translate back and\nforth between the two.\n\n203\n00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,905\nThis is really gonna be a central tenant\nof how we deal with IP addressing.\n\n204\n00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:41,990\nSo 192.168.0.1 each of them\nrepresent a block of numbers.\n\n205\n00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,696\nThose block of numbers\nare called [COUGH] octets,\n\n206\n00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:48,250\nbecause they are each made up of 8 bits.\n\n207\n00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,596\nAnd so what maybe we can do is just\nnumber what the four octets are, so\n\n208\n00:09:52,596 --> 00:09:55,050\nwe have a point of reference for them.\n\n209\n00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,838\nSo from left to right, we think of the\nfirst octet, second octet, third octet,\n\n210\n00:09:58,838 --> 00:09:59,570\nfourth octet.\n\n211\n00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,670\n192, would be octet number 1.\n\n212\n00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,660\n168 would be octet number 2.\n\n213\n00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,860\nZero would be octet number three in our\nworld here and one would be number four.\n\n214\n00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,440\nAnd what you're seeing is Don is breaking\nthat up, as soon as we get the zero\n\n215\n00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,600\ncounter on the decimal block there,\nto help us, and he's putting the period in\n\n216\n00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,560\nafter every eight-character, eight-count\nblock, to help us understand that.\n\n217\n00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,324\nAnd the reason for that is that when we\nsee this as humans, we see 192 period, and\n\n218\n00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:30,150\nwe read that the machine sees\na continuous stream of one and zeros.\n\n219\n00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,930\nWhen it translates, on the dot, in the dot\ndecimal notation is how the machine\n\n220\n00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:39,410\nknows eight bit stop eight bit stop\neight bits, no stop, that must be\n\n221\n00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,160\nthe last part of the block so we know now\nit's 32 bits based on the architecture.\n\n222\n00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,157\nSo we translate back and forth in our\nmind the computer translates back and\n\n223\n00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:54,073\nforth but does so in effect automatically\nusing the same concept looking\n\n224\n00:10:54,073 --> 00:10:56,990\nat this eight block bit, eight bit block.\n\n225\n00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,590\n[LAUGH] Eight bit block, and\nthen stopping, and then starting again.\n\n226\n00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,860\nSo, the periods become very important as\nplace holders, but also as start and stop.\n\n227\n00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,660\nIt's much like we will see,\nas we talk about a modem later on.\n\n228\n00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,870\nWe talk about eight bits and\nand stop in parity, right?\n\n229\n00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,260\nIt's not quite the same but\n\n230\n00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,920\nthe general thought process is the same,\njust as a point of reference.\n\n231\n00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,600\nSo we have 32 bits there,\nand so now that we have our\n\n232\n00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,280\nbits we understand IPv4 addressing\nequally in the 32 bit address block.\n\n233\n00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,970\nSo now let's delve in\nmaybe a little bit and\n\n234\n00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,240\ntake a look at one octet is from\na bit structure perspective, right.\n\n235\n00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,770\nLay out what the bits are and\nhelp everybody understand.\n\n236\n00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,650\nNow the thing to remember, as Don may just\nbe setting up to make some notes here.\n\n237\n00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:37,570\nIs that each of these octets is gonna\nhave the same sequencing of bits.\n\n238\n00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:42,520\nAs we set up what a bit structure looks\nlike for you we're gonna see that we have\n\n239\n00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,000\nfrom basically 128 starting at the top or\n\n240\n00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,690\nat the left hand side as we look at\nthe bits all the way over, Brad and\n\n241\n00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,680\nDon I think is gonna lay this out for\nus quickly.\n\n242\n00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,525\nBut we're gonna go from 128, 64 32, 16, 8,\n4, 2, and 1 as he's just laying this out.\n\n243\n00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:02,033\nWhat we're gonna see is the same pattern\nof the bits repeating in each of\n\n244\n00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:04,290\nthe blocks and each of the octets for us.\n\n245\n00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,590\nSo we wanna understand that\nonce we master this one time,\n\n246\n00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,900\nwe're gonna have the tools necessary to\nrepeat this process of understanding how\n\n247\n00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,310\nan octet is structured across any address,\nregardless of what it is.\n\n248\n00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:18,130\nWe're not really gonna have to\nworry about it after we get done.\n\n249\n00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,950\nSo, when we think about the structure of\nan octet, we think about the sequencing of\n\n250\n00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,840\nbits that allows us to understand how\nthis particular bit is structured.\n\n251\n00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,700\nWhat the value of that bit is, right.\n\n252\n00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,415\nSo is it a 128, if it's 128 and\nwe turn it on by signifying a one,\n\n253\n00:12:33,415 --> 00:12:38,175\nwe're gonna use that value to help\nus structure what the value of that\n\n254\n00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,915\noctet is 192, 168, whatever it may be.\n\n255\n00:12:40,915 --> 00:12:43,071\n>> So let's just do two quick examples,\nright.\n\n256\n00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:43,592\n>> Sure.\n\n257\n00:12:43,592 --> 00:12:45,884\n>> So,\nI wrote up here if I had eight zeros,\n\n258\n00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:49,695\nthat those eight zeros would\nequal the decimal number zero.\n\n259\n00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:52,595\nBut if I had eight ones,\nthat would equal the decimal number 255.\n\n260\n00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:54,270\nNow how did I get that, right?\n\n261\n00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,810\nWell, like Adam said, each bit is\na placeholder for a certain value and\n\n262\n00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,770\nwhen you have a one, that just means\nthat that value you have it and\n\n263\n00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,480\nit counts and if you have a zero,\nthe value doesn't count.\n\n264\n00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,161\nSo we take something like 255\nwhere its 11111111 or something,\n\n265\n00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:11,729\nI think that was eight ones or something.\n\n266\n00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:15,650\nIt's eight ones, we're saying we\nget every placeholder value and\n\n267\n00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,006\nto write that out in the high school\nmathematics that I am capable of doing.\n\n268\n00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:28,495\nThen we would write that as\n128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1 which,\n\n269\n00:13:28,495 --> 00:13:36,249\nif we work all that out, adds up to\n255 that's how I got to that, right.\n\n270\n00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:39,950\nNow that's a really easy example,\nI like the easy examples.\n\n271\n00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,581\nIf we took a harder number, right.\n\n272\n00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:48,777\nSo if we took a binary number,\nmaybe Adam fed me a number and\n\n273\n00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:52,706\nsaid that Don I need to know that one.\n\n274\n00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,185\n>> Let's do do 240.\n\n275\n00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:56,396\n[CROSSTALK] We can go that direction.\n\n276\n00:13:56,396 --> 00:13:57,560\n>> You wanna do that one?\n\n277\n00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,787\n>> So if we take 240.\n\n278\n00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:01,250\n>> Oh,\nI'm sorry you wanted a binary number.\n\n279\n00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,445\n>> [CROSSTALK] You know what?\n\n280\n00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:03,489\nLet's go both ways.\n\n281\n00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:04,128\nLet's go both.\n\n282\n00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:05,810\nSo let's start with yours.\n\n283\n00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,145\nSo let's say somebody gave\nme a number like 240.\n\n284\n00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:08,772\nAll right,\n\n285\n00:14:08,772 --> 00:14:12,611\nI need to figure out what bits we need\nthat would add up to represent that.\n\n286\n00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:15,935\nAnd so I can take that same\nlittle chart that I jotted in.\n\n287\n00:14:15,935 --> 00:14:18,725\nAnd this is something that it's\na good idea to memorize it.\n\n288\n00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:22,172\nIf you ever have to do something like this\non the exam, you have a dry erase board or\n\n289\n00:14:22,172 --> 00:14:24,320\nsheets of paper depending\non the center you go to.\n\n290\n00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,536\nAnd you can write this down and\nkinda use it to do quick conversions or\n\n291\n00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:30,240\nbetter yet, you can memorize it and\ndo it in your head.\n\n292\n00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,300\nBut basically, you go down the list,\nand you do some simple mathematics to\n\n293\n00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,890\ndetermine what bits you need and\nwhat bits you don't need.\n\n294\n00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,964\nSo the way I usually do it, and\nI typically do this in my head, so\n\n295\n00:14:38,964 --> 00:14:41,400\ndoing it out loud's\na little awkward sometimes,\n\n296\n00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,400\nbut 240 is a bigger number than 128,\nso I know I'm gonna need 128, right?\n\n297\n00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,410\nSo I'm gonna take 240,\nand I can say minus 128.\n\n298\n00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,840\nAnd here's where my critical\nmath skills start to suffer.\n\n299\n00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,378\nThat's gonna leave, what, 112?\n\n300\n00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:57,075\n>> Yes.\n\n301\n00:14:57,075 --> 00:14:58,073\n>> Yes, all right.\n\n302\n00:14:58,073 --> 00:14:58,974\nFact check me on this in case I'm wrong.\n\n303\n00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:00,321\n>> Okay, no problem.\n\n304\n00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:01,810\n>> 112 is bigger than 64.\n\n305\n00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:09,141\nSo I'm gonna need 64, so I'll take that\naway, and that's gonna leave 50, 68?\n\n306\n00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:09,826\n>> No, not 68.\n\n307\n00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,405\n>> 58.\n\n308\n00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:14,850\n[LAUGH]\nThis is, okay good.\n\n309\n00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,920\nSo then 58 is bigger than 32 so we'll,\noh, that should be an equals sign.\n\n310\n00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,760\nSo we'll take away 32 and\nthat is gonna equal 26.\n\n311\n00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,438\n26 is bigger than 16,\nnow the math starting to get easy.\n\n312\n00:15:30,438 --> 00:15:31,970\nSo we'll take away 16.\n\n313\n00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,060\nThat's gonna equal 10.\n>> You don't need me anymore, now.\n\n314\n00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,215\n>> 10 is bigger than 8 so,\nwe'll take away 8.\n\n315\n00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:41,210\nAnd that leaves 2,\nnow 2 is smaller than 4.\n\n316\n00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:47,030\nSo I don't need that, but, I think I\ndid bad in math somewhere, didn't I?\n\n317\n00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,520\n>> You may have.\n\n318\n00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,800\n>> 240 should be an even one.\n\n319\n00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,709\nIt should be.\n\n320\n00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,884\n>> It should be so just while Don\nself-corrects let me just point\n\n321\n00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:58,606\none thing out here real quick while he\ngoes and he kind of auto corrects and\n\n322\n00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:00,430\nspellchecks the math here.\n\n323\n00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:03,268\nSo the one thing just to be aware of as\nwe're just working through this to make it\n\n324\n00:16:03,268 --> 00:16:04,000\nclear in your mind.\n\n325\n00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,500\nRight?\n\n326\n00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,460\nA 1 signifies On for the Bit.\n\n327\n00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,705\nA 0 signifies Off.\n\n328\n00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:10,340\nRight?\nSo in effect we're selecting or\n\n329\n00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,455\nwe're not as Don's kinda just\nworking through the logic here.\n\n330\n00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:17,525\nAnd so what we need to make sure we\nunderstand is as Don puts a 1 next to 128,\n\n331\n00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:22,575\nor 64, and ultimately works he way down\nand figures out what bits we need.\n\n332\n00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:26,802\nWe're representing the fact that we\nwant that bit to be part of the value.\n\n333\n00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:31,712\nFor this Octet the overall calculated\nvalue by signifying the 1.\n\n334\n00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:34,882\nWhereas by signifying the zero we're\neffectively turning off that bit,\n\n335\n00:16:34,882 --> 00:16:37,352\nnot rendering it as part of\nthe overall calculated value.\n\n336\n00:16:37,352 --> 00:16:40,060\nJust so that we're kind of\nclear on what we're doing.\n\n337\n00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,570\nBecause it's a great way to look\nat this visually to lay it out.\n\n338\n00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,880\nBut you have to then have the end game,\n\n339\n00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,250\nyou have to understand what we're shooting\nfor to understand how we calculate that.\n\n340\n00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:47,895\nSo did we-\n>> Yeah.\n\n341\n00:16:47,895 --> 00:16:48,820\n>> Self-correct there?\n\n342\n00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,270\nOkay, good.\n>> Yeah, I had bad math right here so\n\n343\n00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,660\nI just fixed my math.\n\n344\n00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,010\nIt's sad that simple subtraction\nsometimes is [CROSSTALK]\n\n345\n00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,020\n>> So anyhow, we end up with 48 there.\n\n346\n00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,760\n>> Okay.\n>> And so minus 32 leaves 16.\n\n347\n00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,090\nWe take away 16, that equals 0.\n\n348\n00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:05,490\nNow, 0 is smaller than 8, smaller than 4,\nsmaller than 2, smaller than 1.\n\n349\n00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,840\nso I don't need any of those numbers.\n\n350\n00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,470\nAnd as a result, I zero all those out.\n\n351\n00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,990\nSo, the final end game, like Adam was\nsaying, is that 240 written in binary.\n\n352\n00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,450\nWould be these numbers written in order.\n\n353\n00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,040\nSo it would be 11110000.\n\n354\n00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:19,980\nRight?\n>> Perfect.\n\n355\n00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,890\n>> It doesn't make a lot of sense\nto us because when we grow up\n\n356\n00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,410\nwe are taught base 10 mathematics, right?\n\n357\n00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,970\nSo from kindergarten on up you\nlearn base 10 mathematics.\n\n358\n00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,820\nYou have digits of zero through nine.\n\n359\n00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,790\nWhen you get past nine\nyou go to two digits and\n\n360\n00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,330\neach place holder has\na value of zero through nine.\n\n361\n00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:42,040\nThis is phase two mathematics, every place\nholder has a value of either zero or one.\n\n362\n00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,680\nThere's only two values and that's it so\n\n363\n00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,670\nthe numbers are just\nrepresented differently.\n\n364\n00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,940\nAt the end of the day they\nare the same numbers.\n\n365\n00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,515\nIt's just a different way\nof representing them.\n\n366\n00:17:49,515 --> 00:17:50,240\nRight?\nSo,\n\n367\n00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,648\nthat's an example of going\nfrom a decimal number,\n\n368\n00:17:52,648 --> 00:17:56,390\na base 10 number to a binary number.\n\n369\n00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,080\nThe reverse is really the same process,\n\n370\n00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,240\nexcept you're doing addition\ninstead of subtraction.\n\n371\n00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,260\nIf we.\n\n372\n00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:08,800\n>> So let's do 10100011 and\nthen that's two for six, one, one.\n\n373\n00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:12,400\n>> All right, so\nwe'll take a number like that and\n\n374\n00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,740\nI'm basically gonna just again run through\nthe same process like I did a minute ago,\n\n375\n00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,100\nexcept we're kind of\ndoing addition this time.\n\n376\n00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,430\nAnd so I'm gonna go through and\n\n377\n00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,630\ntag all the placeholders that\nAdam told me I needed, right?\n\n378\n00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,950\nSo it's 10100011, all right.\n\n379\n00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,680\nAnd now we just have a simple addition.\n\n380\n00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,440\nAnd I say simple.\n\n381\n00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,135\nI know I'll screw it up.\n\n382\n00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,910\n>> [LAUGH] I was gonna say simple is\nrelative in the mind of the beholder.\n\n383\n00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,680\nSo it's 128+32+2+1.\n\n384\n00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,300\nRight?\nSo that's 163.\n\n385\n00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,560\n>> Should be 163.\n\n386\n00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,060\n>> All right.\n\n387\n00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,530\nSo if we work all that out, we get 163.\n\n388\n00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:56,540\nSo the conversion process, going back and\nforth like this, doing it in your head,\n\n389\n00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,300\nit can be a little\nchallenging the first time.\n\n390\n00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,990\nThe more you work with it,\nthe better you get at it.\n\n391\n00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,490\nSo you just practice.\n\n392\n00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,740\nIf you've got your Windows calculator,\nyou can cheat.\n\n393\n00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,160\nThis is how I checked myself a minute ago.\n\n394\n00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,850\nBecause in the Windows calculator,\nif you go to view and\n\n395\n00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,150\nyou switch to the programmer mode,\nyou can actually go in here and\n\n396\n00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:15,970\npunch in a decimal number like 163.\n\n397\n00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:20,170\nAnd than you can just click binary to flip\nover and it'll give you the binary answer.\n\n398\n00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,650\nRight?\nSo you can use that to kinda verify.\n\n399\n00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,280\nBut, can you use that on the exam?\n\n400\n00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:25,900\nNo.\n\n401\n00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,480\nSo, you need to be able\nto do this by hand.\n\n402\n00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,510\nAnd I'll be honest with you guys,\neven if you have the calculator.\n\n403\n00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,420\nDoing it by hand ensures that you\nactually know what's going on.\n\n404\n00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,640\nIt's gives you that better vision.\n\n405\n00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,330\nIt makes you understand it.\n\n406\n00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,360\nSo, while in real life land sure your\ngonna use a Subnet calculator, right.\n\n407\n00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,400\nThere's plenty of them on the internet.\n\n408\n00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,165\nThey're great.\nI use them all the time.\n\n409\n00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:46,815\nBut learning to do it by hand,\nwell make sure that you\n\n410\n00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,845\nactually understand what's\ngoing on in the background.\n\n411\n00:19:49,845 --> 00:19:50,655\n>> It will.\nAnd so\n\n412\n00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,420\nwe mentioned a couple of magic numbers.\n\n413\n00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,285\nRight?\nSo, it would\n\n414\n00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:56,905\nbe 32 bits being a touch point to\nunderstanding how we get 32 bits.\n\n415\n00:19:56,905 --> 00:20:00,145\nAlso, understanding that the total value\nif we were to turn all bits on as Don\n\n416\n00:20:00,145 --> 00:20:03,585\nindicated, is 255 in\nthe Octet per Octet right?\n\n417\n00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:05,830\nAnd we have four of them obviously.\n\n418\n00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,763\nIs also important, so let's summarize\njust a couple of things we've done so\n\n419\n00:20:09,763 --> 00:20:11,430\nfar in this area.\n\n420\n00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,500\nBring all this particular knowledge\ntogether and then let's move on and\n\n421\n00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,720\ntalk about study of classes and\n\n422\n00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,650\nmaybe the study of Subnets, we'll\nstart to bring that stuff in as well.\n\n423\n00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,910\nSo a couple of key summary\ntake away points here.\n\n424\n00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,930\nNumber one when we look at the Octet,\nright.\n\n425\n00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,850\nWe're looking at a bit count\nof anything from 0 to 255,\n\n426\n00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,928\nas Don has pointed out there.\n\n427\n00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:34,530\nBut we wanna understand that\nwe're never gonna start on a 0 or\n\n428\n00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,650\nend on a 255 depending on where we are.\n\n429\n00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,390\nWhich Octet we are talking about.\n\n430\n00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:41,220\nAnd so we have what are called\nsome simple rules generically.\n\n431\n00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,570\nThese ideas of how we put\nthis address in together\n\n432\n00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,410\nthat really allows us to create\nfunctional, routable IP addresses\n\n433\n00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:53,040\nthat move information from place to place\nversus IP addresses that are not usable.\n\n434\n00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,090\nNow there are some other outlier cases\nthat we are not gonna address here.\n\n435\n00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,640\nSpecifically, we're not gonna talk\nabout any of this custom subnetting,\n\n436\n00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,390\nborrowing of bits, classless internet\ndumb in routing, super netting.\n\n437\n00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,610\nThere's many ways to\nrefer to these things.\n\n438\n00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,280\nThese are very important topics.\n\n439\n00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,960\nThey are things you wanna be aware of as\na networking and a security professional.\n\n440\n00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,890\nThey are not gonna be addressed,\nper se, right now.\n\n441\n00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,110\nThere are other follow up areas\nwe can certainly look at.\n\n442\n00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,050\nWe coukd take to you,\nkinda focus you in on.\n\n443\n00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,190\nSo for instance maybe a Network +\nclass conversation, maybe ICND 1 or\n\n444\n00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,720\nICND 2 on the Cisco side, certainly.\n\n445\n00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,330\nWould address those things, and theres\ndefinitely more to the puzzle so to speak.\n\n446\n00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,970\nBut let's talk about kind of\nthe standard ones here, right.\n\n447\n00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:39,180\nSo each Octet [INAUDIBLE] will be anywhere\nbetween and 0 and 255 as an overall value.\n\n448\n00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,075\nWe're never gonna wanna start on a zero,\n\n449\n00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:43,785\nbecause that implies no IP\naddress that is routable.\n\n450\n00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:47,185\nAnd we never wanna start\non a 255 because if we do,\n\n451\n00:21:47,185 --> 00:21:49,855\ndepending on which Octet will\nidentify where we can start or\n\n452\n00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:53,810\nwhere we can't, that indicates\npotentially that we're broadcasting.\n\n453\n00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,390\nRight?\n\n454\n00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,370\nAnd if we end on a zero, it indicates\nthat we have no routable IP address.\n\n455\n00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,160\nAnd if we end on a 255, it may indicate\nthat we are broadcasting depending on\n\n456\n00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,940\nthe example and where we're putting this.\n\n457\n00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,080\nSo let's take that rule and let's put\nit into the matrix in which octets\n\n458\n00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,840\nare going to Allow or\nNot Allow this to occur.\n\n459\n00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,210\nAnd so Don's just typing out some\ninformation there for us really quickly.\n\n460\n00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,580\nLet me just kinda summarize\nthis thought process.\n\n461\n00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,130\nIf we have four octets, right- one,\ntwo, three, and four laid out.\n\n462\n00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,310\nThe simple rule to apply here\nwould be that octet number one,\n\n463\n00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,800\nwhich is our first IP address\npart in the dot-decimal notation,\n\n464\n00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,240\nshould never start on a zero,\nnever end on a 255.\n\n465\n00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,570\nOr, in other words, It should always\nbe a value of 1 to 254, right?\n\n466\n00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,360\nBecause if we do 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.\n\n467\n00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,150\nWe're always gonna start out\nwith a routable IP address.\n\n468\n00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,745\nOctets number 2 and 3, and\nwe'll kinda group those together right?\n\n469\n00:22:46,745 --> 00:22:52,075\nThey can always have a value\nof anything from 0 to 255.\n\n470\n00:22:52,075 --> 00:22:56,025\nBecause we can actually do\nanything from 0 to 255.\n\n471\n00:22:56,025 --> 00:22:57,895\nWill kill, what?\n\n472\n00:22:57,895 --> 00:22:59,755\nWill be anything from 0 to 255.\n\n473\n00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:00,465\nWill kill [LAUGH].\n\n474\n00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:03,620\n>> Message are telling me to kill Adam!\n\n475\n00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,425\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, so Octet number four, right?\n\n476\n00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:07,777\nDon's gonna stay on his\nside of the podium.\n\n477\n00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:08,952\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna make sure to put that\n\n478\n00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:09,995\nforce field up.\n\n479\n00:23:09,995 --> 00:23:11,340\nOctet number four.\n\n480\n00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,030\nIs always going to be just\nlike octet number one.\n\n481\n00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,270\nIt is always gonna have a range\nof anything from 1 to 254,\n\n482\n00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:23,710\nbecause again, if we were to start\non a 0 on octet 4, end on a 255,\n\n483\n00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,400\nthere are cases where that's acceptable.\n\n484\n00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,960\nWe'll talk about those, again, in that\nother discussion we're not having here.\n\n485\n00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,010\n>> Yeah.\n>> But for our purposes here,\n\n486\n00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,010\nlet's assume that those addresses would\nnot be addresses that we would be using.\n\n487\n00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,430\nTo send information out over the wire.\n\n488\n00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,330\nAs you'll be able to access a routable IP\naddress so we can move information across.\n\n489\n00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,530\n>> Yeah.\n>> Let's put it that way, right?\n\n490\n00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,334\n>> Let me just tack onto that.\n\n491\n00:23:45,334 --> 00:23:48,490\nSo, and you guys might be thinking this if\nyou've worked with these addresses a lot.\n\n492\n00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,560\nThere are some scenarios where\nyou can end with zero or 255.\n\n493\n00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,720\nIt's not important because\nthey're very rare.\n\n494\n00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,829\nBut if you wanna learn about some of\nthose, as an IT ProTV subscriber you have\n\n495\n00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:02,250\naccess to all of our courses, so\njump over to the network plus.\n\n496\n00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,970\nActually, the Cisco one does a better job.\n\n497\n00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,053\n>> Yeah.\n>> If you jump over to the CCENT and\n\n498\n00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:11,130\nCCNA shows, we go super in depth on this,\nand we show those exception areas.\n\n499\n00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:13,410\nThose are networking certifications.\n\n500\n00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,480\nThey really do the deep dive.\n\n501\n00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,340\nCISSP, networking is one of our domains,\nbut there's so much more.\n\n502\n00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,550\nSo they don't do that deep dive.\n\n503\n00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,510\nSo we don't wanna get into the crazy\nexceptions and quirks right now.\n\n504\n00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,608\nSo just be aware that there are some.\n\n505\n00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:26,419\n>> Mainstream IP.\n\n506\n00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:26,980\n>> Yeah.\n\n507\n00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,940\n>> All right, so we've got some simple\nrules laid out and the importance of these\n\n508\n00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,480\nrules is that they give us the focus,\naround how to build these IP addresses.\n\n509\n00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,180\nSo, for instance, the very first\nIP address then that we could use,\n\n510\n00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,245\nright, in this system would be 1.001,\nright?\n\n511\n00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:46,236\n1.001 would be the first routable IP\naddress in our IP subnetting that we're\n\n512\n00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:51,153\ndoing here, that would effectively allow\nus to be able to send information out on\n\n513\n00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:52,912\nthe wire using these rules.\n\n514\n00:24:52,912 --> 00:24:57,308\n1.001, and then the last usable IP\n\n515\n00:24:57,308 --> 00:25:02,351\naddress in our range if\nwe follow these rules,\n\n516\n00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:09,351\nwould be [COUGH] excuse me,\n254.255.255.254.\n\n517\n00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:13,690\nAnd so if we did 1.0.0.1, 1.0.0.2, 0.0.3,\n\n518\n00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:18,645\nif you follow the logic all the way up\nright, just iterate through all that we\n\n519\n00:25:18,645 --> 00:25:23,236\nget approximately give or\ntake about 4 billion usable IP addresses.\n\n520\n00:25:23,236 --> 00:25:25,925\nGive or take a couple of million, what's\na couple of million between friends?\n\n521\n00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:30,440\n[LAUGH] So, we have that whole process,\nand that's what we would see.\n\n522\n00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,700\nNow, there are some exceptions within\nthat, as well and, as we start talking\n\n523\n00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:40,380\nabout IP classes, we're gonna identify one\nrange, what we call the loopback adaptor,\n\n524\n00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:46,200\nrange or we can look back adaptor, but 127\nis that block that we're not gonna use for\n\n525\n00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,140\nroutable IP addresses\noutside of our network.\n\n526\n00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,680\nWe're basically just going to use\nit locally on a single machine.\n\n527\n00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:56,070\nBut other than that, we're going to see\nthat all those addresses are gonna be used\n\n528\n00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,030\nin one form or another.\n\n529\n00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,960\nThere may be multicast based addresses\ncause in the 240 block in that\n\n530\n00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,430\narea we have IPv6 expansion,\nthings of that nature going on.\n\n531\n00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,860\nBut at the end of the day this\nis gonna roughly frame out for\n\n532\n00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,700\nus how we're gonna move\ninformation around.\n\n533\n00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,280\nRight, so\nwe want to talk about the classes or\n\n534\n00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,400\ndo we want to lay out subnets and\ndo the other classes along the way?\n\n535\n00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,540\n>> Let's do this because we're running\ndown a little bit on time in the segment\n\n536\n00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,280\nand the classes can take\na little bit of time.\n\n537\n00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,160\nLet's just talk a little bit\nabout what the subnets are first,\n\n538\n00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,440\nand then we'll jump into\nthe classes after the break.\n\n539\n00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,540\nOne of the things that we need to know\nis that, so we got addresses, great.\n\n540\n00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,404\nRight, with an address,\n\n541\n00:26:31,404 --> 00:26:36,180\nyou need to be able to identify whether\nsomebody is on the same network as you.\n\n542\n00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,650\nIs somebody on the same network as you or\n\n543\n00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:42,072\nare you going to need to go through\na router, to get to that other person.\n\n544\n00:26:42,072 --> 00:26:44,250\nAll right, and,\nthe way we can determine that,\n\n545\n00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,530\nthe way we determine whether we need to\nuse a router, or a default gateway, or\n\n546\n00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,420\na gateway of last resort, or\nwhatever term we wanna use.\n\n547\n00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:56,385\nAdam, what's the common term on\nthe exam for a default gateway?\n\n548\n00:26:56,385 --> 00:26:57,265\n>> It's default gateway.\n\n549\n00:26:57,265 --> 00:27:02,645\n>> So different vendor use, Cisco is all\nabout gateway of last resort and all that.\n\n550\n00:27:02,645 --> 00:27:04,165\n>> We're not as dramatic.\n\n551\n00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,465\n>> So, it does sound dramatic doesn't it?\n\n552\n00:27:05,465 --> 00:27:07,646\nI gotta get out, my last resort.\n\n553\n00:27:07,646 --> 00:27:12,070\n[LAUGH] Anyhow, so the way we\ndetermine that is by using a subnet.\n\n554\n00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,990\nAll right, a subnet is simply a note\n\n555\n00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,840\nthat lets us know who's on our network and\nwho isn't.\n\n556\n00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,820\nAn IP address is kind of\nlike a street address.\n\n557\n00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:28,280\nRight, the building we're in right now is\n6933, Northwest Fourth Boulevard, right?\n\n558\n00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,650\nNorthwest Fourth Boulevard,\nthat's our street, and 6933,\n\n559\n00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,690\nthat's our building number.\n\n560\n00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:37,248\nNow, there's other buildings on this\nstreet, so there might be 6931, 6929,\n\n561\n00:27:37,248 --> 00:27:40,880\nwhatever, that are on the same\nNorthwest Fourth Boulevard, right?\n\n562\n00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,750\nBut there is no other 6933.\n\n563\n00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,720\nWe're the only 6933 on\nNorthwest Fourth Boulevard.\n\n564\n00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,830\nBut, if you go over to\nNorthwest Fifth Boulevard,\n\n565\n00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,010\nthere's probably another 6933 out.\n\n566\n00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:53,460\nI don't really know, I haven't looked,\nbut there probably is, right.\n\n567\n00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,620\nYou can have the same building\nnumber on a different street.\n\n568\n00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,080\nThat's how IP addresses are.\n\n569\n00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,080\nWe break them up into a host ID and\na network ID.\n\n570\n00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,710\nOn a particular network, you will only\nhave one host with a particular host ID.\n\n571\n00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:11,250\nBut there may be other networks out\nthere with that same host address.\n\n572\n00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,625\nSo if I take just a really common one,\nI wanna stay high level too,\n\n573\n00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,610\nbecause the classes are really\ngonna help explain this some too.\n\n574\n00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:24,390\nBut if I take an address like 192.168.0.1,\nAdam mentioned earlier that was a Class C.\n\n575\n00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:30,361\nWell, what that means is that,\nour network ID is part of this address,\n\n576\n00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:34,749\nand then our host ID is\nanother part of this address.\n\n577\n00:28:34,749 --> 00:28:39,471\nIf I just draw a line right here,\nright and I basically come in and\n\n578\n00:28:39,471 --> 00:28:43,580\nI say that the first part here,\nthat's my network ID and\n\n579\n00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:46,291\nthen I've got my Host ID after that,\n\n580\n00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:51,211\nwhich I guess didn't really\nrepresent itself very well, did it?\n\n581\n00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:56,853\nBut your network is\n192.168.0 your host is .1.\n\n582\n00:28:56,853 --> 00:29:00,244\nIf I'm talking to 192.168.0.10 or\n\n583\n00:29:00,244 --> 00:29:05,900\n192.168.0.200, right,\nthey start with 192.168.0.\n\n584\n00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:11,050\nThey start with the same network ID,\nI do, they are on the same network.\n\n585\n00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,920\nI don't need to go\nthrough a router to them.\n\n586\n00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,020\nI can just talk directly to them.\n\n587\n00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,570\nBut if their network was different,\nif they were for\n\n588\n00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:23,020\nexample, if one host\nwas 192.168.1.58 okay?\n\n589\n00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:31,250\nWell, the network IDs are different.\n\n590\n00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,980\nSince the network IDs are different,\n\n591\n00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,210\nI'm going to have to go through\na router to get to that other host.\n\n592\n00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,300\nAll right,\nthat's what a subnet mask does for us.\n\n593\n00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,480\nThe subnet identifies who's on\nour network and who isn't and\n\n594\n00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,920\nwhen we need to go to that route.\n\n595\n00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,110\nAll right, so I just drew a line here,\nI arbitrarily drew this line.\n\n596\n00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,810\nI decided that that was the place for\nthat line.\n\n597\n00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:54,180\nOkay, how did I know\nwhere to put that line?\n\n598\n00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,760\nWell, that's what we're gonna\ntalk about after the break.\n\n599\n00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,570\n>> Okay, very good.\n\n600\n00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:00,760\nAll right, so we're gonna continue\nthis conversation, obviously,\n\n601\n00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,830\nmake sure we're focusing in on the subnet\nmask, we'll continue that part.\n\n602\n00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:08,380\nWe'll talk about the classes, how they\ncome together, really help us understand\n\n603\n00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,270\nhow to signify which kind of\nan IP address we're dealing with,\n\n604\n00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,430\nis it a class A, B, C,\nD, or potentially E.\n\n605\n00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,340\nSo we'll talk about that as well as\nwe come back and go through this.\n\n606\n00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,290\nWe'll wrap all that up and\nbring it back together,\n\n607\n00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,940\nkind of summarize it at a high level.\n\n608\n00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:24,744\nWe also want to make sure as part of\nthis conversation that we're comfortable\n\n609\n00:30:24,744 --> 00:30:29,016\nwith the concept, the level of detail that\nwe're going into at the conceptual level,\n\n610\n00:30:29,016 --> 00:30:32,080\nwhich is that we're doing this\nvery high level as you can see.\n\n611\n00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,450\nAnd so, as Don mentioned,\nwe're not doing the deep dive.\n\n612\n00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,600\nThe deep dive is really about\nunderstanding networking at the practical\n\n613\n00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,610\nlevel where you do this\nhands on every day.\n\n614\n00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,740\nAnd I wanna make sure you're comfortable\nin your mind as you're going through this.\n\n615\n00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,405\nWe're not implying you shouldn't get\nto that level of knowledge, [LAUGH].\n\n616\n00:30:45,405 --> 00:30:49,505\nWhat we're implying is that as a security\nprofessional that looks at CISSP\n\n617\n00:30:49,505 --> 00:30:52,095\ncredential, we wanna make sure\nyou have the right mind set\n\n618\n00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:56,950\nabout the kind of knowledge you bring to\nthe exam at the level it's appropriate for\n\n619\n00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,890\nmost of you that will do this\nif you're managing networks and\n\n620\n00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,470\nare in IT,\ndoing this kind of stuff on a daily basis.\n\n621\n00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,860\nAt some level will touch this.\n\n622\n00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,610\nYou may have, again as Don indicated\nthe ability to use the subnet calculator.\n\n623\n00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,090\nYou may not do this in your head.\n\n624\n00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,670\nMost of us don't walk around doing this\nkind of stuff unless we teach on a regular\n\n625\n00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:17,170\nbasis, the way we're doing it here for\nyou and breaking it down every day.\n\n626\n00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:20,990\nThat's not to say it's not important, it\njust means that in reality of our everyday\n\n627\n00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:25,450\nworld as we manage networks, once we\nset up the network, set up our subnets,\n\n628\n00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,630\nget everything moving, we don't tend to\ncircle back to this very often, right?\n\n629\n00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:31,150\nSo, once it's set up,\nit's almost like set up and forget.\n\n630\n00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,440\nWe don't tend to do it.\n\n631\n00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,290\nSo we want to remind you of how to do it,\nwe want to remind you of the context, and\n\n632\n00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,740\nmake sure you're comfortable with it.\n\n633\n00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,667\nI would encourage you to think\nabout practicing a little bit.\n\n634\n00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:42,950\nRight, maybe going through,\ngrabbing a couple of IP addresses,\n\n635\n00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:46,882\nbreaking them down, putting them back\ntogether the way we did, a go through and\n\n636\n00:31:46,882 --> 00:31:50,579\nfigure out subnets, we'll walk through and\ndo that in our next episode and\n\n637\n00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:53,982\nmake sure you're comfortable at\nthat level It's the right focus for\n\n638\n00:31:53,982 --> 00:31:56,000\nyou as you prepare to answer questions.\n\n639\n00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,450\nWhen you want that next level down as Don\nindicated, you'll come back and see us for\n\n640\n00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,754\nsome of the other conversations we have\nin some of those other programs that'll\n\n641\n00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,650\ntake you to that next level.\n\n642\n00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,380\nAll right?\n\n643\n00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,460\n>> All right.\nAdam, why don't we stop here\n\n644\n00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,100\nand take a break?\n\n645\n00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,730\nWhen we get back, we're gonna talk\na little bit more about addressing stuff.\n\n646\n00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,610\nWe don't wanna drive you\nguys too crazy with it.\n\n647\n00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:16,110\nWe'll continue on with our networking\nconversation from there stay tuned.\n\n648\n00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,170\nWe'll be back in a few.\n\n649\n00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,770\n>> See you soon.\n\n650\n00:32:21,385 --> 00:32:26,812\n[SOUND] All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n651\n00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:29,451\nSo we're gonna jump back\ninto IP addresses and\n\n652\n00:32:29,451 --> 00:32:31,690\nwe're gonna take a look at how we tell.\n\n653\n00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,360\nYou know, when I drew that line a moment,\nwhere did that go?\n\n654\n00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,660\nThere.\n\n655\n00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,780\nSo, when I drew that line a moment ago,\n\n656\n00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,940\nin between some IP addresses to\ndesignate where the network ended and\n\n657\n00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,470\nthe host started,\nhow did I know where to draw that line?\n\n658\n00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:49,320\nAnd I used my Hollywood magic skills\nto build up the anticipation, right?\n\n659\n00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,770\nOur viewers, like you guys, are on\nthe edge of their seats right now just\n\n660\n00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,100\nwondering, how did Don know\nwhere to draw that line?\n\n661\n00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,070\nAnd the answer is, at least in\nthe short-term that I it didn't match.\n\n662\n00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,310\n>> A ruler.\n\n663\n00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,190\nJust kidding.\n\n664\n00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,660\n>> I just drew the daggum thing.\n\n665\n00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,080\nBut it's not arbitrary like that.\n\n666\n00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,460\nIn the early days, and by the early\ndays I really mean in the late\n\n667\n00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,940\n1970's early 1980's,\nwhen IPV 4 was being developed.\n\n668\n00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,550\nThey set up a very simple set of rules,\nthat we had what were called classes,\n\n669\n00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:24,510\nand the classes defined where the network\nID began and where the host ID started.\n\n670\n00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,220\nOkay?\n\n671\n00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:31,570\nAnd so it basically worked out like this,\nis you had a Class A, class B and\n\n672\n00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,370\na class C, and there's actually two\nmore but these are the important ones.\n\n673\n00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:41,040\nAnd in a class A address\nthe first octet was\n\n674\n00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,460\npart of the network ID and the remaining\nthree octets were all the host ID.\n\n675\n00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,500\nJust like this, all right?\n\n676\n00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,337\nSo you know, and\nN is network and H is host, and\n\n677\n00:33:53,337 --> 00:33:55,340\nthat was how Class A is kinda laid out.\n\n678\n00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,950\nIf you had a Class B address, well,\nit was a little bit different, right?\n\n679\n00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:05,450\nA Class B,\nthe first two octets were part of that,\n\n680\n00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,350\nwell, that didn't work out,\nwas part of the network ID.\n\n681\n00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:12,740\nAnd then a Class C,\nit was the first three octets, right?\n\n682\n00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:18,600\nSo depending on our class would\ndetermine where our network ID ended and\n\n683\n00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,385\nwhere our host ID started.\n\n684\n00:34:20,385 --> 00:34:21,917\nSo let me just [CROSSTALK]\n>> So\n\n685\n00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:24,330\nare you implying that\nif you have no class.\n\n686\n00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,650\n>> You have no networks or hosts?\n\n687\n00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:26,180\n>> That's it.\n\n688\n00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,520\nThat's it.\nYou just had all zeros-\n\n689\n00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,330\n>> You're a classless,\n\n690\n00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,310\na classless network.\n\n691\n00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,410\n>> You know,\nthere could be something connected here.\n\n692\n00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:34,120\nIf you had no class you just\nbroadcast it all the time.\n\n693\n00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,730\n>> Okay.\nSo there you go.\n\n694\n00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:36,558\nAll right.\n\n695\n00:34:36,558 --> 00:34:38,810\n>> [LAUGH] Like Netbuoy.\n\n696\n00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:39,600\nNetbuoy has no class.\n\n697\n00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,050\n>> That loveable rascal of a protocol.\n\n698\n00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,870\n>> This is just sad networking humor.\n\n699\n00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:46,150\nNow what we do want to just note here\nas Don's typing out N's and H's.\n\n700\n00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,100\nLet's translate this back\nin what we actually see\n\n701\n00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,950\nwhen we set this up as opposed\nto just representing it for\n\n702\n00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:54,440\nyou here because it's a very\neasy way to get it in your mind.\n\n703\n00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,600\nBut what we also could do,\ncan you highlight in there?\n\n704\n00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,940\nIs that a highlightable area?\n\n705\n00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,080\nWhat I was thinking was\nhighlight all of the N's and\n\n706\n00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,980\nthen just signify that as a result or\n\n707\n00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:06,180\nmaybe [INAUDIBLE] around it that we have\na stairstep kind of thought process where.\n\n708\n00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,850\n>> You know where going through and\nyou can see.\n\n709\n00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,443\nSo the question was not can we highlight\nthe question it was can Don highlight.\n\n710\n00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,540\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH] I know.\n\n711\n00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,484\nIt's whether Don knows where to stop.\n\n712\n00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:15,120\n>> [LAUGH] Right, okay.\n\n713\n00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,330\nWhat I wanted to point\nout is two things to you.\n\n714\n00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:22,235\nNumber one that this concept of\nadding networks as we go means that\n\n715\n00:35:22,235 --> 00:35:26,425\nif you'll notice we're shifting\nover an octet as Don indicated.\n\n716\n00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:30,365\nSo we're losing certain number of hosts\nas we gain a certain number of networks.\n\n717\n00:35:30,365 --> 00:35:32,335\nAnd this is a zero-sum concept.\n\n718\n00:35:32,335 --> 00:35:36,295\nBecause at the end of the day,\nwe only have an overall box that's so big.\n\n719\n00:35:36,295 --> 00:35:38,705\nRight?\nWe can only add or remove so\n\n720\n00:35:38,705 --> 00:35:41,710\nmany networks or\nhosts to get to that magic number.\n\n721\n00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,550\nOf the actual,\n\n722\n00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:47,850\nultimate number of addressable IP\naddresses that we can use that are unique.\n\n723\n00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:50,950\nRemember, we have to have each host\ntest to have its own, unique endpoint.\n\n724\n00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,669\nSo unique IP that is\nsignifying it as something\n\n725\n00:35:53,669 --> 00:35:56,680\nthat is unique from something\nelse on the network.\n\n726\n00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,450\nAnd so, in class A, what we see is.\n\n727\n00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:01,050\nWe have 126 networks, right?\n\n728\n00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:01,730\nZero.\n\n729\n00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,460\nRemember, we don't start on zero.\n\n730\n00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,860\nThe first octet number is one, goes all\nthe way up to 126, and as a result,\n\n731\n00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,290\nthe number of networks for class A in\nthat first block is a hundred and 26.\n\n732\n00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:16,610\nThen the number of hosts in those last\nthree octets is going to be much,\n\n733\n00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,370\nmuch larger than the number of networks.\n\n734\n00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:25,010\nAs a result, what we wind up with Is\napproximately about 16.7 million hosts for\n\n735\n00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:31,140\nevery one of those networks of those 126,\nthat ultimately exist in a class A.\n\n736\n00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:34,420\nAnd so the way we signify\nthat is not what ends in H’s,\n\n737\n00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,920\nthat just represent the logic.\n\n738\n00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,390\nBut what we would see with a seven mask is\nultimately a 2 5 5 value, the total number\n\n739\n00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:44,280\nof bits for that subnet octet that is\ngoing to be used for that network.\n\n740\n00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,450\nAnd then, again we're talking\nabout a general case study here.\n\n741\n00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,210\nWhat were talking about\nis a default subnet mask.\n\n742\n00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:55,090\nAll right, so the default class A subnet,\ndefault class B, default class C.\n\n743\n00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:00,130\nWe're not talking about special use cases\nwhere we are default subnet masks, right,\n\n744\n00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:00,960\nwhen we go sailing.\n\n745\n00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,440\n>> Right.\n>> When we are going to be borrowing bits,\n\n746\n00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,080\nthat's another conversation,\nas we talked about in our last episode.\n\n747\n00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,730\nWe're gonna see a zero that represents\nthe host portion of the ID.\n\n748\n00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:14,420\nSo what I wanted to just bring out to you\nas Don was working with the NNH matrix\n\n749\n00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,690\nwith you here, and showing you that we\ngain as we go down on the networks and\n\n750\n00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,070\nlose when we go down on the hosts.\n\n751\n00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:20,770\nRight?\n\n752\n00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:25,160\nAs a result is that we are going to\nrepresent or swap in a 2.5.5 for the N\n\n753\n00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,350\nblock and a zero for the H block here as\nwe represent this and we build it out.\n\n754\n00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:33,062\nBecause what you'll see as you represent\nthis and we look at this is a 2.5.5 or\n\n755\n00:37:33,062 --> 00:37:37,520\na zero in the subnet masks based on\nthe network or host identification.\n\n756\n00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,280\nSo when we write that out, as you can see,\n\n757\n00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,020\nDon's kinda just translated those Ns and\nHs into numbers for us.\n\n758\n00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:52,375\nWhat we're actually seeing is\n2.5.5.0.0.0 is the default class A.\n\n759\n00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:53,510\n255.255.0.0, default class B.\n\n760\n00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,900\nAnd 255.255.255.0,\ndefault class C, subnet masks.\n\n761\n00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,100\nSo what that signifies for us there is\nthe number of network versus number of\n\n762\n00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:04,890\nhost octet blocks that we\nare dedicating to either one of these.\n\n763\n00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,870\nNow you can clearly see,\nas we did with the Ns and\n\n764\n00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:11,480\nthe Hs that as we gain on the network\nside, we lose on the host side.\n\n765\n00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,690\nWe can say the inverse is true as well\nbecause if we go from a Class C to\n\n766\n00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:17,690\nClass B, we're losing networks,\nbut gaining hosts,\n\n767\n00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,740\ngoing the other way as\nwe walk up the chain.\n\n768\n00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,390\nNow we use subnet masks\nlike that every single day.\n\n769\n00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:27,500\nWhen you assign an IP address to a router,\nto a switch, to a firewall,\n\n770\n00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:28,660\nto a PC-\n>> Any end point.\n\n771\n00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,560\nRight, any available IP endpoint.\n\n772\n00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,610\n>> You're typically going to\nlist 3 things: an IP address.\n\n773\n00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,180\n>> A subnet mask and\na default gateway or router.\n\n774\n00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,380\nAnd you're specifying\nwhat is your address,\n\n775\n00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,700\nhow do you identify the network and\nhost IDs, and\n\n776\n00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,350\nthen who do you use as a router when\nyou need to talk to another network.\n\n777\n00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,715\nThose are the three\nthings that we provide.\n\n778\n00:38:48,715 --> 00:38:51,905\nIn the early days, in the 70s and\n80s, we didn't have subnet masks.\n\n779\n00:38:51,905 --> 00:38:56,245\nInstead it was the very first octet\nthat determined which class we were.\n\n780\n00:38:56,245 --> 00:38:56,945\nAnd Adam mentioned this.\n\n781\n00:38:56,945 --> 00:39:00,575\nHe mentioned how a Class A is going to\nstart with the number 1 through 126.\n\n782\n00:39:00,575 --> 00:39:01,855\nWhy is that?\n\n783\n00:39:01,855 --> 00:39:06,725\nThe reason is that a Class A,\nin the olden days,\n\n784\n00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:09,055\nit was the first bits that\ndetermined the class.\n\n785\n00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,150\nAnd Class As always started with 01.\n\n786\n00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:15,490\nThe first two bits were a 01 in a Class A.\n\n787\n00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:20,110\nA Class B, we started with 001 and\na Class C started with 0001.\n\n788\n00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,060\nAll right.\n\n789\n00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,450\nThe end result was,\nif you fix these two bits, there's only so\n\n790\n00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,600\nmuch variation you can have.\n\n791\n00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:31,188\nSo, for example,\na Class A would run from 01000000.\n\n792\n00:39:31,188 --> 00:39:32,210\nAll the way to 01111111 right?\n\n793\n00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:37,400\nThose would be the lowest and\nhighest class As.\n\n794\n00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:43,292\nSo Class As would always\nstart with 1 to 126.\n\n795\n00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:47,875\nNow I skipped 0 because well 0\ndoesn't start with 01 does it?\n\n796\n00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:50,581\nRight.\nSo that one doesn't fall in so\n\n797\n00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:52,083\nwe go 1 to 126.\n\n798\n00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:59,667\nClass B's go 128 through 191.\n\n799\n00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:02,110\nLet me just write this out\na little more consistently.\n\n800\n00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,880\nAnd then Class C's.\n\n801\n00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,751\nGo 192 through 223.\n\n802\n00:40:04,751 --> 00:40:10,000\nAll right?\nNow you might be looking at this and\n\n803\n00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,740\nsaying oh great Don's doing bad\nmath again, this guy sucks at math.\n\n804\n00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,620\nWell, that's true and\n\n805\n00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,905\nyou're not wrong there, but\nI'm skipping some numbers on purpose.\n\n806\n00:40:17,905 --> 00:40:19,660\nOkay?\nWe skip zero because\n\n807\n00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,661\nzero breaks the rules.\n\n808\n00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:21,480\nRight?\nWe don't use zero.\n\n809\n00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,080\nAt the very beginning.\n\n810\n00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,790\nI skipped 127 and I skipped 224\nall the way through 255, right?\n\n811\n00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:33,680\nWell let's say 254 cuz 255 we skipped\nbecause of the broadcast, right?\n\n812\n00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,950\nSo zero.\n\n813\n00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,420\nThat's the beginning of the address space.\n\n814\n00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:43,120\nWe don't wanna use that one, all right?\n\n815\n00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,210\n127 I think, Adam,\nyou already mentioned this, didn't you?\n\n816\n00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:45,720\nThe Loopback?\n\n817\n00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,480\n>> I did.\nIt's\n\n818\n00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,560\nconsidered the Loopback adapter\naddress and what that will do is.\n\n819\n00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,390\nAnd it's interesting because\nwe take only the 127.0.0.1.\n\n820\n00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:58,320\nSo the first usable address in the block,\nand assign it.\n\n821\n00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,288\nIt this is hard coded into the network\ncard, into the NIC that you are using or\n\n822\n00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:03,720\ninto the endpoint device.\n\n823\n00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,130\nWhatever it is wireless,\nwired, doesn't really matter.\n\n824\n00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,510\nBut we hard code that into that as\na Loopback adapter meaning we use it to be\n\n825\n00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:15,030\nable to diagnose the card being\nturned on if you ping the local\n\n826\n00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:17,010\naddress the 127.0.0.1 address.\n\n827\n00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,180\nYou will get back a response if\nthe card slotted, powered on and\n\n828\n00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,870\nis able to function correctly.\n\n829\n00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:25,210\nWe don't do anything with\nthe rest of that address box.\n\n830\n00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:29,261\nSo 127.0.0.2 all the way up through 127,\n255, 254.\n\n831\n00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:32,660\nFor your purposes, as far as you know.\n\n832\n00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,720\nWe don't do anything with it.\n\n833\n00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,783\nWhen I say we I mean, we don't use it to\ncreate router-able network traffic that\n\n834\n00:41:37,783 --> 00:41:41,902\nmoves between machines either on a LAN, or\non a WAN, or on a Subnet on other words,\n\n835\n00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:44,440\nor across a Subnet to another Subnet.\n\n836\n00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,280\nThere are special cases where that\nnetwork may be used for other things.\n\n837\n00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,170\nWe're not really gonna worry about those.\n\n838\n00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:54,400\nSo we'd consider that to be the Loopback\naddress or Loopback adapter range.\n\n839\n00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,100\nSo 127 actually,\nwhen you look at documentation,\n\n840\n00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,968\nis considered a class A address, because\nit does fall into the Class A block.\n\n841\n00:42:00,968 --> 00:42:02,350\nBut it's a set-aside.\n\n842\n00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,910\nWe refer to it as\na set-aside address range.\n\n843\n00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,597\nAnd so\nalthough we technically call it Class A,\n\n844\n00:42:07,597 --> 00:42:12,047\nthe documentation on what the actual\nusable Class A range is, is 1-126.\n\n845\n00:42:12,047 --> 00:42:14,889\nWe consider 127 As separate set-off and\n\n846\n00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:18,725\nthen 128-191 as you can see Class B and\nClass C.\n\n847\n00:42:18,725 --> 00:42:23,805\nAnd then Don noted out here for\nus the 224-239 is considered Multicast.\n\n848\n00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:25,835\nThat is actually considered Class D.\n\n849\n00:42:26,935 --> 00:42:30,324\nAnd then the 240-254 range really 255 but\n\n850\n00:42:30,324 --> 00:42:35,720\nit's not indicated as broadcast is\nconsidered a reserved the research range.\n\n851\n00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,297\nIt's been used for\nIPV6 expansion recently.\n\n852\n00:42:38,297 --> 00:42:41,426\nThe last several years as\nwe're ramping up IPV6.\n\n853\n00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:44,710\nAnd that is considered\nClass E as in Eagle.\n\n854\n00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,140\nRight so we do have a total\nof five address classes.\n\n855\n00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:50,170\nThree of them are considered usable for\nevery day for\n\n856\n00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:53,210\nroutable IP traffic across LANs and WANs.\n\n857\n00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,870\nThe Multicast address is used\nprimarily for streaming and for\n\n858\n00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,550\nthings like doing imaging.\n\n859\n00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,750\nWriting a multicast scenario.\n\n860\n00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,410\nSo it is used fairly often, but we don't\nreally address it as a normal range we use\n\n861\n00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,040\nto move traffic back and forth.\n\n862\n00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,460\nAnd class C is considered\nto be a set aside range.\n\n863\n00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,560\nIt's really used in only special cases.\n\n864\n00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,490\n>> Do we need to talk about\nprivate public RFC 1918 addresses,\n\n865\n00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:15,440\nthat kind of stuff, or?\n\n866\n00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,390\n>> Well, you know, we probably want to\nmention a PEPA based addressing, right?\n\n867\n00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,990\nJust to understand the concept of the 169,\n254 address blocks.\n\n868\n00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,560\nProbably a good idea\nto throw that in here.\n\n869\n00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,190\nSo we don't need to reference any RFCs or\nanything like that.\n\n870\n00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:31,420\nBut we do wanna talk about\nthis particular address block,\n\n871\n00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:35,860\nwhich is 169.254 on the network side, and\n\n872\n00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,110\nthen 01 through,\nas we know hopefully by now, 255.254.\n\n873\n00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:44,989\nAnd this will be what is known as APIPA,\nA-P-I-P-A.\n\n874\n00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:48,870\nYou wanna say that three or four times\nfast while you're hopping up and down.\n\n875\n00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,710\nIt makes a very interesting sound.\n\n876\n00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:53,390\nSo automatic private IP addressing and so\n\n877\n00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:58,740\nwhat APIPA does is this allows us to\nbe able to maintain a net-workable,\n\n878\n00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,920\naddressable address,\nan IPV4 based address.\n\n879\n00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,150\nWhen we either come into a situation where\nwe have lost our IP address in a DHCP\n\n880\n00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,020\nenvironment where for\nsome reason we cannot renew.\n\n881\n00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,860\nOur TTL has ticked down to zero.\n\n882\n00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,790\nWe can't hit our DHCP server.\n\n883\n00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:15,030\nAnd as a result we will not go dark and\n\n884\n00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:18,590\nsimply see all zeros register meaning\nwe're off the network in effect.\n\n885\n00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:22,660\nBut rather what we will get is a private\nIP address that puts us into our\n\n886\n00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,380\nown Subnet.\n\n887\n00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:24,660\nSo it's almost like a VLAN.\n\n888\n00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,500\nAnd it keeps us on the network.\n\n889\n00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:31,220\nConnected and able to then cycle through\nconnecting to the DHCP service at various\n\n890\n00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,810\ntimes, there's a timeout variable\nthat comes into play here to do that.\n\n891\n00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:38,540\nAnd if we then are successful at\nreconnecting, we release an address or\n\n892\n00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,960\nrenew an address, whatever it may be,\nand it keeps us connected.\n\n893\n00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,970\nAnd then, yes, we do wanna talk about\nthe private set-asides as well.\n\n894\n00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:46,310\nFor a Class B, as you're noting there.\n\n895\n00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,935\nClass B and then Class C as well.\n\n896\n00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:51,201\nRight?\nSo Don mentioned that these are set up\n\n897\n00:44:51,201 --> 00:44:55,140\nusing an RFC out there, public,\nprivate IP address classes.\n\n898\n00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,270\nWe don't need to worry about\nthe RFC reference, right?\n\n899\n00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,935\nOther than from a historical perspective.\n\n900\n00:44:58,935 --> 00:45:00,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Always important to know that.\n\n901\n00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:02,170\nDon't wanna indicate it's not important.\n\n902\n00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,550\nBut it's more of just a factual.\n\n903\n00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:08,410\nKind of a trivial piece of\ninformation if you will.\n\n904\n00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:12,740\nWe don't tend to ask questions on exams\nlike this about what is this RFC?\n\n905\n00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,330\nWhat is that?\n\n906\n00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,490\nHow does it refer?\n\n907\n00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,420\nWhat does it mean?\n\n908\n00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,460\nBecause RFCs can be updated and\nsuperseded over time.\n\n909\n00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:20,310\nCertain RFCs are gonna be updated.\n\n910\n00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:21,660\nAs we change things and so\n\n911\n00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,550\nthat reference point is not as\nimportant as understanding the concept.\n\n912\n00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,630\nSo let's just quickly discuss Class A,\nB and C set-asides and\n\n913\n00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,090\ntalk about what they are as well.\n\n914\n00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:32,080\n>> Yeah so all the other addresses that we\nwere talking about, these guys up here,\n\n915\n00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,380\nthe Class As, Bs and Cs from before.\n\n916\n00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:37,878\nThese guys the bulk of those\naddresses are called registered IPs.\n\n917\n00:45:37,878 --> 00:45:41,920\nIf you wanna use them like on\nthe internet you would be the unique\n\n918\n00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,420\nsole individual with that IP\nacross the entire planet.\n\n919\n00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:45,960\nAnd we have the.\n\n920\n00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:46,920\n>> I feel special.\n\n921\n00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,050\n>> And you are special.\n\n922\n00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,250\nSo [LAUGH] everybody's special.\n\n923\n00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,670\nWell-\n>> In your own unique way.\n\n924\n00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,570\n>> You're special until we run out of\nIPs and then you're not so special.\n\n925\n00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:59,560\nBut we have the INA and ARIN and\norganizations like that that are insuring\n\n926\n00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,020\nthe uniqueness of those\nIPs across the world.\n\n927\n00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:06,130\nBut, what if you just need an IP for\nprivate use for inside of your network,\n\n928\n00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,350\nlike here in the studio.\n\n929\n00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:08,230\nRight?\nI don't want\n\n930\n00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:12,240\nall the studio equipment to have Public\nIP Addresses out there on the internet.\n\n931\n00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,060\nSo they did set aside.\n\n932\n00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,400\nThey set some ranges aside.\n\n933\n00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,270\nThey reserved them for private use.\n\n934\n00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,720\nYou can use them inside\nof your organization and\n\n935\n00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,700\nyou do not have to register,\nfree of charge.\n\n936\n00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:22,870\nYou can use the heck out of them.\n\n937\n00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:24,460\nYou then all you want.\n\n938\n00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,630\nThe only thing to remember is\nthese are for private use.\n\n939\n00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,720\nYour internet service provider\n>> Your ISPs,\n\n940\n00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,890\nthey're actually required\nto block this traffic.\n\n941\n00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:38,170\nIf you send any traffic to your ISP source\nfrom one of these private addresses,\n\n942\n00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,150\nthey will drop it.\n\n943\n00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:39,650\nAll right?\n\n944\n00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:42,780\nIf they don't, they run the risk of\nhaving their BGP zones terminated.\n\n945\n00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,830\nWe don't wanna get into all that.\n\n946\n00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:46,239\nSo obviously they're gonna drop it.\n\n947\n00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:46,920\nRight?\n>> So is\n\n948\n00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,520\nthat like the end of\nthe world as we know it?\n\n949\n00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,220\nIs that what happens when\nwe cross the streams?\n\n950\n00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,190\n>> It would be if you were in ISP.\n\n951\n00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:53,880\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Total protonic reversal.\n\n952\n00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,438\nSo, [LAUGH] can't get\nthrough a day without\n\n953\n00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,790\na Ghostbusters reference somewhere.\n\n954\n00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:59,370\n>> No.\nSo,\n\n955\n00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,510\nlet's think about this logic right here.\n\n956\n00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:01,180\nWhat we would say.\n\n957\n00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,340\nLet's frame this out.\n\n958\n00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,740\nIs any of this internal private traffic?\n\n959\n00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,420\nIs effectively routable only on the LAN,\nright.\n\n960\n00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:10,000\nWe try to cross the default\ngateway boundary.\n\n961\n00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,950\nAnd move out to the WAN with this private\nIP address traffic in these ranges.\n\n962\n00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:17,010\nIt's not that this can't be done.\n\n963\n00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,330\nRight.\nWe want you to understand\n\n964\n00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:21,650\nIt's not that this doesn't allow for\nit to happen.\n\n965\n00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:24,170\nIt's that we have chosen based\non how the system is set up,\n\n966\n00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:27,130\nas Don was indicating, for\nit not to be transmittable.\n\n967\n00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,360\nBecause if it was,\n\n968\n00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:32,420\nwhat happens is effectively we'd create\ncollision environments where in effect.\n\n969\n00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,250\nMultiple end points have\nthe same IP address.\n\n970\n00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:39,608\nAnd we have no way of creating this unique\ndelivery model where we drop traffic at\n\n971\n00:47:39,608 --> 00:47:41,830\na certain end point based on an address.\n\n972\n00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,750\nWe'd have to revert to MAC addressing and\nit would be a nightmare.\n\n973\n00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,550\nThere'd be no way to do that,\nit would just be.\n\n974\n00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:50,101\nWe'd overwhelm the routing capabilities\non the Internet pretty quickly, and\n\n975\n00:47:50,101 --> 00:47:51,167\nit would just be a mess.\n\n976\n00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:55,040\nAnd so what we would wind up with would\njust basically be an untenable situation.\n\n977\n00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,010\nSo it is routable traffic, right?\n\n978\n00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,060\nWe wanna be clear about that but\n\n979\n00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,590\nit is routable only on the inside\nof your network up to the gateway.\n\n980\n00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:04,412\nOut beyond that we have to\nuse technology like natting,\n\n981\n00:48:04,412 --> 00:48:09,610\nnetwork address translation or\nsome form of proxying that prevents that\n\n982\n00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:14,960\ntraffic from being seen outside on the WAN\nas being internally addressable only.\n\n983\n00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,570\nWe effectively mask that internalized\nIP with some sort of external\n\n984\n00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:21,580\npublic routable IP which is\nwhere the ISP comes in, right?\n\n985\n00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,740\nThat's what they give you.\n\n986\n00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:26,850\nThat's what sits on the WAN side, the wide\narea network side of your gateway device,\n\n987\n00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:29,180\nyour router at the end of the day,\nyour firewall, or\n\n988\n00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:31,262\nwhatever it is in your logical or\nphysical architecture.\n\n989\n00:48:31,262 --> 00:48:37,080\n>> Yeah so while we have these nice,\ngrand class rules,\n\n990\n00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:42,230\nright, that were way up here, which\nare accurate the majority of the time,\n\n991\n00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,880\nthere's always exception\nto make things harder.\n\n992\n00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,120\nSo just remember that.\n\n993\n00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:48,000\nThat we've got our loop backs,\nwe've got our multicast ranges,\n\n994\n00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,420\nwe've got our private ranges and\nour APIPA.\n\n995\n00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,420\nThese are all just kind of\nexceptions to the rule.\n\n996\n00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,110\nIt's frustrating, but\n\n997\n00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:56,240\nthey're facts of life that we\nneed to be ready to deal with.\n\n998\n00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:56,980\n>> Alright, so I know we were\n\n999\n00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,295\ntalking about doing a quick little\ntour of some of this stuff.\n\n1000\n00:48:59,295 --> 00:49:01,302\n>> Sure.\n>> Just quickly throwing it up into our\n\n1001\n00:49:01,302 --> 00:49:03,980\ncommand shell environment, if you will.\n\n1002\n00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,610\nI know Don has put that up.\n\n1003\n00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,230\nWe had a couple of things in there\nwe're gonna quickly show you.\n\n1004\n00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:10,705\nFirst of all, Don's name about\nsix times on the screen there.\n\n1005\n00:49:10,705 --> 00:49:13,490\n[LAUGH] So you could see he's gonna\ndo a clear screen real quick.\n\n1006\n00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:15,680\nSo we thought we would quickly,\nin the last couple of minute,\n\n1007\n00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,440\nthat we wanna demonstrate\na couple of things.\n\n1008\n00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,690\nWalk you through some visuals\naround some of this, right?\n\n1009\n00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,150\nSo why don't we start with\njust doing a quick IP config.\n\n1010\n00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,780\nAnd let's talk about what IP config is,\nright?\n\n1011\n00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:29,880\nThis is a command that is going to allow\nus to be able to extract into the command\n\n1012\n00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,900\nshell all of the IP address information\nthat is associated with the network stack,\n\n1013\n00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,500\nthe TCP stack, in Don's machine in\nthis case, as we're demonstrating.\n\n1014\n00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,440\nSo we will see both wired and\nwireless adaptors, for instance.\n\n1015\n00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,960\nIf we do have both, we will see virtual\nadaptors if Don's running maybe virtual\n\n1016\n00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,540\ninterfaces, or virtual infrastructure.\n\n1017\n00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,240\nSo this can create some confusion for\nsome people, right,\n\n1018\n00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,690\nbecause potentially,\nI always get this question in class.\n\n1019\n00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,320\nHey, why did you do that, and\nyou have like seven or eight IP addresses?\n\n1020\n00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:59,320\nCuz I have virtual adaptors running,\nand I have wireless, and\n\n1021\n00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,220\nall sorts of stuff, maybe even\nBluetooth if I have Bluetooth enabled.\n\n1022\n00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,610\nAll sorts of crazy things.\n\n1023\n00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:07,210\nSo what we want to understand is\nwhich adapter we're looking for, and\n\n1024\n00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,470\nthey'll be given numbers, right?\n\n1025\n00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:12,100\nAdapter five I think I see there for\nethernet, and there's some other stuff.\n\n1026\n00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,670\nSo, you may have to do a little\nreconnaissance here just to\n\n1027\n00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,560\nfigure out which adapter\ninterface you're looking for\n\n1028\n00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,170\nbased on the kind of address\nyou want to associate.\n\n1029\n00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:22,050\nAm I looking for my wired adapter?\n\n1030\n00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:24,090\nDo I want my wireless adapter addressed?\n\n1031\n00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,520\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1032\n00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:28,740\nUp top we see the host name of\nDon's machine, very important.\n\n1033\n00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:32,860\nWe see whether or\nnot Don is gonna have some DNS suffix.\n\n1034\n00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:36,640\nWe'll talk about this in a future episode,\nabout DNS and how we do that.\n\n1035\n00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,740\nIs Don using either WINs, which is an old\nschool, Windows-based NetBIOS networking\n\n1036\n00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:47,400\nsolution, thank God we don't see any of\nthat turned on, right, and whether or\n\n1037\n00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,120\nnot Don has some other information\nthat may or may not be important.\n\n1038\n00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,930\nWe do see a specific reference to\nthe physical adapter down there, so\n\n1039\n00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:57,200\nthe physical address, rather.\n\n1040\n00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,980\nSo I'm looking at the MAC address,\nas well as the physical adapter reference.\n\n1041\n00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:04,650\nHe's got a, looks like a USB adapter there\nthat's doing gigabyte translator for him.\n\n1042\n00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:08,300\nSo he effectively has an external\nnetwork adapter device\n\n1043\n00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,620\nplugged into his machine without seeing\nit or without knowing what it is.\n\n1044\n00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,840\nAnd we see a MAC address there.\n\n1045\n00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,510\nThe MAC address,\n\n1046\n00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:18,320\nremember, gonna be a layer two address in\nthe data link sublayer of our OSI model.\n\n1047\n00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,340\nAlways fun to talk about that and\nrefer to that.\n\n1048\n00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:24,630\nThe interesting thing about Mac\naddresses is gonna be the first three\n\n1049\n00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,810\nblocks of numbers, if you will.\n\n1050\n00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,140\nSo I don't want to call them\noctets because they're not octets.\n\n1051\n00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:33,690\nBut the first three sequence character\nsets are gonna represent the vendor ID.\n\n1052\n00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:34,620\nUnique ID.\n\n1053\n00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,270\nEverywhere we go you need this.\n\n1054\n00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:40,630\nUnique vendor ID for the device,\nin this case that USB dongle adapter,\n\n1055\n00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,490\nthat Don is using,\nthat's a fun word to say dongle.\n\n1056\n00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,470\nSay that a couple of times,\nit rolls right off your tongue,\n\n1057\n00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:47,610\nespecially on a Saturday morning.\n\n1058\n00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:51,240\nSo the three unique character sets there\nare gonna represent the vendor ID.\n\n1059\n00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:54,690\nWe don't know what vendor this is but,\nwhatever vendor it is that is their ID.\n\n1060\n00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:58,832\nAnd then the last grouping of characters\nthere is gonna represent the unique,\n\n1061\n00:51:58,832 --> 00:52:02,020\nin effect,\ndevice ID within that vendor block.\n\n1062\n00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,480\nThat's gonna represent uniqueness as well.\n\n1063\n00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,936\nAnd make sure that this adapter\nthat Don is using in this case, or\n\n1064\n00:52:06,936 --> 00:52:11,354\nwhatever IPN point you're using when you\nlook at this, is unique from any other.\n\n1065\n00:52:11,354 --> 00:52:13,200\nAnd that Mac address is burned-in.\n\n1066\n00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,100\nThat's how we refer to it.\n\n1067\n00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,080\nIt is a physically assigned address.\n\n1068\n00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,820\nThe adapter is made physically\nat a plant somewhere.\n\n1069\n00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:23,880\nIt's programmed in and it is then\neffectively rendered for that device.\n\n1070\n00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,570\nAnd it should stay that way.\n\n1071\n00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:28,150\nIn security tool sets and\nin hacking classes and\n\n1072\n00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:31,630\nthings, we do talk about the fact that\nyou could manipulate this Mac address.\n\n1073\n00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:35,420\nBut for purposes of our conversation,\nlet's assume that it stays fixed and\n\n1074\n00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,000\nyou don't tend to play around with it.\n\n1075\n00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,340\nBecause those kinds of things,\n\n1076\n00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:41,198\nalthough they are possible,\nthen lead to other complications.\n\n1077\n00:52:41,198 --> 00:52:44,310\nYou may want into another device,\nin effect, but it's the same address, and\n\n1078\n00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:47,010\nyou run into that whole issue\nof effectively collisions and\n\n1079\n00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:48,660\nstart dropping traffic,\nand bad things happen.\n\n1080\n00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:54,110\nWe do see things like DHCP being enabled,\nwe see a lot of information in here, but\n\n1081\n00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:54,770\nas we move down,\n\n1082\n00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:57,630\nwe see something interesting,\nwhich is a new address type, right.\n\n1083\n00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:01,550\nSo we're seeing what looks like\na stream of characters, letters and\n\n1084\n00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:04,790\nnumber that has instead\nof dot decimal notation,\n\n1085\n00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:09,300\nthe way that we have seen with IPv4, we're\nlooking at something that has a colon, or\n\n1086\n00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,930\ncolon notations, almost like a double\nrow of dot decimals, if you will.\n\n1087\n00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:14,440\nSo what kind of an address is this?\n\n1088\n00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,700\nWhat are we talking about there?\n\n1089\n00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:20,350\n>> You mentioned earlier with IPv4 that we\nget billions of addresses, four billion.\n\n1090\n00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:21,420\nRight?\n>> Approximately.\n\n1091\n00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:24,170\n>> In the early days of IP,\nbefore that was cool, because the world's\n\n1092\n00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:27,170\npopulation was about four billion and\neverybody could have one IP.\n\n1093\n00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,300\nBut that didn't work out so well, right?\n\n1094\n00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,718\nWe started running out of IP addresses.\n\n1095\n00:53:30,718 --> 00:53:37,950\nSo IPv6, the successor to IPv4, was\ndeveloped to increase that address space.\n\n1096\n00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:43,830\nSo we go from the old 32-bit address\nof IPv4 to a 128-bit address in IPv6,\n\n1097\n00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:44,780\nwhich is massive.\n\n1098\n00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:48,310\nAnd it's such a big number that\n\n1099\n00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:52,150\nthey really couldn't represent it the same\nway that we represented IPv4 addresses.\n\n1100\n00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:55,090\nSo they represent it in hexadecimal.\n\n1101\n00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:58,750\nEach digit represents\na value from zero to fifteen.\n\n1102\n00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,010\nSo sixteen different values,\nit actually goes zero through nine and\n\n1103\n00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,050\nthen A through F, so\nwe see letters and numbers.\n\n1104\n00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,410\nVery similar to the Mac address right?\n\n1105\n00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:09,250\nThe Mac address is a 48-bit\nnumber written in hexadecimal.\n\n1106\n00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:12,870\nIPv6 addresses are a 128\nbit-number written in hexadecimal.\n\n1107\n00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:19,240\n>> Obviously when we have 128 bits,\nwe have, do the rough math in your head.\n\n1108\n00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,203\n32-bit, 128-bit, four times.\n\n1109\n00:54:21,203 --> 00:54:22,590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> If we think about that,\n\n1110\n00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,680\nthe address block.\n\n1111\n00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,010\nNow that urban myth and\nlegend we've heard about for years.\n\n1112\n00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:26,830\nOh my God.\n\n1113\n00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,610\nThe chicken little thing,\nthe sky is falling,\n\n1114\n00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:30,450\nwe're running out of IP addresses.\n\n1115\n00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,770\nYou know hasn't happened,\nyou know that's just the reality.\n\n1116\n00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:36,880\nSo we haven't run out of IPv4 addresses\nyet, but do understand that at some\n\n1117\n00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,380\npoint if we wait long enough, as not\nonly the population of the world but\n\n1118\n00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,570\nmore importantly are we going\nto that authoritative reference,\n\n1119\n00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:46,870\nright that ultimate\nauthoritative reference.\n\n1120\n00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,510\nI hesitate to even say the word, right.\n\n1121\n00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:51,270\n>> You know it has a name, and\nI can't remember the name or\n\n1122\n00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:54,300\nthe number because it's such\na massive number with IPv6.\n\n1123\n00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,610\nBut the way I explain it is-\n>> Googolplex?\n\n1124\n00:54:56,610 --> 00:54:57,770\n>> It's even bigger than that.\n\n1125\n00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:59,360\nIt's some ridiculous number.\n\n1126\n00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,901\n>> Oh, is it Amazon plex?\n\n1127\n00:55:00,901 --> 00:55:06,076\n>> [LAUGH] On the earth we have six\nbillion people, the IPv6 address space\n\n1128\n00:55:06,076 --> 00:55:11,890\nis big that all six billion people could\nhave the four billion IPs from IPv4.\n\n1129\n00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:14,840\nEach person could have their\nown set of four billion IPs and\n\n1130\n00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,750\nwe still wouldn't be\nout of IPv6 addresses.\n\n1131\n00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,576\nThat's how big the address space is.\n\n1132\n00:55:18,576 --> 00:55:22,483\nIt's massive.\nThey're saying here that it is 3.4 times\n\n1133\n00:55:22,483 --> 00:55:25,200\n10 to the 1,038 power.\n\n1134\n00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,150\nThat's massive.\n\n1135\n00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:30,370\nSo it's actually 7.9 times 1028,\n\n1136\n00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:35,390\nI guess that's to the 1028th\npower times as many IP before.\n\n1137\n00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,980\nSo it is an insane amount of addresses,\n\n1138\n00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,160\nthe idea being we ran out once,\nwe don't want to run out again.\n\n1139\n00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,083\n>> But we didn't actually run out.\n\n1140\n00:55:42,083 --> 00:55:45,959\nThat's what I was trying to point out,\nwhich is that we still actually have\n\n1141\n00:55:45,959 --> 00:55:50,205\nplenty of IPv4 addresses because of this\nprivate IP address blocks that we talked\n\n1142\n00:55:50,205 --> 00:55:53,240\nabout where most devices\nare masked behind a routable IP.\n\n1143\n00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,720\nWe actually have a ton of IP addresses\nthat are just sitting idle, and\n\n1144\n00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,920\nnot being used in the IPv4 range.\n\n1145\n00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,790\nAt least, that is as of today right,\n\n1146\n00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:02,060\nthat's kind of where we sit today\n>> Right.\n\n1147\n00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:04,650\n>> But we know that over time\nif this trend continues,\n\n1148\n00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:08,730\nthere is the possibility that we could run\nout of IP addresses, this could be clear.\n\n1149\n00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:11,600\nAlright so we did want to just talk\nabout maybe one other thing there,\n\n1150\n00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:16,630\ninside of this, which is, what does\nthe loopback Address, the 127.0.0.1.\n\n1151\n00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,150\n>> Oh, sure.\n>> What does that look like in\n\n1152\n00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:19,150\nIPv6, right?\n\n1153\n00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:22,030\nCuz we probably want to know\na basic concept of how to write\n\n1154\n00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,090\nan address like that.\n\n1155\n00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:25,450\n>> Yeah, so the loopback,\nit's a logical interface.\n\n1156\n00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,100\nSo we don't really see it\nhere in the interfaces.\n\n1157\n00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:29,390\nLike here, you see my wireless adapter,\nand my bluetooth.\n\n1158\n00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:32,879\nYou'll see there's a tunnel for\n[CROSSTALK].\n\n1159\n00:56:32,879 --> 00:56:35,200\nSo you'll see some various\nassorted junk in there.\n\n1160\n00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,750\nThere's ISO tap, but you don't see\none that's labelled loop back.\n\n1161\n00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:39,590\nBut it does exist.\n\n1162\n00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:41,920\nIf I ping 127.0.0.1, all right?\n\n1163\n00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,350\nThat's my loop back.\n\n1164\n00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:45,550\nThat range.\n\n1165\n00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:47,980\nRemember 127 is reserved for that.\n\n1166\n00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,710\nIf I ping that,\nI'm actually pinging myself.\n\n1167\n00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:53,770\nAnd I'm doing it logically\nwithin the protocol stack.\n\n1168\n00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:56,500\nSo this is not actually using\na physical network adapter.\n\n1169\n00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:01,790\nThis is a great way to test the TCIP\nprotocol stack software on your machine.\n\n1170\n00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,970\nTesting software not hardware, right?\n\n1171\n00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:07,550\nIf I were to ping an IP address attached\nto one of my hardware adapters,\n\n1172\n00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:08,930\nthen I'd be testing hardware.\n\n1173\n00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:12,120\nSo it's a good way to test, and\nit's actually a whole range.\n\n1174\n00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,960\nSo I could I could ping.\n\n1175\n00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,010\nWait Windows doesn't do it.\n\n1176\n00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:20,195\nIn Linux, you can actually ping the whole\nrange, and it will loop back to you, but\n\n1177\n00:57:20,195 --> 00:57:22,025\nin Windows, oh wait did I do a typo.\n\n1178\n00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:23,039\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> do 172.\n\n1179\n00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:25,012\n>> I did.\n\n1180\n00:57:25,012 --> 00:57:26,597\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> It picks the whole stack,\n\n1181\n00:57:26,597 --> 00:57:27,690\nits just you have to put the 127.\n\n1182\n00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,100\n>> You just have to type it right.\n\n1183\n00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:29,947\nThat stupid requirement\n[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n\n1184\n00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,830\n>> Otherwise you get a 172 end point\n\n1185\n00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:32,782\nactually entry.\n\n1186\n00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,110\nOne or the other.\n\n1187\n00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:35,600\nSo it's that whole range.\n\n1188\n00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:36,530\nWe can ping that.\n\n1189\n00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:39,980\nAnd IPv6 has a loop back also.\n\n1190\n00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:44,160\nAnd if I wanted to type\nthe whole address out, right?\n\n1191\n00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,350\nThe long form in IPv6 would be.\n\n1192\n00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:51,950\nThis'll get boring really fast,\nI'm actually kind of already bored, and\n\n1193\n00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:52,740\nI just got started.\n\n1194\n00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:57,202\n>> So we're gonna take a commercial\nbreak while Don [CROSSTALK].\n\n1195\n00:57:57,202 --> 00:57:59,811\nSo only kidding right, but\nyou can see this is how,\n\n1196\n00:57:59,811 --> 00:58:01,520\nto be clear this is the long form.\n\n1197\n00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,910\nSo what we actually wanna do, and\nthe reason I asked Don to put this up.\n\n1198\n00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:07,500\nIs to show you the short form\nof the loopback address.\n\n1199\n00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:11,190\nWhich you can see right there,\nhe just put it in, colon, colon, one.\n\n1200\n00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,650\nThat's effectively like short-hand,\nhow we register it or\n\n1201\n00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:16,540\nrender it, cuz you're not gonna\ntype out what Don just did.\n\n1202\n00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,520\nAnd more importantly.\n\n1203\n00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,630\nWhy would you, right?\n\n1204\n00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:23,770\nYou need a hobby, right, you've got to get\nout more, get a little sun, see the world.\n\n1205\n00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,060\nIt's very important, right.\n\n1206\n00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:29,300\nSo we want you to understand what the\nloopback adaptor short hand, if you will,\n\n1207\n00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:31,710\nlooks like on the IPv6 stack.\n\n1208\n00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:34,920\nBecause it is important, if you start\nseeing it, you want to recognize it.\n\n1209\n00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,990\nAnd you may need to, you know,\njust be aware of that from a question and\n\n1210\n00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:39,200\nanswer prospective.\n\n1211\n00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,390\nSo it's a good piece of information for\nyou to have.\n\n1212\n00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:45,450\nIf you haven't been playing with IPv6 by\nthe way, it is integrated directly into\n\n1213\n00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:48,250\nthe network stacks,\nin most modern operating systems today.\n\n1214\n00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:52,855\nBack in the day, when we had started to\nsupport IPv4, you may have to add and\n\n1215\n00:58:52,855 --> 00:58:56,330\nre-compile the protocol stack in\nolder Microsoft systems to use it.\n\n1216\n00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:57,670\nToday it is built right in.\n\n1217\n00:58:57,670 --> 00:59:00,260\nSo if you're running Windows 7,\nif you're running Windows 8,\n\n1218\n00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:03,550\nif you're running Server 2008,\nyou're running Server 12.\n\n1219\n00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:07,630\nYou've got native,\nwhat we call in line IPv6 support.\n\n1220\n00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:11,080\nYou want a dual stack in effect that's\ncompiled to run both in real time.\n\n1221\n00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,450\nSame thing on the Linux side.\n\n1222\n00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:14,700\nAny of the modern Linux distributions,\n\n1223\n00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:18,030\nwill have real time compiled\nIPv6 support in their kernels.\n\n1224\n00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:21,140\nThey actually were there before\nWindows was, so kudos to them.\n\n1225\n00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,840\nBecause obviously they\nsaw the future coming.\n\n1226\n00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,760\nBut either way, you should be able\nto go out and play with this.\n\n1227\n00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,290\nSo, don't be afraid to set this up, and\nmaybe do a little backing and forthing,\n\n1228\n00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:33,260\nexplore what those items are and\nthose options are.\n\n1229\n00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:36,570\nBut remember, do so in the context of\npreparing the knowledge base you need for\n\n1230\n00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:40,460\nthe exam, and don't get sucked into\nthis black hole of, oh my god,\n\n1231\n00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,770\nI need to know everything about IPv6.\n\n1232\n00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:44,020\nBecause you're not using it today.\n\n1233\n00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:48,160\nYou just have to know the conceptual high\nlevel of the difference between a 32 and\n\n1234\n00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:51,760\n128 bit solution, and\nthis idea of how to identify and\n\n1235\n00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,080\naddress should you see one,\nin a different notation form.\n\n1236\n00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,790\nKnow that that's and IPv6 address.\n\n1237\n00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:57,810\n>> Yeah.\n\n1238\n00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:01,170\nAll right, so that's probably a pretty\ngood spot for us stop and take a break.\n\n1239\n01:00:01,170 --> 01:00:02,120\n>> Think so, think so.\n\n1240\n01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:02,740\n>> So let's stop.\n\n1241\n01:00:02,740 --> 01:00:07,700\nWe'll take a breather here and when we get\nback, we haven't done any telecom yet.\n\n1242\n01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,420\n>> We haven't.\n>> But telecom and\n\n1243\n01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:12,750\nnetwork security, which is our objective.\n\n1244\n01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,455\nSo its a good thing we'll cover it.\n\n1245\n01:00:14,455 --> 01:00:16,090\n>> Oh, So I'm maybe thinking OSI model.\n\n1246\n01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:17,250\n>> That could be fun.\n\n1247\n01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:20,340\n>> That could be fun, so we may want\nto do that, and I dont know maybe\n\n1248\n01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:25,450\nnetwork apologie,s and we could talk about\n>> I don't know,\n\n1249\n01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:27,760\nmodern day weather patterns\nover the Atlantic.\n\n1250\n01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,020\n>> There we go.\n>> We'll throw a little\n\n1251\n01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,510\ntransitional stuff in there for\nyou as well, all right?\n\n1252\n01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:34,060\n>> So, currency exchange rates,\ntrade routes, all that other stuff?\n\n1253\n01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:35,150\n>> BitCoin, BitCoin too.\n\n1254\n01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:36,480\n>> BitCoin.\n>> All right, so we'll see you soon.\n\n1255\n01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,657\n>> All right, stay tuned,\nwe'll be back after this.\n\n1256\n01:00:38,657 --> 01:00:45,843\n[MUSIC]\n\n1257\n01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:46,460\nAll right.\n\n1258\n01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,730\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n1259\n01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:50,860\nSo in our final segment today,\nwhat we're gonna be doing is diving into\n\n1260\n01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:55,560\na very important concept,\nwhich I know we alluded to earlier.\n\n1261\n01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,440\nAgain building the suspense and\nanticipation.\n\n1262\n01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,870\nWe're like Hollywood scientists here.\n\n1263\n01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:04,550\nSo, [LAUGH] so,\nwe started talking about the OSI model,\n\n1264\n01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,800\nthe Open Systems Interconnect model.\n\n1265\n01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,240\nAnd, that would be a good thing\nto write down, I suppose.\n\n1266\n01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,960\nAnd, it is a nice\nframework that we have for\n\n1267\n01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,030\nmaking communications\npossible between systems.\n\n1268\n01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:16,340\nSo, we wanna have a good understanding.\n\n1269\n01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:20,140\nAt least a high level understanding of it,\nbefore we attempt the exam.\n\n1270\n01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:20,720\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1271\n01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,850\nSo, let's talk a little\nbit about the OSI model.\n\n1272\n01:01:22,850 --> 01:01:24,730\nLet's talk a little bit about what it is.\n\n1273\n01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,490\nAs Don indicated,\nwe have a name to go with the model.\n\n1274\n01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,000\nWe also have a pretty picture.\n\n1275\n01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,880\nI see a couple of pretty pictures,\nthat Don has put together for us,\n\n1276\n01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,060\nas well,\nto help you kinda walk through this.\n\n1277\n01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:39,340\nSo, the background with the OSI model,\nis this is a logical construct.\n\n1278\n01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:40,410\nIt's a framework.\n\n1279\n01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:46,160\nIt helps us to visualize what is\nhappening as we either deconstruct or\n\n1280\n01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,130\nconstruct a data packet,\nas we move it from the top of the stack at\n\n1281\n01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:54,270\nthe application layer, off the desktop,\nif you will, in a software interface,\n\n1282\n01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:59,345\ndown through the computer's processing\nlogical deconstruction of data.\n\n1283\n01:01:59,345 --> 01:02:02,205\nWe strip away the presentation.\n\n1284\n01:02:02,205 --> 01:02:05,905\nWe start decompiling the data\ninto its component parts, and\n\n1285\n01:02:05,905 --> 01:02:08,015\ndeconstructing into data packets.\n\n1286\n01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:12,645\nUltimately packages, packets up, box\nthem up if you will, send them out over\n\n1287\n01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:16,555\nthe wire, and then when they get\nreceived on the other side somewhere,\n\n1288\n01:02:16,555 --> 01:02:18,090\nwherever that end point is.\n\n1289\n01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:22,260\nThe model exists at every IP\nendpoint anywhere in the world, so\n\n1290\n01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:27,494\nit's part of the TCP/IP protocol stack,\nand the concept of how the stack works.\n\n1291\n01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:31,010\nAnd so if we're using TCP/IP\nbased networking solutions,\n\n1292\n01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:34,190\nwhat we're gonna see is,\nwe're basically going to reconstruct\n\n1293\n01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:38,570\nthat packet on the fly,\nbuilding blocks are then added.\n\n1294\n01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:40,400\nPresentation is added back in.\n\n1295\n01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,850\nOverlay to create data\nthat's human interactive,\n\n1296\n01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:46,790\nas opposed to machine readable,\nwill be constructed on the other side, and\n\n1297\n01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:51,710\nshow up on the screen in some sort of nice\npretty picture, or whatever it may be.\n\n1298\n01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:53,550\nAnd so, a couple of key starting points.\n\n1299\n01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:56,940\nWe want to understand that the OSI\nmodel is a bidirectional model,\n\n1300\n01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:00,470\nit deals with data flow in two directions,\n\n1301\n01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:05,410\nso from a starting point to an end point,\nand everything in between is addressed.\n\n1302\n01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,560\nData in and data out, right?\n\n1303\n01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,310\nAnd so as a result of that,\n\n1304\n01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:12,910\nwe wanna understand that the OSI model\nexists everywhere a computer exists.\n\n1305\n01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:17,640\nAnywhere, any time, any place that we\nuse an end point that uses a computer\n\n1306\n01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,440\nas kind of its thought process.\n\n1307\n01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,020\nAn operating system is installed,\nthe device has the ability to manipulate\n\n1308\n01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:28,340\nnetwork traffic using protocols, TCP,\nIP being two of those protocols.\n\n1309\n01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:30,610\nWe will see the OSI model existing.\n\n1310\n01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:33,714\nI want you to understand this is\nnot unique to TCP and IP, right,\n\n1311\n01:03:33,714 --> 01:03:35,625\nso other protocol exist in this model.\n\n1312\n01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:39,972\nAny protocol you can think of: UDP,\nFTP, DNS, NTP, you name it,\n\n1313\n01:03:39,972 --> 01:03:44,628\nany of these functions,\nnetwork services, protocols, etcetera.,\n\n1314\n01:03:44,628 --> 01:03:48,625\nare gonna exist somewhere up in\none of the layers of the model.\n\n1315\n01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:52,840\nIP addresses are found here,\nMAC addresses are found here.\n\n1316\n01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:57,460\nSo all the things, all the component\nbuilding blocks of a networking solution\n\n1317\n01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:01,100\nand a computer solution that\nallows users to interact with and\n\n1318\n01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,490\nexchange data are part of this model.\n\n1319\n01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:07,960\nThis is a very broad,\nhigh level explanation of function, right.\n\n1320\n01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:12,710\nNow there is an interesting video that\nI often talk to my students about, and\n\n1321\n01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:13,320\nI use with them, and\n\n1322\n01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,440\nI tell them about which may be valuable\nto you just as kind of a framework,\n\n1323\n01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,980\na reference that you can use to go out and\nto put this all in perspective.\n\n1324\n01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,180\nAnd really does illustrate\nthe LSI model for\n\n1325\n01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:27,630\nus nicely the good warriors\nof the Dot net video.\n\n1326\n01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:31,070\nSo Don is just gonna bring that up for\nus really quickly and\n\n1327\n01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:34,310\ngive us a point of reference for\nURL for this.\n\n1328\n01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:36,420\nSo the good warriors of the net.\n\n1329\n01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:37,620\nWarriors of the dot net.\n\n1330\n01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:38,310\nYeah, that's the one.\n\n1331\n01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:39,710\nWe can go there.\n\n1332\n01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,220\nYou probably want to pause that.\n\n1333\n01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:42,470\nIt's like a 13 minute video.\n\n1334\n01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:43,900\nWe don't wanna play the whole thing.\n\n1335\n01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,745\n>> They're not very good warriors\nif they auto-play their damn video.\n\n1336\n01:04:46,745 --> 01:04:48,615\n[LAUGH]\n>> I didn't say they were very.\n\n1337\n01:04:48,615 --> 01:04:50,770\n[LAUGH]\n>> Not even gonna go there, all right?\n\n1338\n01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:53,490\nSo all right,\nwe are gonna put the URL in there for you.\n\n1339\n01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:57,160\nSo this is an animated\nshort that was shot by\n\n1340\n01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,838\nErikson Labs back probably\nabout 10 to 15 years ago now.\n\n1341\n01:05:00,838 --> 01:05:04,220\nAnd it's kinda cool because you use\nNetscape as the browser in there.\n\n1342\n01:05:04,220 --> 01:05:04,750\n>> Is it really?\n\n1343\n01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,430\n>> Yeah, it's actually pretty neat.\n\n1344\n01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:08,560\n>> I do notice these sparkles\nthat are following my mouse.\n\n1345\n01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:12,260\n>> Exactly, so if you never seen it,\nthis is directly off their website.\n\n1346\n01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:15,230\nIt's about ten years old now but\nyou can get this on YouTube and\n\n1347\n01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:16,070\na variety of places.\n\n1348\n01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:17,190\nIt's all over the place.\n\n1349\n01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:19,400\nSo, you should take a look at some point.\n\n1350\n01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,200\nIt is actually just a really\nneat way to kinda bring all\n\n1351\n01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,230\nthis discussion we're gonna\nhave with you together.\n\n1352\n01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:27,140\nSo we'll put the URL in there for\nyou obviously give them a little plug.\n\n1353\n01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:29,800\nRight, and just have you maybe go out and\ntake a look.\n\n1354\n01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,740\nIt'll work up and down the stack for you,\nshows the package being deconstructed,\n\n1355\n01:05:33,740 --> 01:05:37,300\nreconstructed, sent across the LAN\nout to the WAN through a firewall,\n\n1356\n01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,330\nall sorts of really good stuff.\n\n1357\n01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:40,770\nSo it's gonna be a great way to\nsummarize a lot of the conversation\n\n1358\n01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,310\nwe're having here.\n\n1359\n01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:42,300\nSo do take a look.\n\n1360\n01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:43,650\nAll right, so we have that.\n\n1361\n01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:47,060\nSo let's actually delve into\nthe OSI model at a high level.\n\n1362\n01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:50,800\nWe've got a graphic there we're just\ngonna zoom in on and fullscreen on.\n\n1363\n01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,510\nAnd what we're gonna\nsee that's pretty good.\n\n1364\n01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:56,230\nActually yeah, cuz we lose\nthe corner there at the bottom.\n\n1365\n01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:57,910\nThere we go.\nPerfect, all right.\n\n1366\n01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:00,505\nMinute finger based adjustments\nin real life time here.\n\n1367\n01:06:00,505 --> 01:06:02,540\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Modern of magical,\n\n1368\n01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:06,200\nor magical modern\ntechnology of presentation.\n\n1369\n01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,630\nSo we see a seven layer model and\nremember,\n\n1370\n01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:12,140\nsince the model is bi-directional\nWe can move up or down the stack.\n\n1371\n01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,970\nIt doesn't really matter\nwhat direction we go in.\n\n1372\n01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,210\nWe just have to understand\nwhat happens in each layer.\n\n1373\n01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:19,010\nSo we have a description column in\nthe middle we're gonna go through as\n\n1374\n01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:19,660\na summary.\n\n1375\n01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:23,740\nAnd then off the right we have a protocol\nfunction area that helps us to describe\n\n1376\n01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,690\nI have some of the things that\nmay occur there in realtime.\n\n1377\n01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:30,406\nWe do have to adjust that\nFTP is not portating.\n\n1378\n01:06:30,406 --> 01:06:34,530\nThat should be either HTTP or oops.\n\n1379\n01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:38,180\nWe will fix that really quickly,\nminor adjustment there in real time.\n\n1380\n01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:43,740\nJust notice that it has caught that really\nquickly, I didn't catch that before.\n\n1381\n01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:44,740\n>> There we go, very good.\n\n1382\n01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:45,650\n>> All right.\n\n1383\n01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:50,170\nSo now that's been fixed and so\nlet's just get back to where we were.\n\n1384\n01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:52,840\nSo what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna\nstart from the bottom of the model,\n\n1385\n01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,550\nat the physical layer work my way up.\n\n1386\n01:06:54,550 --> 01:06:57,580\nJust because that way we can kinda\nlook at what happens in each layer,\n\n1387\n01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:01,010\nunderstand how data packets\nare going to be reconstructed.\n\n1388\n01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:04,430\nWe can quickly run that in reverse,\ngoing the other way when we're done.\n\n1389\n01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:08,450\nSo at the physical layer, layer one,\nwe are gonna see that we are converting,\n\n1390\n01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:09,930\nas you can see to the right there,\n\n1391\n01:07:09,930 --> 01:07:13,160\nthe data into the format that's\nappropriate for the associated media.\n\n1392\n01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:14,470\nWhat do we mean in English?\n\n1393\n01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:17,600\nIn effect what we mean is,\nwe are connecting up to\n\n1394\n01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:21,830\nthe network interface of some kind, this\nis where physical connectivity happens and\n\n1395\n01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:24,090\nwe are sending packets out on the wire.\n\n1396\n01:07:24,090 --> 01:07:27,650\nThis is where, we proverbially say,\nthe rubber meets the road.\n\n1397\n01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:31,305\nThe interesting thing with the OSI model\nis, because it is a logical construct,\n\n1398\n01:07:31,305 --> 01:07:35,850\nthe framework of how we do construct and\ndeconstruct data and\n\n1399\n01:07:35,850 --> 01:07:39,520\nmove it through a system, it's hard to\npoint to one place in the computer and\n\n1400\n01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,420\nsay wow, this is where the OSI model is.\n\n1401\n01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:45,480\nIf I Look at the computer or the end-point\nholistically I can represent the OSI\n\n1402\n01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:49,410\nmodel and say, well yeah,\nin my laptop, all seven layers exist.\n\n1403\n01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:53,030\nBut, I would challenge someone to say,\nLayer five, at the session layer,\n\n1404\n01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:55,865\nis right here in this particular place.\n\n1405\n01:07:55,865 --> 01:07:58,645\nNow we can do that at layer seven\ncause we can point to the desktop and\n\n1406\n01:07:58,645 --> 01:08:00,415\nsay, well applications are running.\n\n1407\n01:08:00,415 --> 01:08:01,835\nWe can kinda look at the screen and\n\n1408\n01:08:01,835 --> 01:08:04,805\nsay, that's a representation\nof the application layer.\n\n1409\n01:08:04,805 --> 01:08:07,465\nI'm sending mail in a web browser so\nI can see that.\n\n1410\n01:08:07,465 --> 01:08:11,295\nBut as we get down into the other layers,\nwe can't really represent it.\n\n1411\n01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:15,525\nWe can capture network packets and look at\nthe protocol stack and look at that stuff\n\n1412\n01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:18,960\nand kind of represent it in different\nways but it's not quite the same.\n\n1413\n01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,710\nBut at layer one we can also point\nto the machine, typically for\n\n1414\n01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:25,280\ninstance, where the network\ninterconnection would be.\n\n1415\n01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:29,610\nWe can point to the physical place where\nwe plug power in, the video cable,\n\n1416\n01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:30,560\nthings like that.\n\n1417\n01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,650\nAll of that is gonna be the physical\nlayer connectivity, right.\n\n1418\n01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:37,720\nSo we can look at those things, but\nlayer one and layer seven as the endpoints\n\n1419\n01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:39,980\nare represented physically\nthe rest is logical.\n\n1420\n01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:43,460\nWe have to kind of close our eyes and\nimagine, so join me on this journey of\n\n1421\n01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:49,450\ndiscovery as we delve into the mysteries\nof the modern computing infrastructure.\n\n1422\n01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:53,100\nImagine if you will, kind of a cross\nbetween the Twilight Zone and\n\n1423\n01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,180\nCarl Sagan on a bad day right?\n\n1424\n01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:58,417\n>> Is there a Gremlin on the layer five,\nit's a [LAUGH].\n\n1425\n01:08:58,417 --> 01:09:02,330\n>> All right, it's Saturday morning guys,\nwe gotta have a little fun.\n\n1426\n01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:03,364\nAll right, so physical layer,\n\n1427\n01:09:03,364 --> 01:09:05,330\nlayer one is where we see\nphysical connectivity happening.\n\n1428\n01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:09,040\nNow remember, this could be a wireless\nnetwork card that we're sending data out\n\n1429\n01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,360\nacross, could be this USB dongle that\nwe talked about in a prior episode that\n\n1430\n01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:16,520\nDon uses on his laptop could\nbe a physical network cable.\n\n1431\n01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:20,340\nAn RJ45 copper cable, that we will\ntalk about in some future episodes,\n\n1432\n01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:21,220\nand plugs in here.\n\n1433\n01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:22,250\nCould even be a RJ11 right.\n\n1434\n01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:25,375\nA phone cable to a,\ndare I say the word, modem.\n\n1435\n01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,990\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That somebody may still be\n\n1436\n01:09:26,990 --> 01:09:27,950\nusing, right.\n\n1437\n01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:29,860\nThat's where we see physical connectivity.\n\n1438\n01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,240\nLayer two is when we move up the model.\n\n1439\n01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:36,330\nThe data link layer is going to be,\nwe don't represent it on this diagram, but\n\n1440\n01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:37,610\nI am going to share this with you.\n\n1441\n01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:39,450\nDon kinda has it implied here.\n\n1442\n01:09:39,450 --> 01:09:43,230\nBut there are two distinct sub layers\nthat exist at the data link layer.\n\n1443\n01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:46,520\nSo this is the only layer, by the way,\nwhere we see two sublayers, or\n\n1444\n01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:48,130\nany sublayers for that matter.\n\n1445\n01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:52,880\nSo we would always draw a parallel\ngoing at it at an angle on each side,\n\n1446\n01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,570\nwith a little landing strip or point,\n\n1447\n01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:58,720\nwith almost like one of these coming out\nto represent the two sublayers, right?\n\n1448\n01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:03,178\nAnd what we're gonna see is the LLC,\nthe logical link control sublayer.\n\n1449\n01:10:03,178 --> 01:10:06,580\nAnd we're gonna see what Don is hovering\nover, right there on the right which is\n\n1450\n01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:10,470\nthe MAC address sublayer existing\nwithin the Data Link layer.\n\n1451\n01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:12,930\nThe Logical Link sublayer is at the top.\n\n1452\n01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:15,930\nThe MAC address layer is at the bottom,\nas we just think through that.\n\n1453\n01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:19,160\nThe MAC address layer,\nsublayer MAC addresses and\n\n1454\n01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,060\nwhat the MAC address represents for us.\n\n1455\n01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:24,710\nMaybe, access control,\nis going to represent this\n\n1456\n01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:30,660\nhexadecimal unique identifier that\nis used to identify the physical\n\n1457\n01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:35,450\naddress that is burned\ninto the network card.\n\n1458\n01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:39,840\nVendor ID as well as unique\nendpoint ID will be there.\n\n1459\n01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,390\nAnd what we see with the MAC address is a\nway to uniquely identify the IP endpoint,\n\n1460\n01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:47,010\nthe interface being used for IP traffic.\n\n1461\n01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:52,020\nThe MAC address is going to represent this\nparticular machine, this endpoint for us.\n\n1462\n01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:55,440\nAnd then the logical link sublayer,\nthe LLC,\n\n1463\n01:10:55,440 --> 01:11:00,530\nis where we are seeing error control and\ncorrection applied to the data packets.\n\n1464\n01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:04,370\nIf we're building a packet up from\nthe ground up, we are applying

way out of the system.\n\n1467\n01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:12,280\nThis is the last place that\nwe check error control and\n\n1468\n01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:17,440\ncorrection, to make sure that the error\ncontrol was being applied properly,\n\n1469\n01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,540\nand we have no faults in the packet\nbefore we send it out on the wire.\n\n1470\n01:11:20,540 --> 01:11:24,542\nSo just want to make sure we see that,\nand we kinda understand that, and\n\n1471\n01:11:24,542 --> 01:11:29,212\nwe see what's going on there, with our two\nsub-layers LLC and the MAC sublayer and\n\n1472\n01:11:29,212 --> 01:11:30,279\nDon is gonna just,\n\n1473\n01:11:30,279 --> 01:11:34,038\nI think, try to fix that up and\njust represent that for us, right.\n\n1474\n01:11:34,038 --> 01:11:36,410\nOur Svengali of Visio as we see here.\n\n1475\n01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:38,417\nHe's the mad scientist creating as we go.\n\n1476\n01:11:38,417 --> 01:11:41,399\nSo, this is great actually because\nnow we're able to represent that, so\n\n1477\n01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:43,917\nthat's very, very valuable to have and\njust see that there.\n\n1478\n01:11:43,917 --> 01:11:45,333\nAll right, so we have our two sublayers.\n\n1479\n01:11:45,333 --> 01:11:46,417\n>> We aim to please.\n\n1480\n01:11:46,417 --> 01:11:47,625\n>> We do, we do.\n\n1481\n01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:48,833\nWe have our two sublayers.\n\n1482\n01:11:48,833 --> 01:11:52,458\nNow I could, Could we solicit color\nrequests in real time from our.\n\n1483\n01:11:52,458 --> 01:11:54,051\n>> Sure.\n>> Our studio audience, and have them.\n\n1484\n01:11:54,051 --> 01:11:55,942\n[CROSSTALK] Have them mix and match there.\n\n1485\n01:11:55,942 --> 01:11:57,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We threw a little interior design in\n\n1486\n01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:59,350\nreal time, while we're doing this.\n\n1487\n01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:01,430\nAll right, so you could see\nthe other two sub-layers there.\n\n1488\n01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:02,580\nWe have our network layers.\n\n1489\n01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:03,150\nWe move up.\n\n1490\n01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:07,700\nLayer three, our Network layer,\nis gonna allow us to be able\n\n1491\n01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:12,490\nto start working with the structure\nof the data packet, right,\n\n1492\n01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:14,450\nthe headers specifically\nof the data packet.\n\n1493\n01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:18,850\nAnd where we're gonna be applying our\nIP address, in particular IPv4, and or\n\n1494\n01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:21,110\nIPv6, as you can see off the the right.\n\n1495\n01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:21,980\nAn oldie but a goodie.\n\n1496\n01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:24,890\nIP PX, which we don't\ntraditionally see much anymore.\n\n1497\n01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:28,970\nNovell protocol that was used on their\nnetworks, proprietary to their networks,\n\n1498\n01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,810\nbut we do see IP based\naddressing at layer three.\n\n1499\n01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:33,750\nSo layer three connectivity devices,\n\n1500\n01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:37,970\nhardware devices that we manage,\nwould be using a manipulating IP address.\n\n1501\n01:12:37,970 --> 01:12:41,385\nSo we would see routers existing\nat layer three of the OSI model,\n\n1502\n01:12:41,385 --> 01:12:44,530\ncuz they are gonna use IP\naddresses in their routing tables.\n\n1503\n01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:48,510\nAt layer 2, we would see MAC\naddress-based manipulation of data, so\n\n1504\n01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:50,770\nwe would see devices\nthat use MAC addresses.\n\n1505\n01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:52,300\nThose would be bridges for instance,\n\n1506\n01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:55,120\nthat create their routing\ntables based on a MAC address.\n\n1507\n01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,430\nAt layer one, we would see physical\nconnectivity devices, like we said.\n\n1508\n01:12:58,430 --> 01:13:01,700\nSo a smart device not really, right?\n\n1509\n01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:05,220\nA dumb device like a hub,\nwould exist in layer one of the OSI model,\n\n1510\n01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:06,490\nif we still saw those.\n\n1511\n01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:10,260\nBut a switch, which is somewhat of a smart\ndevice, smarter than a hub, right?\n\n1512\n01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,930\nSmarter than the average bear, right?\n\n1513\n01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:14,630\nSmarter than a hub,\nwould exist at layer two traditionally.\n\n1514\n01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:18,020\nWe see switches defined typically,\nas layer two devices.\n\n1515\n01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,920\nBut we certainly have\nlayer three switches, and\n\n1516\n01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:23,120\nso we can see them operating at\ndifferent levels of the OSI model.\n\n1517\n01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,680\nAs we get further up the stack,\ninto the core switching and\n\n1518\n01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,410\nrouting infrastructure of\nthe core internet globally,\n\n1519\n01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:32,490\nyou see switches that can go up to\nhigher levels of the OSI model.\n\n1520\n01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:33,450\nThey're very expensive.\n\n1521\n01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:36,520\nYou tend to add a zero as you go\nup a layer, if not more zeros.\n\n1522\n01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:39,950\nSo some of these really high level\ncore switches, that really build and\n\n1523\n01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:43,640\ndrive the internet globally,\nare gonna be million dollar plus devices,\n\n1524\n01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:46,950\nthat are sitting int he ISPs and\ndata centers around the world,\n\n1525\n01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:50,520\nthat are routing billions of data packets,\nyou know, simultaneously.\n\n1526\n01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,760\nAnd moving them and switching them, across\nfiber networks, and things like that.\n\n1527\n01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,270\nSo, more to come on that in Cisco, right?\n\n1528\n01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:57,830\n>> Yeah.\n>> At the much higher end later.\n\n1529\n01:13:57,830 --> 01:14:00,390\nBut if you've never seen some of\nthose high-level switches, go out and\n\n1530\n01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:01,110\nGoogle for them.\n\n1531\n01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:02,870\nThey're actually pretty\ninteresting to look at.\n\n1532\n01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:05,580\nCisco has pictures of some of\ntheir core switching gear, and\n\n1533\n01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:06,470\nrouting gear out there.\n\n1534\n01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:09,540\nIt's kinda interesting just to imagine,\nwhat if I had that running in my room?\n\n1535\n01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:11,670\nWhat kind of cooling I would need,\nwhat kind of power, right?\n\n1536\n01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:12,609\n>> AC would be a big concern, right?\n\n1537\n01:14:12,609 --> 01:14:13,690\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, you'd have to live in\n\n1538\n01:14:13,690 --> 01:14:15,870\nthe Polar North,\nto be able to run those things.\n\n1539\n01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:17,570\nSo that's layer three.\n\n1540\n01:14:17,570 --> 01:14:19,560\nThat's where we see IP Address coming in.\n\n1541\n01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:23,500\nSo configuration of the packet,\nreally understanding the IP Address, and\n\n1542\n01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,400\nbeing put in.\n\n1543\n01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,420\nLayer four, transport layer.\n\n1544\n01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,350\nTransport layer is where we segment\ntraffic, as you can see there, for\n\n1545\n01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:33,000\nreliable, best effort, or\ntransmission between systems.\n\n1546\n01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,910\nSo we'll see off to the right there,\nTCP or UDP or SPX,\n\n1547\n01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:41,700\nthe partner to IPX, and\nthe Novell proprietary networking stack.\n\n1548\n01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,380\nSo TCP connection oriented.\n\n1549\n01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:45,680\nUDP connection less.\n\n1550\n01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,000\nSend and receive, versus send and\n\n1551\n01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,390\nforget, TCP associated with that\ntraditional three-way handshake, right?\n\n1552\n01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:54,420\nSo if we do the three-way handshake,\nDon and I practiced this before.\n\n1553\n01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,730\nWe actually got going today for our thing.\n\n1554\n01:14:56,730 --> 01:14:57,400\nAre you ready?\nThis is.\n\n1555\n01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,120\n>> It's our secret handshake.\n\n1556\n01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,100\n>> This was a bit of a challenge,\n\n1557\n01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:02,130\nwe weren't quite clear on whether we\ncould do this or not, live on TV.\n\n1558\n01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:05,910\nBut, because we like you, right,\ncuz you people are nice people.\n\n1559\n01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:08,125\nWe're gonna try this live,\nwithout a safety net.\n\n1560\n01:15:08,125 --> 01:15:08,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Okay, so\n\n1561\n01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:12,270\nwe're gonna try to reproduce\nthe three-way handshake here live, right.\n\n1562\n01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:15,025\nWithout knocking over the coffee,\nas Don moves it out of the way.\n\n1563\n01:15:15,025 -->

We talk about this idea of\n\n1566\n01:15:21,460 --> 01:15:22,534\nacknowledging, right?\n\n1567\n01:15:22,534 --> 01:15:23,730\nMm-hm.\nSay hello.\n\n1568\n01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:24,760\nSo hello.\n\n1569\n01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:25,700\nHi.\nNice to meet you.\n\n1570\n01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:26,735\nPleasure to meet you.\n\n1571\n01:15:26,735 --> 01:15:28,460\nSo this is the first hand shake.\n\n1572\n01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:31,210\n[LAUGH]\n>> This is the TCP synchronization,\n\n1573\n01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:31,800\nas we call it.\n\n1574\n01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,680\nWe'll call the syn, s-y-n for\nsynchronize, right?\n\n1575\n01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:35,620\nSo we've done that, right.\n\n1576\n01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:38,550\nSo, this is gonna be the SYN,\nright there, right.\n\n1577\n01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:41,510\nNow what we have to do, is we have\nto have another synchronization.\n\n1578\n01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:43,340\nBecause this is me saying hello to Don.\n\n1579\n01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:46,620\nSo, this is Adam and Don saying hello,\nbut this is Adam to Don.\n\n1580\n01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,665\nNow what about Don coming back to me?\n\n1581\n01:15:48,665 --> 01:15:50,565\n>> And then I say, hi, nice to meet you.\n\n1582\n01:15:50,565 --> 01:15:51,905\n>> Okay, so now we have what?\n\n1583\n01:15:51,905 --> 01:15:53,355\n>> That's the SYN-ACK, I acknowledge.\n\n1584\n01:15:53,355 --> 01:15:55,165\n>> Right, so\nwe have another SYN though, right?\n\n1585\n01:15:55,165 --> 01:15:56,795\nSo we have another SYN, right?\n\n1586\n01:15:56,795 --> 01:15:58,175\nAnd an ACK, so we need another handshake,\n\n1587\n01:15:58,175 --> 01:15:59,982\nwe need another handshake\ngoing the other way, right?\n\n1588\n01:15:59,982 --> 01:16:02,852\nSo now what we have, iswe have\naffectively Don's a little nervous here,\n\n1589\n01:16:02,852 --> 01:16:04,822\nhe's never done this in person before.\n\n1590\n01:16:04,822 --> 01:16:07,943\n>> I am.\nMy personal space is being intruded on.\n\n1591\n01:16:07,943 --> 01:16:08,716\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n1592\n01:16:08,716 --> 01:16:11,315\nBut we have two sims right out there,\nbut we only have one ac.\n\n1593\n01:16:11,315 --> 01:16:13,110\nSo who's responsible for the ACK?\n\n1594\n01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,040\nWell, this would be your's now.\n\n1595\n01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:14,770\n>> This would be mine, right.\n\n1596\n01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:18,380\nSo I have to come back and acknowledge\nDon for having said hello to me.\n\n1597\n01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:22,920\nSo the way that the three way TCP\nhandshake works, is we do a send, so\n\n1598\n01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:28,030\nwe send a hello, we get back a hello,\nalong with an acknowledgement of my hello.\n\n1599\n01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,400\nAnd then I have to acknowledge\nthe hello that I just got.\n\n1600\n01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:34,137\nSo we get Syn, Syn Ac, Ac.\n\n1601\n01:16:34,137 --> 01:16:36,084\nRight, and\nthis is the three way hand shake, and so\n\n1602\n01:16:36,084 --> 01:16:38,093\nwhen we seeing this happening,\ngood job by the way.\n\n1603\n01:16:38,093 --> 01:16:41,170\n>> Hey, hey excellent work.\n\n1604\n01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:43,020\n>> So\nwhen we see this happening in real time,\n\n1605\n01:16:43,020 -->

--> 01:16:56,540\nIf it was UDP, what would you see?\n\n1611\n01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:57,140\nRight?\n\n1612\n01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:00,910\nHey Don, here you go, I'm going to\nsend you some data in real time.\n\n1613\n01:17:00,910 --> 01:17:01,960\nDid Don get it?\n\n1614\n01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,880\nI don't know.\nDid Don tell me he's there?\n\n1615\n01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:04,640\nI don't know.\n\n1616\n01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,770\nRight?\nWe have no way of knowing.\n\n1617\n01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:06,550\nI don't know.\n\n1618\n01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:07,900\nNow, if Don doesn't get it,\n\n1619\n01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:10,500\ndoes Don even realize that he\nwas supposed to get something?\n\n1620\n01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,585\nAnd does Don have any words to

right?\n\n1627\n01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:27,665\nWe don't acknowledge,\nwe don't do this kind of check.\n\n1628\n01:17:27,665 --> 01:17:30,035\nSo if I send the data over there,\nand I'm streaming it,\n\n1629\n01:17:30,035 --> 01:17:32,405\nI have no way of knowing whether\nit got there or not, right?\n\n1630\n01:17:32,405 --> 01:17:34,535\nSo this is the key difference\nhere between TCP and\n\n1631\n01:17:34,535 --> 01:17:36,715\nUDP, that we want to make\nsure you're aware of.\n\n1632\n01:17:36,715 --> 01:17:40,085\nSo understand that's happened at\nthe transport layer, layer four.\n\n1633\n01:17:40,085 --> 01:17:41,465\nNow layer five is an interesting layer,\n\n1634\n01:17:41,465 --> 01:17:44,320\nbecause layer five is the session layer,\nright?\n\n1635\n01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,400\n>> Is going to be often misrepresented,\nright?\n\n1636\n01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,550\nWhen I read a lot of documentation\nabout the session layer,\n\n1637\n01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:54,570\nI see things that unfortunately sometimes,\nnot that they set out to be inaccurate.\n\n1638\n01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:56,860\nBut just don't really give\nthe complete picture, and\n\n1639\n01:17:56,860 --> 01:17:59,480\nthe true understanding of what does and\ndoesn't happen here.\n\n1640\n01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:00,860\nAnd Don used some great language here,\n\n1641\n01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:04,940\nwhen he said in the description area,\nestablishes a logical connection, right?\n\n1642\n01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:09,020\nLet's underline logical connection there,\nbecause that's really the critical piece,\n\n1643\n01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:11,040\nthe lynchpin of this description.\n\n1644\n01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:14,630\nWhich is that we are reaching out and\nestablishing the boundary, the border, or\n\n1645\n01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:18,300\nthe box, if you will,\nof how this network exchange\n\n1646\n01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:22,090\nis going to occur as we manipulate\ndata up and down the stack.\n\n1647\n01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:25,090\n>> But we are not creating\nthe physical connection\n\n1648\n01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:26,605\nthat actually allows us to do this.\n\n1649\n01:18:26,605 --> 01:18:30,760\nSo what you often see not\nquite explained clearly.\n\n1650\n01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,280\nI hesitate to say misrepresent it,\n\n1651\n01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:34,890\nbecause I don't really think that\nanybody sets out to misrepresent it.\n\n1652\n01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:37,440\nBut I think that it's\nnot clearly explained,\n\n1653\n01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:42,340\nis that the session layer is about\nlogical construction of the box.\n\n1654\n01:18:42,340 --> 01:18:45,210\nNot about the physical linkage that\nactually allows us to send and\n\n1655\n01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:46,070\nreceive data.\n\n1656\n01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:49,980\nIt's about the rules that will govern\nhow that data exchange will take place,\n\n1657\n01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:52,790\nonce it is created down\nat the physical layer.\n\n1658\n01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:55,850\nAnd so, understand that this is\nabout the logical connection.\n\n1659\n01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:58,830\nBut when we say logical there,\nwe use the word connection,\n\n1660\n01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:01,820\nwe almost imply we're creating\nthat connection to layer five.\n\n1661\n01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,040\nAnd so people tend to get confused.\n\n1662\n01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,700\nWell, what we want to understand\nis we're not creating that\n\n1663\n01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:06,860\nconnection out right now.\n\n1664\n01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:10,110\nWe're structuring it, so that when we do\ncreate it down to the physical layer,\n\n1665\n01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:12,590\nwe understand how to manipulate it,\nmonitor it, and run it.\n\n1666\n01:19:12,590 --> 01:19:17,390\nAnd so what we see here at the session\nlayer, are all these protocols\n\n1667\n01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:21,530\nthat are used to govern the connection,\nto set it up to structure it.\n\n1668\n01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:23,400\nProtocols are like languages.\n\n1669\n01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,710\nThey are the operating system\ninstructions, for how we send and\n\n1670\n01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:27,760\nreceive data.\n\n1671\n01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:32,500\nSo they structure the discussion,\nthe conversation around data, and\n\n1672\n01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,860\nas a result are going to be giving\nus the instructions we need,\n\n1673\n01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:37,410\nto be able to understand how to send and\nreceive data.\n\n1674\n01:19:37,410 --> 01:19:39,750\nBut they don't actually send\na receive on their own,\n\n1675\n01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:42,042\nthey need help from the lower\nlevel of the OSI model.\n\n1676\n01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:44,276\nSo, I want to make sure we're clear there.\n\n1677\n01:19:44,276 --> 01:19:45,375\nYes, layer six.\n\n1678\n01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:47,583\nThe layer that screams at you in red.\n\n1679\n01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:50,583\nBurns my eyes whenever I\ntake a look at that color.\n\n1680\n01:19:50,583 --> 01:19:51,750\nIt is a bright red.\n\n1681\n01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,933\n>> And I apparently don't know how to\nspell responsible, it's resonsable.\n\n1682\n01:19:54,933 --> 01:19:58,270\n>> Yes, but we're going to not even\nworry about that for a second.\n\n1683\n01:19:58,270 --> 01:20:01,315\nSpell check that really quickly,\nDon's going to fix that for us.\n\n1684\n01:20:01,315 --> 01:20:01,835\n>> There we go.\n\n1685\n01:20:01,835 --> 01:20:04,675\n>> All right so Layer 6,\nPresentation Layer.\n\n1686\n01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:08,759\nRight, so the presentation layer\nis where we are formatting and\n\n1687\n01:20:08,759 --> 01:20:13,305\ntranslating machine readable data\ninto human readable data, right.\n\n1688\n01:20:13,305 --> 01:20:16,655\nNot binary to dot decimal\nthe way we talked about\n\n1689\n01:20:16,655 --> 01:20:19,845\nin our prior discussions on subnetting,\nalthough that is one form of that, but\n\n1690\n01:20:19,845 --> 01:20:23,620\nreally more adding in all\nthe pretty bells and whistles.\n\n1691\n01:20:23,620 --> 01:20:27,070\nThe smiley, happy dancing unicorns and\nthe pretty stars, right.\n\n1692\n01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:31,180\nThat allow us to be able to\nsee data in a way that for us,\n\n1693\n01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:35,010\non a screen as a human using a piece\nof software, makes sense to us.\n\n1694\n01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:36,960\nNot the way the machine sees the data.\n\n1695\n01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:38,892\nWhich is a stream of bits of ones and\n\n1696\n01:20:38,892 --> 01:20:43,303\nzeros that are linked together logically\nbut don't have a physical overlay.\n\n1697\n01:20:43,303 --> 01:20:47,556\nSo in effect, think about the fact\nthat this is like going from looking\n\n1698\n01:20:47,556 --> 01:20:51,953\nat the matrix right, to being able to\nactually see the lady in red right,\n\n1699\n01:20:51,953 --> 01:20:54,210\nthat whole thing inside the matrix.\n\n1700\n01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:56,620\nGotta work that whole Lady\nin Red reference in there,\n\n1701\n01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:59,420\nsince it's the red layer of the OSI model.\n\n1702\n01:20:59,420 --> 01:21:02,263\nThere is no distinction,\nno method or madness by the way,\n\n1703\n01:21:02,263 --> 01:21:04,943\nto Don's color choice for\nthe layers of the OSI model.\n\n1704\n01:21:04,943 --> 01:21:08,296\nThere is no significance, other than the\nfact that Don had a blue period and a red\n\n1705\n01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:11,867\nperiod, and then he got a little happier\nwhen he went into the green period, right.\n\n1706\n01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,815\n>> And I have no taste.\n\n1707\n01:21:13,815 --> 01:21:14,820\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n1708\n01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:19,775\nSo, the red layer here, layer 6,\nyou'll see extensions are protocol\n\n1709\n01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:24,095\nfunctions .doc, maybe docx,\njpeg, gif, xls, wri, etc.\n\n1710\n01:21:24,095 --> 01:21:25,460\nEtc is my most favorite one.\n\n1711\n01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:26,960\nI love the etc extension.\n\n1712\n01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:27,680\nIt's so versatile.\n\n1713\n01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:29,050\nYou can do almost anything with it, right?\n\n1714\n01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:29,980\n>> You don't know.\nIt's a mystery.\n\n1715\n01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:31,970\n>> It's anything you want it to be.\n\n1716\n01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:33,890\n>> So pdf would be here, right.\n\n1717\n01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,680\nAny of those things we can think of.\n\n1718\n01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:39,110\nThis is where we add in all\nthe window dressing, right?\n\n1719\n01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:42,040\nSometimes I think of a Star Trek\nreference here when I teach this and\n\n1720\n01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,440\nI talk to my students about this, and\n\n1721\n01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,280\nI think of the presentation layer\nas being like old school Star Trek.\n\n1722\n01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:49,120\n>> Gotta go way back,\ndeep into the vaults on this right.\n\n1723\n01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:52,950\nKirk, is Captain James T Kirk,\nis gonna be William Shatner.\n\n1724\n01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,220\nRight Leonard Nimoy for Spock.\n\n1725\n01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:55,330\nOriginal Star Trek.\n\n1726\n01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:56,630\nUniversal translator.\n\n1727\n01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:57,170\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1728\n01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:58,310\n>> So, the Gorn episode,\n\n1729\n01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:59,270\nwhere they're on the planet,\n\n1730\n01:21:59,270 --> 01:22:02,120\nwith the lizard creature.\nAnd they gotta us the universal translator\n\n1731\n01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:04,640\nto talk to the Gorn before\nKirk blows them up.\n\n1732\n01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,610\nShoots them with the rock salt or\nwhatever it was.\n\n1733\n01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:09,350\nSo that universal translator\nwas basically a karaoke mic\n\n1734\n01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,750\nwhen you look at the special\neffects that they were using right.\n\n1735\n01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:14,930\nBut the universal translation concept is\nwhat I often think about when I think\n\n1736\n01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:19,610\nabout the presentation layer so for those\nof you that are trekkies out there right,\n\n1737\n01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:23,050\nawesome, we worked it in there,\nwe got an old school Star Trek thing.\n\n1738\n01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:26,420\nSo that's the universal translation layer,\nthat's what presentation is.\n\n1739\n01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:27,370\nThen application layer,\n\n1740\n01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:30,640\nlayer 7 up at the top there,\nthis is the human interface, right.\n\n1741\n01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,650\nThis is where we're sitting\nin front of the computer.\n\n1742\n01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:34,290\nWe've got software running.\n\n1743\n01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:36,380\nIt's doing the presentation for us.\n\n1744\n01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:39,100\nSo whatever our data is it's\nshowing up on the screen.\n\n1745\n01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:43,450\nSo you can see Don put things in there\nlike an email client, a web browser so\n\n1746\n01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:45,155\nthat could be Google Chrome.\n\n1747\n01:22:45,155 --> 01:22:49,100\nRight, could be Mozilla Firefox browser,\nmaybe IE right.\n\n1748\n01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:51,270\nCould be anything doesn't really matter,\ndon't wanna leave out Apple,\n\n1749\n01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:55,240\nit could be Safari, but we don't want\nthem to have an inferiority complex.\n\n1750\n01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:59,550\nAny of those, sometimes it doesn't really\nmatter what, all that stuff, all the data\n\n1751\n01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:03,040\non there, the pretty pictures,\nthe point and click, the GUI interface.\n\n1752\n01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,420\nThat all comes from the application layer,\n\n1753\n01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:07,880\nthat's what we see there, so\nas we build the OSI model together.\n\n1754\n01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:11,640\nWe're talking about taking all of these\ndifferent parts and literally laying them\n\n1755\n01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:15,375\nin and layering them to create\na complete picture, a complete whole.\n\n1756\n01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:17,710\nI often think years and years and\nyears ago when I was a student,\n\n1757\n01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:18,955\nI was young, right.\n\n1758\n01:23:18,955 --> 01:23:21,080\n[COUGH] Back when I was small.\n\n1759\n01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:22,350\nAnd I had hair, right.\n\n1760\n01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:25,541\nSo back in the day,\nyou remember transparencies?\n\n1761\n01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:26,818\nYou remember that technology?\n\n1762\n01:23:26,818 --> 01:23:27,624\n[CROSSTALK] Overhead projectors.\n>> Overhead projectors, right?\n\n1763\n01:23:27,624 --> 01:23:32,463\nAgain, your old technology, you don't\nreally see that much anymore today,\n\n1764\n01:23:32,463 --> 01:23:34,150\nthrough the modern magic,\n\n1765\n01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:38,354\nI'm having trouble with that\nphrase of presentation technology.\n\n1766\n01:23:38,354 --> 01:23:39,710\nWe've really gotten\naway from those things.\n\n1767\n01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:44,100\nBut back in the day you would use\ntransparencies on an overhead projector.\n\n1768\n01:23:44,100 --> 01:23:46,610\nYou would write on them much like\nyou would do a whiteboard today, and\n\n1769\n01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:48,470\nsince they were translucent,\n\n1770\n01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:52,970\nyou could actually create layered pictures\nof all these things and build on them.\n\n1771\n01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:54,551\nSo I often think about the OSI Mmdel,\n\n1772\n01:23:54,551 --> 01:23:57,820\nalmost like a set of transparencies\nbeing laid one on top of the other.\n\n1773\n01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:59,310\nSo that you can effectively build this but\n\n1774\n01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:03,160\nalso deconstruct it as we go because\nremember, it's by direction, right.\n\n1775\n01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:06,960\nAnd so when we think about the OSI model\nwe want to make sure we understand this.\n\n1776\n01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,310\nNow, a couple of things for you out\nthere to think about as well which is\n\n1777\n01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:13,475\nhow do I remember what happens\nat all seven layers, right?\n\n1778\n01:24:13,475 --> 01:24:15,605\nWe have these things\nthat we call mnemonics.\n\n1779\n01:24:15,605 --> 01:24:16,325\nMemory aids.\n\n1780\n01:24:16,325 --> 01:24:19,395\nMemory devices that help\nus remember things.\n\n1781\n01:24:19,395 --> 01:24:24,625\nI shared mine with you guys when we\ndid the SSCP shows for the OSI model.\n\n1782\n01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:28,975\nWe discussed that there's well, Mike I\nthink was my cohost for that show, and\n\n1783\n01:24:28,975 --> 01:24:30,185\nso Mike shared his.\n\n1784\n01:24:30,185 --> 01:24:32,525\nHe had a couple of pithy ones\nthat he threw out there.\n\n1785\n01:24:32,525 --> 01:24:34,500\nI'll share mine with you again.\n\n1786\n01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:36,250\nAnd Don may have one\nhe wants to throw out.\n\n1787\n01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:38,660\nHe's rearing up, so\nI think he might have one or two.\n\n1788\n01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:40,030\nBut I'll throw mine out here.\n\n1789\n01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:41,940\nThere's many of them out here for you.\n\n1790\n01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:42,490\nThe goal is for\n\n1791\n01:24:42,490 --> 01:24:44,940\nyou to just come up with some way\nto understand the layers in order.\n\n1792\n01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:46,450\nYou have to know them in order.\n\n1793\n01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:48,520\nWhether it's top to bottom, bottom to top.\n\n1794\n01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:49,720\nIt doesn't matter how.\n\n1795\n01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,740\nBut you have to ascribe the right\nfunctionality to the right layer.\n\n1796\n01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:55,850\nAnd you must know them in order in order\nto be able to understand the model.\n\n1797\n01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:59,850\nSo for me, child of the 80's,\nI grew up in the 80's.\n\n1798\n01:24:59,850 --> 01:25:05,720\nSo for me, I start at the bottom and\nstarting with the physical layer,\n\n1799\n01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:09,640\npeople don't need to see Paula Abdul.\n\n1800\n01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:12,990\nPaula I love you, I apologize,\nyou're a great woman.\n\n1801\n01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:16,590\nLove the music, love the videos but\nit is what it is.\n\n1802\n01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:18,552\nFor me physical is for p so\n\n1803\n01:25:18,552 --> 01:25:23,892\npeople don't need to need to see\nPaula Abdul is my memory mnemonic.\n\n1804\n01:25:23,892 --> 01:25:25,160\nWorks for me.\n\n1805\n01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:27,379\nYou may have one you want to share\nwith the audience, I don't know.\n\n1806\n01:25:27,379 --> 01:25:30,150\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Put you on the spot there.\n\n1807\n01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:31,112\n>> There's one I learned,\nthere's one I use.\n\n1808\n01:25:31,112 --> 01:25:31,842\n>> [CROSSTALK] Oh, okay.\n\n1809\n01:25:31,842 --> 01:25:33,380\nThere's always the clean and\nthe dirty one.\n\n1810\n01:25:33,380 --> 01:25:34,170\n>> That's exactly it.\n\n1811\n01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:37,080\nThe one I use is actually a little\nvulgar cuz I find that I remember those\n\n1812\n01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,510\nthings better so I won't share that one.\n\n1813\n01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:40,157\nBut the way I learned it\nwas actually top to bottom.\n\n1814\n01:25:40,157 --> 01:25:40,930\n>> Okay.\n\n1815\n01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:44,350\n>> And it was\nAll People Seem To Need Data Processing.\n\n1816\n01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:46,500\n>> All right, so that's another one,\npretty common right?\n\n1817\n01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:50,900\nOr All People Seem To Need\n[COUGH] Data Processing.\n\n1818\n01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,320\nThere's one out there with Pizza.\n\n1819\n01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:53,560\nThere's a few out there with Pizza and\n\n1820\n01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:57,070\ndifferent things like\nNeed Pepperoni Pizza or things like that.\n\n1821\n01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:59,530\nThere's all sorts of different ones\nthat you may want to come up with.\n\n1822\n01:25:59,530 --> 01:26:01,600\nCome up with something, whatever it is.\n\n1823\n01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:06,510\nDefinitely zone in on, zero in on this\nidea of understanding the session layer,\n\n1824\n01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:09,170\ntransport layer,\nnetwork layer, what's going on.\n\n1825\n01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:10,840\nUnderstand the functionality.\n\n1826\n01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:15,850\nUnderstand some of the things we've\nascribed to it in terms of protocol and\n\n1827\n01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:17,910\nfunctionality and hardware right?\n\n1828\n01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:21,430\nWhere does a router fall, where does\na bridge fall, where does a switch fall?\n\n1829\n01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:22,271\nThat kind of thing.\n\n1830\n01:26:22,271 --> 01:26:26,455\nAnd know the layers, know the model\nlayers in order, know what they are,\n\n1831\n01:26:26,455 --> 01:26:27,754\nvery important here.\n\n1832\n01:26:27,754 --> 01:26:31,200\nAll right, so I think we've gone through,\ncreated a good building block,\n\n1833\n01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:35,100\na good foundational element\nhere in our OSI model\n\n1834\n01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:37,400\nepisode to really help you\nto better understand this.\n\n1835\n01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,880\nHopefully it was valuable to you.\n\n1836\n01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:39,980\nI know we have the chart.\n\n1837\n01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:42,990\nI guess we're gonna,\nobviously try to make sure that's in here.\n\n1838\n01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:44,590\nBut are we making that graphic available?\n\n1839\n01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:45,792\nIs that something we were-\n>> We certainly can.\n\n1840\n01:26:45,792 --> 01:26:46,923\n>> [CROSSTALK] Okay.\n\n1841\n01:26:46,923 --> 01:26:49,861\n>> It's in the episode, but we can\nembed that as an image on the page too.\n\n1842\n01:26:49,861 --> 01:26:50,649\n>> [CROSSTALK] Maybe just have it there..\n\n1843\n01:26:50,649 --> 01:26:52,520\nSo that way you guys have a reference for\nit.\n\n1844\n01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,910\nIt's all over the internet,\nit's not like you can't find one.\n\n1845\n01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,320\nBut the one Don made was special.\n\n1846\n01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,630\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I'm gonna have him sign a copy for\n\n1847\n01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,840\nme and make sure I can take it away.\n\n1848\n01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:01,560\n>> There we go.\n\n1849\n01:27:01,560 --> 01:27:03,600\n>> But we do want to have that and\nmake sure you're aware of that.\n\n1850\n01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,140\nSo we've gone through another\nhopefully good episode with you.\n\n1851\n01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:07,510\nHopefully this is valuable.\n\n1852\n01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:10,270\nWe're gonna come back after\nwe get done with a new show.\n\n1853\n01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:11,990\nTalk some more about network and security.\n\n1854\n01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:14,710\nAnd delve into some of the other\nareas that are gonna be\n\n1855\n01:27:14,710 --> 01:27:18,365\ncontinuing to build out this educational\nmodel for us of this material.\n\n1856\n01:27:18,365 --> 01:27:21,485\nThings like all the services,\nthe protocols, the ports, and\n\n1857\n01:27:21,485 --> 01:27:23,685\nall the associated things that\ngo into the networking model.\n\n1858\n01:27:24,775 --> 01:27:26,135\n>> All right, well let's wrap it

right, welcome everybody\nto another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:40,161\nI'm your host, Mike Roderick, and\nwith me today is Mr Adam Gordon.\n\n6\n00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:41,340\nHow are you doing Adam?\n\n7\n00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,920\nI'm good.\nHow's everybody doing?\n\n8\n00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,800\nHopefully doing as good as we are.\n\n9\n00:00:44,800

00:00:49,290\nWhat else?\n\n13\n00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,350\nIf you guys are watching this live.\n\n14\n00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,200\nWhat better to be doing than\nspending my time with Mr.\n\n15\n00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,646\nAdam Gordon, talking about\ntelecommunication and network security.\n\n16\n00:00:57,646 --> 00:00:59,582\nWoo hoo, yay!\n\n17\n00:00:59,582 --> 00:01:03,660\n[LAUGH] All right, so\nguys hope you enjoy it.\n\n18\n00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,230\nLet's get right into it.\n\n19\n00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,460\nAbsolutely.\nSo we're gonna spend a little time this\n\n20\n00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,470\ndiscussion talking about a lot of the\nadditional elements that we start bringing\n\n21\n00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,340\ninto the picture here to build up\nour knowledge about networks and\n\n22\n00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,230\nabout how we secure them,\nwe'll find some ports for you,\n\n23\n00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,690\ntell you what some of the ports\nare you need to be aware of.\n\n24\n00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,630\nAnd we'll walk through and deal with some\nprotocols and things associated with them.\n\n25\n00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,890\nSo, I know we put together a nice list\nof things we want to run through.\n\n26\n00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,670\nWe'll start off with port numbers.\n\n27\n00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,170\nPorts are very important because in\nour networking staff and our TCP,\n\n28\n00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,750\nIP networking staff, we define, when I\nsay we I mean the operating system that\n\n29\n00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,210\nimplemented Stack defines 65,535\nports that are virtually available.\n\n30\n00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,088\nMeaning we don't see them physically\non the back of the machine,right?\n\n31\n00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:53,455\nInstead we logically are able to see\nthem being available and assigned for\n\n32\n00:01:53,455 --> 00:01:57,964\nuse based on breaking down that big block\nof the full port ridge number we've\n\n33\n00:01:57,964 --> 00:02:01,920\ndefined there into three sub\ngroupings that are then associated.\n\n34\n00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,290\nAnd so we define them there for you.\n\n35\n00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,180\nThe first 1,023 ports what we\nrefer to as the well known ports.\n\n36\n00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,520\nWell known ports are going to be\ndefined as ports that are used\n\n37\n00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,860\nconsistently by a certain protocol,\nby a service or something like that.\n\n38\n00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,660\nDNS, DHCP.\nRight, DNS, DHCP, things of that nature.\n\n39\n00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,910\nThings we're used to all the time,\nhttp is another good example right?\n\n40\n00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,140\nSurfs the web.\n\n41\n00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,220\nPeople are doing that now\nin order to watch us.\n\n42\n00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,780\nSo obviously you're engaging in that\nbehavior on a consistent basis.\n\n43\n00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,700\nAnd so those are well known ports.\n\n44\n00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,450\nAnd then beyond that, the next block\ndown from 1,024 to 49,000 151 will\n\n45\n00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,300\nbe what we referred to as\nregister port numbers.\n\n46\n00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,750\nThese ports are registered with Iona or\nwith a entity like that.\n\n47\n00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,310\nBut typically Iona which is\nthe group that will manage,\n\n48\n00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,980\nat least right now anyway,\nmanages port assignments.\n\n49\n00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,490\nThat may be changing a little bit.\n\n50\n00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,320\nUS has made it clear that they're looking\nto basically devolve and perhaps get away\n\n51\n00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,740\nfrom that and back out of that model,\nopen up the internet a little bit and\n\n52\n00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,260\nlet some other countries have some\nsay as to whats going on there.\n\n53\n00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,670\nYay.\nReally yay, right?\n\n54\n00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,660\nSo that may change.\n\n55\n00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,720\nThink about all the paperwork\nassociated with that right?\n\n56\n00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,350\nIf you could just sign over ownership,\nthe pink slip for the internet,\n\n57\n00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:08,919\nthat's kind of cool.\n\n58\n00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:12,860\n[LAUGH] Well when you think about it,\nhistorically, right, the U.S.\n\n59\n00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,470\nhas played a lead role as a country,\nas an entity,\n\n60\n00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:21,790\nkind of a driving force over the last\n30 to 40 years in the structuring,\n\n61\n00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,610\nand really the management globally,\nof these kinds of networks.\n\n62\n00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,840\nThe internet being the most prevalent of\ncourse, but before the internet was in\n\n63\n00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,350\nexistence just setting the standards for a\nlot of this stuff, and has maintained that\n\n64\n00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,530\nownership, that leadership role through\ncontrol of and then kind of sponsorship of\n\n65\n00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,310\ngroups like Iona and so they're thinking\npotentially at least right now under\n\n66\n00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,550\nthe current thought process, were think\nabout president Obama has kind of said you\n\n67\n00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,590\nknow maybe we'll back away\nfrom that a little bit.\n\n68\n00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,430\nRight, free that up a little bit,\nmaybe devolve that.\n\n69\n00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,620\nSo that may change, but for\n\n70\n00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,410\nthe moment, Iona is really where we\nsee port registrations taking place.\n\n71\n00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,670\nAnd so, the 49,151 cut-off there\nis the registered known ports, or\n\n72\n00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,710\nexcuse me, registered ports.\n\n73\n00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,230\nAnd those ports are gonna be\nthe ones that companies go out and\n\n74\n00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,770\nplant the flag on and say, this is\ngonna be the port that we're using for\n\n75\n00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,144\nour stuff, so 3389, for instance,\nbe on our list a little further down,\n\n76\n00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:21,110\nright, will be our remote\naccess protocol with RDP.\n\n77\n00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,105\nWe've got the Microsoft SQL port\nthat's listed there, right,\n\n78\n00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:25,630\nthat we'll have on our list as well.\n\n79\n00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,840\nThat's in the registered port range.\n\n80\n00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,582\nSo those kinds of things.\n\n81\n00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:34,808\nAnd then From 49,152 up to 65,535 for\ndynamic port numbers.\n\n82\n00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:38,868\nThese are ones that literally are taken\nby the stack, assigned with some sort\n\n83\n00:04:38,868 --> 00:04:42,614\nof rhyme or reason, based on a need,\nbased on a service, or a program,\n\n84\n00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:46,735\ncalling a port and needing a randomized\ndynamic port, it will be a sign there,\n\n85\n00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:48,796\ntypically good for a session, good for\n\n86\n00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:53,130\nthe duration of that particular engagement\nthat's going on in the machine.\n\n87\n00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,700\nThat port may change based on\ndynamic information coming in or\n\n88\n00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,560\nbeing modified during a session.\n\n89\n00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,730\nBut that port number will not hold\ntraditionally through the entire\n\n90\n00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,550\never after life cycle of that system and\nthat application.\n\n91\n00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,820\nYou shut the machine off,\nthose dynamic port numbers go away and\n\n92\n00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,020\nget reassigned on the fly the next\ntime the machine comes back up.\n\n93\n00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,330\nWhere as the well known ports and\n\n94\n00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,500\nregister port numbers are static in the\nsense that they're always gonna be there.\n\n95\n00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,150\nHttp is always running on port 80,right?\n\n96\n00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,030\nHttps always on port 443\nregardless of whatever else\n\n97\n00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,780\nis going on unless you manipulate and\nsomehow modify the stack\n\n98\n00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,830\nin some way that's really not supposed\nto be happening on a regular basis.\n\n99\n00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,920\nProbably not gonna be good.\n\n100\n00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,410\nWell yeah, not for\nthe long term anyway, right?\n\n101\n00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,310\nNot good for the long term,\nnot if you wanna surf the web.\n\n102\n00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,530\nSo we listed some network\nprotocols there for\n\n103\n00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,310\nyou protocols that you'll want\nto start becoming familiar with.\n\n104\n00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,980\nAnd below that we actually have a much\nmore in-depth list of protocols that\n\n105\n00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,170\nshould be thought about, or\nkind of on that need-to-know list for you,\n\n106\n00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,310\nif you prepare for an exam and\nanswer some questions.\n\n107\n00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,920\nSo maybe if we could quickly\ngo back up for just a second.\n\n108\n00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,220\nLet's just talk quickly about the ports\non the network protocol side.\n\n109\n00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,260\nThese are protocols that are specifically\ndealing with network traffic,\n\n110\n00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,250\nthe management of network services.\n\n111\n00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,850\nWe're gonna delve into\nsome of these later on.\n\n112\n00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,860\nWe'll talk a little bit more about ARP,\nabout DNS, about DHCP, how they work.\n\n113\n00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,770\nSo we'll break that down a little bit.\n\n114\n00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,300\nWe have IP and TCP on the list there.\n\n115\n00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,330\nRemember IP will be a OSI model layer.\n\n116\n00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,380\nWe fill in the blank here.\n\n117\n00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,120\nThis is kind of a little,\nquick knowledge check for\n\n118\n00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,480\nyou about our OSI model discussions\nfrom our previous show.\n\n119\n00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,040\nOne of our previous episodes.\n\n120\n00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,420\nSo if you remember the OSI model,\nseven layers.\n\n121\n00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,680\nHelps us to understand the logical\nassociation of networking and\n\n122\n00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,020\ncapability and functionality with how\nwe process data up and down the stack.\n\n123\n00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,640\nAnd so we see IP occurring at\nlayer three of the OSI model.\n\n124\n00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,870\nTCP is occurring at layer four VOSI model.\n\n125\n00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,050\nI just wanna make sure we're\nthinking about those things.\n\n126\n00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,070\nUDP by the way.\n\n127\n00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,690\nTherefore the OSI model as well, probably\ngonna see them both associated there.\n\n128\n00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,630\nHas in layer four meaning\nthe transport layer, right,\n\n129\n00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,740\nof the OSI model, whereas the layer three\nis the network layer of the OSI model.\n\n130\n00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,700\nSo we have IGMP, ICMP, SNMP, BOOTP which\nis part of the DHCP solution there.\n\n131\n00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,480\nSo we have all these as network protocols\nspecifically dealing with network\n\n132\n00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,245\nfunctionality, network capabilities.\n\n133\n00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:14,580\nAnd then we have a broader list down\nbelow that are just need to know, right.\n\n134\n00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,300\nWe assign port numbers to those and\ngiving them to you.\n\n135\n00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,773\nI think we did this last time as well,\n\n136\n00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:22,021\nwe couldn't get them all to fit on the\nscreen, [CROSSTALK] changed the font size.\n\n137\n00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:26,647\nSo we have TelNet there, and remember, I\nthink I mentioned this when we did this in\n\n138\n00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,613\nthe discussion of this material from SSCP,\nright?\n\n139\n00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:32,090\nWe put this port list together as well.\n\n140\n00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:35,470\nAnd we basically just have the same,\nit's pretty much an identical port list.\n\n141\n00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,374\nBut what we did is, we couldn't get it\nall on the screen, so we had mentioned,\n\n142\n00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:42,020\nnumber one, there's a little bit more,\nwe'll go up and down to let you see that.\n\n143\n00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,710\nWe also mentioned that this was not done\nin a chronological, nor alphabetic order.\n\n144\n00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,009\nIt was more of a much randomized\nassociation thought process on our part,\n\n145\n00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,641\nso we just threw them out there without\nreally thinking about organizing a list.\n\n146\n00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:57,196\nSo, you will see some randomness\nport numbers jump back in forth,\n\n147\n00:07:57,196 --> 00:08:00,700\nthey are not alphabetic by any means,\nbut this is a list of ports.\n\n148\n00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,135\nAnd the protocols associated with them\nthat are gonna use that you need to\n\n149\n00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:04,763\nbe aware of.\n\n150\n00:08:04,763 --> 00:08:08,210\nAnd you need to make sure\nyou have under your command.\n\n151\n00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,710\nIn terms of making sure that as\nyou prepare for the exam, what for\n\n152\n00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:16,040\ninstance the BOOTP protocol number is and\nthe fact that it's a UDP based protocol\n\n153\n00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,210\nand it's port 67 and 68 whereas MS Sequel,\nI mentioned that just a minute ago..\n\n154\n00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:26,140\nIs gonna be in the TCP 1433 area and\nradius for instance\n\n155\n00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,640\nyou'll see there we have some different\nports depending on how it's implemented.\n\n156\n00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,460\nThings of that nature.\n\n157\n00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,390\nSo, just make sure we are aware of that.\n\n158\n00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,620\nWe have a list here.\n\n159\n00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,880\nThis is one of those things that\nas much as I hate to tell people,\n\n160\n00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,758\nit's probably a memorization concept.\n\n161\n00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:41,565\nYeah, it is.\nIt's brute forcing of knowledge.\n\n162\n00:08:41,565 --> 00:08:42,920\nRight?\nBut the idea's there,\n\n163\n00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,295\nbring in that attack concept.\n\n164\n00:08:44,295 --> 00:08:45,130\nRight?\nAlong with the knowledge.\n\n165\n00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,400\nI like that.\nBrute forcing of knowledge.\n\n166\n00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,590\nBrute forcing of knowledge.\n\n167\n00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,385\nWe call it drinking from the fire hose.\n\n168\n00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:53,080\n[LAUGH] So you do have to make sure\nyou have command of this material\n\n169\n00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,440\nthat will more often than not,\n\n170\n00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,980\nespecially if you don't do this\nkind of stuff on a regular basis.\n\n171\n00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,000\nMeaning always associate port number and\n\n172\n00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,714\nprotocol function and\nyou may need to do some flash cards here.\n\n173\n00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:03,790\nYeah.\nWe've talked about that before.\n\n174\n00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,110\nA good way to go through and get some\nknowledge acquisition on this material.\n\n175\n00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,280\nBut make sure you are gonna be in command\nof this knowledge it will be very\n\n176\n00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,450\nimportant for you.\n\n177\n00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,726\nAll right.\nHaving said that we also now have a,\n\n178\n00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:17,310\ndown below there we have some single\ntypes that we wanted to talk about.\n\n179\n00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,364\nAnd kinda throw out some thought process\nhere on the different ways in which we can\n\n180\n00:09:21,364 --> 00:09:24,599\nmove information from point A to\npoint B inside of our networks.\n\n181\n00:09:24,599 --> 00:09:28,003\nAnd some of the tools and technologies\nassociated with doing that and\n\n182\n00:09:28,003 --> 00:09:30,080\nhow that all comes together for us.\n\n183\n00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,350\nAnd so we generically,\nstart talking about signal types.\n\n184\n00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,260\nWe start talking about this\nidea of analog versus digital.\n\n185\n00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,860\nRight.\nThat's probably\n\n186\n00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,660\nthe best way to frame that initially.\n\n187\n00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,190\nAnalog is an older, traditional,\na signal that we would think of as a wave.\n\n188\n00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:47,030\nRight?\nWe'd see that perhaps in the older movies.\n\n189\n00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,940\nYou might see sci-fi\nmovies things like that.\n\n190\n00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,050\nWe have the Mad Scientist in the lab and\nhe's got the oscilloscope.\n\n191\n00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,551\nOscilloscope in the background.\n\n192\n00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:55,295\nAll waves going like this.\n\n193\n00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:55,818\nAlways makes full.\n\n194\n00:09:55,818 --> 00:09:56,985\n[CROSSTALK] It's always so neat.\n\n195\n00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:57,819\nRight?\n\n196\n00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:02,007\nAnd so you have that wave concept going on\nwhere you see the electrical wave being\n\n197\n00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:04,380\nrepresented kind of as an S wave.\n\n198\n00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,970\nWith values some tropes\nturned on it's side.\n\n199\n00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,910\nThat's an analog signal.\n\n200\n00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,570\nDigital is going to a little\nbit different than that.\n\n201\n00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,750\nWe don't see a digital signal\nbeing represented that way.\n\n202\n00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,355\nWe see it almost looking like\na green key or like a square.\n\n203\n00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:20,270\nYeah.\nLike this kind of going out that way and\n\n204\n00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:23,840\nso, we see it as being a square\npattern to tell we represent digital.\n\n205\n00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,950\nOn or off.\n\n206\n00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,940\nOn or off.\n\n207\n00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,570\nRight.\nBinary, it's either one or zero, on or\n\n208\n00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,010\noff, exactly that.\n\n209\n00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,930\nAnd so, the digital signal is really\ngoing to show us this on, off,\n\n210\n00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,412\nyes, no, true, false, one,\n\n211\n00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:39,680\nzero kind of view of the world,\nwhereas the analog is gonna have waves.\n\n212\n00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,300\nAnd is going to have valleys and\ntroughs and peaks,\n\n213\n00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,070\nand things of that nature associated\nwith it, not the same with digital.\n\n214\n00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,110\nDigital is obviously more reliable in the\nsense that it is gonna be either yes we're\n\n215\n00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,380\non as a burst of information,\nburst of energy, or\n\n216\n00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,600\nwe're off, no signal kind of flat.\n\n217\n00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,460\nWhereas analog can spike and move all\nover the place based on amplitude and\n\n218\n00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,750\nfrequency and these terms that\nwe use associated with waves.\n\n219\n00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,310\nAnd so we wanna be aware of that and\n\n220\n00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:08,480\nso we obviously move towards\ndigital encoding of our data and\n\n221\n00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,830\nobviously digital management of our\ndata in our modern networking systems.\n\n222\n00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,310\nEverything these days we talked\nabout is primarily digital.\n\n223\n00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,020\nWe really don't support analog for\nmuch of anything anymore.\n\n224\n00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,360\nModems are kinda falling out of favor and\nnot really used too much anymore.\n\n225\n00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,300\nWe don't use dial-up for much of\nanything unless it's maybe a back up.\n\n226\n00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:23,870\nBack up something, yeah.\n\n227\n00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,210\nTo a system or a remote access\nsolution for maintenance on PB access,\n\n228\n00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:28,885\nthings like that.\n\n229\n00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:30,250\nMostly everything today is digital.\n\n230\n00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,210\nSo we like that in some respects.\n\n231\n00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,840\nHackers obviously have to\ndeal with that switch.\n\n232\n00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,410\nAnalog systems may or\nmay not have been easier to get into,\n\n233\n00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,400\ndepending on what they were.\n\n234\n00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,421\nThere's simply less security\nassociated with them.\n\n235\n00:11:41,421 --> 00:11:44,350\nRight so they are more secure\ntypically in a digital world.\n\n236\n00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,320\nBut that brings a whole new\nset of challenges with it.\n\n237\n00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,290\nYou obviously have to be aware of those\nfrom a security stand point as well.\n\n238\n00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,680\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n239\n00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:57,030\nWe do want to throw out the idea of\nbandwidth versus data throughput.\n\n240\n00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,840\nHere quickly, I'm really just\nmore as a touch point for you.\n\n241\n00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,856\nI don't even know if we\nnecessarily need to write it down.\n\n242\n00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,560\nOkay.\nBut just as a thought process,\n\n243\n00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,070\nthe idea of bandwidth is\nreally just the amount of\n\n244\n00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,608\nthe measurement of the network pulses.\n\n245\n00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,170\nRight?\nWhatever is going through there\n\n246\n00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,097\nover a certain period of time.\n\n247\n00:12:13,097 --> 00:12:15,970\nSo, when we think of bandwidth,\nwe measure it over seconds.\n\n248\n00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,620\nWe think of say megabits per second,\ngigabits per second, some measure of\n\n249\n00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,970\ninformation moving past a defined\npoint within a certain period of time.\n\n250\n00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,870\nSo that is why we say kilobits,\nmegabits, gigabits, petabits,\n\n251\n00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,640\nwhatever I'd like to have that network.\n\n252\n00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,910\nRight?\nI was gonna say, yeah.\n\n253\n00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,950\nI'd like the two petabit per\nsecond data option, please.\n\n254\n00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,810\nCox Communications.\n\n255\n00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,750\nSide of price with that, yes?\n\n256\n00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,240\nSo, yeah, that is coming at some point.\n\n257\n00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,340\nNot right now, but\nwe do see that happening.\n\n258\n00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,190\nSo understand balance and measure of data\nflowing through a fixed point over time.\n\n259\n00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,740\nWhereas data throughput\nis just the actual amount\n\n260\n00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,840\nof data that could traverse\nover that connection.\n\n261\n00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,800\nWe talk about throughput,\n\n262\n00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,950\nwe're talking about the actual\ncarrying capacity of the pipe.\n\n263\n00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,260\nRight?\nHow much it could carry.\n\n264\n00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,070\nHow much could carry.\n\n265\n00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,820\nRight.\nThat can be carried over this connection.\n\n266\n00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,130\nSo a little bit of a different\nway of looking at things.\n\n267\n00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:04,860\nWe want to make that distinguishing\nkind of connotation there and call your\n\n268\n00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:08,600\nattention to the difference in the terms\nbetween bandwidth and data throughput.\n\n269\n00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,100\nWe often just refer to data throughput\nby way of referring to bandwidth.\n\n270\n00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,170\nWe don't differentiate\nbetween the two typically.\n\n271\n00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,800\nIn our conversations you\njust hear people say oh,\n\n272\n00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,300\nI have 100 megabits of bandwidth or\nwhatever.\n\n273\n00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,470\nThey don't really make the difference or\nthe differentiation apparent.\n\n274\n00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,650\nWe just lump them together, but\nthere is actually a distinguishing\n\n275\n00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,580\ncharacteristic of each that we\njust want to point out to you.\n\n276\n00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,690\nSo having said that, let's talk then\nabout Asynchronous versus Synchronous.\n\n277\n00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,200\nRight?\n\n278\n00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,180\nThis idea we put a modem\nin brackets there for\n\n279\n00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,070\nasynchronous to signify that asynchronous\nsolutions deal with stopping and\n\n280\n00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,580\nstarting and\nblocking the data into a chunk of data.\n\n281\n00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,380\nSo we stop, we have a stop bit and\na start bit associated with the data.\n\n282\n00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,150\nIf you think of a way a modem used\nto work we would set a modem,\n\n283\n00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,140\nsomething like eight and\none was the setting for modem.\n\n284\n00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,690\nEight bytes for the data block.\n\n285\n00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,260\nRight?\n\n286\n00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,910\nThen we would have N for parody.\n\n287\n00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,480\nThere's typically no parody.\n\n288\n00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,098\nRight.\nSo, we'll then have a stop and\n\n289\n00:13:59,098 --> 00:13:59,670\na start date.\n\n290\n00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,715\nAnd so we would see a data block in\nan asynchronous solution having a stop,\n\n291\n00:14:03,715 --> 00:14:05,750\nexcuse me, a start bit in the front.\n\n292\n00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,030\nData stop was typically one byte.\n\n293\n00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,580\nData block in the middle of eight bits.\n\n294\n00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,150\nRight?\n\n295\n00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,430\nA parity bit, yes or no for parity.\n\n296\n00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,890\nSo then that would be one bit as well.\n\n297\n00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:17,420\nAnd then we would have\na stop bit on the back end.\n\n298\n00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,230\nSo you would have a total of 11 bits for\n\n299\n00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:23,335\nthe block of data that was sent out if we\ndid an eight bit block for a synchronous.\n\n300\n00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:28,035\nBecause you had one for the start,\none for the parody, one for the stop, and\n\n301\n00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,925\nthen eight bits for the actual data block.\n\n302\n00:14:29,925 --> 00:14:33,025\nAnd so\nwe would send this thing as 11 bit blocks.\n\n303\n00:14:33,025 --> 00:14:34,972\nRIght.\nRight overall as we streaming down\n\n304\n00:14:34,972 --> 00:14:35,502\nthe wire.\n\n305\n00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:38,352\nThat was an asynchronous solution\nwith a modem we would stop and\n\n306\n00:14:38,352 --> 00:14:40,422\nstart to differentiate\nthe sending of data.\n\n307\n00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:43,112\nWhere synchronous is gonna\nbe a clock mechanism,\n\n308\n00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:45,992\nsome sort of timing\nsynchronization takes place there.\n\n309\n00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:47,962\nIt's why wrote we clock mechanism.\n\n310\n00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:49,282\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n311\n00:14:49,282 --> 00:14:53,012\nwhat we would typically see is\nthat we transfer data in a stream.\n\n312\n00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:54,892\nRight?\nWe're not doing it as a block there.\n\n313\n00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:57,072\nAnd so as a result,\nwe simply don't use the stop and\n\n314\n00:14:57,072 --> 00:15:01,400\nstart framing, we send the data down\nthe wire as continuous stream of bits.\n\n315\n00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,190\nAnd we do that based on an amount of time.\n\n316\n00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,510\nWe synchronize and say okay we're ready\nto set up, we're ready to send and\n\n317\n00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,670\nreceive, transmit and we're gonna do that.\n\n318\n00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,520\nAnd then we do that for\na period of time, whatever that is.\n\n319\n00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,090\nSo it's much more like\na free flow of data.\n\n320\n00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,944\nIt is literally like\ndrinking from the fire hose.\n\n321\n00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:17,350\nYes.\nThere's a stream of data\n\n322\n00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,830\nthat comes out of the device.\n\n323\n00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,220\nSo that's the key difference there\nbetween asynchronous and synchronous.\n\n324\n00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,921\nAnd then we also want to make\nsure that [COUGH] we talk this\n\n325\n00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:29,970\nidea of Broadband and Baseband.\n\n326\n00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,452\nYet another way of\nframing our conversation.\n\n327\n00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:33,170\nAll right?\n\n328\n00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:38,240\nSo the idea of baseband is that we're\nusing the entire technology spectrum.\n\n329\n00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,290\nRight?\n\n330\n00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,680\n[COUGH] So if we have a channel.\n\n331\n00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,380\nNot the technology spectrum I mean\nthe transmission spectrum I should say.\n\n332\n00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,580\nIf we have lets think of this as maybe.\n\n333\n00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,677\nA system that has 13 channels\nhypothetically associated with it.\n\n334\n00:15:50,677 --> 00:15:53,674\nRight?\nSo if we said we have potentially 13\n\n335\n00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:58,343\nchannels we're gonna use in\nbaseband [COUGH], excuse me.\n\n336\n00:15:58,343 --> 00:16:00,546\nWe're gonna use that entire spectrum or\n\n337\n00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:04,880\nall 13 channels to transmit when we\ntalk about base [INAUDIBLE], right?\n\n338\n00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,420\nWhereas, with broadband,\n\n339\n00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,620\nwe are going to use those 13\nchannels split up individually.\n\n340\n00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,490\nAnd we're gonna be able to, in theory,\ntransmit 13 different data streams,\n\n341\n00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,300\nor however many we might set up for\ndata, we may have one or\n\n342\n00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:20,520\ntwo that are specified for error control,\nsetup, breakdown, things like that.\n\n343\n00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,750\nBut in general,\nwe're gonna use those channels and\n\n344\n00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,180\nhave each one associated with\nsome sort of transmission stream.\n\n345\n00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,280\nAnd so when we think about cable TV for\ninstance,\n\n346\n00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,340\nright, versus maybe radio or\nthings like that or whatever it is.\n\n347\n00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:38,551\nYou know, radio uses the entire\nchannel that it's assigned,\n\n348\n00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:44,660\n96.5 or I don't know, 100.7 or\n99.2 or whatever it may be.\n\n349\n00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,050\nThat radio station is tuned\nin on that specific channel.\n\n350\n00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,920\nThat one little narrowly defined channel.\n\n351\n00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,250\nIt's not, you know, all 100 gigahertz\nof the radio spectrum is being assigned\n\n352\n00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,620\nto you and you get everything whether\nyou use it all or not, right?\n\n353\n00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,350\nCable TV, kind of the same thought\nprocess, we have one carrier signal but\n\n354\n00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,690\nwe have it chopped up in effect.\n\n355\n00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,680\nLots of channels on there.\n\n356\n00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,320\nMaybe hundreds of channels today\nwhatever it may be, right?\n\n357\n00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,940\nSo just think about the difference\nthere where baseband is really gonna\n\n358\n00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,200\ntake this entire communication channel.\n\n359\n00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,430\nAnd broadband is going to split this up\ninto individual and independent channels.\n\n360\n00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:17,580\nSo just make sure we have\na good sense of that.\n\n361\n00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:21,230\nAnd obviously those transmit as\nsimultaneously as streams of data.\n\n362\n00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,540\nSo obviously\n\n363\n00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,860\nsomething like as we said cable TV is\na good example of a broadband solution.\n\n364\n00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,090\nSo this might be an idea for you there.\n\n365\n00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,340\nAll right, very good.\nSo we want to make sure we're comfortable\n\n366\n00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,800\nwith these concepts because these are the\nunderlying mechanisms that really help us\n\n367\n00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,900\nto understand the kinds of systems,\n\n368\n00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,350\nthe kind of networking components\nthat we may see out there.\n\n369\n00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,990\nSo common communication characteristics\nthat we see around these and\n\n370\n00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,450\nso, understanding the difference, good for\n\n371\n00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,480\nus as we look to master\nsome of this material.\n\n372\n00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,170\nWe also had thrown out some\ncabling information there,\n\n373\n00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,000\nI wanted to talk a bit about cabling.\n\n374\n00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,270\nYeah, once we set up the transmission\nmechanisms, asynchronous,\n\n375\n00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,320\nsynchronous, digital,\nanalog, broadband, baseband.\n\n376\n00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,640\nWhat really then has to happen is we\nhave to talk about how we're gonna set\n\n377\n00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,470\nthese systems up from a physical\nconnectivity perspective.\n\n378\n00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,830\nWhat's our media that we're gonna\nactually transmit that data across?\n\n379\n00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,410\nAbsolutely.\n\n380\n00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,990\nSo cabling will typically be that way.\n\n381\n00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,150\nAt least if it's a physically\ncabled solution.\n\n382\n00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,500\nIf it's wireless, we still have\nto worry about what that is, but\n\n383\n00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,875\nwe're not gonna worry\nabout a physical cable.\n\n384\n00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,960\nWe're gonna worry about transmission\nmechanism, and bandwidth and\n\n385\n00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,220\nthings of that nature, right.\n\n386\n00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,730\nAnd so we'll have those\nconversations in a while as well.\n\n387\n00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,680\nSo cabling categories are what we call the\ncat rating for a cable, CAT 1 through 7.\n\n388\n00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,380\nIts important for us to be aware of here\nand to think about some of you may or\n\n389\n00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,580\nmay not have been involved in IT long\nenough that you may have heard this term\n\n390\n00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,215\nwhere we say oh, it's a CAT 5 cable or\nmay hear it referred to all the time but\n\n391\n00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:43,930\nmay not necessarily know\nwhy we call it that.\n\n392\n00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,596\nAnd so\nit's not because it purrs like a kitten.\n\n393\n00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:50,750\nIt's not because it's warm and snuggly.\n\n394\n00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,270\nIt's not because it's antisocial.\n\n395\n00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,240\nThose of you that may or\nmay not be cat people out there.\n\n396\n00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,720\nRight what it is instead is short for\ncategory.\n\n397\n00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,052\nIt's just a truncated abbreviation\nthat we use to specify category.\n\n398\n00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:04,920\nSo the categories of cable which\ntraditionally see 7 categories have been\n\n399\n00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,680\nlaid out or\n7 categories that have been assigned for\n\n400\n00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,130\ndifferent kinds of cabling and different\nspeeds primarily associated with them.\n\n401\n00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:17,240\nAnd so CAT 1 was, well it is actually,\nI think it's all capitals when you do it,\n\n402\n00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,720\neither way, it doesn't really matter.\n\n403\n00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,600\nCAT 1 is going to be traditionally\nseen as telephony, so\n\n404\n00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,330\nwe're not really going to be using it for\ndata, per se,\n\n405\n00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,510\nalthough you could argue that certainly\nthat voice going over it on a traditional\n\n406\n00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,920\nanalog system was a form of data, but\nit was not digital voice just to be clear.\n\n407\n00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,870\nThis was an analog solution, so\n\n408\n00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,420\nthis was seen traditionally\nas the analog phone lines.\n\n409\n00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,130\nIt didn't really come into play for\nus when we were dealing with networking.\n\n410\n00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:46,340\nCAT 2 was going to be data\nthat was transmitted but\n\n411\n00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,140\nit was so slow just at the very end our,\nlower end of our bandwidth spectrum.\n\n412\n00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,490\nThat early on was four megabits by\nthe way was the maximum carrying capacity\n\n413\n00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,580\non a CAT 2 cable.\n\n414\n00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,690\nThat is was so slow that once\nwe really got started there and\n\n415\n00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,020\ntalked about bandwidth speeds with\nany kind of substance on a network\n\n416\n00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,990\nwe didn't really use CAT 2,\nwe jumped right to CAT 3 primarily.\n\n417\n00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:10,085\nThe heyday,\nthe boom of cabling networks up was CAT 3.\n\n418\n00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:14,065\nCAT 3 back in the day, was going to\nbe your 10 Mb network, right, so\n\n419\n00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:17,675\nthat was going to be 10 megabits per\nsecond transmission speed, this was for\n\n420\n00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,175\nethernet networks.\n\n421\n00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:23,645\nFor token ring, CAT 3 would have been\na 4 megabit per seconds token ring, so\n\n422\n00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:25,325\nit could have meant either one.\n\n423\n00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:29,175\nWe'll talk about topologies and\nwhat a token ring was in a little while.\n\n424\n00:20:29,175 --> 00:20:32,150\nBut it was traditionally seen\nas 10 megabits for ethernet and\n\n425\n00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,805\nwe may just want to make a little sub-note\nthere that it was a four meg token ring.\n\n426\n00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:38,439\nMm-hm.\nSo that way people have a sense of that.\n\n427\n00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:42,920\nWhen we get into CAT 4, again one of those\n\n428\n00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,340\nodd categories that didn't really play out\nvery well, was around for a little bit.\n\n429\n00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,720\nCAT 4 was 16 megabits bandwidth.\n\n430\n00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,130\nIt was used primarily, and\nalmost exclusively on token ring.\n\n431\n00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,540\nAnd it was going to be a great\njump from 4 megabits, right?\n\n432\n00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,930\nI mean, think about it obviously.\n\n433\n00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,860\nQuadrupled our speed there.\n\n434\n00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,820\nYeah, quadrupled our speeds.\n\n435\n00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,460\nAnd at the time,\nwhen CAT 3 was the norm for Ethernet and\n\n436\n00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,170\nyou could jump to 16 megs on the the token\nring, this was actually a big deal.\n\n437\n00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,930\nYou got 6 more megs of bandwidth\nout of your token rings.\n\n438\n00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,600\nQuadrupled, as Mike said,\nthe speed of the initial token ring.\n\n439\n00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,620\nCuz once people put token ring\nout in 4 megs on the coax, and\n\n440\n00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,820\nthen all of a sudden, right, or\njust on the cables generically,\n\n441\n00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,910\nwhatever they were, but to use the 4 meg\ncable for coax, for coax ,excuse me,\n\n442\n00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,922\nfor token ring, got coax on the brain, and\nthen all of a sudden, people were doing\n\n443\n00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:32,960\nCAT 3 on the Ethernet side and basically\nget two and half times the bandwidth.\n\n444\n00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,830\nRight.\nRight, with the 10 meg on just traditional\n\n445\n00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,910\nEthernet, all the token ring\npeople were kinda bummed, right?\n\n446\n00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,530\nYeah, and they jumped ship.\n\n447\n00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,990\nYeah, they basically did, but the problem\nwas it was a proprietary mechanism and\n\n448\n00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,910\nyou had to spend a lot of money in order\nto be able to get IBM technology and\n\n449\n00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:48,500\nto do token ring.\n\n450\n00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,900\nAnd so you weren't walking away\nfrom those networks very easily.\n\n451\n00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,880\nRight.\nCuz there was a lot of time and energy.\n\n452\n00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,630\nSo CAT 4 played out for a little bit, but\n\n453\n00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,030\nyou know as token rings really went by\nthe wayside because of the nature of\n\n454\n00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,600\nthe technology, we see that really\ndisappearing almost immediately.\n\n455\n00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,780\nMost Ethernet solutions jump\nright from CAT 3 to CAT 5.\n\n456\n00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,050\nAnd CAT 5 is gonna be 100 megabit\nwhat we know today is probably\n\n457\n00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,700\nthe widest deployed and most ubiquitous of\ncabling solutions on the Ethernet side.\n\n458\n00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,110\nYou know everything back in the day and\n\n459\n00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,620\neven still in many cases in many older\nnetworks are still 100 megabit in CAT 5.\n\n460\n00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:25,220\nSo this was just 100 megabit per per\nsecond, this was typically twisted pairs.\n\n461\n00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,810\nThis was unshielded or\nshielded twisted pair cables,\n\n462\n00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,220\nnot really worried about the difference\nbetween that for the moment.\n\n463\n00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,790\nThen CAT 6 and or CAT 7, well actually\nI have CAT 5E, we can just say it's\n\n464\n00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:40,220\na subcategory of CAT 5 was about 350 megs\nof bandwidth approximately for CAT 5e.\n\n465\n00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,800\nWas a subcategory kind of an improvement\non CAT 5 before we got to CAT 6.\n\n466\n00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,680\nSo that was typically seen as\nbeing up to about 350 megs.\n\n467\n00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,420\nAnd then CAT 6 makes its\nway onto the market there.\n\n468\n00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,950\nWe associate CAT 6 traditionally\nwith gigabit Ethernet.\n\n469\n00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,970\nBut it actually is capable\nof going up to 10 gigabits,\n\n470\n00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,640\ndepending on how it's implemented.\n\n471\n00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,380\nAnd then Cat 7 is also seen as a 10\ngigabit solution depending on how\n\n472\n00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:04,970\nit's implemented.\n\n473\n00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,940\nThere are some varying factors there,\ndepending on how it's set up.\n\n474\n00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,570\nBut ultimately it seems being\nup to a 10 gigabit solution.\n\n475\n00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:15,210\nSo we have those categories laid out and\nset up.\n\n476\n00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:19,180\nThis is for the unshielded, twisted\npair of solutions that we talk about,\n\n477\n00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,550\nwhat we call UTP.\n\n478\n00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,520\nSo these are the categories of cable.\n\n479\n00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,480\nYou should definitely\nbe familiar with them,\n\n480\n00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,210\nunderstand the bandwidth association,\nwe just laid out for\n\n481\n00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,390\nyou there not necessarily the historical\nreferences to things like token ring.\n\n482\n00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,960\nBut just understanding that,\nfor instance a CAT 4 cable\n\n483\n00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,210\nwould have transmitted at 16 megabits\nversus CAT 2 versus a CAT 6.\n\n484\n00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,060\nRight.\nThat kind of thing would be important.\n\n485\n00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,330\nAnd then we have thin net and\nthick net for cabling types.\n\n486\n00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,231\nThese are, that's why I kept\nhaving coax on the brain.\n\n487\n00:23:45,231 --> 00:23:46,570\nI kept reading down but\n\n488\n00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,715\nyou know trying to write up the this\nwhole we'll talk about in confidentiality\n\n489\n00:23:51,715 --> 00:23:56,099\nwhen we talk about cryptography much\nlater on in another one of our shows.\n\n490\n00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:59,106\nSo here, Thinnet and\nThicknet refers to coax cable.\n\n491\n00:23:59,106 --> 00:24:04,170\nCoax cable as in the cable cable like\nyou would have at home for cable.\n\n492\n00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,550\nBut with a slightly different make up,\n\n493\n00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:10,420\nthe core internal is made of different\nstrength and grade of copper.\n\n494\n00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,300\nBut we have coax cable there.\n\n495\n00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,590\nAnd so the idea was a copper wire\nthat would have been cylindrical and\n\n496\n00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,270\nhad a little copper protrusion\ncoming out of the core there.\n\n497\n00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:23,620\nAnd we use the BNC connector for it to\nbe able to link it up and to connect it.\n\n498\n00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,220\nAnd we did some pictures in the SSCP\nshow we did where we put that stuff up.\n\n499\n00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,730\nMaybe we can do that again\nreal quickly as well.\n\n500\n00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,080\nAnd so, just while Mike's doing\na quick image search for us for\n\n501\n00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,580\na BNC connector and maybe a coaxial\ncable just to show it for a network.\n\n502\n00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,035\nThe idea there, we'll capture it in the\nnotes in just a minute, is that Thinnet\n\n503\n00:24:41,035 --> 00:24:45,730\nand Thicknet were just just ways of\nreferring to this idea of the coax cable.\n\n504\n00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:50,090\nSo you could see there,\nplastic outer jacket, metal shield\n\n505\n00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,450\nin the middle there to protect against\nelectromagnetic radiation coming off it,\n\n506\n00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,810\nand interference coming into\nit to kind of shield it.\n\n507\n00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,040\nThe dielectric insulator,\nwhich was just kind of a hard core,\n\n508\n00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,750\nthat would protect the copper,\ncuz copper's soft and malleable.\n\n509\n00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,980\nAnd yes, you can bend this stuff, but\nit doesn't break, that kind of thing.\n\n510\n00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,320\nAnd then the central core is\ngonna be the copper wire,\n\n511\n00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,240\nthat central core will be poking\nout there at the end of the copper.\n\n512\n00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:14,240\nA wire at the end of the coax and I think\nin that other image if you go back to\n\n513\n00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,830\nthe main page what we saw was,\nyeah like any one of those up there.\n\n514\n00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,040\nNot that one because that one isn't really\na BNC but the other one there would,\n\n515\n00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,290\nnot really a BNC either.\n\n516\n00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,240\nI thought I saw one poking out there but\nwe may have to search for\n\n517\n00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,210\na VNC specifically, but these are just\ncopper wire cable-cable connectors, right?\n\n518\n00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,620\nHome connectors, but\nwe will search, there we go.\n\n519\n00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,390\nThere's a VNC.\n\n520\n00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,230\nI think we actually used\nthat one last time.\n\n521\n00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,410\nThat's the same exact one.\n\n522\n00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,070\nLook at that.\n\n523\n00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,030\nTwo shows, one image, no waiting, right?\n\n524\n00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:43,560\nAnd so what we do is we would plug,\n\n525\n00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,220\nyou could see the copper wire into\nthe connector, it gets crimped on.\n\n526\n00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,000\nYou could see it there and\n\n527\n00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,070\nso that's the end of the copper wire\nthat's kind of poking out right there.\n\n528\n00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,760\nAnd then what would happen is you would\nplug that into the back of a network card\n\n529\n00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,290\nand that network card would\nhave two little wings on it,\n\n530\n00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,660\non the back of the connector\nwhere you would plug in and\n\n531\n00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,360\neffectively turn and torque this and\nturn the BNC connector.\n\n532\n00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,520\nYou could see it kind of there and\n\n533\n00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,620\nit would lock in place by swiveling around\nas Mike just outlined in those rectangles.\n\n534\n00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,200\nYou would notch the two ends of the, they\nwere like little fly ends like this on\n\n535\n00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,400\nthe network card, so you would plug\nthis in and then turn it to notch it,\n\n536\n00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,600\nand basically lock it in place,\nmuch like a piece of Ikea furniture.\n\n537\n00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,655\nAnd a wingnut, right, so\nbasically the concept is the same, right?\n\n538\n00:26:23,655 --> 00:26:29,095\nIf you've ever had the privilege and\nthe excitement of building Ikea furniture,\n\n539\n00:26:29,095 --> 00:26:32,935\nit is just like in the old days,\nas we say, back in the old country.\n\n540\n00:26:32,935 --> 00:26:34,630\nRight, so this is what it was like.\n\n541\n00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,100\nBut you know if you've ever seen these or\n\n542\n00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,630\nmay have even had these in your networks,\nthis is what you saw.\n\n543\n00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,980\nSo the network card had,\non the back end of it,\n\n544\n00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,430\nthis little protrusion that stuck out\nthat you would attach to and lock down.\n\n545\n00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:48,120\nI know we talked about vampire taps,\nvampings we used to call it.\n\n546\n00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,430\nTapping the other wire.\n\n547\n00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,260\nAnd you weren't going to\naccidentally unloosen that or\n\n548\n00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,390\nknock that off the back\nof the card very easily.\n\n549\n00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,480\nNot very easily you had a work out.\n\n550\n00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,130\nYou can see the T connector up\nthere on the right in blue.\n\n551\n00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,230\nThat was just going to be a junction\nconnector where you could basically set up\n\n552\n00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,190\nyour bus line one of the cables coming\nin and then going out the other way.\n\n553\n00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,940\nWe tapped it right in the middle there so\nyou could drop it down and\n\n554\n00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,820\nactually connect to it.\n\n555\n00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,200\nSo that was just called a T connector.\n\n556\n00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,590\nAnd then we also would\nhave maybe a network card.\n\n557\n00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,600\nIf we find one that has a BNC on there,\nmay be able to find that.\n\n558\n00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,580\nAnd so the network card would have\nthis connecting point on the back, and\n\n559\n00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,750\nwe may be able to show you a picture\nof that real quickly as well.\n\n560\n00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,090\nIf I can get Google to play.\n\n561\n00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:26,800\nYeah right, exactly.\n\n562\n00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,400\nSo we can see there BNC network adapter\nof some kind, any one of those.\n\n563\n00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,442\nYeah, it's good.\n\n564\n00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:35,780\nYou gonna see right there that that\nconnection point on the back is\n\n565\n00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,310\nplugged right in.\n\n566\n00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:39,400\nThat one happens to be a dual card,\nright, so it can do both kinds.\n\n567\n00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,300\nYou see the traditional RJ-45 And\nthen we see the BNC connector there.\n\n568\n00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,300\nAnd you can see right there,\n\n569\n00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,000\nit has a little wing on it and you would\nplug this cable in, torque it left or\n\n570\n00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,950\nright depending on how it\nwas situated in the box.\n\n571\n00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:53,010\nAnd then, as a result,\nyou'll be able to lock it in place.\n\n572\n00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,370\nAnd as Mike said,\ncouldn't really pull that off, right?\n\n573\n00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,370\nThat would be locked in.\n\n574\n00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,790\nSo that's what we would see there.\n\n575\n00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:59,297\nYou don't really see this anymore.\n\n576\n00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:02,212\nThis is really not something\nyou're going to find and\n\n577\n00:28:02,212 --> 00:28:05,137\ntrip around or\ntrip over in your networks very often.\n\n578\n00:28:05,137 --> 00:28:09,673\nIf you do, its going to be a slow network\nbecause the coax cables going to run\n\n579\n00:28:09,673 --> 00:28:12,927\ntraditionally on a much\nslower bandwidth solution.\n\n580\n00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:16,027\nSo lets go back and just document out\nour thin and a Thicknet really quickly.\n\n581\n00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:19,421\nSo a Thinnet referred to\ncoax as does Thicknet.\n\n582\n00:28:19,421 --> 00:28:24,585\nThe idea was that Thinnet was quarter\ninch cable, as opposed to the half inch,\n\n583\n00:28:24,585 --> 00:28:28,950\nwhich is what Thicknet was, and\nwe referred to it as ten base two.\n\n584\n00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,570\nThat was how we referred to thin net,\nit was called ten base two.\n\n585\n00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,590\nAll these names are basically the same.\n\n586\n00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,970\nThey just refer to this\nkind of coax cable.\n\n587\n00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,990\nAnd then we had Thicknet,\nwhich was going to again be coax as well.\n\n588\n00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,400\nIt was going to be half inch.\n\n589\n00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,820\nThis is the diameter,\nthe circumference of the cable.\n\n590\n00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,460\nAnd then 10BASE5 as opposed to 10BASE2.\n\n591\n00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,540\nYou know, you could run this stuff\nin conduit, you could crimp it and\n\n592\n00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,340\nmove it around, you could, just about.\n\n593\n00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,390\nIt was thick and hard and tough but you\nliterally could tie it into a semi knot,\n\n594\n00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,590\nright, kind of delude it and\nstuff, wouldn't hurt the cable.\n\n595\n00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:05,040\nUnlike the fiber cable down at the bottom\nthere, which was gonna have a glass core\n\n596\n00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,640\nin it which if you did that you would\nbreak, it wouldn't be able to transmit.\n\n597\n00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,570\nNow all these copper cable types,\nincluding twisted pair, and\n\n598\n00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,020\nas we see coax is listed there again.\n\n599\n00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:20,500\nSo all of those, they all use electrical\npulses of energy that go down the wire\n\n600\n00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,320\nto send and receive and transmit data.\n\n601\n00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,190\nWe'll talk about what that means in one of\nour future upcoming episodes about just\n\n602\n00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,130\nhow we know that's going on.\n\n603\n00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,660\nAnd basically listening methods,\ncommunication methods, but for\n\n604\n00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,670\nnow it's just important to understand\nthis is done with electrical pulses,\n\n605\n00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,430\nwhereas fiber is gonna be\ntransmitting with light pulses.\n\n606\n00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:41,340\nAnd so we have to have lined out or laid\nout cable that is relatively straight.\n\n607\n00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,120\nWe can bend fiber to a degree but\n\n608\n00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,850\nit cannot be bent the way\nthat copper wire can.\n\n609\n00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,830\nWe can't make right angle bends with fiber\nfor instance, it just doesn't work, and\n\n610\n00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,360\nas a result we run into some issues there\nwith running fiber in certain situations\n\n611\n00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,700\nwhere we may not be able to clearly and\neasily run that without bending it,\n\n612\n00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,480\nbecause we can break the internal\nglass cladding, the core,\n\n613\n00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,780\nand that could be a problem.\n\n614\n00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,940\nSo we just have to be aware of that.\n\n615\n00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,480\nAs a result of that,\njust some things to be aware of.\n\n616\n00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,070\nSo we've laid out\nthe different cable types.\n\n617\n00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,450\nWhat we probably want to do\nquickly is lay in the attenuation\n\n618\n00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,758\ndistances associated with this just to\nwrap up this part of the conversation.\n\n619\n00:30:15,758 --> 00:30:17,450\nSo if we go back up generically and\n\n620\n00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:22,080\nwe'll do it maybe right here which is\ncopper wire versus fiber versus coax.\n\n621\n00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:26,300\nSo twisted pair, which will be traditional\nethernet, coax, and then that.\n\n622\n00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,390\nSo twisted pair or\ncopper wire, unshielded,\n\n623\n00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,200\ntwisted pair is gonna attenuate.\n\n624\n00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,690\nLet's talk about attenuation for\njust a minute.\n\n625\n00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,640\nIdentified attenuation is this\nidea of resistance, I think.\n\n626\n00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,500\nI said friction last time,\nyou said resistance.\n\n627\n00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,560\nAnd so basically the same concept because\nwe're using electricity and we're pushing\n\n628\n00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,030\nelectricity down a copper wire copper's\na very good conductor of electricity, but\n\n629\n00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,070\nlike anything else, electrical\ncurrent runs through something and\n\n630\n00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,490\nmeets resistance to\nmoving forward over time.\n\n631\n00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,189\nAnd so, as we go down the wire literally,\n\n632\n00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:59,897\nwe run out of basically forward motion\nin that electrical pulse unless we\n\n633\n00:30:59,897 --> 00:31:05,015\nare going to somehow modify that pulse\nby bringing it back up to full strength.\n\n634\n00:31:05,015 --> 00:31:07,655\nAnd so we talk about using\na repeater of some kind,\n\n635\n00:31:07,655 --> 00:31:09,560\nan amplification of that signal.\n\n636\n00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,290\nSo the attenuation rating is done in\ndistance, typically done in meters,\n\n637\n00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,700\nwe can translate that to feet for\nthose of you that are not metric friendly.\n\n638\n00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,870\nBut at the end of the day we have this\nattenuation rating which represents\n\n639\n00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:25,010\nthe distance that a signal is likely\nto travel on average, in a medium,\n\n640\n00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,740\nin copper or in fiber before\nthe signal either peters out,\n\n641\n00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:32,490\nstops moving forward, or\nhas to be effectively amplified and\n\n642\n00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:35,290\nbrought back up to full strength\nto continue moving forward.\n\n643\n00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,994\nSo this is what the concept\nof attenuation refers to.\n\n644\n00:31:37,994 --> 00:31:41,907\nAnd so attenuation ratings for\ncopper wire, specifically unshielded,\n\n645\n00:31:41,907 --> 00:31:45,693\ntwisted copper wire we think of as\ntraditional ethernet networks today\n\n646\n00:31:45,693 --> 00:31:49,117\nare going to be on average 100\nmeters before we attenuate it.\n\n647\n00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:52,508\nSo what that means is give or\ntake Approximately 100 feet,\n\n648\n00:31:52,508 --> 00:31:54,734\nor excuse me 300 feet 100 meters.\n\n649\n00:31:54,734 --> 00:31:57,200\nNow that is affected by several things.\n\n650\n00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,117\nIts affected by the grade of the cable\nmeaning is it very, very clean copper?\n\n651\n00:32:02,117 --> 00:32:03,720\nSo its very pure?\n\n652\n00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,900\nIs it copper that may have some\nimpurities in it and as a result may not\n\n653\n00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:13,220\nbe able to conduct electricity quite\nas quickly as clean copper wire does.\n\n654\n00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,220\nSo, as a result, there are some\nvariations that we see there.\n\n655\n00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,760\nThis is a measurement, on average,\n\n656\n00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,040\nof attenuation rating,\nmeaning it may 110 meters, it may go 90.\n\n657\n00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,340\nIt's hard to say for sure.\n\n658\n00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,520\nBut if we smooth all that out and\non average, look at it overall,\n\n659\n00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,260\nwe find UTP cable approximately\nattenuates at about 100 meters.\n\n660\n00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,730\nSo, just be aware of that you're nice\nenough to give them that congruence.\n\n661\n00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,770\nWell, just in case.\n\n662\n00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:39,480\nI wouldn't have just yeah,\nI wouldn't have done it.\n\n663\n00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,010\nI would have said there's a calculator,\nright, symmetrics.\n\n664\n00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:47,060\nYou gotta figure it out.\n\n665\n00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,940\nYeah, but it is roughly as you probably\nnow roughly about three feet to the meter.\n\n666\n00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,320\nSo, quickly we do the math.\n\n667\n00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,480\nIt's not that hard.\n\n668\n00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,890\nSo we have 100 meters there.\n\n669\n00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:59,260\nSo coax, coax which remember is the copper\nwire cable that's like cable cable like\n\n670\n00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:04,040\nyou're home cable attenuates at and we\nhave to rate this based on thin net/thick\n\n671\n00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:09,240\nnet so thin net attenuates\nat approximately 185 meters.\n\n672\n00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,240\n185 meters, which is about 600\nfeet by the time you do the math,\n\n673\n00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,070\napproximately, give or take.\n\n674\n00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,410\nAnd Thicknet will attenuate at 500 meters.\n\n675\n00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,630\nThinknet- [LAUGH] Nice.\n\n676\n00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:26,530\nwe are pairing up with IBM, and we're\ngoing to bring out a new cabling standard\n\n677\n00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:30,590\ncalled Thinknet for The Lenovo now,\nit's Lenovo that owns it, right so, for\n\n678\n00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:35,410\nthe Lenovo thinknet network coming\nto a network near you very soon.\n\n679\n00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:40,390\nSo with Thicknet we have 500 meters, 500\nmeters, which is approximately 1500 feet,\n\n680\n00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,775\nright, on average, and then Or\n\n681\n00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:48,480\n1,500 for those of you who are\ngrammatically inclined and like commas.\n\n682\n00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,860\nAnd then for fiber, right, which is using\nlight pulses a little bit different\n\n683\n00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:56,641\nwe attenuated approximately\ntwo kilometers, 2,000 meters.\n\n684\n00:33:56,641 --> 00:33:58,240\nWe just want to be aware of that.\n\n685\n00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,880\nI think they can figure that one out.\n\n686\n00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,170\nYeah.\nIt's roughly, it's about 6,000 feet.\n\n687\n00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,160\nGive or take it's approximately that.\n\n688\n00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,310\nAgain, the real trick there would be,\ncan you convert that to inches and\n\n689\n00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:13,500\nthen milliliters and then bring it\non back to miles before we get done.\n\n690\n00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,960\nI had to go through all those recently\n\n691\n00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,180\nwith one of my daughters trying\nto this whole math thing.\n\n692\n00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,530\nAnd it's going through all these\nmetrics and all this stuff.\n\n693\n00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,250\nAnd in the US,\nwe don't use the metric system.\n\n694\n00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:27,080\nThat's just the way it is and so\nunfortunately I'm hampered by that.\n\n695\n00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,980\nI'm a child of my upbringing, I should\nsay, so the extent of my metric exposure\n\n696\n00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,060\nis what I do in this program right\nhere for these three things.\n\n697\n00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,582\nThat's it.\n[LAUGH] Just a for continuation and\n\n698\n00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:37,510\nthat's all we use it for.\n\n699\n00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,842\nAbsolutely.\n\n700\n00:34:38,842 --> 00:34:41,740\nAll right, so we at least have\na sense now of the cable standards,\n\n701\n00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:45,400\nwe have the cable attenuation rates, we\nknow the different kind of cables added to\n\n702\n00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,670\nour transmission mechanisms,\nanalog, digital- Thicknet and\n\n703\n00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:54,320\nthinnet, broadband, baseband, all those\ndiscussion points we went through.\n\n704\n00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:57,450\nSo we're gonna wrap up this\nconversation in this particular place.\n\n705\n00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,410\nWe're gonna come back and\nwe're gonna continue on.\n\n706\n00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,880\nTalk about some of the additional\nbuilding blocks of networking and\n\n707\n00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,440\nnetwork security as it relates\nto telecommunications.\n\n708\n00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,450\nAll right, sounds like a plan.\n\n709\n00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,780\nHope you guys are with\nus when we get back.\n\n710\n00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:17,674\nSee you in a few.\n[MUSIC]\n\n711\n00:35:17,674 --> 00:35:22,310\nAll right welcome back everybody\nto our telecommunication.\n\n712\n00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,860\nYou can say that in\nnetwork security episode.\n\n713\n00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,860\nIt is isn't it?\n\n714\n00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,998\nWe're going to head into some\nconnectivity devices I think next.\n\n715\n00:35:28,998 --> 00:35:29,880\nWe are absolutely.\n\n716\n00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,150\nSo let's talk about those.\n\n717\n00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,680\nIn our last episode we've been talking\nabout different kinds of cables,\n\n718\n00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,330\ndifferent categories.\n\n719\n00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,660\nTalk about tenuation and\n\n720\n00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,370\none of the key factors around\nproblems with communication.\n\n721\n00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,100\nCabling problems is a tenuation.\n\n722\n00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,850\nSo we talked about B and C connectors.\n\n723\n00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,800\nAnd I want to just quickly throw out\nthe idea of what the ether net based\n\n724\n00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,660\nconnectors are for UTP.\n\n725\n00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,490\nFrom the categories of cables we'd\nreally didn't mention them by name.\n\n726\n00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:55,610\nWe probably just wanna throw that out\nthere quickly as a reference point.\n\n727\n00:35:55,610 --> 00:36:00,750\nSo we have two types and we dealt with\nCAT1 cable, we talked about phone cable.\n\n728\n00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,210\nThat would've been an RJ-11 connector.\n\n729\n00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,780\nIt would've been a four pin.\n\n730\n00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,080\nCopper wire connector with the little\nplastic connection point on it.\n\n731\n00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,480\nWe're used to seeing these for\nnetwork cables today, but\n\n732\n00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,988\nit would have been half the number\nof cables stuck in there.\n\n733\n00:36:11,988 --> 00:36:15,360\nFor traditional cat-5 copper\nwire there's an RJ-11,\n\n734\n00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,000\nMike was just pointing to one,\nthat's your modem connection, if you will.\n\n735\n00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,835\nWe would see an RJ-45 connector,\n\n736\n00:36:21,835 --> 00:36:26,560\nthe RJ-45 connector will be a eight\nwire or a eight pin connector.\n\n737\n00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,060\nWe're used to seeing it and I think we\nrailed on this during the SCP show last\n\n738\n00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:33,820\ntime about the fact you break those little\nconnectors off and they don't stay in.\n\n739\n00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,170\nAnd so you said, oh what about those ones\nthey have now with the shielding on them?\n\n740\n00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,130\nAnd we said, yeah those are annoying\ncuz once you put it in,\n\n741\n00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,360\nyou can never get it out because you can't\nreally press that little nub down since\n\n742\n00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,330\nit's right up against the side of the.\n\n743\n00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,100\nA machine and, you know, so you just\ncan't win with these things, right?\n\n744\n00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,280\nYou end up ripping that off yourself.\n\n745\n00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,950\nYeah. Yeah.\nWind up using some duct tape and\n\n746\n00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,080\njust taping that thing in there and\njust, you know?\n\n747\n00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,460\nYour wired connection now becomes\na standardized connection.\n\n748\n00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,030\nMaybe solder gun and.\n\n749\n00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,800\nRight.\nLittle epoxy or Gorilla Glue or\n\n750\n00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,360\nsomething and never comes undone again.\n\n751\n00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,650\nSo that's what we're talking about\nthere with those connectors.\n\n752\n00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,020\nJust to remind you of that.\n\n753\n00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,630\nAlso, you know,\n\n754\n00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,680\nwe talked generically about attenuation,\nI described what it was.\n\n755\n00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,730\nThe concept is really dealing\nwith this idea of interference.\n\n756\n00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:11,340\nIn this case,\n\n757\n00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,090\nright, just resistance going down the wire\nthat's preventing us from moving forward.\n\n758\n00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,890\nAnd wireless signals continuate as well,\n\n759\n00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,630\njust different type of\nresistance they're running into.\n\n760\n00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,140\nAbsolutely, they do.\n\n761\n00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,990\nAnd we'll talk more about\nthat when we get to wireless,\n\n762\n00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,880\nbut It's a very good point to make.\n\n763\n00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,360\nAnd so we generically have this idea of\njust noise when we're dealing with copper\n\n764\n00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:26,890\nspecifically.\n\n765\n00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:27,690\nWired cable.\n\n766\n00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,740\nElectrical signals.\n\n767\n00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,260\nWe have noise.\n\n768\n00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,370\nWe have attenuation that happens\non the light beam with the.\n\n769\n00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,080\nYeah.\n\n770\n00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,310\nFibers.\nWell, it's a different kind of light beam.\n\n771\n00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:35,960\nScatters.\n\n772\n00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,560\nYeah, hard to keep it.\n\n773\n00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,800\nAnd so it basically fracture.\n\n774\n00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,440\nIt fractures and goes out in all\nthese different directions, and so\n\n775\n00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,350\nyou have to keep it focused.\n\n776\n00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:44,810\nSo that's really about focusing the beam,\nas opposed to allowing it to go wide.\n\n777\n00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,588\nSo the idea of generically of noise,\nright?\n\n778\n00:37:46,588 --> 00:37:48,944\nI'm just making sure we're\nfamiliar with this idea,\n\n779\n00:37:48,944 --> 00:37:51,303\nthat this is one of the key\nissues we deal with cabling.\n\n780\n00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:52,099\nAnd also cross talk.\n\n781\n00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:56,220\nThe reason we shield cables is to make\nsure that we don't have effectively\n\n782\n00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,210\ntwo conversations taking place\nside by side in a conduit.\n\n783\n00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,200\nWe tend to run cable in conduit so\n\n784\n00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,300\nwe run it in a pipe of some\nkind run it side by side.\n\n785\n00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,130\nWe could cross pollinate and\npick up those conversations.\n\n786\n00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:12,060\nI don't know if you are, you may certainly\nhave a point of reference for this.\n\n787\n00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,320\nI remember when I was a kid, some of you\nlistening out there may or may not, but\n\n788\n00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,600\nif you ever had a party line- Yeah,\nyeah- Not the kind we think of today.\n\n789\n00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,881\nNo, I didn't have one of those,\nbut I [CROSSTALK] talking about.\n\n790\n00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,332\nBut if you ever had a phone line,\nanalog phone line, that,\n\n791\n00:38:23,332 --> 00:38:26,814\ndepending on where you lived, depending on\npart of the world you're in we call these\n\n792\n00:38:26,814 --> 00:38:30,198\nthings party lines because you would pick\nup the phone and somebody else might be on\n\n793\n00:38:30,198 --> 00:38:33,540\nyour phone line having a conversation\nwhile you were trying to have one.\n\n794\n00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,130\nAnd that's the idea of crosstalk.\n\n795\n00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:39,060\nAnd so the older phones systems, if\nthey were switched by accident you could\n\n796\n00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,270\neffectively bond a line and\njoin two conversations together.\n\n797\n00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,690\nSo you have to be aware of that.\n\n798\n00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:47,290\nAnd so cross talk is this idea of\nhaving information cross pollinating or\n\n799\n00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,890\ncrossing between the lines.\n\n800\n00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:51,020\nAnd so\nwe shield the cable in order to do that.\n\n801\n00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,200\nWe wrap it with additional\nlayers of plastic or\n\n802\n00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,010\npolyvinyl chloride or metal foil or You\nknow, mash, different things we do, right?\n\n803\n00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,400\nWe may wrap the wire and\ntwist a certain number of times, and\n\n804\n00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,980\nwrap each individual strand.\n\n805\n00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:06,350\nThere's different ways of shielding, but\nat the end of the day, this is gonna\n\n806\n00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:10,130\nprevent crosstalk, which is basically the\nsignal spillover from one to the other.\n\n807\n00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,680\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n808\n00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,640\nWe also grade cable to run\nit inside of crawl spaces.\n\n809\n00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,080\nWe'll talk about plenum\ncable that's graded.\n\n810\n00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,820\nAnd so plenum grading for\ncable is gonna be this cable\n\n811\n00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:24,250\nthat's rated to go either under the floors\nof raised flooring inside data centers.\n\n812\n00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,410\nOr up in the ceilings and the crawl\nspaces, doesn't really matter where.\n\n813\n00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:31,660\nThis is plenum grade cable which has been\ntreated with fire retardant material,\n\n814\n00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,390\nso the cable will not burst into flame and\n\n815\n00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,425\nshoot the flame down\nthe conduit spreading it.\n\n816\n00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:38,875\nIt may smolder but\nit's not gonna catch fire.\n\n817\n00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:39,845\nIt's nice and snug.\n\n818\n00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:43,392\nYou can feel it when you pick up a piece\nof plenum versus a non-plenum wire.\n\n819\n00:39:43,392 --> 00:39:46,165\nThe non-plenum you can feel the individual\nwires inside the outer jack in the plenum-\n\n820\n00:39:46,165 --> 00:39:46,765\nKinda moves.\n\n821\n00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:49,015\nYou can almost feel it move.\n\n822\n00:39:49,015 --> 00:39:49,618\nVery tight.\n\n823\n00:39:49,618 --> 00:39:52,567\nNo air therefore the fire's\nnot gonna be able to spread.\n\n824\n00:39:52,567 --> 00:39:53,459\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n825\n00:39:53,459 --> 00:39:54,343\nSlow it down anyway.\n\n826\n00:39:54,343 --> 00:39:57,500\nSo if you're ever stuck\non a desert island And\n\n827\n00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,086\nyou have to make a snorkel out\nof plenum cable, you're screwed.\n\n828\n00:40:02,086 --> 00:40:06,900\n[LAUGH] You're not gonna survive, so\nmake sure you take normal cable with you.\n\n829\n00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,010\nThat's right, normal cable only.\n\n830\n00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:08,860\nAs opposed to plenum cable.\n\n831\n00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,155\nOtherwise, you're gonna have a problem.\n\n832\n00:40:10,155 --> 00:40:13,330\n[LAUGH] All right, so we've kinda\nlaid out just some of the background,\n\n833\n00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,060\nthought processes,\nsome of these little odds and\n\n834\n00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,010\nends pieces we just wanna bring back\nin and help us to look back and\n\n835\n00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,990\nthen look forward around setting\nup our connectivity devices.\n\n836\n00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,580\nThen we're going to\n\n837\n00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,880\nmove into our network topology Mm-hm\nin a couple minutes here as well.\n\n838\n00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,730\nSo, I thought it would be good just to\nreview some of our network connectivity\n\n839\n00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,140\ndevices for you.\n\n840\n00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,680\nAgain, reaching backwards a little\nbit to one of our prior shows and\n\n841\n00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,430\nepisodes, Mm-hm.\n\n842\n00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,800\nAround the OSI model.\n\n843\n00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,650\nKinda putting these in perspective.\n\n844\n00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,710\nLayering in that functionality and\n\n845\n00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:40,170\nthat formality around how we see\nthese devices and what they do.\n\n846\n00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:43,255\nSo, we have things like a patch panel,\nthis is gonna be simply where are we,\n\n847\n00:40:43,255 --> 00:40:46,245\non the wall, see the cabling\ndropping in from our conduit.\n\n848\n00:40:46,245 --> 00:40:47,445\nDo our punch downs there, and\n\n849\n00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,325\nthen we can do our front end plates\nwhere we punch, basically, punch in and\n\n850\n00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:54,317\nconnect one or more of the end points,\none or more of the devices.\n\n851\n00:40:54,317 --> 00:40:56,737\nHave a variety of different\nways of doing this.\n\n852\n00:40:56,737 --> 00:41:01,317\nFiber patch panels do look different\nthan Ethernet and coax connections.\n\n853\n00:41:01,317 --> 00:41:04,187\nAnd for instance, token ring,\nthose S mouths are mouths.\n\n854\n00:41:04,187 --> 00:41:06,037\nRemember we did that in the SSCP class.\n\n855\n00:41:06,037 --> 00:41:07,207\nWe brought one of those up.\n\n856\n00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:09,377\nSo, yeah, those things gonna\nlook a little different as well.\n\n857\n00:41:09,377 --> 00:41:10,347\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n858\n00:41:10,347 --> 00:41:13,782\nThe idea, the concept that a patch panel\nis simply that place where we plug in.\n\n859\n00:41:13,782 --> 00:41:15,047\nMm-hm.\n\n860\n00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:16,987\nSo next on our list there,\nwhat else do we have?\n\n861\n00:41:16,987 --> 00:41:18,400\nThe hub.\nWe had our hub layer.\n\n862\n00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,770\nOur address, rather our player one.\n\n863\n00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:24,330\nWe had our hub, there was\nan extra space there we needed to\n\n864\n00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:27,000\ncatch the eye as I scanned across\nthe note as we were talking.\n\n865\n00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,520\nThere we go.\n\n866\n00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520\nThere, oh I see, that's better.\n\n867\n00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,950\nNow I know to stop,\nit's a dramatic pause right?\n\n868\n00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:31,490\nThat's right.\n\n869\n00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,810\nSo we have a hub there.\n\n870\n00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,840\nA hub is considered to be a dumb device,\n\n871\n00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,210\nmeaning there's really no\nmanagement capability.\n\n872\n00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:40,110\nNo smarts, interactivity of any kind.\n\n873\n00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,960\nComes in one board,\nit goes out of every other board.\n\n874\n00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,748\nAbsolutely.\n\n875\n00:41:42,748 --> 00:41:43,820\nWe just plug it in.\n\n876\n00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:47,130\nSo in effect what we're doing is we're\ncreating a connectivity replicator,\n\n877\n00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,350\nwe allow connectivity to be kind of\nmoved from one place to another to\n\n878\n00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,300\nset with the hub.\n\n879\n00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,870\nBut it's much like, I think of it as\nan electrical power strip, right?\n\n880\n00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,910\nWe just plug in and connect things, but\nthere's really no way to manage that.\n\n881\n00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,280\nYou have no idea of what's happening.\n\n882\n00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,100\nTurn the whole strip off.\n\n883\n00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,060\nTurn the whole strip on.\n\n884\n00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,940\nCan't do it individually.\n\n885\n00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:02,650\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n886\n00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,970\nRight.\nSo as a result,\n\n887\n00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:05,650\na hub is considered to\nbe a layer one device,\n\n888\n00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:08,770\na physical connectivity device down\nat the bottom of the OSI model.\n\n889\n00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,880\nYou don't really see hubs\nindependently anymore.\n\n890\n00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:15,070\nThe technology and the functionality of a\nhub is built into the upper layer devices\n\n891\n00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:19,230\nthese days, simply a switch, is where we\nsee that connectivity being built in.\n\n892\n00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:22,490\nSame thing, although it's not on this\nlist, with line conditioners, right?\n\n893\n00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:26,260\nConditioning the power on the lines, it's\nkind of all rolled up into the switch,\n\n894\n00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,440\nreally as a function there as well.\n\n895\n00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,900\nSo bridges are considered\nto be Layer 2 devices,\n\n896\n00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,660\nwe talked about this when we\nwent through the OSI model.\n\n897\n00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,270\nThis is just a quick reminder of\nthat bridges are going to exist\n\n898\n00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,490\ntraditionally layer two.\n\n899\n00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:41,600\nNot real popular anymore on the physical\nside, although you do see them.\n\n900\n00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,210\nYou see them more on the wireless side\nwhen we're connecting maybe two campus\n\n901\n00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,420\nbuildings together,\ncreate a bridge to link them.\n\n902\n00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:50,540\nAny place that can't really run\ncable again might use those bridges.\n\n903\n00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,040\nCould, right?\nAnd\n\n904\n00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,630\nthen we can bring in different\nconnectivity types with a bridge.\n\n905\n00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:54,440\nRight?\nSo we can\n\n906\n00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,730\nbring different network typology types,\nconnectivity types together.\n\n907\n00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:01,570\nA switch is considered a layer two device,\nalthough we obviously see it running up\n\n908\n00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:05,730\nand down the OSI model, depending on\ncomplexity and function and expense.\n\n909\n00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,600\nYou see them at layer three\ncertainly all the time.\n\n910\n00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,505\nProbably have layer three switches in most\nof our networks, as well as layer two.\n\n911\n00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,955\nThose are managed devices, they're\ntypically a little bit more smart and\n\n912\n00:43:14,955 --> 00:43:18,245\na little bit more capability because they\nexpose a different layer of the OSI model\n\n913\n00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:19,885\nthan a layer 2 switch would.\n\n914\n00:43:19,885 --> 00:43:23,070\nThen routers are typically\nconsidered to be layer 3 devices.\n\n915\n00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,080\nThen we have things like WAPs,\nWireless Access Points, repeaters.\n\n916\n00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,970\nAgain, that functionality typically\nrolled up with the HUB, and\n\n917\n00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,560\nthe line conditioner and the switch today.\n\n918\n00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,090\nDon't intend to see repeaters\nseparately anymore but those are there.\n\n919\n00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:37,830\nConcentrators, where we bring a lot\nof connectivity together typically on\n\n920\n00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:39,110\nthe VPN side.\n\n921\n00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,240\nMore often than not,\n\n922\n00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,950\nkind of technology that's going by\nthe wayside a little bit as well.\n\n923\n00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:46,370\nWe have modems right so we're again\ntalking about some older technology,\n\n924\n00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:49,220\nbut just kinds of connectivity\ndevices we may see.\n\n925\n00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,600\nMultiplexors, which would have\n\n926\n00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,820\nbeen used to bring in a lot of\nconnectivity types and link them all.\n\n927\n00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,200\nSo fiber, and token ring,\nand maybe ethernet all\n\n928\n00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,770\ntogether into one system would have used\nthe multiplexor to be able to do that.\n\n929\n00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:07,000\nNetwork interface cards,\njust generically mix, right?\n\n930\n00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,730\nAnd then firewall,\ndifferent firewall types,\n\n931\n00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,930\nwe'll have a discussion on that at\nsome point in a future episode.\n\n932\n00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:16,223\nProxy servers and other kind of\nconnectivity device that would effectively\n\n933\n00:44:16,223 --> 00:44:19,361\nallow us to go out and request information\non behalf of multiple users and\n\n934\n00:44:19,361 --> 00:44:21,750\nbring it back in and\nspeed up the access, right?\n\n935\n00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:22,520\nCash it.\n\n936\n00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,610\nRAS, or remote access server solutions and\nVPNs as well, right?\n\n937\n00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,838\nVPN concentrators and/or VPNs generically.\n\n938\n00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:30,660\nMm-hm.\nAgain, connectivity solutions.\n\n939\n00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:35,280\nSo these are just kind of a top ten,\ntop 15 hit list of all the big\n\n940\n00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,800\nconnectivity solutions that we may see\nout there in different kinds of networks.\n\n941\n00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,270\nAnd we'll be talking about one or\nmore of these as we go out and\n\n942\n00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,650\nreally start delving into how some\nof this stuff comes together.\n\n943\n00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:47,306\nSo let's go out, let's talk about\nour network topologies a little bit.\n\n944\n00:44:47,306 --> 00:44:51,000\nWe have these different ways of\narchitecting network connectivity,\n\n945\n00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,820\nthese are pretty traditional on the LAN\nside, we see this concept of a bus.\n\n946\n00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:57,900\nA bus would have been used with,\nfor instance,\n\n947\n00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,240\ncoaxial technology, thin-net or thick-net,\n\n948\n00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,590\nmore often than not, thick-net because of\nthe 1500 meter attenuation distance there.\n\n949\n00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:08,640\nAnd so we will see these long runs of\ncables that allow us to connect one or\n\n950\n00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,720\nmore systems up.\n\n951\n00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,553\nWe talked about this idea of vamping,\n\n952\n00:45:11,553 --> 00:45:15,260\ndoing a vampire tap to connect in\neffectively with the BNC connector.\n\n953\n00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:19,815\nThe upside to bus was you had a very long\npotential attenuation distance could\n\n954\n00:45:19,815 --> 00:45:23,855\nhook up a lot of systems into\na thick net run on the bus.\n\n955\n00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:26,915\nIt was a straight run logically in\nthe sense that we thought of it like a bus\n\n956\n00:45:26,915 --> 00:45:29,805\nline, a well defined route,\neverybody knew where to connect.\n\n957\n00:45:29,805 --> 00:45:32,675\nThe downside was that if\nyou got off the bus, right,\n\n958\n00:45:32,675 --> 00:45:37,195\nbefore everybody else did everybody\nelse basically was stranded.\n\n959\n00:45:37,195 --> 00:45:41,191\nAnd so what we meant by that was if you\nbroke the connection and in effect broke\n\n960\n00:45:41,191 --> 00:45:44,562\nthe circuit that was created on\nthe bus line by shutting off one or\n\n961\n00:45:44,562 --> 00:45:45,840\nmore of the machines.\n\n962\n00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,140\nRight.\nOr somehow disconnecting,\n\n963\n00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,070\nbreaking that connection,\nhowever you did that, if you went dark and\n\n964\n00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:54,150\nbroke the circuit, everybody on that\nline basically went dark as well.\n\n965\n00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,513\nSo a significant downside there,\nwith buses,\n\n966\n00:45:56,513 --> 00:46:00,470\nwhich is one of the reasons why we really\ndon't see them out in production much,\n\n967\n00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,791\nat least in most networks,\ntoday very often.\n\n968\n00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:07,937\nWe have star topology there and a star\ntopology, just like a token ring and\n\n969\n00:46:07,937 --> 00:46:11,933\na mesh, is going to be a logical\nas opposed to a physical.\n\n970\n00:46:11,933 --> 00:46:13,560\n[LAUGH] We want to make\nsure you understand.\n\n971\n00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,420\nI think I shared with you the SSEP program\nthat we did, the story about the fact that\n\n972\n00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:21,930\nI've had several students over the years\nthat have come in and asked me, okay so\n\n973\n00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:22,820\nwe're talking about a star.\n\n974\n00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,670\nSo actually is it really a star?\n\n975\n00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:25,680\nIs it really a ring?\n\n976\n00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,200\nNo.\nWe don't do duck duck goose,\n\n977\n00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,010\nit's not a ring.\n\n978\n00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:31,050\nIt's not a physical topology,\nit's a logical topology.\n\n979\n00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,250\nAnd, as a result,\n\n980\n00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:35,730\nwhat we talk about is the way in which we\nare configuring the network to behave.\n\n981\n00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:39,980\nThis is not a physical layout,\nwe don't put all of our cubes into a star.\n\n982\n00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,640\nWe walk into the office and\n\n983\n00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,170\nsee everybody in the pentagram in the\nmiddle of the floor, something like that.\n\n984\n00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:47,290\nNo, it doesn't work that way,\nit's a logical star,\n\n985\n00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,530\nphysically your office is laid\nout the way it would be, right?\n\n986\n00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:53,420\nYou typically have a cube form of some\nkind, people are laid out in rows.\n\n987\n00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:57,075\nVery neatly stacked, much like The Matrix,\nright, and then they just plug in and\n\n988\n00:46:57,075 --> 00:46:59,428\nwe extract the life and\nthe energy out of them.\n\n989\n00:46:59,428 --> 00:47:03,027\n[LAUGH] In order to power our networks.\n\n990\n00:47:03,027 --> 00:47:03,905\nSo, I digress.\n\n991\n00:47:03,905 --> 00:47:04,868\nI digress.\nRight, so\n\n992\n00:47:04,868 --> 00:47:07,325\nit's the subject of another conversation.\n\n993\n00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:13,080\nSo the star network topology is going\nto be using the same concept of a bus.\n\n994\n00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,420\nWe think about this idea of connecting\nmachines into a network run, but\n\n995\n00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,510\nwe don't lose connectivity\nif one of them unplugs.\n\n996\n00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:20,520\nThis is the key thing.\n\n997\n00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,790\nBecause when we add to the star\nis we add a switch, right?\n\n998\n00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:27,130\nAnd so instead of a connectivity\nsolution that's directly connecting to\n\n999\n00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,190\nthe cable, right?\n\n1000\n00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,910\nWe're doing this through a star,\nand so the star allows us, or\n\n1001\n00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,660\nrather through the switch\nto create the star,\n\n1002\n00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:36,390\nwhich allows us to connect these different\nend points up, but disconnect one or\n\n1003\n00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:39,565\nmore of them on demand while all the\nothers stay connected through the switch.\n\n1004\n00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,850\nYeah.\nNow what we've, I'm sorry.\n\n1005\n00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:41,510\nGo ahead.\nEach one of those\n\n1006\n00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:44,810\nnodes ends up with basically a point to\npoint connection back to that switch.\n\n1007\n00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:47,339\nSo if you pull one of them out, it doesn't\naffect the other nodes that are hooked to\n\n1008\n00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:50,815\nthat same circuit And what we've\neffectively done is just transferred that\n\n1009\n00:47:50,815 --> 00:47:54,501\nidea of where we create the break in\nthe circuit, from away from the line To\n\n1010\n00:47:54,501 --> 00:47:58,140\nthe device, and so as long as the switch\nstays powered on, we're good.\n\n1011\n00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:01,179\nIf the switch goes down,\nthen anybody connected to that switch,\n\n1012\n00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:02,490\nloses connectivity.\n\n1013\n00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,930\nBut any other switches\nthat are connected up,\n\n1014\n00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,230\nwould be connected as long\nas they stay powered on.\n\n1015\n00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:09,740\nSo we just push that kind\nof out a little bit; we've\n\n1016\n00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:11,260\nmoved the boundaries so to speak.\n\n1017\n00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,230\nToken ring is going to be a logical ring,\nand\n\n1018\n00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,460\na physical topology would\nlook like a star, right?\n\n1019\n00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:20,150\nYou would see people sitting in,\nbasically their office space, normally.\n\n1020\n00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:23,410\nThe difference is, we used different kind\nof proprietary equipment for token rings.\n\n1021\n00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:25,840\nThis was an IBM networking standard.\n\n1022\n00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,210\nThey created it,\nthey sold the technology for it, so\n\n1023\n00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:31,430\nyou had to buy special network cards,\nspecial hubs, and\n\n1024\n00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:36,340\nswitches which were called mals or s mals,\nand the connectors were also special.\n\n1025\n00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,940\nThey look almost like alligator\nclips with a big head on them,\n\n1026\n00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,350\nplugged in sideways to the MaU.\n\n1027\n00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,970\nThere was usually an eight port Mal.\n\n1028\n00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,010\nWe had a picture of one\nthe last time we did this.\n\n1029\n00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:49,410\nSo we could do that while we are talking,\nif you want?\n\n1030\n00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:53,840\nSo the idea with a token ring,\nis we would logically instantiate,\n\n1031\n00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,280\nlogically set up and run the ring,\neither in clockwise or\n\n1032\n00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,790\ncounter clockwise solution\nwhen we set it up.\n\n1033\n00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:03,150\nSo you would initialize in effect,\nthe system, by going in and\n\n1034\n00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,680\nspecifying which direction you\nwant the token to be passed.\n\n1035\n00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,490\nAnd then once you set that up it's the\ndirection or flow, It's actually, I think,\n\n1036\n00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,440\nthe exact one we use.\n\n1037\n00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,710\nThat is isn't it.\n\n1038\n00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,460\nAnd so you can see that was what a MAL,\na multi-station access unit,\n\n1039\n00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:20,000\notherwise known as a HUB, or a switch,\ndepending on what you prefer.\n\n1040\n00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,280\nMore like a hub than a switch, but\nbasically kind of a combination of both.\n\n1041\n00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:28,800\nSo this is your IBM model 8220 or\n8228 there.\n\n1042\n00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,750\nI see a ring in.\n\n1043\n00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,900\nBoy, the good old days of ring in,\nring out.\n\n1044\n00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:36,380\nThis is your uploadm or\nyour crossover on your switch, right?\n\n1045\n00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,510\nSo, you'd have an eight port mount,\nand they would plug in.\n\n1046\n00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,950\nYou would plug in sideways.\n\n1047\n00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:43,400\nYou would plug an alligator clip-like\ninterface on the end of a cable,\n\n1048\n00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,150\ninto sideways in each of those boxes,\nto be able to hook them up, right?\n\n1049\n00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:49,140\nFun stuff.\n\n1050\n00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:49,725\nYeah, yeah.\n\n1051\n00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:54,480\n[LAUGH] Kept all that old gear,and\nmade a killing on dedicating, or\n\n1052\n00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,260\ndonating all that stuff to somebody.\n\n1053\n00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,360\nAll right, so that's what we see there.\n\n1054\n00:49:57,360 --> 00:49:59,750\nSo that is what a MAu would have looked\nlike, that's what token ring was.\n\n1055\n00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:02,470\nAnd so IBM's token ring standard,\nwould have set up the ring,\n\n1056\n00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:05,560\ninitialized the flow clockwise,\ncounterclockwise, and then\n\n1057\n00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:09,780\ntokens were pass representation of access\nand availability to transmit, to pass.\n\n1058\n00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,870\nDeterministic network.\n\n1059\n00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:12,260\nDeterministic network as well.\n\n1060\n00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,650\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n1061\n00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:14,910\nAnd then we added dual ring.\n\n1062\n00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:19,800\nA dual ring is what we see now with\nfiber token rings, what we call FDDI.\n\n1063\n00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,120\nThese are used for man metropolitan area\nnetworks, where we wire up whole cities\n\n1064\n00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,840\nWith high speed fiber, running at\nopposite ends in parallel to one another.\n\n1065\n00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,460\nSo one goes clockwise, one goes counter\nclockwise, and if one ring gets broken,\n\n1066\n00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:32,640\nthe other is still up and running.\n\n1067\n00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,830\nSo this is what we call\na dual ring technology.\n\n1068\n00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:39,160\nIt is used today as primarily to set\nup major metropolitan area networks.\n\n1069\n00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:43,520\nAnd mesh typology would have been a\ncomplete overlay, where every connectivity\n\n1070\n00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,260\ndevice is connected to every other device,\nin like a spider web effect.\n\n1071\n00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:50,210\nSo this is for,\nreally you can't scale the mesh very well.\n\n1072\n00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:51,682\nIt could be a you know,\n\n1073\n00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:55,630\n10,000 network right, we'd run out of\ncables before we had enough room to do it.\n\n1074\n00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:59,030\nLike three, four machines that had to\nbe totally redundant with each other,\n\n1075\n00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,380\nyou create a mesh on a small scale.\n\n1076\n00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,870\nYou can't really create it on a very\nlarge scale, it's not very practical,\n\n1077\n00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:06,990\nbut it means every network point\nis connected to every other.\n\n1078\n00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:08,980\nSo the switches are redundant.\n\n1079\n00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,560\nRight, if we're doing a star,\n\n1080\n00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,000\nthen all of the connections from\neach of the machines is redundant.\n\n1081\n00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,040\nSo for a three node network with a mesh,\nyou need four network points in every\n\n1082\n00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,950\nmachine, right, because you have to have\none connection out to every other machine.\n\n1083\n00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:21,660\nSo, you know it would have to have that.\n\n1084\n00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,210\nSomething we might see in\na storage area network,\n\n1085\n00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:24,780\nthough, where we need that redundancy.\n\n1086\n00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,680\nWe do, right.\nYou would see them\n\n1087\n00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,120\nin those kind of networks, but\nagain, those are small in a sense and\n\n1088\n00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,570\nthey're very well defined small\nnumber of connection points.\n\n1089\n00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:33,620\nAll the people coming in,\nare coming in on multi path connections.\n\n1090\n00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,250\nSo you don't have million connections\nthat are active, you have three or\n\n1091\n00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:37,720\nfour that are dedicated between the nodes.\n\n1092\n00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,340\nSo that's exactly where we would see it.\n\n1093\n00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:42,190\nVery, very good, Doctor Watson.\n\n1094\n00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:45,030\nAnd so then we have also the idea\nof combining these together, right,\n\n1095\n00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,110\nwe may create something called a star bus,\n\n1096\n00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:49,390\nwhich is what we see in traditional\nin most traditional networks.\n\n1097\n00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:52,970\nSo they would call hybrid, where you\nmay use the benefit of the star and\n\n1098\n00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:57,670\nthe attenuation distance capacity of\na bus, to be able to link floors and\n\n1099\n00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:01,030\noffices together in large\nhigh-end office buildings.\n\n1100\n00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:05,180\nWhere we have to run star networks out on\nthe floors, but the bus is going to link\n\n1101\n00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:09,760\nthose floors and we often run those, as\nyou pointed out to me on one of our other\n\n1102\n00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,790\nepisodes, we tend to see this running\nin elevator shafts a lot of the times,\n\n1103\n00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,220\nright in the core of the building,\nwe may see that running there.\n\n1104\n00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:17,680\nSo just be aware of that also,\nand be thinking about that.\n\n1105\n00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,980\nSo that's our network topology,\n\n1106\n00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:23,420\nand kind of thinking through that,\nwe then have really\n\n1107\n00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:27,700\nto discuss this idea of how we then create\naccess running on top of these networks.\n\n1108\n00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:29,990\nIt's not enough just to be able\nto connect these up together, and\n\n1109\n00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:33,360\nsay yep we've got a mesh, or a bus,\nand so now we can connect everything.\n\n1110\n00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,170\nWe want to make sure that we understand\nhow to actually access information\n\n1111\n00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:40,890\nacross the wire, if we will, and so\nwe have these media access technology\n\n1112\n00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,420\ncharacteristics that we\nhave to think about,\n\n1113\n00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:45,490\nour media access Methods that\nwe want to think about, right.\n\n1114\n00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:48,970\nAnd so in ethernet networks, where we\nthink about an ethernet, or we think about\n\n1115\n00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:53,770\na wired network, we're going to talk\nabout CSMA/CD Collision Detection.\n\n1116\n00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:55,900\nWe're going to talk about CSMA/CA,\n\n1117\n00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:59,290\nCollision Avoidance up there for\nwireless networks.\n\n1118\n00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,620\nRight, both of them\nare going to be important.\n\n1119\n00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:07,050\nAnd the CSMA Carrier Sense Multiple Access\ntechnology, is used in these areas.\n\n1120\n00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:09,800\nWe also have this idea of token\npassing on a token network, right.\n\n1121\n00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,810\nSo, in FTDI, in fiber rings, or\n\n1122\n00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:15,770\nin token rings, we would see token\npassing, and poling, where we go out and,\n\n1123\n00:53:15,770 --> 00:53:19,560\nbasically, check on upstream and\ndownstream heart beating in effect.\n\n1124\n00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,200\nCheck on statuses and other media\naccess method that could be used.\n\n1125\n00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,510\nBut in our ethernet networks,\nwe're focused on collision detection and\n\n1126\n00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:27,410\ncollision avoidance.\n\n1127\n00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:29,210\nLet's talk about those for a minute.\n\n1128\n00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,910\nSo the idea with collision detection,\n\n1129\n00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,850\nlet's take that one first,\nstart with that one.\n\n1130\n00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,150\nThis idea that when we send\na signal down a copper wire,\n\n1131\n00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:41,016\nusing the OSI model,\ncome down the stack from 7 to 1.\n\n1132\n00:53:41,016 --> 00:53:45,550\nGo out the back end of the machine,\nacross the wire, and we send this burst of\n\n1133\n00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:50,210\nelectrical energy down the copper wire,\ntraveling down the wire, towards\n\n1134\n00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:53,850\nthe endpoint that we have identified,\nthat we want to send to, wherever that is.\n\n1135\n00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:58,630\nWe have now put some energy on the copper\nwire, and we can effectively listen for\n\n1136\n00:53:58,630 --> 00:54:02,490\nthat energy, as it passes by each\nof the nodes on the network.\n\n1137\n00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:07,150\nAnd so we can sense that there is\na change in voltage up on the wire.\n\n1138\n00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:10,330\nAnd so this is what carrier\nsense multiple access means.\n\n1139\n00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:12,440\nWe're listening to the copper wire.\n\n1140\n00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:14,210\nWe're sensing a change in voltage.\n\n1141\n00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:15,620\nThe network card is able to do that.\n\n1142\n00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:19,320\nIt has built in electronics.\n\n1143\n00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,320\nAnd effectively the architecture of\nit is such, that it can do that.\n\n1144\n00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,030\nAnd so when a data packet is sent down\nthe wire, change in voltage happens.\n\n1145\n00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:29,810\nAnd when the spike in voltage occurs,\nwe know there's activity on the wire.\n\n1146\n00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:33,120\nSo what happens at that point is,\nwe start looking for those packets.\n\n1147\n00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,210\nThey go out, we look at them,\nwe may interject, and\n\n1148\n00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:41,030\nmay inspect it and check the layer two\naddress to see if it's meant for us or\n\n1149\n00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:44,090\nnot, or move it up the stack\nto layer three, who knows.\n\n1150\n00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,480\nBut at the end of the day,\nwhether it's for us or\n\n1151\n00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,680\nnot, it's still travelling down the wire.\n\n1152\n00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,300\nNow, just like with anything else, we can\neither send or receive at any one time,\n\n1153\n00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:54,440\nbut we're not really doing those\nsimultaneously in real time.\n\n1154\n00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,030\nIt seems like we are,\nbecause we measure time in our world,\n\n1155\n00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:00,810\nas humans, really down to,\nwe can say about a second.\n\n1156\n00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:04,450\nIt's very hard to get your mind around\nsomething below a second of time.\n\n1157\n00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:08,125\nRight, I mean the time it takes you to\nblink your eyes, is less than a second,\n\n1158\n00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:10,110\nand we can't really imagine that.\n\n1159\n00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,980\nSo, say it takes like a second or two.\n\n1160\n00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,510\nBut we time slice inside computers,\nto down to the millisecond, or\n\n1161\n00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:17,840\nmaybe even lower than that\n,depending on how we go right?\n\n1162\n00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:22,610\nAnd so this millisecond time value is much\ntoo quick for a human being to really\n\n1163\n00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:27,410\ngrasp, in real time and understand, so the\nsystem is monitoring and measuring this.\n\n1164\n00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:29,770\nAnd so when we say, we don't always\nsend and receive in real time.\n\n1165\n00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:32,870\nWe send and/or receive as a single entity,\n\n1166\n00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,460\na single operation, but\nnot simultaneously.\n\n1167\n00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,000\nRight.\nBecause we use time slicing in\n\n1168\n00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,410\nmilliseconds, to specify whether\nwe're doing one or the other.\n\n1169\n00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:41,570\nAnd so, as a result, right.\n\n1170\n00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:43,325\nWhen we're sending down the wire,\n\n1171\n00:55:43,325 --> 00:55:47,025\nif another machine tries to send a package\nat the same time, a data packet.\n\n1172\n00:55:47,025 --> 00:55:51,797\nThey could collide with one another, much\nlike two cars coming down the road in real\n\n1173\n00:55:51,797 --> 00:55:54,465\ntime, and\nplaying chicken with one another.\n\n1174\n00:55:54,465 --> 00:55:57,006\nSomebody doesn't decide\nthey're going to turn, Right?\n\n1175\n00:55:57,006 --> 00:55:59,108\nWe have some sort of a collision.\n\n1176\n00:55:59,108 --> 00:56:02,751\nAnd we see collisions represented in\nthe real world, in the physical world,\n\n1177\n00:56:02,751 --> 00:56:06,058\non our switches by seeing blinking\nlights that typically are orange or\n\n1178\n00:56:06,058 --> 00:56:08,990\nperhaps red or yellow,\ndepending on the switch you have.\n\n1179\n00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:12,810\nWhereas green is gonna signify good,\nconsistent packets moving back and\n\n1180\n00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:13,960\nforth and connectivity.\n\n1181\n00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,350\nSo if we have a collision, and\n\n1182\n00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:18,660\nwe do fairly often, this is not unusual,\nif we have collisions\n\n1183\n00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,820\ndata has to be resent because packages\nhave basically been destroyed.\n\n1184\n00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:25,730\nAnd so what we try to do is detect that\ncollision to know that we have to resend.\n\n1185\n00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:29,320\nAnd this is what the CD,\nthe collision detection solution for\n\n1186\n00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,090\nwired lans is going to be.\n\n1187\n00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:36,010\nIf there is a collision detected on\nthe wire, what happens is both sender and\n\n1188\n00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:39,620\nreceiver, so the starting point and\nthe end point, have to back off.\n\n1189\n00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,682\nThis is what we refer to it as, and\n\n1190\n00:56:41,682 --> 00:56:45,677\nthey then have to then figure out\nhow to resend that data packet.\n\n1191\n00:56:45,677 --> 00:56:48,525\nBut re-sending means we have to\nwait a certain amount of time,\n\n1192\n00:56:48,525 --> 00:56:51,267\nbecause if they both resend\nagain at the same time randomly,\n\n1193\n00:56:51,267 --> 00:56:55,120\nwe're going to have the same\ncollision effectively, right?\n\n1194\n00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,760\nRight.\nSo instead what we have to do,\n\n1195\n00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,640\nis we have to run some sort of random\noffset, as you put down there,\n\n1196\n00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,520\nthat effectively kicks in inside the\nnetworking stack and allows us to generate\n\n1197\n00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,330\na value that says okay you're going to\nwait two milliseconds, Mike, and I'm going\n\n1198\n00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:11,440\nto wait four, and whoever has the lower\nvalue gets to go first, in effect, right?\n\n1199\n00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,970\nAnd if you resend before I do, in theory,\nthat data pack should get through,\n\n1200\n00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:15,730\nwe should have no collision.\n\n1201\n00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:17,000\nShould avoid the collision.\n\n1202\n00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,890\nSo we use typically the spanning tree\nalgorithm more often than not in most of\n\n1203\n00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:22,120\nthese to do our random offsets.\n\n1204\n00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,190\nThere may be some variation there\ndepending on the specific kind\n\n1205\n00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:29,730\nof the network stack you're implementing,\nhow it's compiled and what it does.\n\n1206\n00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:33,310\nBut, on average, more often than not,\nthis is what we see.\n\n1207\n00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,234\nYeah, 'i-t-h-m' I think.\n\n1208\n00:57:34,234 --> 00:57:36,410\n[LAUGHTER] Yeah I was reaching deep for\nthat one.\n\n1209\n00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,594\nI would've gone with the 'y' myself there.\n\n1210\n00:57:38,594 --> 00:57:40,880\n'Rhithm' as in 'rhythm,' right?\n\n1211\n00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,570\nThat would have been me, so\nI would've gone there too.\n\n1212\n00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:45,050\nSo using spinning tree algorithms\nis typically what we see for\n\n1213\n00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:47,430\nthe execution of the offset.\n\n1214\n00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:49,150\nIf we need to come up with\nthe offset parameter.\n\n1215\n00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:50,770\nSo we step back effectively.\n\n1216\n00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:53,440\nAs long as we randomly choose\nan offset that is not the same,\n\n1217\n00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,910\nwe can then typically\nreset with no trouble.\n\n1218\n00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:58,670\nIf we happen to choose the same\none randomly, and again, every so\n\n1219\n00:57:58,670 --> 00:57:59,850\nmany times that will happen.\n\n1220\n00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:02,600\nAnd there's other nodes\nthat we might collide with.\n\n1221\n00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,780\nWhen we've avoided our\ncollision this time, but\n\n1222\n00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:06,090\nit will collide with somebody else.\n\n1223\n00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,014\nRight.\nAnd we have to do the whole\n\n1224\n00:58:07,014 --> 00:58:07,750\nthing over again.\n\n1225\n00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,420\nKind of like driving in South Florida.\n\n1226\n00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:10,495\nYeah, pretty much.\n\n1227\n00:58:10,495 --> 00:58:14,140\n[LAUGH] So as a result of that what we'll\nsee is that we can have a lot of these\n\n1228\n00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:15,510\ncollisions happening in real time.\n\n1229\n00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:18,190\nWe simply just step back,\nkeep recalculating,\n\n1230\n00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:21,670\neventually more often than not we're\nable to get through and do that.\n\n1231\n00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:24,190\nSo that's what we see there with\nthe collision detection method.\n\n1232\n00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,350\nWhat about collision avoidance?\n\n1233\n00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:30,640\nI often refer to collision avoidance\nas being the civilized access method,\n\n1234\n00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,090\nbecause it's very, very nice.\n\n1235\n00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:36,430\nEverybody sits around logically and they\nask each other how are you doing today?\n\n1236\n00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,450\nAnd what are you planning for\nthe next five minutes?\n\n1237\n00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,430\nWould you like to send something?\n\n1238\n00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:41,600\nYou know, I don't think so.\n\n1239\n00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,700\nI'm kinda hanging out here and\nI'm not doing much.\n\n1240\n00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:44,370\nHow about you?\n\n1241\n00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:46,920\nNo, I don't think I want\nto send anything either.\n\n1242\n00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,350\nAnd so I hear Joe wants to send\nsomething maybe we should let Joe send.\n\n1243\n00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:51,130\nLet's let Joe send.\n\n1244\n00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,100\nAnd we'll do that.\n\n1245\n00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,920\nSo we give Joe the right to send.\n\n1246\n00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,180\nAnd so it's very, very civilized, right?\n\n1247\n00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:57,240\nIt's very, very civilized.\n\n1248\n00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,450\nIt's almost genteel, right?\n\n1249\n00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:04,560\nVery Victorian, or Elizabethan,\nin its outlook, in terms of its approach.\n\n1250\n00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:08,120\nAnd so, what happens here- I don't\nnormally do collision detection.\n\n1251\n00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,248\nBut when I do, it's collision avoidance.\n\n1252\n00:59:10,248 --> 00:59:11,018\n[LAUGH] Right.\n[LAUGH].\n\n1253\n00:59:11,018 --> 00:59:12,227\nRight, exactly.\n\n1254\n00:59:12,227 --> 00:59:15,070\n[COUGH] The most interesting\nnetwork packet in the world.\n\n1255\n00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:15,835\nThat's right.\n\n1256\n00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:19,010\n[LAUGH] And so, what we see here is\nthat when we're thinking about this,\n\n1257\n00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,780\nthis is used only on wireless networks.\n\n1258\n00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,420\nAnd I'll explain why this becomes\napparent as we go through this.\n\n1259\n00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,810\nSo, what the idea is, is that since\nwe are listening to the wire and\n\n1260\n00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:28,330\ncollision detection, looking for\n\n1261\n00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:32,480\nthat spike, that change in voltage as we\nsend, how do we do that with wireless?\n\n1262\n00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,840\nIf you think about the logic of that\nthere's no data packet increase or\n\n1263\n00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,790\ninflux of electrical\nsignal we can listen to.\n\n1264\n00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:39,417\nIt's unbound.\n\n1265\n00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:43,795\nSo we can't really manage or look for\nthat and understand that, and so\n\n1266\n00:59:43,795 --> 00:59:47,385\nas a result there's nothing to avoid,\nin the sense that we don't know that we're\n\n1267\n00:59:47,385 --> 00:59:51,015\nactually transmitting in the first place,\nat least not through traditional methods.\n\n1268\n00:59:51,015 --> 00:59:52,845\nAnd so, instead of collision detection,\n\n1269\n00:59:52,845 --> 00:59:56,845\nwe have to find a way to figure out how to\navoid collisions if at all possible, cuz\n\n1270\n00:59:56,845 --> 01:00:00,655\nwe can't really tell that there is packets\ncoming down the wire until they show up.\n\n1271\n01:00:00,655 --> 01:00:01,725\nRight.\nCuz, there is no wire.\n\n1272\n01:00:01,725 --> 01:00:02,650\nThat's the problem.\n\n1273\n01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:06,350\nAnd so instead of detection, we are going\nto have to send around a data packet\n\n1274\n01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:11,160\ninitially to every member of that network\nthat is hooked up to that segment,\n\n1275\n01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:15,300\nthat subnet that we're on, saying hey,\nin effect, I want to use the network.\n\n1276\n01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,140\nI want to send data.\n\n1277\n01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,080\nCan I do that?\n\n1278\n01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,630\nDo I have your permission?\n\n1279\n01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:23,620\nAre you gonna stay off the network and not\nhave a collision with me while I do that?\n\n1280\n01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,530\nWe're actually effectively\nasking permission.\n\n1281\n01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:31,000\nAnd so, assuming we get back no responses,\nmeaning nobody says, yeah, hey,\n\n1282\n01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,920\nwait a second, I'm doing that.\n\n1283\n01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:33,870\nRight?\nThen what we can do,\n\n1284\n01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:35,770\nis we can assume it's safe to send.\n\n1285\n01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:37,030\nUnderscore the word soup.\n\n1286\n01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:38,960\nWe can assume it's safe to send.\n\n1287\n01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,820\nWe all know what happens when you assume,\nright?\n\n1288\n01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:42,700\nAnd so\nwe can assume it's safe to send, and\n\n1289\n01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:45,260\nthen what happens is we go ahead and\nwe then send our packet.\n\n1290\n01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:48,610\nBut as a result of that, while we avoid\nalmost all, if not all collisions,\n\n1291\n01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:49,820\nthere are some collisions of course.\n\n1292\n01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:52,250\nBut we tend to avoid a lot\nof them by doing this.\n\n1293\n01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:56,470\nIt is good but it takes twice as long,\nvery resource intensive and\n\n1294\n01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:59,090\nas a result takes longer to send and\nreceive and\n\n1295\n01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,540\nwe have to give up something\nas a part of doing this.\n\n1296\n01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:04,170\nSo what we have to give up is\na certain amount of bandwidth.\n\n1297\n01:01:04,170 --> 01:01:09,790\nAnd so what happens here in CSMACA systems\nis that unlike collision detection,\n\n1298\n01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:13,730\nwhere if we have 100 megabit network or\ngigabit network, assuming network\n\n1299\n01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:17,600\nconnectivity and conditions are right and\nwe don't have a lot of stuff going on\n\n1300\n01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:21,650\nwith things like continuation, we actually\nget the full measure of that bandwidth.\n\n1301\n01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,390\nIn wireless networks we don't.\n\n1302\n01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:24,900\nYou may have seen this happen.\n\n1303\n01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,230\nYou may have see where you look at your\nbandwidth indicator for a wireless network\n\n1304\n01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:33,930\nand you wonder, well I'm connected to a 54\nmeg network, but I'm only getting 20ish,\n\n1305\n01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:37,240\n25, 27 megabits of actual bandwidth,\nwhat's going on with that, right?\n\n1306\n01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:37,840\nMany times.\n\n1307\n01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:41,780\nReason for that happening, is that we\nlose approximately 50% of our overall\n\n1308\n01:01:41,780 --> 01:01:46,470\ncapacity in the system to this collision\navoidance mechanism because we're sending\n\n1309\n01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:50,730\ntwice the amount of data and half of\nit is overhead to set up the session.\n\n1310\n01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:54,270\nAnd so we're losing approximately\nhalf our bandwidth to this overhead.\n\n1311\n01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:59,000\nSo, the collision avoidance system, while\nit may actually prove to be valuable for\n\n1312\n01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,810\nwireless solutions because we avoid a lot\nof collisions, does take an overhead,\n\n1313\n01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:05,600\na toll, a tax, a bandwidth tax right?\n\n1314\n01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:09,240\nYeah, you might think, why don't we use\ncollision avoidance on all of our networks\n\n1315\n01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,300\nbut in the end just letting\nthe collision happen, detecting it,\n\n1316\n01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,300\nand re-sending is more efficient\nthan- It's less painful.\n\n1317\n01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,840\nIt's more efficient, less painful, and so\nas a result we have a lot of collisions,\n\n1318\n01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,530\nbut we also have much more\nhigher bandwidth networks.\n\n1319\n01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:22,620\nWe have higher speeds.\n\n1320\n01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,810\nYou couldn't do gigabit, 10 gig,\n\n1321\n01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:29,400\n100 gig on wireless using collision\navoidance the same way, cuz you'd have to\n\n1322\n01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,360\nhave 250 gigs of bandwidth to get down\nto 100 gigs doing the same thing.\n\n1323\n01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,100\nAs we see these higher speed\nwireless technologies coming\n\n1324\n01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,820\nto fruition now in markets,\n\n1325\n01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:41,650\nthey're starting to figure out different\nways of managing these processes.\n\n1326\n01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:44,820\nOr they're front loading the bandwidth\nto be able to offset that, or\n\n1327\n01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:47,220\naccelerating and\ndoing other things as a result of that.\n\n1328\n01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:50,222\nSo there's different coping mechanisms\nin effect is what we there, right?\n\n1329\n01:02:50,222 --> 01:02:53,760\nSo you just want to be thinking about\nthat, and so these are the different\n\n1330\n01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,100\nmechanisms we use for sensing or\nsetting up multiple access solutions.\n\n1331\n01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,110\nWe want to make sure we're\nthinking about that and\n\n1332\n01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,700\nthat we're aware of those as well, right?\n\n1333\n01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,770\nSo what else do we have on\nour list down below there?\n\n1334\n01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:08,030\nWe had our communication\nconcepts within the LAN.\n\n1335\n01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:11,760\nI wanna talk about this idea of unicast,\nbroadcast, and multicast.\n\n1336\n01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,382\nAnd also wanna throw out quickly,\njust the standards for ethernet, right?\n\n1337\n01:03:17,382 --> 01:03:21,450\nSo we probably just wanna throw out\nthe 802 dot ethernet standards, so\n\n1338\n01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:23,330\nthe IEEE standards quickly.\n\n1339\n01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:25,592\nFor ethernet and for a token ring in FTBI.\n\n1340\n01:03:25,592 --> 01:03:30,210\nSo IEEE standards, very important here, I\nwanna make sure we know what they are for\n\n1341\n01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:35,500\nethernet, for\nethernet it's IEEE working group 802.3.\n\n1342\n01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:40,722\nGot .1 on my brain for\nwireless, .11x, yeah.\n\n1343\n01:03:40,722 --> 01:03:43,001\nSo 802.3 for Ethernet.\n\n1344\n01:03:43,001 --> 01:03:44,882\nToken ring, 802.5.\n\n1345\n01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:50,595\nAgain these are the IEEE standard\nnumerical convention or naming convention.\n\n1346\n01:03:50,595 --> 01:03:54,302\nAnd this is the designation of the working\ngroup, the standards body that has\n\n1347\n01:03:54,302 --> 01:03:58,191\nin charge of this technology and creates\nthe standards around this for the IEEE.\n\n1348\n01:03:58,191 --> 01:04:01,347\nAnd for FDDI it is 802.4.\n\n1349\n01:04:01,347 --> 01:04:04,350\n802.4, just remember FDDI\nis fiber token ring, right?\n\n1350\n01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:06,290\nThat's what we're talking about there.\n\n1351\n01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:09,510\nJust want to make sure we are aware of\nthat and we understand these standards.\n\n1352\n01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:10,880\nThey will be important for us.\n\n1353\n01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,120\nAgain, kind of as a knowledge point.\n\n1354\n01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,590\nJust making reference to it,\nmaking sure we're aware of it and\n\n1355\n01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,390\nthat we are comfortable with this idea.\n\n1356\n01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:20,240\nThis may come up, you may wanna be\nfamiliar with this and be ready to answer\n\n1357\n01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:24,910\nsome questions about this should\nthe opportunity arrives at some point.\n\n1358\n01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:27,620\nAll right so let's finish up here\nin this particular discussion.\n\n1359\n01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,100\nWe talked about access methods.\n\n1360\n01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,840\nLets talk about unicast and\nbroadcast quickly.\n\n1361\n01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:35,030\nWhen we talk about this idea of\ncommunications within the LAN,\n\n1362\n01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:40,120\nwe are talking about potentially even\nbeyond the LAN and out to the WAN.,\n\n1363\n01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:42,430\nit doesn't really matter\nin the case of unicast.\n\n1364\n01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:44,190\nWe're talking about a one\nto one transmission.\n\n1365\n01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:46,420\nSo if I want to speak to Mike,\nlet's say maybe Mike and\n\n1366\n01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:50,330\nI are not in the same place or we could\nbe right here talking to each other.\n\n1367\n01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:52,650\nBut we could also potentially\nbe across the network and\n\n1368\n01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:56,540\nmaybe through some sort of a router or\na gateway device of some kind.\n\n1369\n01:04:56,540 --> 01:05:00,030\nIf I know Mike's endpoint address,\nif I know his phone number,\n\n1370\n01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:04,980\nif I had traditional communication outside\nof networks, if I had his IP address.\n\n1371\n01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:07,800\nIf I talk about being able to have\nhis phone number to call him or\n\n1372\n01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:12,010\nhis IP address to send him data and\nI sent it just to him, nobody else,\n\n1373\n01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:13,560\nthat's a one-to-one transmission.\n\n1374\n01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,720\nWe call that a unicast transmission.\n\n1375\n01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:18,590\nAs in uni being one, right,\nunicast transmission.\n\n1376\n01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:23,340\nWhen we talk about one to a group,\nwe're gonna jump to multicast come back to\n\n1377\n01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:26,190\nbroadcast, we're talking\nabout a multicast solution.\n\n1378\n01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:29,420\nThis is where you have to have\nmembership in the group in\n\n1379\n01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:32,310\norder to take advantage of\nthis transmission mechanism.\n\n1380\n01:05:32,310 --> 01:05:35,450\nSo this may be something\nlike doing desktop imaging,\n\n1381\n01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:37,090\nthis could be streaming media.\n\n1382\n01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:41,500\nSo think of things like watching\npay-per-view TV, tuning in a radio\n\n1383\n01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:46,540\nstation, things like that where we\nselectively join a group by associating.\n\n1384\n01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:49,450\nBut not everybody gets it,\nit's just the people in the group.\n\n1385\n01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:51,220\nThat will be multicast.\n\n1386\n01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:54,025\nAnd then broadcast is, as we can see,\ntheir one to everyone.\n\n1387\n01:05:54,025 --> 01:05:56,870\nSo I stand up on a table\nin the middle of the room,\n\n1388\n01:05:56,870 --> 01:06:01,550\nshout at the top of my lungs whether\nanybody wants to hear or not, right?\n\n1389\n01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:03,000\nYou get that, whether you're there or\n\n1390\n01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,710\nnot, whether you want to know,\nyou may choose to opt out and\n\n1391\n01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:08,410\nnot pay attention to the broadcast,\nbut it's still going to be there.\n\n1392\n01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:09,520\nYou're still going to hear about it.\n\n1393\n01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:14,080\nSo, for instance that whole country\nmusic thing that we had going on, right?\n\n1394\n01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:17,070\nWhen you and I went out and\nspent some time socially.\n\n1395\n01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:19,340\nDidn't really have a choice,\nit was a broadcast thing.\n\n1396\n01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:22,230\nI was adamantly opposed to it Try to tune\n\n1397\n01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:24,710\nit out As was almost everybody\nelse who that was there.\n\n1398\n01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:28,390\nBut we were participating nonetheless,\nbecause everybody around us,\n\n1399\n01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:31,540\nother than us, thought that broadcasting\ncountry music was the way to celebrate.\n\n1400\n01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:32,510\nThey seem to enjoy it.\n\n1401\n01:06:32,510 --> 01:06:33,640\nThey did seem to enjoy it.\n\n1402\n01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,750\nNo offense, by the way,\n\n1403\n01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:37,650\nif anyone does like country music\nNot that we don't like it at all,\n\n1404\n01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:41,970\nwe just didn't want to hear 12 hours of it\nnon-stop while we were out socializing.\n\n1405\n01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:42,890\nSo just so you know.\n\n1406\n01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:45,710\nIt's fun, I don't wanna tear in my beer\nand then hear about losing my dog and\n\n1407\n01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,080\nmy wife and my house- And\nkicking your car, right?\n\n1408\n01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,410\nYeah.\nAnd all that stuff.\n\n1409\n01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:52,420\nSo that's what we talk about with unicast,\nbroadcast, and multicast, so.\n\n1410\n01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:55,420\nJust be aware of the fact that we have\nthese different transmission types,\n\n1411\n01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:58,610\ncommunicating, and we want to\nunderstand how we apply them and\n\n1412\n01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:01,700\noverlay them to our networks to\nunderstand how to manage traffic.\n\n1413\n01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,330\nSo what really becomes really important.\n\n1414\n01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:05,120\nIn our next episode we're\ngonna continue on and\n\n1415\n01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,365\ntalk about some of the protocols\nthat help us to do this exact thing.\n\n1416\n01:07:08,365 --> 01:07:10,825\nSo you can kind of see a preview there.\n\n1417\n01:07:10,825 --> 01:07:13,345\nMike's got things like ARP and\nRARP and DHCP and\n\n1418\n01:07:13,345 --> 01:07:14,985\nall sorts of protocols listed there.\n\n1419\n01:07:14,985 --> 01:07:18,410\nWe'll go through those and continue to\ntalk about network protocols and services.\n\n1420\n01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:20,280\nWhen we come back after a short break.\n\n1421\n01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,080\nAll right, well you guys have a good\nbreak and we'll see you back here.\n\n1422\n01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,120\nDid you do the whole peace thing,\nsorta like this?\n\n1423\n01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:25,670\nYeah, there we go.\n\n1424\n01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:27,120\nHow about the live long and prosper thing.\n\n1425\n01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:27,870\nCan we do that?\n\n1426\n01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:29,370\n[LAUGH] Live long and prosper?\n\n1427\n01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:32,170\n[CROSSTALK] So if we do this,\nis this the cut?\n\n1428\n01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:33,920\nYeah.\n\n1429\n01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,830\nLike that and\nthen we go out to break when we do this.\n\n1430\n01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:38,858\nCut.\n[SOUND]\n\n1431\n01:07:38,858 --> 01:07:44,165\nAll right.\n\n1432\n01:07:44,165 --> 01:07:46,913\nWelcome back everybody to\nour telecommunications and\n\n1433\n01:07:46,913 --> 01:07:48,350\nnetwork security episode.\n\n1434\n01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:51,820\nWe've been going over some\ndifferent access methods.\n\n1435\n01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:54,930\nWe've talked about some cabling types and\nthings like that and now we're\n\n1436\n01:07:54,930 --> 01:07:59,336\ngoing to go and talk about some protocols\nthat we might see on said cable types.\n\n1437\n01:07:59,336 --> 01:08:01,210\nSaid cable types.\n\n1438\n01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,870\nYes Ooh said cable types.\n\n1439\n01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:08,150\nAll right so network protocols and\nservices as we were just told we were\n\n1440\n01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,980\ngoing to talk about, or\nsaid network protocols and services.\n\n1441\n01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:14,740\nSo yes, so we'll talk about some network\nprotocols and services because that's\n\n1442\n01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:17,660\nthe next layer down as we think\nabout building this architecture.\n\n1443\n01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:21,350\nWe're adding in different layers and so\nnow we're gonna throw some protocols and\n\n1444\n01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:24,700\nservices out there on these wires that\nwe have talked about establishing and\n\n1445\n01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,470\nhave talked about how they're now gonna\ncommunicate what the transmission mediums\n\n1446\n01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:30,540\nare, the speeds, the ways in which we\nunderstand how to send information.\n\n1447\n01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,440\nNow we're gonna layer some functionality\non top of that architecture.\n\n1448\n01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,740\nSo we have a lot of different protocols\nand you can see art for instance,\n\n1449\n01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,430\naddress resolution protocol.\n\n1450\n01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:41,520\nWe have RARP, which is just reverse ARP.\n\n1451\n01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,090\nWe have DHCP, pretty common,\n\n1452\n01:08:44,090 --> 01:08:48,460\nICMP for control protocol to be\nable to do things like pinging.\n\n1453\n01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,750\nSo, these are pretty common ones.\n\n1454\n01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:52,740\nSo, let's spend just a couple of minutes\ntalking about functionality here.\n\n1455\n01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:56,810\nARP is going to allow us to be able\nto do IP to MAC resolution and\n\n1456\n01:08:56,810 --> 01:09:00,020\nor MAC to IP depending on\nthe way in which we run ARP.\n\n1457\n01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:03,750\nAnd know when we did this for\nSSCP we brought up the command show.\n\n1458\n01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:06,176\nWe just quickly did that ARP /?\n\n1459\n01:09:06,176 --> 01:09:08,440\nAnd arp-a to do the cache.\n\n1460\n01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,460\nWe did a little ping there as well.\n\n1461\n01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:16,730\nAnd so what we can see here is, and\nI think I had you do this last time,\n\n1462\n01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:19,970\nwe talked about the fact that you may or\nnot be familiar with some of the commands\n\n1463\n01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:23,880\nfor some of these things and so\nwhat Mike just did is a best practice and\n\n1464\n01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,550\na really good way to start out\nby looking at the help file.\n\n1465\n01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:30,770\nRight in Linux Unix we would call\nthis a man file, short for manual.\n\n1466\n01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:33,735\nIn Window's we just call it a help\nfile cuz [LAUGH] we're just not that\n\n1467\n01:09:33,735 --> 01:09:34,630\ncreative, right?\n\n1468\n01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:37,290\nAnd so\nwhat we have there [LAUGH] It's true,\n\n1469\n01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:39,540\nwhat can I tell you that's the reason,\nright?\n\n1470\n01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:41,856\nCouldn't come up with something\ncool called the man file so\n\n1471\n01:09:41,856 --> 01:09:44,440\nthey just went ahead and\nthey called it a help file.\n\n1472\n01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:46,830\nVery very utilitarian,\nit's exactly what it does.\n\n1473\n01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:48,070\nIt's get the point across.\n\n1474\n01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:52,120\nThey don't miss any opportunity there\nto be bland and monochromatic [LAUGH].\n\n1475\n01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:56,300\nAnd so what we see is were able to pull up\nthe help file that helps us to understand\n\n1476\n01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,210\nwhat the commands are.\n\n1477\n01:09:57,210 --> 01:10:00,710\nThe switches is how we refer to these\nthings that we can use to create some\n\n1478\n01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,540\nadditional functionality.\n\n1479\n01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:05,410\nSo you'll see -a there at the top\nis the current ARP entries.\n\n1480\n01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:09,105\nIt's important to be aware of this cuz\nsometimes these may be case sensitive.\n\n1481\n01:10:09,105 --> 01:10:12,185\nNot too many of them are, but\nARP is definitely one of them.\n\n1482\n01:10:12,185 --> 01:10:14,675\nYou could get different results there\nif you're not paying attention.\n\n1483\n01:10:14,675 --> 01:10:19,480\nSo, I don't know if we did a CLS,\na clear screen there, but\n\n1484\n01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:24,440\nwe're doing arp-a or space -a, we'll see\nwhatever is in Mike's arp cache there.\n\n1485\n01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:29,080\nSo, we can see the IP addresses being\ntranslated into the mac addresses for\n\n1486\n01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:32,040\none or more of the IP end points\nthat he's been talking too.\n\n1487\n01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,320\nSee a few on there.\n\n1488\n01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:36,350\nAnd, so that's how we would look at\narp and that's what we'd use it for.\n\n1489\n01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:40,750\nNow I know when we create a cache,\nthere is what's called a TTL, time to live\n\n1490\n01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:44,210\nassociated with the cache and so\nif we look at this information in five or\n\n1491\n01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:46,820\nten minutes, we may or\nmay not see the same entries in there.\n\n1492\n01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:47,520\nThey might disappear.\n\n1493\n01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:48,260\nThey may rotate.\n\n1494\n01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:48,940\nSome may be there.\n\n1495\n01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:49,820\nSome newer ones may be there.\n\n1496\n01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:51,095\nSome older ones may disappear.\n\n1497\n01:10:51,095 --> 01:10:54,830\nAnd so we want to keep that in mind\nbecause the cache is constantly being\n\n1498\n01:10:54,830 --> 01:10:59,000\nadd to and subtracted from in order to\nrefresh and understand what's going on\n\n1499\n01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:02,440\nbased on the last active connection\nwe have out to this particular item.\n\n1500\n01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:04,630\nSo if we don't connect to that machine for\n\n1501\n01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:08,560\na period of time, we have a counter that\ndecrements, that counts down to zero.\n\n1502\n01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:11,410\nWhen that hits zero,\nthat's like a little bomb going off and\n\n1503\n01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:14,730\nremoves it from the cache and\nwe don't see that entry anymore.\n\n1504\n01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:17,990\nAnd so checking the cache now versus\nchecking it later could potentially yield\n\n1505\n01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:18,820\ndifferent results.\n\n1506\n01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:22,190\nWe see the same thing with DNS by the way,\nwith the DNS resolver cache.\n\n1507\n01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:25,440\nWe'll talk about that when we come to\nthe DNS a little bit later but you know.\n\n1508\n01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,510\nAnd I appreciate your willingness\njust to jump right in there.\n\n1509\n01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:28,760\nMike was just raring to go.\n\n1510\n01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:31,680\nHe was almost, all right let me just\npull that up for you right now and\n\n1511\n01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:32,270\nwe'll take a look.\n\n1512\n01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:36,170\nAll right so we have to constrain\nthat enthusiasm sometimes so\n\n1513\n01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:38,130\nwe have something left to demo for\nthe people later.\n\n1514\n01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:42,043\nGive it all to them now, they got nothing\nleft to come back and watch later and\n\n1515\n01:11:42,043 --> 01:11:42,961\nwe're done.\n\n1516\n01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:45,790\nRight but we can obviously look at\nthe cache, and we will do that as well.\n\n1517\n01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:47,436\nBut we'll do that when we talk about DNS.\n\n1518\n01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:49,350\nRight so, we have our cache there, so\n\n1519\n01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:51,240\nsince we're here let's talk\nabout ping real quick.\n\n1520\n01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,623\nI know you were just doing a ping.\n\n1521\n01:11:52,623 --> 01:11:57,298\nSo, if we do take a look at ping, and\nwe can quickly look at the parameters for\n\n1522\n01:11:57,298 --> 01:11:58,847\nping Same kind of thing.\n\n1523\n01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:00,947\nWe'll have a lot of opportunity to\ndo two different kinds of pings.\n\n1524\n01:12:00,947 --> 01:12:04,082\nThe one that's fairly common is\nthe minus T right at the top,\n\n1525\n01:12:04,082 --> 01:12:06,025\nwhich is a persistent ping, right?\n\n1526\n01:12:06,025 --> 01:12:07,500\nMm-hm.\nAnd so we can actually go in and\n\n1527\n01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,350\nwe can do a ping, IP address minus T.\n\n1528\n01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:14,210\nAnd as a result just continuously ping\nuntil we get to wherever we want to be.\n\n1529\n01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:17,370\nSo the typical ping solution\nis we send out four requests,\n\n1530\n01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:20,500\nwe hopefully if all goes\nwell get back four replies.\n\n1531\n01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:23,660\nMike had done this quickly when we\nwere first starting, just ping Google.\n\n1532\n01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:27,450\nAnd you can see we get back four\nstatements from whatever the IP endpoint\n\n1533\n01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:29,060\nis for Google is defined as.\n\n1534\n01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:31,230\nAnd then we get a bite count,\nit should equal 32.\n\n1535\n01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:36,170\nAnd then we see a time there which is\nequal to almost 18 milliseconds for\n\n1536\n01:12:36,170 --> 01:12:38,560\nall them,\nthe last one was a 13 millisecond one.\n\n1537\n01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,230\nAnd a TTL value, which represents\nthe time to live for that packet, and so\n\n1538\n01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:48,000\nwe can see based on the TTL that this is a\nWindows machine that Mike is pinging from,\n\n1539\n01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,880\nbecause that TTL is associated typically\nwith a Windows solution, right?\n\n1540\n01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,000\nSo we can see that there.\n\n1541\n01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:58,010\nSo that means that the google.com\nwebsite is less than\n\n1542\n01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:01,712\nanywhere from 18 to 13\nmilliseconds away from us.\n\n1543\n01:13:01,712 --> 01:13:02,740\nTransit time back and\n\n1544\n01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:06,680\nforth from our current location,\nhere at our hidden bunker studios.\n\n1545\n01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:10,610\nSo at ITProTV,\nwe are broadcasting from somewhere.\n\n1546\n01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:13,200\nCan't tell you where, but wherever we\nare- A ship in the middle of the ocean.\n\n1547\n01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,398\nWe're within an 18 millisecond radius.\n\n1548\n01:13:15,398 --> 01:13:17,435\nFrom where Google.com is broadcasting,\nright?\n\n1549\n01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:20,630\nSo just so you know that's how we\nwould look at the time value there.\n\n1550\n01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:23,660\nWhich is just telling us round trip was\nanywhere from 18 to 13 milliseconds for\n\n1551\n01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:24,520\nthose packets.\n\n1552\n01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,950\nIn particular the last one which\ndropped down to 13 milliseconds.\n\n1553\n01:13:27,950 --> 01:13:30,460\nAnd obviously the smaller\nthe value there on the time\n\n1554\n01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:33,920\nthe closer we are the quicker way to\nable to transit that information.\n\n1555\n01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,210\nThe bigger that time value,\nthe further away we are,\n\n1556\n01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:40,020\nthe less network speed there is so\ntypically more congestion.\n\n1557\n01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:41,895\nThe more upset I get with my browser.\n\n1558\n01:13:41,895 --> 01:13:43,800\n[CROSSTALK] And\nattempt to pound on my keyboard.\n\n1559\n01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:44,310\nYes.\n\n1560\n01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:45,180\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n1561\n01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:47,770\n[LAUGH] Cause we get that instant feedback\n\n1562\n01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:50,000\nwhich is not instant because\nwe see nothing happening.\n\n1563\n01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,840\nThe spinning vortex of nothing\nis what we have with Yes.\n\n1564\n01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:53,420\nWindows 8.\nRight?\n\n1565\n01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,360\n[COUGH] Hm.\n\n1566\n01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,800\nAll right.\nSo we see that.\n\n1567\n01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:56,700\nAnd then we also.\n\n1568\n01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:58,340\nWe're gonna talk about DHCP.\n\n1569\n01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:59,065\nSo maybe we could do.\n\n1570\n01:13:59,065 --> 01:14:00,580\nMm-hm?\nAn ipconfig real quick.\n\n1571\n01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:01,180\nOkay.\nSure.\n\n1572\n01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:03,360\nAnd just bring up just generic ipconfig.\n\n1573\n01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:03,940\nNot all the.\n\n1574\n01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,020\nNot an all.\n\n1575\n01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:08,980\nAnd so what we'll see there with ipconfig\nis we'll see some basic information.\n\n1576\n01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:09,985\nOur IP address.\n\n1577\n01:14:09,985 --> 01:14:11,130\nMm-hm.\nOur subnet mask.\n\n1578\n01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:14,460\nWe've talked about that in some of\nour subnetting episodes early on.\n\n1579\n01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:18,460\nAnd but what we noticed here with ipconfig\nby itself is we don't see whether we're\n\n1580\n01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:20,490\nusing dacp, we don't know.\n\n1581\n01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:24,420\nBut if we do an ipconfig forward\nslash all which we can do,\n\n1582\n01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:28,000\nthat will give us a full\nlisting of all the information.\n\n1583\n01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,540\nWe will be\n\n1584\n01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:31,700\nable to tell because there's a lot more\ninformation scrolling through there.\n\n1585\n01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,940\nAs we come back up we will\nsee that we are using DHCV.\n\n1586\n01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:39,000\nAnd we can see it there for our connection\nand what we see is lease obtained,\n\n1587\n01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,590\nlease expires, right, so DHCP enabled yes,\nand then lease obtained right there,\n\n1588\n01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:45,040\ntells us when we got it.\n\n1589\n01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,840\nTells us that we are running, you know,\nour lease will be good, our TTL for\n\n1590\n01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,201\nour lease looks like it is three days,\nFriday, Saturday, Sunday.\n\n1591\n01:14:52,201 --> 01:14:55,710\nSo we have a 72 hour\ntotal lease time right?\n\n1592\n01:14:55,710 --> 01:15:00,220\nSo as a result of that we are then\nable to tell that we will potentially\n\n1593\n01:15:00,220 --> 01:15:04,010\nuse this DHCP based address for\nup to three days on this network.\n\n1594\n01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:07,670\nSo, we can see information there, we also\nsee, by the way, the DHCP server, and we\n\n1595\n01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:10,660\ncan see the information about that happens\nto be the same as our default gateway.\n\n1596\n01:15:10,660 --> 01:15:12,070\nAll right, so very good.\n\n1597\n01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:15,950\nSo, we see all that and what that helps\nus to understand is how these different\n\n1598\n01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:18,510\nnetworks services these\ndifferent solutions are working.\n\n1599\n01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:21,680\nSo let's go back to our notes and\njust fill in some blanks for us.\n\n1600\n01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:22,890\nSo we have ARP.\n\n1601\n01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:25,570\nWe see IP to MAC, RARP MAC to IP.\n\n1602\n01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:28,020\nDHCP we put DORA and or\n\n1603\n01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:32,470\nROSA there as holding a little knowledge\nout of the memory pneumonic to\n\n1604\n01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:36,840\nhelp you understand the four state process\nThat DHCP request will go through.\n\n1605\n01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,220\nSo let's just walk through quickly.\n\n1606\n01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:39,630\nYou want to be DORA or ROSA?\n\n1607\n01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:40,600\nWhich one do you feel like today?\n\n1608\n01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,640\nI'm gonna be DORA.\nYou're gonna be DORA today.\n\n1609\n01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:43,200\nWe're gonna start with our Discovery.\n\n1610\n01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:44,990\nOkay.\nSo we're gonna start with Discover or\n\n1611\n01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:48,200\nDiscovery and\nthen we're gonna do our Offer, and\n\n1612\n01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,610\nthen we're gonna do our Request, and\nthen we're gonna do our Acknowledgement.\n\n1613\n01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:54,939\nThese are the four stages of the DHCP.\n\n1614\n01:15:55,970 --> 01:15:59,300\nExchange of information between\na client and a server to take place.\n\n1615\n01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:01,830\nThe DHCP process to initialize, and\n\n1616\n01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:05,490\nactually get a IP address from\na DHCP server the first time.\n\n1617\n01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:08,630\nWe need one on boot-up, or when we lose\none for some reason and need to renew.\n\n1618\n01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:11,140\nRight.\nIf we already have an existing IP address.\n\n1619\n01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:14,660\nAnd simply need to either\nthrough a release and renew or\n\n1620\n01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:17,960\nperhaps just a renewal through half TTL or\nwhatever it may be but\n\n1621\n01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:19,670\nwe're holding an existing address.\n\n1622\n01:16:19,670 --> 01:16:21,750\nWe don't have to go through\nthis entire process.\n\n1623\n01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,520\nIt gets short-cutted just a little bit.\n\n1624\n01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,550\nBut discover offered\nrequest acknowledgement.\n\n1625\n01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:26,560\nROSA is the equivalent.\n\n1626\n01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,920\nIt's just simply gonna be request\noffer selection and acknowledgement.\n\n1627\n01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,820\nRequest offer, selection and\nacknowledgement as opposed to discover,\n\n1628\n01:16:34,820 --> 01:16:37,260\noffer, request, and\nacknowledgement for DORA.\n\n1629\n01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,300\nI'll throw that in for you guys later.\n\n1630\n01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,550\nYeah, that's fine, but\nit's basically the same thing, right?\n\n1631\n01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:43,380\nSo the idea is that the client\nsends out a discover packet\n\n1632\n01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:46,260\ngoes to the broadcast out\nto the network at large.\n\n1633\n01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:47,120\nIs anybody out there?\n\n1634\n01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,820\nHence the concept of discovery.\n\n1635\n01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:52,910\nIs there a DHCP server in my subnet or\nsomewhere on my network that I can get to?\n\n1636\n01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:56,150\nThe DHCP servers potentially plural\nsince there may be more than\n\n1637\n01:16:56,150 --> 01:17:00,210\none will broadcast back or\neffectively send back a Request\n\n1638\n01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:03,210\nacknowledgements saying hey yes I am\nout here what do you want, right?\n\n1639\n01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:06,440\nThat's the offer and then the request\ngoes out from the client and\n\n1640\n01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:09,950\nthe client says hey to the specific\nDHCP server I would like an IP address.\n\n1641\n01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:12,510\nCan you please service that need and\ngive me one?\n\n1642\n01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:16,060\nSo, one at that point specifically\ntargeting a single DHCP server as opposed\n\n1643\n01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:20,460\nto multiples and then an acknowledgement\ncomes back from the DHCP server saying,\n\n1644\n01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:22,390\nokay, effectively here's your IP address.\n\n1645\n01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:24,510\nAnd we now have put that into our scope,\nso\n\n1646\n01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:27,930\nour scope database signifies that you\nnow have that based on your MAC address.\n\n1647\n01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:31,220\nAnd the client accepts it,\nbinds the IP address to the interface.\n\n1648\n01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:35,730\nAt that point, the client has a rotatable\nIP address or some sort of IP address.\n\n1649\n01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:38,130\nBut until then all of this\ntraffic is broadcast based,\n\n1650\n01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,920\nas we indicated down below there.\n\n1651\n01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:43,490\nSo as a result we have to think\nabout the architecture of DHCP.\n\n1652\n01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:46,470\nWe want to make sure that with DHCP\n\n1653\n01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:50,470\nthat we are aware of the fact that because\nthis is all broadcast based traffic\n\n1654\n01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:54,720\nThat we have to understand that this may\nnot pass through a routed interface.\n\n1655\n01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,090\nAt least, not unless we go ahead and\n\n1656\n01:17:56,090 --> 01:17:58,740\nmake sure the router is going\nto be set up to do this.\n\n1657\n01:17:58,740 --> 01:18:00,270\nAnd, so as a result, by the way,\n\n1658\n01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:03,520\ndon't you just love when you get those\nlittle pop up messages out of the blue.\n\n1659\n01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:04,570\nThose little pop ups, yeah.\n\n1660\n01:18:04,570 --> 01:18:06,110\nYou system taken care of.\n\n1661\n01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:08,010\nHey, by the way, I'm about to shut off.\n\n1662\n01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:11,580\nYou may wanna pay attention and turn\non the power strip when you plug me in.\n\n1663\n01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:14,170\nAll right, so\nwe have broadcast based there and\n\n1664\n01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:20,140\nthe idea will be then can be pass\nbroadcast traffic generically.\n\n1665\n01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,580\nAnd so we know, routers by default and\n\n1666\n01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:26,890\nby design are specifically made\nto drop broadcast packets.\n\n1667\n01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:30,330\nNormal, generic broadcast packets,\nnot special packets,\n\n1668\n01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:34,160\nwhich is why we have this BOOTP RFC\n1542 thing going on down there\n\n1669\n01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:36,260\nbecause general broadcast packets are bad,\nright.\n\n1670\n01:18:36,260 --> 01:18:38,130\nYes.\nThey create what are broadcast storms.\n\n1671\n01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:41,780\nThink of a tidal wave slamming into\nyour network with all this traffic,\n\n1672\n01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,370\nthat is not gonna be required,\nnot needed and\n\n1673\n01:18:44,370 --> 01:18:47,060\ncannot be easily processed\nflowing through our subnets.\n\n1674\n01:18:47,060 --> 01:18:48,740\nCause we're overwhelm, not working them.\n\n1675\n01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:51,940\nTake it down.\nSo, we prevent broadcast storms.\n\n1676\n01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:53,150\nBy using routers,\n\n1677\n01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:58,010\nhowever, this kind of traffic DHCP\nrequest traffic has to broadcast.\n\n1678\n01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:59,680\nRight.\nAnd it may need to be broadcast out\n\n1679\n01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,570\nbeyond subnet.\n\n1680\n01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:03,320\nYeah, unless we have a DHCP server\non every subnet we're gonna\n\n1681\n01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:06,440\nhave to uigure out a way to get\nthose message to that DHCP server.\n\n1682\n01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,710\nRight.\nOne of the ways to do that right,\n\n1683\n01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:08,980\nbring the mountain over to us.\n\n1684\n01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,000\nRight.\nBy bringing the DHCP\n\n1685\n01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,390\nserver local to the subnet.\n\n1686\n01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:14,730\nAnother way would be to use\na [COUGH] DHCP relay agent.\n\n1687\n01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:15,680\nA bootstrap agent,\n\n1688\n01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:20,000\nwhere we can effectively straddle the two\nnetworks with a multi-home machine.\n\n1689\n01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,120\nTwo network cards one on each segment, and\n\n1690\n01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:25,580\nthe DHCP relay agent has fixed\nIP addresses that are static.\n\n1691\n01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:27,780\nThat we can broadcast to on one side.\n\n1692\n01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:29,240\nIt picks up the traffic proxies and\n\n1693\n01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:33,720\nsends it out the other end to the DHCP\nserver on a dedicated path, comes back.\n\n1694\n01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,370\nThat's the old school way of doing it.\n\n1695\n01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:38,800\nBecause back in the day not a lot of\nour routers would've been RFC-1542\n\n1696\n01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:41,790\ncompliant because it was\na relatively new standard.\n\n1697\n01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:43,870\nAnd you may have had to go out and\nbuy new gear.\n\n1698\n01:19:43,870 --> 01:19:47,830\nSo now pretty much if you've bought\nrouters in the last seven eight years ago,\n\n1699\n01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:51,440\nsomething like that,\nyour routers are probably 1542 compliant.\n\n1700\n01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:54,867\nWhich simply means that they will\npass this specific kind of traffic,\n\n1701\n01:19:54,867 --> 01:19:56,620\nthat is tagged as the DHCP traffic.\n\n1702\n01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:59,535\nBecause although they see it as\na broadcast they understand it's\n\n1703\n01:19:59,535 --> 01:20:01,448\na certain kind of traffic That is allowed.\n\n1704\n01:20:01,448 --> 01:20:02,888\nIt will not cause broadcast storms.\n\n1705\n01:20:02,888 --> 01:20:06,072\nAnd so the routers will then,\nsimply propagate that traffic,\n\n1706\n01:20:06,072 --> 01:20:07,280\nis the term we use.\n\n1707\n01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,895\nAs if it was routable traffic.\n\n1708\n01:20:08,895 --> 01:20:09,490\nMm-hm.\nRealistically.\n\n1709\n01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:10,610\nEven though it's broadcast based.\n\n1710\n01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:15,060\nAnd will send it back and\nforth without dropping it at the border.\n\n1711\n01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:17,380\nSo that's what an RC1542\ncompliant device will do.\n\n1712\n01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:21,990\nWhen we deal with ICMP,\nwe're dealing with ping as you saw.\n\n1713\n01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:24,980\nWe threw some message type\nindicators in there for you.\n\n1714\n01:20:24,980 --> 01:20:27,850\nThere's a whole bunch of message\ntypes associated with ping.\n\n1715\n01:20:27,850 --> 01:20:31,320\nThese are the ones that are fairly\ncommon that we probably wanna know and\n\n1716\n01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:34,709\nbe prepared to answer questions\naround in some form or another.\n\n1717\n01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:39,000\nShould we actually have\nthe opportunity to do so.\n\n1718\n01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,110\nAnd so, you could see type zero is an echo\nreply that's paired with type eight.\n\n1719\n01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:45,180\nYou have to have an echo\nfirst before you reply.\n\n1720\n01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,460\nRight.\nBut you'll see type zero and type eight.\n\n1721\n01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:49,280\nType three destination unreachable.\n\n1722\n01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,000\nThis is important.\n\n1723\n01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,400\nIf we try to ping something, we can't get\na ping out, because it's unreachable.\n\n1724\n01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,390\nComes back and\ntells us basically, hey, sorry.\n\n1725\n01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:56,400\nCan't get there.\n\n1726\n01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,718\nType nine, router advertisement.\n\n1727\n01:20:58,718 --> 01:21:03,850\nType 30 traceroute, when you do\na trace route using a type 30 message.\n\n1728\n01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:06,330\nType 37 and 38,\ndomain name request and reply.\n\n1729\n01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:08,400\nAgain, typically paired together,\none with the other.\n\n1730\n01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,350\nRIght.\nWe'll see them in traffic management,\n\n1731\n01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:12,200\nback and forth that way.\n\n1732\n01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:16,700\nAnd these are the actual types of\nmessages that ICMP will carry for us.\n\n1733\n01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:19,780\nThere's many more, by the way, but\nthese are the pretty popular ones.\n\n1734\n01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:21,470\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n1735\n01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:23,920\nAnd then ICMP attack methods.\n\n1736\n01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,370\nThere's a lot of attacks that exist\nout there from a security standpoint.\n\n1737\n01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:30,350\nWe talk about a fair number of them\nscattered throughout our discussions in\n\n1738\n01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:31,480\nmultiple areas.\n\n1739\n01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:34,920\nBut, when we talk about\nnetworking-based attacks,\n\n1740\n01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,020\nthese are three that are very popular.\n\n1741\n01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:40,080\nThe ping of death, right, which is\ngonna be a malformed ping packet that\n\n1742\n01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:42,930\nbasically overwhelms through\na distributed denial of service or\n\n1743\n01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:44,790\ndenial of service depending\non how you're doing it.\n\n1744\n01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:48,070\nAttack solution where we effectively\njust target the machine.\n\n1745\n01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:51,170\nAnd as a result of that, potentially,\ncan take it down by corrupting the network\n\n1746\n01:21:51,170 --> 01:21:54,970\nstack and locking it open in such a way\nthat effectively it stops working.\n\n1747\n01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:58,860\nAnd as a result of that, it just\nbasically falls over dead, if you will.\n\n1748\n01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:00,840\nHence the ping of death concept.\n\n1749\n01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:02,570\nThat's effectively how it is described.\n\n1750\n01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:05,190\nBut basically,\nwe send an oversized ICMP packet,\n\n1751\n01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:07,660\na malformed ping packet that's oversized.\n\n1752\n01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:11,390\nAnd a result of that, there was a flaw in\nthe network kernel implementations from\n\n1753\n01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:12,340\nother operating systems.\n\n1754\n01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:13,300\nDidn't know what to do with it.\n\n1755\n01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:14,850\nDidn't know how to deal with\nit beyond the 65,536 bytes.\n\n1756\n01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:16,940\nYou broke the rules, what are you doing?\n\n1757\n01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:19,610\nAnd just locked out.\n\n1758\n01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:22,420\nSomebody smart out there manipulated\nthe rules and said effectively,\n\n1759\n01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:25,740\nhey if it's this big normally,\nwhat if I made it this much bigger?\n\n1760\n01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:27,410\nIt doesn't seem like we're well-defined.\n\n1761\n01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:29,600\nThere is no buffer that really\nunderstands how to deal with that.\n\n1762\n01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:30,570\nWhat would happen?\n\n1763\n01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:34,840\nSure enough, it's like pouring too much\nwater into some sort of a container.\n\n1764\n01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,270\nWe overflow,\nwhich is effectively what happened.\n\n1765\n01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:40,830\nAnd that overflow was not anticipated\nin the original architecture of\n\n1766\n01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:41,830\nthe network stack.\n\n1767\n01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:45,110\nAnd because of that, when we overflowed,\nin effect, we just locked up.\n\n1768\n01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:47,460\nAnd there was nothing there and\nthe machine would lock up and die.\n\n1769\n01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:50,660\nAnd so, as a result of that,\nwe typically crash.\n\n1770\n01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:55,166\nThat lovely, comforting blue screen that\nwe often hear so much about, the bsod.\n\n1771\n01:22:55,166 --> 01:22:57,430\nAt least they've added\na little frownie face to it,\n\n1772\n01:22:57,430 --> 01:23:02,180\ntry to make it a little more- It\nis a more friendly crash screen.\n\n1773\n01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,960\nWe are unhappy for you.\n\n1774\n01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:05,770\nIf you are experiencing system disruption.\n\n1775\n01:23:05,770 --> 01:23:08,810\nThey are feeling our pain Yes I feel like\nthey are sharing my pain Absolutely.\n\n1776\n01:23:08,810 --> 01:23:10,130\nThey are sharing something all right.\n\n1777\n01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:12,860\nI don't know if it is pain, but\nthey are sharing something.\n\n1778\n01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:14,850\nAll right, Smurf attack,\nwhat would that be?\n\n1779\n01:23:14,850 --> 01:23:18,030\nSmurf attack Is basically\nusing an ICMP Echo Request.\n\n1780\n01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:22,560\nSo, this is gonna be targeting or\nre-targeting by effectively mirroring and\n\n1781\n01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:26,750\nbouncing back multiple echoes\nusing the ICMP Echo command,\n\n1782\n01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:28,865\nto effectively target a machine.\n\n1783\n01:23:28,865 --> 01:23:29,700\nRight.\n\n1784\n01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:32,230\nAnd so, this idea again,\ndistributed denial of service typically,\n\n1785\n01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:34,910\nalthough it could be done as a denial\nof service depending on how you do it.\n\n1786\n01:23:34,910 --> 01:23:38,580\nBut typically distributed denial of\nservice, we send out a bunch of echos.\n\n1787\n01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,400\nSo, we send out a bunch of ping requests.\n\n1788\n01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:45,400\nAnd we malform the ping in such a way\nthat the reply back to address is\n\n1789\n01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,750\ngonna be the target of the machine\nthat we want to take down.\n\n1790\n01:23:47,750 --> 01:23:50,380\nAnd so we may ping, as the attacker,\n\n1791\n01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:54,850\nwe may ping thousands of\nmachines out there like this.\n\n1792\n01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:55,520\nAnd then all of a sudden,\n\n1793\n01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,460\nall of those machines reply back at\nonce to a single target entry point.\n\n1794\n01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:02,220\nAnd that machine gets knocked offline,\nbecause it gets overwhelmed.\n\n1795\n01:24:02,220 --> 01:24:03,720\nThis is what a smurf attack will be.\n\n1796\n01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:09,000\nThis is done with the TCP echo command.\n\n1797\n01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,510\nSo, it's done in the ICMP\nutility with a stack, but\n\n1798\n01:24:13,510 --> 01:24:16,650\nit's done with a TCP,\nas opposed to a UDP protocol.\n\n1799\n01:24:16,650 --> 01:24:19,900\nFragle attack is just\na Smurf attack done with UDP.\n\n1800\n01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:21,940\nSo, a Fragle attack is gonna be.\n\n1801\n01:24:21,940 --> 01:24:23,240\nDid you ever see Fragle Rock?\n\n1802\n01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:24,100\nCan you remember that?\n\n1803\n01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:24,900\nYeah. I did. Fragle rock?\n\n1804\n01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:25,626\nThat was a cool show.\n\n1805\n01:24:25,626 --> 01:24:26,400\n[LAUGH] That was a great one.\n\n1806\n01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,280\nThat was pretty cool.\n\n1807\n01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,770\nSo, Fragle attack named after Fragle Rock.\n\n1808\n01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:32,060\nRock at least that's what\nI'm going with anyway.\n\n1809\n01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:34,310\nMaybe not be but\nit's what I think it would be too.\n\n1810\n01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:37,650\nI think that's what the unofficial myth\nand lore of the Internet would claim.\n\n1811\n01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:41,420\nAnd so the fraggle attack is simply\na smurf attack done with UDP.\n\n1812\n01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:42,250\nAs opposed to TCP.\n\n1813\n01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:46,730\nSame concept, malform targeting or\ntargeting rather with malform packets\n\n1814\n01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:51,150\nagainst an attack vector that comes in\nagainst one machine from multiple places.\n\n1815\n01:24:51,150 --> 01:24:53,250\nAnd as a result knocks\nthat machine off line.\n\n1816\n01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:54,560\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1817\n01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:57,420\nThese are distributed denial-of-service\nattacks more often than not, right?\n\n1818\n01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,580\nAll right, so SNMP,\nSimple Network Management Protocol,\n\n1819\n01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:03,330\nanother one of the protocols we see.\n\n1820\n01:25:03,330 --> 01:25:05,790\nThis is used to manage\nhardware based endpoints.\n\n1821\n01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:10,810\nSo routers, switches that run on SNMP\nwill be using that to manage them,\n\n1822\n01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:12,410\ndo inventory of them.\n\n1823\n01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:14,300\nKeep track of them, things like that.\n\n1824\n01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:18,440\nVersions 1 and 2, older implementations\nof SNMP by today's standards,\n\n1825\n01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,940\nare not going to encrypt\nthe data that we send back and\n\n1826\n01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:25,470\nforth, the community string which\nis the association that we use, and\n\n1827\n01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:28,260\nmaybe the shared secret which is\nthe password effectively, right?\n\n1828\n01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:30,100\nThings like that are not encrypted.\n\n1829\n01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:33,770\nVersion 3 does include encryption\nof that traffic natively.\n\n1830\n01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:36,520\nAnd so we really are seeing a push\ntowards implementing an SNMP\n\n1831\n01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,480\nversion that's free as\na management protocol.\n\n1832\n01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,310\nJust be aware of that.\n\n1833\n01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:44,710\nDNS is going to be our domain name\nservice or domain name system.\n\n1834\n01:25:44,710 --> 01:25:49,380\nAnd our domain name solution\nIs going to allow us,\n\n1835\n01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:53,470\nthe domain name service will allow us to\nbe able to do fully qualified domain name.\n\n1836\n01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:57,010\nOr just, you know basically,\na name resolution with an IP address.\n\n1837\n01:25:57,010 --> 01:26:01,480\nSo we're gonna be able to resolve\nusing what's called a forward zone or\n\n1838\n01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:02,760\na forward look up.\n\n1839\n01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:05,990\nThe fully qualified domain\nname to the IP address.\n\n1840\n01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:09,420\nIf we are doing what is\nknown as a reverse lookup.\n\n1841\n01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:11,870\nSo a forward lookup is fully\nqualified domain name.\n\n1842\n01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:14,280\nWhat we call FQDN to IP.\n\n1843\n01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:19,500\nAnd if we're doing a reverse lookup\nusing the reverse lookup zone,\n\n1844\n01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:22,360\nwe are going to do the IP to FQDI.\n\n1845\n01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,930\nThis is why we can ping, right?\n\n1846\n01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:28,610\nA something like Google get\nthe IP address at Google.com\n\n1847\n01:26:28,610 --> 01:26:30,350\nput the IP address into the browser and\n\n1848\n01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:33,430\nstill get Google.com as opposed to\nhaving put Google.com into the browser.\n\n1849\n01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:34,030\nRight, yep.\n\n1850\n01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:37,830\nBecause either one gets resolved and\ntranslated DNS.\n\n1851\n01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:39,530\nSo this is how DNS works.\n\n1852\n01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:42,280\nNow it's probably worth a couple minutes\nof our time just to quickly go over\n\n1853\n01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,290\nthe concept of DNS at a high level.\n\n1854\n01:26:44,290 --> 01:26:46,260\nAnd maybe just explain\nhow DNS is gonna work.\n\n1855\n01:26:46,260 --> 01:26:49,800\nSo I know we were gonna quickly\njust take a look at something.\n\n1856\n01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:51,300\nAs quickly as Adobe runs.\n\n1857\n01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:52,360\nWe'll wait for it.\n\n1858\n01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:55,740\n[LAUGH] So we're gonna go ahead and\nnarrate through.\n\n1859\n01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:58,980\nGo fix your cup of coffee and- So\nI'll speak slowly, all right?\n\n1860\n01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,290\nYeah.\nSo when we talk about DNS,\n\n1861\n01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:03,710\nwhat we're doing is we're trying to\ngo in and just think about this idea.\n\n1862\n01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:05,330\nThere you go.\nWe got our white board right there.\n\n1863\n01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:06,380\nAll right?\n\n1864\n01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:08,090\nAnd so I love that.\n\n1865\n01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:09,480\nRight?\nWe've got the actual marker.\n\n1866\n01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,120\nInvisible hand of knowledge, right?\n\n1867\n01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:11,800\nYes, yes.\nIt's already got\n\n1868\n01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:14,100\nthe The cap on the back just\nlike a good trainer would.\n\n1869\n01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:16,070\nIt's dry erase, all that stuff right?\n\n1870\n01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:18,020\nEverybody wants to update as always.\n\n1871\n01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:19,490\nRight we're not gonna do that.\n\n1872\n01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:23,020\nSo what we're gonna do is we thought we'd\nquickly in real time just sketch out for\n\n1873\n01:27:23,020 --> 01:27:26,565\nyou what a traditional visual\nof DNS might look like.\n\n1874\n01:27:26,565 --> 01:27:29,745\nLet's start at the top of our root domain.\n\n1875\n01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:33,685\nSo we're just going to put that\nin there and put our root there.\n\n1876\n01:27:33,685 --> 01:27:35,855\nAnd the root is typically\nrepresented by a period.\n\n1877\n01:27:35,855 --> 01:27:37,255\nSo a little period there,\n\n1878\n01:27:37,255 --> 01:27:40,547\na little dot or whatever we can\ndo there is going to be the root.\n\n1879\n01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:42,317\nYeah, we can kind of see that.\n\n1880\n01:27:42,317 --> 01:27:44,497\nAnd so\nthen down below we'll draw hierarchy.\n\n1881\n01:27:44,497 --> 01:27:47,377\nWe'll just draw a little grid out and\ncome down over there.\n\n1882\n01:27:47,377 --> 01:27:50,821\nAnd we'll draw our first level,\nwe call our top level domain.\n\n1883\n01:27:50,821 --> 01:27:54,915\nAnd so this top level domain\nwould be taking the roots,\n\n1884\n01:27:54,915 --> 01:27:58,298\ntaking the root plus\nthe domain extensions.\n\n1885\n01:27:58,298 --> 01:28:02,005\nThis is where we get the .com .org,\n.mil, .gov, .edu,\n\n1886\n01:28:02,005 --> 01:28:06,650\nwhatever it is, .tv, all of these\ndifferent extensions we have there.\n\n1887\n01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:12,036\nAll the country extensions are there,\n.us, .gb for Great Britain,\n\n1888\n01:28:12,036 --> 01:28:16,540\n.au for Australia, .ru for\nRussia, that kind of thing.\n\n1889\n01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:17,980\nAll those would be there.\n\n1890\n01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:19,020\nSo all of those are there.\n\n1891\n01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:21,750\nThose are our top level domains.\n\n1892\n01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:24,238\nThen down below let's choose one,\nright, .com?\n\n1893\n01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:26,360\nYeah sure .com, whatever, sure.\n\n1894\n01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:29,180\nOff of .com, right,\nwe will then draw another box there,\n\n1895\n01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:32,320\nand this is where we have\nour second level domain.\n\n1896\n01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,800\nSo our second level domain,\nagain doing the math,\n\n1897\n01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,830\nwill be our root plus our top level\ndomain plus the second level domain name.\n\n1898\n01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:42,450\nRead from left to right, so second level\nis on the left, and then the root is in\n\n1899\n01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:45,780\nthe middle and the extension for\nthe top level domain will be on the right.\n\n1900\n01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:49,994\nSo we could do something like,\nI don't know, maybe cnn.com,\n\n1901\n01:28:49,994 --> 01:28:53,360\nkeep it small so\nwe can fit in the box there, right.\n\n1902\n01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,310\nYeah, yeah.\n\n1903\n01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:56,480\nBecause we're kinda pushed or\nconstrained there.\n\n1904\n01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:59,140\nThis is by the way, an example of\nconstrained user interface, right?\n\n1905\n01:28:59,140 --> 01:29:00,870\nRight.\nWe are constrained by the size of the box\n\n1906\n01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:01,760\nthat Mike drew for us.\n\n1907\n01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,920\nSo CNN, something very small like\nabc.com or whatever it may be, right?\n\n1908\n01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,380\nSo you can just get a general idea\nof how we build the namespace.\n\n1909\n01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:09,650\nNow this is interesting.\n\n1910\n01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:11,945\nLet's right out a URL real quick,\nlet's do that?\n\n1911\n01:29:11,945 --> 01:29:13,151\nOkay, right.\n\n1912\n01:29:13,151 --> 01:29:17,298\nMaybe just write one here like\nhttp: whack whack, www., then cnn,\n\n1913\n01:29:17,298 --> 01:29:20,645\nlet's do cnn.com,\nsince we're doing this, right?\n\n1914\n01:29:20,645 --> 01:29:22,270\nMm-hm.\nNow can we make this a little bigger?\n\n1915\n01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:23,200\nIs there a way to do that?\n\n1916\n01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,340\nYou may be able to zoom a little.\n\n1917\n01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:27,320\nMaybe to zoom in, I don't want to mess\nwith the font if that's gonna be an issue.\n\n1918\n01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:28,120\nBut, okay.\n\n1919\n01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:29,970\nSo, let's, perfect, yeah.\n\n1920\n01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:30,520\nAll right, good.\n\n1921\n01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,920\nSo, let's do that, let's just move\nthe marker out of the way if we can.\n\n1922\n01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:34,440\nLet's see if it's gonna play along.\n\n1923\n01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:35,752\nOr, maybe not.\n\n1924\n01:29:35,752 --> 01:29:37,410\nAll right, so if we can't do that,\nperfect, alright.\n\n1925\n01:29:37,410 --> 01:29:38,130\nJust so we can see.\n\n1926\n01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:39,390\nSo, I wanna talk about how we read this.\n\n1927\n01:29:39,390 --> 01:29:42,710\nSo, what I want you to do is can we draw,\nif possible,\n\n1928\n01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:48,160\nan arrow that goes from right to left, and\nput the arrowhead at the right hand side\n\n1929\n01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:53,150\nthere under the http, so arrowhead\non the other side if you can there.\n\n1930\n01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:59,040\nAnd so, we want to signify that we read\nthis going in a different direction.\n\n1931\n01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,110\nMaybe we should draw it all out\nbefore we actually zoom in.\n\n1932\n01:30:01,110 --> 01:30:01,720\nYeah.\nYou want to do that?\n\n1933\n01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:02,260\nWould it be easier?\n\n1934\n01:30:02,260 --> 01:30:03,700\nYeah, just draw it out that way.\n\n1935\n01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:04,280\nPerfect.\n\n1936\n01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:06,150\nAll right.\nSo then, the idea there would then be,\n\n1937\n01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:09,180\nif you could switch colors for\nme real quick, switch colors for a second.\n\n1938\n01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:11,590\nMaybe put up a red or\na black or something.\n\n1939\n01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:12,150\nAll right.\n\n1940\n01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:18,340\nAnd go to, right, and so at the end of\ncom, put a big period at the end of com.\n\n1941\n01:30:18,340 --> 01:30:19,740\nJust make a big circle there.\n\n1942\n01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:22,044\nNow, right, or what approximates a period.\n\n1943\n01:30:22,044 --> 01:30:23,189\nThat's a pretty sad period.\n\n1944\n01:30:23,189 --> 01:30:24,826\nKind of red smudge, right?\n\n1945\n01:30:24,826 --> 01:30:29,064\n[CROSSTALK] It is real time,\nwe are drawing freehand, right?\n\n1946\n01:30:29,064 --> 01:30:32,431\nAt no point do our hands leave our bodies\nduring this demonstration, boys and girls,\n\n1947\n01:30:32,431 --> 01:30:37,578\nright, so- [LAUGH] So the reason I had\nMike put a dot there is that when we write\n\n1948\n01:30:37,578 --> 01:30:43,039\na URL inside of a web browser,\nyou don't ever put www.cnn.com period.\n\n1949\n01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:45,100\nBut that is technically the.\n\n1950\n01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:48,800\nAnd not just technically,\nit is actually and it is implied, right?\n\n1951\n01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:52,230\nBut the browser's smart enough to complete\nthat for us like any good grammatical\n\n1952\n01:30:52,230 --> 01:30:54,790\nsyntax, we always add a period\nat the end of a sentence.\n\n1953\n01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:57,499\nAnd so, we add that in with\nthe browser of the software you use,\n\n1954\n01:30:57,499 --> 01:31:00,660\nhas been programmed to be smart\nenough to auto-complete for us.\n\n1955\n01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:05,502\nAnd the reason we need that is, we read\nthe URL right to left, not left to right.\n\n1956\n01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:07,892\nTo deconstruct it,\nonce we start drilling in,\n\n1957\n01:31:07,892 --> 01:31:10,900\nwe start actually left to right\nwith the protocol, right?\n\n1958\n01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:13,794\nHTTP, HTTPS, FTP, whatever it may be, or\n\n1959\n01:31:13,794 --> 01:31:19,039\nif it's a URL that has a actual file\npath in it, right, c-colon-backslash,\n\n1960\n01:31:19,039 --> 01:31:23,683\nit's local, whatever, we read that\nfirst to figure out where to go.\n\n1961\n01:31:23,683 --> 01:31:26,519\nRight.\nHttp means worldwide web, right, or\n\n1962\n01:31:26,519 --> 01:31:27,900\nsecure, https.\n\n1963\n01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:28,950\nSo we do that.\n\n1964\n01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:31,820\nThen the colon whack whack is just filler.\n\n1965\n01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,900\nLet's not worry about what that is,\nit's architectural stuff but\n\n1966\n01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:35,260\nit really doesn't matter to us.\n\n1967\n01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:39,166\nAt that point when we get into\nthe web browser using that protocol,\n\n1968\n01:31:39,166 --> 01:31:41,069\nthen we go to resolve using DNS.\n\n1969\n01:31:41,069 --> 01:31:43,775\nAnd so\nthen we start reading right to left and\n\n1970\n01:31:43,775 --> 01:31:48,690\nwe have to go to the end of the syntax of\nthe address line and that period is there.\n\n1971\n01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:51,210\nNow if we just stop there,\nwe imply the period.\n\n1972\n01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:56,120\nBut if we had cnn.com, and\nthen we had like a forward slash and then\n\n1973\n01:31:56,120 --> 01:32:00,140\nsome sort of designation for directories\nthat we drew into to find a welcome page,\n\n1974\n01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:03,200\nwhat we would see is that\nwhole thing gets filled in.\n\n1975\n01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,430\nBut it gets filled in after a backslash,\nright?\n\n1976\n01:32:05,430 --> 01:32:06,440\nOr a forward slash, rather.\n\n1977\n01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:10,100\nAnd so as a result of that,\nwhat we see is, the computer knows that,\n\n1978\n01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:13,480\nat that point, we're looking at a\ndirectory structure within the web server,\n\n1979\n01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:14,940\nonce we resolve the name.\n\n1980\n01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:19,060\nAnd so it still know to stop right\nthere where it sees that slash.\n\n1981\n01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:22,860\nAnd as a result of that, we don't imply\nthe period on the end for index.htm.\n\n1982\n01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:26,410\nWe imply it at the end of the com,\nright before the slash.\n\n1983\n01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:28,070\nSo either way, that period is still there.\n\n1984\n01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:31,060\nAnd so what we do is, we use that\nperiod as a starting point to go and\n\n1985\n01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,140\nfind the root.\n\n1986\n01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:36,344\nAnd then from the root we work backwards\ndown the chain to the top level\n\n1987\n01:32:36,344 --> 01:32:37,733\nsecond level domain.\n\n1988\n01:32:37,733 --> 01:32:39,369\nwww tells us where we are.\n\n1989\n01:32:39,369 --> 01:32:40,120\nIt's world wide web.\n\n1990\n01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,220\nWe know that.\n\n1991\n01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:45,090\nAnd if you know now these days we're smart\nenough to be able to just type CNN.com and\n\n1992\n01:32:45,090 --> 01:32:48,800\nthe browser fills in www and kind of\nimplies that it knows that as well.\n\n1993\n01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:51,530\nRight?\nSo that's why we need IE 11 because it's\n\n1994\n01:32:51,530 --> 01:32:52,370\nso smart.\n\n1995\n01:32:52,370 --> 01:32:52,920\nIt is.\n\n1996\n01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:53,700\nIt's beautiful.\n\n1997\n01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,520\nSo smart.\nAnd really in the end we're trying to\n\n1998\n01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,790\nfind the authoritative DNS server for\nthat portion of that name space.\n\n1999\n01:32:58,790 --> 01:33:00,990\nAnd so we start like you said,\nfrom that right.\n\n2000\n01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:02,310\nStart up at the root, the very top.\n\n2001\n01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:04,630\nIt would lead you to\nthe dot com name server.\n\n2002\n01:33:04,630 --> 01:33:08,862\nThe dot com named server knows how to find\nthose authoritative servers for cnn.com,\n\n2003\n01:33:08,862 --> 01:33:11,440\ngoogle.com, whatever the case may be.\n\n2004\n01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:14,030\nAnd we finally make our way down by\nworking our way through that fully\n\n2005\n01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:15,390\nqualified domain name.\n\n2006\n01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:19,050\nGet to cnn.com and he happens to know,\nbecause he's authoritative for\n\n2007\n01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:22,050\nthe cnn name space,\nhe knows the IP address of our host, www,\n\n2008\n01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:25,278\nor our alias for\nwhatever they might be doing.\n\n2009\n01:33:25,278 --> 01:33:26,910\nNow that's 100% correct.\n\n2010\n01:33:26,910 --> 01:33:29,610\nAnd, so Mike laid out a really\nimportant thought process for\n\n2011\n01:33:29,610 --> 01:33:31,370\nus around resolving name servers,\n\n2012\n01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:33,800\nwhat we call the authoritative servers,\nor the route servers.\n\n2013\n01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,670\nVery top level of the internet.\n\n2014\n01:33:35,670 --> 01:33:37,810\nThey're based on IP\naddress class by the way.\n\n2015\n01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:41,540\nThere's a certain number assigned A to\nB to C scattered around the world\n\n2016\n01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:44,040\nsecurely maintained in\nundisclosed locations.\n\n2017\n01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:45,970\nYep.\n[LAUGH] Japan has one, right?\n\n2018\n01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:49,580\nThat kind of thing, you can find out where\nthese are, it's not hard to find out.\n\n2019\n01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:51,010\nThere's public knowledge on this,\njust go out and\n\n2020\n01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:52,590\nGoogle it if you want to\nfind the root servers.\n\n2021\n01:33:52,590 --> 01:33:53,690\nRight.\nBut the idea is that we\n\n2022\n01:33:53,690 --> 01:33:56,920\nfind those root servers, but we have\nto have a list of those root servers so\n\n2023\n01:33:56,920 --> 01:33:57,480\nwe know where they are.\n\n2024\n01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,600\nRight, mm-hm.\nSo we have that\n\n2025\n01:33:58,600 --> 01:34:01,260\nin our system as part of\nthe information we have, but\n\n2026\n01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:03,760\nwe have this hierarchy that we have\nto contend with, as Mike was saying.\n\n2027\n01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,298\nAnd we're looking for\nthat authoritative, very important word,\n\n2028\n01:34:07,298 --> 01:34:10,897\nauthoritative server that knows how\nto tell us where the machine is,\n\n2029\n01:34:10,897 --> 01:34:14,246\nin this case, a web server that\nknows how to serve up CNN.com and\n\n2030\n01:34:14,246 --> 01:34:16,900\nspecifically the content\nunderneath CNN.com.\n\n2031\n01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,880\nLike index index.htm or\nwhatever, that may be there.\n\n2032\n01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:22,440\nBut in order to get there,\nwe have to ask a certain kind of question.\n\n2033\n01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:24,100\nWe have to query.\n\n2034\n01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:25,870\nSo now there's two kinds of queries.\n\n2035\n01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:27,320\nQuestions we have to ask, right?\n\n2036\n01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:30,885\nTwo kinds of queries that can occur\nwith DNS, like anything else, right?\n\n2037\n01:34:30,885 --> 01:34:31,740\nMm-hm.\nYou may have had one of these\n\n2038\n01:34:31,740 --> 01:34:33,502\nconversations with your significant other,\nright?\n\n2039\n01:34:33,502 --> 01:34:34,516\nRight.\n[LAUGH] Or your,\n\n2040\n01:34:34,516 --> 01:34:36,530\nyou know where I'm going with this, right?\n\n2041\n01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:37,969\nYeah.\nWhat do you want to do tonight?\n\n2042\n01:34:37,969 --> 01:34:39,629\nI don't know,\nwhat do you want to do tonight, right?\n\n2043\n01:34:39,629 --> 01:34:42,033\nAnd you wind up talking to each other,\nit's what you wanted to.\n\n2044\n01:34:42,033 --> 01:34:44,415\nYou could have shortcut that whole process\nand just said, I want to have a fight,\n\n2045\n01:34:44,415 --> 01:34:45,626\nit would have worked out so much easier.\n\n2046\n01:34:45,626 --> 01:34:47,640\n[LAUGH] It would have been so\nmuch quicker, right?\n\n2047\n01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:48,150\nAll right, so\n\n2048\n01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:50,455\nyou can tell people that have been\nin relationships for a long time.\n\n2049\n01:34:50,455 --> 01:34:53,720\nWe can joke about this kind of stuff,\nbecause this does happen, right?\n\n2050\n01:34:53,720 --> 01:34:55,430\nAnd we'll flip back over to the notes for\njust a second, so\n\n2051\n01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:56,290\nwe can fill some of that in.\n\n2052\n01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:57,450\nAll right, so let's do that.\n\n2053\n01:34:57,450 --> 01:34:58,200\nLet's just quickly do it.\n\n2054\n01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:00,920\nLet me just narrate through some of\nthis stuff that we wanna fill in\n\n2055\n01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:01,455\nhere real quick.\n\n2056\n01:35:01,455 --> 01:35:02,130\nMm-hm.\nSo, we're gonna\n\n2057\n01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:05,040\ntalk about this idea of being able\nto resolve with the root servers,\n\n2058\n01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:08,620\nwhich are gonna be the name space\nservers for the internet, right?\n\n2059\n01:35:08,620 --> 01:35:13,048\nAnd then we're gonna be able to do\na either iterative or recursive query.\n\n2060\n01:35:13,048 --> 01:35:15,540\nThese are the two kinds of\nqueries that we're gonna ask or\n\n2061\n01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:17,470\ntwo kinds of questions\nthat we're gonna ask.\n\n2062\n01:35:17,470 --> 01:35:18,700\nI think it was actually one T.\n\n2063\n01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:19,580\nIterative?\n\n2064\n01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:20,585\nYeah, iterative query.\n\n2065\n01:35:20,585 --> 01:35:22,620\nAnd/or a recursive query, right.\n\n2066\n01:35:22,620 --> 01:35:25,550\nAnd we'll define what each one is there,\nMike was just gonna lay that out for\n\n2067\n01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:27,800\nyou there,\nhe'll fill that in with some talking.\n\n2068\n01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:30,450\nSo, this idea of iterative or\nrecursive queries.\n\n2069\n01:35:30,450 --> 01:35:32,670\nThis idea of how we ask these questions,\nright?\n\n2070\n01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:35,350\nWhether we ask the question and\nwe say, Mike, do you know?\n\n2071\n01:35:35,350 --> 01:35:37,740\nAre you authoritative for cnn.com?\n\n2072\n01:35:37,740 --> 01:35:40,875\nMight come back, Mike might come back.\n\n2073\n01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:44,190\n[LAUGH] Mental note, don't put two Ms\nback to back in the same sentence.\n\n2074\n01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:48,960\nMike might come back to me and say, as the\nDNS server that I ask, oh absolutely I'm\n\n2075\n01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,970\nauthoritative I know, here's where\nit is and give me that answer.\n\n2076\n01:35:52,970 --> 01:35:56,910\nOr he might say you know,\nI'm not sure hold on a second alright.\n\n2077\n01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:59,719\nI gotta go out and\nI gotta find out for you, so stay put.\n\n2078\n01:35:59,719 --> 01:36:03,435\nI gotta go ask somebody else because I\ngotta find out because I don't know and\n\n2079\n01:36:03,435 --> 01:36:05,420\nI gotta work up and down that root chain.\n\n2080\n01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:09,390\nThat we have a root service to figure\nout which one may or may not be, so\n\n2081\n01:36:09,390 --> 01:36:11,730\nwe can give you effectively a referral.\n\n2082\n01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:14,150\nWe can tell you, hey, let me go look and\n\n2083\n01:36:14,150 --> 01:36:16,940\nsure enough, somebody else is\ngoing to be authoritative.\n\n2084\n01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:20,140\nJason or Joe or whoever, and\nI'm gonna send you over there.\n\n2085\n01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:24,500\nOr, if we go out far enough, we do this\nquery and we can't find a referral,\n\n2086\n01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,943\nwe have to come back and effectively\ntell you I'm sorry I can't resolve it.\n\n2087\n01:36:26,943 --> 01:36:30,280\n[CROSSTALK] I don't know,\nright, error 404, no page.\n\n2088\n01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,110\nNo way to resolve that,\ncan't give you that.\n\n2089\n01:36:32,110 --> 01:36:34,120\nSo we have these two kinds of queries,\nright,\n\n2090\n01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,248\nthat are gonna come up that\nwe have to be aware of.\n\n2091\n01:36:36,248 --> 01:36:39,150\nSo I wanna make sure that we understand\nthat, understand how we ask these\n\n2092\n01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:42,470\nquestions, but at the end of the day,\nthis is really important.\n\n2093\n01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:46,779\nBecause depending on the kind of question\nwe ask and the kind of answer we get back,\n\n2094\n01:36:46,779 --> 01:36:49,785\nwe may or may not be able to\nresolve the resource, right.\n\n2095\n01:36:49,785 --> 01:36:52,900\nAnd so we can also forward that request.\n\n2096\n01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:55,920\nRight, we can forward that request in\neffect out to somebody as we said.\n\n2097\n01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,586\nWe can use what's called a DNS forwarder.\n\n2098\n01:36:57,586 --> 01:37:02,380\nUse what's called a, in effect, forwarding\nthat lookup out to somebody else and so\n\n2099\n01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:05,840\ninside of our domains we typically\nwill say, we are the authoritative,\n\n2100\n01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,270\nwe are the root server for everything\nin the domain, in the directory space.\n\n2101\n01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:11,980\nBut then, if it's outside we\nhave to act as a forwarder and\n\n2102\n01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:15,890\nsend an external name resolution request\nout beyond the boundary of the network.\n\n2103\n01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:18,680\nTypically to your ISPs, DNS server,\nlet them do the work, right?\n\n2104\n01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:22,040\nRight, exactly, cuz you don't have\nthe visibility into the root servers\n\n2105\n01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,230\nto be able to query them directly.\n\n2106\n01:37:23,230 --> 01:37:26,310\nYou wanna effectively, as Mike said,\npass that heavy lifting off\n\n2107\n01:37:26,310 --> 01:37:30,220\nto somebody else who can do the query for\nyou automatically, right.\n\n2108\n01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,820\nSo we have this all laid out,\nand this is kinda what we do.\n\n2109\n01:37:32,820 --> 01:37:33,910\nSo can we go back to just.\n\n2110\n01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:34,880\nThe drawing?\n\n2111\n01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:37,750\nYeah, just for a second to kinda\nbring that back to where we were.\n\n2112\n01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:39,000\nSo we do those queries.\n\n2113\n01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,882\nWe work up and down the chain,\nand then as a result,\n\n2114\n01:37:41,882 --> 01:37:46,390\nwhen we get to the name space, the cnn.com\nor whatever, right, maybe we can.\n\n2115\n01:37:46,390 --> 01:37:49,648\nOkay, that's gonna be our- That's where\nI was gonna maybe put your little\n\n2116\n01:37:49,648 --> 01:37:50,285\nclient out here.\n\n2117\n01:37:50,285 --> 01:37:53,390\nOur website, yeah, okay,\nput the little client out there, perfect.\n\n2118\n01:37:53,390 --> 01:37:55,190\nYou know, where is or what is, right?\n\n2119\n01:37:55,190 --> 01:37:56,450\nWhat is the IP for, right?\n\n2120\n01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:58,140\nYeah, that's great, right?\n\n2121\n01:37:58,140 --> 01:37:58,947\nOf CNN, perfect, of CNN.com.\n\n2122\n01:37:58,947 --> 01:38:01,110\nMm-hm.\nThis is the question that you're asking,\n\n2123\n01:38:01,110 --> 01:38:02,270\nand so that's going over there.\n\n2124\n01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:04,400\nAnd that goes up to the DNS server.\n\n2125\n01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:05,050\nLocal DNS server.\n\n2126\n01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:06,270\nOkay, good, local DNS.\n\n2127\n01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:12,830\nAnd then we may want to put a remote DNS\nserver out there just because that may not\n\n2128\n01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:14,310\nbe able to get there, so\nyou know just something.\n\n2129\n01:38:14,310 --> 01:38:15,850\nLet's just kind of hide\nhim down here somewhere.\n\n2130\n01:38:15,850 --> 01:38:16,750\nYeah that's fine.\n\n2131\n01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:20,750\nJust that one's gonna wind up mirroring or\nbouncing out to the ISP DNS,\n\n2132\n01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:24,290\nwhich will then go out and do the whole\nresolution chain for us, right.\n\n2133\n01:38:24,290 --> 01:38:26,865\nAnd then at some point\nthat will come back,\n\n2134\n01:38:26,865 --> 01:38:29,995\nhopefully if everything works well and\nshow up with content on there.\n\n2135\n01:38:29,995 --> 01:38:32,265\nAnd so\nat some point we then have to go out, and\n\n2136\n01:38:32,265 --> 01:38:34,955\nthis is a two step process by the way,\njust want to be clear on this.\n\n2137\n01:38:34,955 --> 01:38:38,090\nSo we have this whole resolution, but\nwhen we get back the resolution to find\n\n2138\n01:38:38,090 --> 01:38:42,645\ncnn.com, we then have to drill\ninto cnn.com as a web server and\n\n2139\n01:38:42,645 --> 01:38:45,413\nfind the directory that we want,\nso we have to send.\n\n2140\n01:38:45,413 --> 01:38:49,920\nNow once we are told where it is,\nwe have to send a secondary packet\n\n2141\n01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:53,470\nto the web server and say,\nnow I want to see cnn.com.\n\n2142\n01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:57,099\nShow it to me and show me specifically\nindex.htm or whatever it is or\n\n2143\n01:38:57,099 --> 01:38:58,119\nwelcome.aspx and\n\n2144\n01:38:58,119 --> 01:39:01,826\nas a result we then get that displayed\nup on the window in the browser.\n\n2145\n01:39:01,826 --> 01:39:05,346\nBut that happens as a secondary step,\nbecause now that we have the address we\n\n2146\n01:39:05,346 --> 01:39:08,880\nnow have to go out and request it, so\nit's actually a multi-step process.\n\n2147\n01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,920\nAnd all this gets cached inside of\n\n2148\n01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:14,880\nthe DNS resolver cache\ninside of our local machine.\n\n2149\n01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,390\nAnd so one of the things that can happen\nwith DNS is if you get bad resolution\n\n2150\n01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:22,230\ninformation, you can get what's called\na DNS cache poisoning taking place.\n\n2151\n01:39:22,230 --> 01:39:26,300\nSo one of the attacks we have against DNS\neither on purpose or inadvertently right?\n\n2152\n01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:27,965\nWe may do it by accident not meaning to.\n\n2153\n01:39:27,965 --> 01:39:31,640\n[COUGH] And\nas a result of that, if we get,\n\n2154\n01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:34,540\nit's beginning to look like\na wiring schematic for a.\n\n2155\n01:39:34,540 --> 01:39:35,740\nGonna say,\ncan we tell what's going on there?\n\n2156\n01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:36,920\nWow, okay, yeah.\n\n2157\n01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:39,090\nSo I was lost back like,\nfive hours ago, right?\n\n2158\n01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:40,750\nThat's right [LAUGH].\n\n2159\n01:39:40,750 --> 01:39:43,060\nGee whiz, this looks like a game\nof chute and ladders, right?\n\n2160\n01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:45,880\nI haven't got to draw in like, I don't\nknow of any episodes I've drawn in yet\n\n2161\n01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:46,390\nand I love to doodle.\n\n2162\n01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:48,930\nI guess you just had it all pent up and\nyou just wanted to share.\n\n2163\n01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:49,510\nI've been waiting, yep.\n\n2164\n01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:51,485\nAll your drawing passion with the people.\n\n2165\n01:39:51,485 --> 01:39:53,760\n[LAUGH] All right so\nit all came out on the page here.\n\n2166\n01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:55,790\nSo we can see all of these arrows, right?\n\n2167\n01:39:55,790 --> 01:40:00,290\nMike will be providing a numbered road map\nas part of the downloadable supplement\n\n2168\n01:40:00,290 --> 01:40:04,560\nwith this signed work of art here Mr.\nJackson Pollock.\n\n2169\n01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,460\nAnd we will be showing that\nto you in a later episode,\n\n2170\n01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:11,602\nwith the secret decoder key that\ntells you how to find your way back.\n\n2171\n01:40:11,602 --> 01:40:14,760\n[LAUGH] So, what we have here is all\nthe different pathways, all kidding aside,\n\n2172\n01:40:14,760 --> 01:40:15,810\nthat Mike's putting out.\n\n2173\n01:40:15,810 --> 01:40:18,490\nHe's showing us the resolution\nat each stage, as we work up and\n\n2174\n01:40:18,490 --> 01:40:20,970\ndown the chain, which is very\nimportant to visualize, right?\n\n2175\n01:40:20,970 --> 01:40:22,795\nYeah, you can see where those\nrecursive queries come in,\n\n2176\n01:40:22,795 --> 01:40:25,063\nwhere those iterative queries come in,\nand how we kinda- Absolutely.\n\n2177\n01:40:25,063 --> 01:40:27,800\nAnd then,\nit's gonna be cached at that DNS server so\n\n2178\n01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:31,310\nif another client goes to get that same\nname, kinda speeds up that process.\n\n2179\n01:40:31,310 --> 01:40:33,420\nOr it could detriment that process and\nknock it down and\n\n2180\n01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:36,030\nslow it down if we cache the wrong\ninformation like I was saying.\n\n2181\n01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:38,840\nSo remember,\nyou can clear that cache on your machine.\n\n2182\n01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:41,070\nYou can't clear it on the server\nnecessarily cuz you may or\n\n2183\n01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:43,190\nmay not have rights to get to it,\nyou may not be able to get to it.\n\n2184\n01:40:43,190 --> 01:40:47,340\nBut on your local machine, you could\nclear that with an ipconfig command,\n\n2185\n01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:52,360\nspecifically ipcong / Display DNS\nto show the resolver cache, right?\n\n2186\n01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:54,150\nDid we background check the DNS cache?\n\n2187\n01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:55,380\nNo, not really, but we probably should.\n\n2188\n01:40:55,380 --> 01:40:57,260\nMake sure that we're not gonna\nshow the whole cache, right?\n\n2189\n01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:59,860\nI wonder what dansdata is,\nmust have been one of those images.\n\n2190\n01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:00,480\nDan's, yeah, yeah.\n\n2191\n01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:02,790\nProbably some of the stuff,\nwe went out there, absolutely, yeah.\n\n2192\n01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:06,235\nOr Dan is paying for some advertising\ntime according to the effort.\n\n2193\n01:41:06,235 --> 01:41:09,550\n[LAUGH] And so, this segment\nbrought to you by DansData.com.\n\n2194\n01:41:09,550 --> 01:41:11,710\nAll right, so we can see there and\n\n2195\n01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:14,660\nactually it's a good point because you're\nseeing all the different pictures.\n\n2196\n01:41:14,660 --> 01:41:16,860\nWe went out and found things on\nGoogle as we've been talking.\n\n2197\n01:41:16,860 --> 01:41:19,710\nSo these are like the blogs and whatever\nwe may have found those pictures from, so\n\n2198\n01:41:19,710 --> 01:41:21,890\nit's exactly what we would expect to see.\n\n2199\n01:41:21,890 --> 01:41:25,210\nWe see the TTL, the time to live there,\nand if we check in thirty,\n\n2200\n01:41:25,210 --> 01:41:26,795\nforty seconds that will go down.\n\n2201\n01:41:26,795 --> 01:41:29,825\nWell since we have all this, what we could\nthen do is, we're not gonna actually\n\n2202\n01:41:29,825 --> 01:41:32,770\nexecute, cuz you may want to have some of\nthat in there at some point in the future.\n\n2203\n01:41:32,770 --> 01:41:35,580\nBut do the IP config, flush DNS, right?\n\n2204\n01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:39,210\nAnd when we do flush DNS, what will\nhappen is it effectively wipes that out.\n\n2205\n01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:41,732\nAnd so, if Mike now does\nan ipconfig display DNS again,\n\n2206\n01:41:41,732 --> 01:41:44,308\nyou'll see there's nothing\nthat comes up in the cache,\n\n2207\n01:41:44,308 --> 01:41:47,220\nbecause he's just effectively\ncleaned it out, right?\n\n2208\n01:41:47,220 --> 01:41:49,690\nAnd so this is how we would\nreset the cache locally,\n\n2209\n01:41:49,690 --> 01:41:51,670\nif we're troubleshooting and\nhave a problem.\n\n2210\n01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:55,264\nAnd maybe everybody around you is getting\nonto the internet but you're not,\n\n2211\n01:41:55,264 --> 01:41:58,247\nthis is typically what an indication\nis of a bad resolver cache or\n\n2212\n01:41:58,247 --> 01:42:01,780\nan IP attack that's taken place for\nDNS around poisoning your cache.\n\n2213\n01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:03,360\nIt happens with file servers.\n\n2214\n01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:06,877\nI've gone and updated a file server's IP\naddress, made sure he registered himself\n\n2215\n01:42:06,877 --> 01:42:09,913\nwith DNS, but a client that had\nrecently connected to that file server,\n\n2216\n01:42:09,913 --> 01:42:11,097\nWouldn't be able to find it.\n\n2217\n01:42:11,097 --> 01:42:13,380\nAnd had already cached the old IP\naddress could no longer connect.\n\n2218\n01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:15,960\nThey called the help desk They're\nlike how come I can't connect.\n\n2219\n01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:19,510\nAnd I can ping it, I know it's IP address,\nso I know it's up and running, and I never\n\n2220\n01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:22,966\nrealized that the problem is exactly he's\ngot the old IP address cached to a little.\n\n2221\n01:42:22,966 --> 01:42:26,720\nAfter fifteen minutes of trying to explain\nto the end user how to do an ipconfig\n\n2222\n01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:30,242\nflush DNS, then walking down to their\nmachine and doing it for them, and\n\n2223\n01:42:30,242 --> 01:42:31,660\nthen everything connects.\n\n2224\n01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:36,052\nThat's why do need remote\ntechnology to connect.\n\n2225\n01:42:36,052 --> 01:42:39,680\nAll right, or users that can solve\ntheir own problems, one or the other.\n\n2226\n01:42:39,680 --> 01:42:41,698\n[LAUGH] All right, very good, so\nwe wanted to walk through this with you,\n\n2227\n01:42:41,698 --> 01:42:42,880\nobviously help you to understand this.\n\n2228\n01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:47,540\nThese are all network services or\nnetworking services are use to be able to\n\n2229\n01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:49,930\ncreate connectivity here as\nwe've been talking about.\n\n2230\n01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:53,880\nSo we've gone through and really hopefully\nhelped you to better understand DNS.\n\n2231\n01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:55,890\nShort list there just\nquickly throw out emails,\n\n2232\n01:42:55,890 --> 01:42:58,970\nanother service there that you may\nbe looking at as well as we wrap up.\n\n2233\n01:42:58,970 --> 01:43:00,420\nWe'll come back in our next episode,\n\n2234\n01:43:00,420 --> 01:43:03,100\nwe'll be able to talk about\nnating among many other things.\n\n2235\n01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:05,530\nContinue on our discussions,\ntalk a bit about firewalls,\n\n2236\n01:43:05,530 --> 01:43:08,550\nI think we have coming up on our list\nhere as well and our next episode.\n\n2237\n01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:10,970\nSo it'll be a lot of fun,\nplease come back and join us.\n\n2238\n01:43:10,970 --> 01:43:12,493\nWe'll see you soon after a short break.\n\n2239\n01:43:12,493 --> 01:43:19,576\n[SOUND]\n\n2240\n01:43:19,576 --> 01:43:22,187\n[LAUGH] All right welcome back everyone to\n\n2241\n01:43:22,187 --> 01:43:25,350\nour Telecom and\nNetwork Security show part two.\n\n2242\n01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:28,280\nWe are, we've been talking about all\nkinds of things, I don't know if I\n\n2243\n01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:31,730\ncould go back and list everything we've\ngone over but getting ready to get\n\n2244\n01:43:31,730 --> 01:43:36,530\ninto some more protocols and more\nservices that we can use on our network.\n\n2245\n01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:38,868\nSo let's start it off with maybe.\n\n2246\n01:43:38,868 --> 01:43:39,660\nTalk about NAT?\n\n2247\n01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:40,785\nNAT?\nNAT works for me.\n\n2248\n01:43:40,785 --> 01:43:41,576\nYeah, why not.\n\n2249\n01:43:41,576 --> 01:43:45,297\nLet's reach into the protocol routing\nhat of goodness, and pull NAT and\n\n2250\n01:43:45,297 --> 01:43:49,024\npull routing protocols out of there,\nwhich I think we'll go into next.\n\n2251\n01:43:49,024 --> 01:43:54,974\nSo we were talking before we took our\nbreak from our last episode about DNS,\n\n2252\n01:43:54,974 --> 01:44:00,084\nemail, DHCP, ARP, ICMP, etc.,\nwe went through all those.\n\n2253\n01:44:00,084 --> 01:44:03,122\nAnd we just had left off, we wanted to\njust quickly throw NAT into the mix,\n\n2254\n01:44:03,122 --> 01:44:04,543\nmake sure we got that one in there.\n\n2255\n01:44:04,543 --> 01:44:09,060\nSo NAT, Network Address Translation,\nthis idea of being able to take a private,\n\n2256\n01:44:09,060 --> 01:44:12,267\nnon-routable out beyond the LAN,\nroutable in the LAN but\n\n2257\n01:44:12,267 --> 01:44:15,370\nnot beyond the LAN,\nprivate set aside IP address.\n\n2258\n01:44:15,370 --> 01:44:18,320\nWe talked about those in\nour subnetting episodes\n\n2259\n01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:22,280\nin our show where we talked about the\nintroductory material around this topic.\n\n2260\n01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:25,240\nDon and I had done some work on subnetting\nand helped you to understand that.\n\n2261\n01:44:25,240 --> 01:44:26,420\nAnd IP addressing.\n\n2262\n01:44:26,420 --> 01:44:29,780\nSo we talked about Class,\nA Class B, and Class C addresses.\n\n2263\n01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:30,947\nOur private set-aside addresses.\n\n2264\n01:44:30,947 --> 01:44:35,138\nThe 10.0 range or the 10 dot range\nI should say rather was Class A.\n\n2265\n01:44:35,138 --> 01:44:39,153\nThe 172.16 to 172.31 was\nour private class B, and\n\n2266\n01:44:39,153 --> 01:44:45,850\n192.168.0 through 192.168.255 was\nour set aside, or private class C.\n\n2267\n01:44:45,850 --> 01:44:49,210\nSo, when we talk about netting,\nwe're talking about taking those private\n\n2268\n01:44:49,210 --> 01:44:51,880\ninternal IP address that\nare routable on the LAN.\n\n2269\n01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:54,535\nWe can move information around\nputting something that's on the LAN.\n\n2270\n01:44:54,535 --> 01:44:58,730\nBut we can't move them, route them out\nbeyond the routable interface on the WAM,\n\n2271\n01:44:58,730 --> 01:45:04,160\nthe default gateway, because if we do,\nall sorts of crazy things happen outside.\n\n2272\n01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:07,340\nOur ISPs stopped being able to send and\nreceive traffic properly\n\n2273\n01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:11,550\nbecause now we have multiple IP address\nendpoints with the same- Duplicates, yeah.\n\n2274\n01:45:11,550 --> 01:45:14,280\nAddress, and all of a sudden\nnobody knows where to send stuff.\n\n2275\n01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:15,140\nSo that's a bad thing.\n\n2276\n01:45:15,140 --> 01:45:18,030\nSo we use this concept, or at least\none of the ways we deal with that.\n\n2277\n01:45:18,030 --> 01:45:19,780\nProxying is another form.\n\n2278\n01:45:19,780 --> 01:45:24,060\nOur thought process here would be to use\nNAT, and NAT, network address translation,\n\n2279\n01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:28,900\nallows up to be able to hide those\ninternal publicly non routed\n\n2280\n01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:33,940\nIP addresses from view and\neffectively present an external\n\n2281\n01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:37,640\npublicly routeable IP address that will be\nused to send and receive information on\n\n2282\n01:45:37,640 --> 01:45:43,040\nbehalf of the internal client or customer\nthat is requesting that information.\n\n2283\n01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:47,160\nSo we have three ways of doing this, we\ncan use static mapping, we can use dynamic\n\n2284\n01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:50,600\nmapping, we can use what's called\nport access translation or PAT.\n\n2285\n01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:53,900\nAnd so let's just quickly kind of\nthink through the logic of this.\n\n2286\n01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:56,690\nStatic mapping, this is where\nwe're gonna be basically having\n\n2287\n01:45:56,690 --> 01:45:59,750\na pool of predefined\naddresses NAT has access to.\n\n2288\n01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:04,310\nThese are gonna be addresses that are for\nexternal IP configuration, right?\n\n2289\n01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:07,820\nOr rather,\nwe have a dedicated IP address for\n\n2290\n01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:10,750\nthe external,\nwe have a pool of IP addresses as well.\n\n2291\n01:46:10,750 --> 01:46:14,210\nEach IP address from the inside\nis mapped to the outside, so\n\n2292\n01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:15,680\nwe do a one to one mapping.\n\n2293\n01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:19,560\nAnd that static mapping then says whenever\nyou come in on this address looking for\n\n2294\n01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:22,540\nthis customer, kinda here's how\nwe are doing the translation.\n\n2295\n01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:24,000\nSo they're statically mapped.\n\n2296\n01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,500\nThey don't change, and\nthat's how that will occur.\n\n2297\n01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:29,680\nWe can do the same thing with dynamic\nmapping, again, the same concept with\n\n2298\n01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:33,610\nthe pool, where we have the external IPs,\nthe internal IPs, the difference is that\n\n2299\n01:46:33,610 --> 01:46:39,090\nwe dynamically map the internal pool of\naddresses to the external recipient or\n\n2300\n01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:42,020\nthe external IP address that\nwe are sending/receiving from.\n\n2301\n01:46:42,020 --> 01:46:48,618\nSo then the NAT does the little sleight\nof hand, and says today 192.168.0.1\n\n2302\n01:46:48,618 --> 01:46:52,200\nis gonna be mapped to here, whereas\ntomorrow may be a map to somewhere else.\n\n2303\n01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:56,611\nAnd so we're able to then simply change\nthat internal/external IP address mapping\n\n2304\n01:46:56,611 --> 01:46:57,460\non the fly.\n\n2305\n01:46:57,460 --> 01:47:00,360\nIt's a dynamic designation and\nthis is good when\n\n2306\n01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:03,340\nwe have large volumes of clients that\nkeep turning over as opposed to one or\n\n2307\n01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:07,160\ntwo specific machines we wanna map to and\njust kind of make available.\n\n2308\n01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:09,840\nAnd then port address translation,\nwhat we call PAT.\n\n2309\n01:47:11,260 --> 01:47:15,790\nPAT is going to allow us to be\nable to have an IP address and\n\n2310\n01:47:15,790 --> 01:47:18,630\na port number that is mapped for\nthe internal IP address,\n\n2311\n01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:23,090\nis mapped to the external routable\nIP on the NAT device, and so\n\n2312\n01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:27,665\nthat designation, almost like\na routing table, will be used to then\n\n2313\n01:47:27,665 --> 01:47:30,835\nsearch through that mapping\nsolution when we're on the inbound.\n\n2314\n01:47:30,835 --> 01:47:33,535\nSending traffic back\nin to try to find that\n\n2315\n01:47:33,535 --> 01:47:36,025\nclient that has been\nmaking those requests.\n\n2316\n01:47:36,025 --> 01:47:39,460\nAnd we will then, simply, do a lookup,\nwhich is effectively what's done.\n\n2317\n01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:42,220\nTo find the IP address and\nport mapping and\n\n2318\n01:47:42,220 --> 01:47:45,300\nthen resolve that information\nback to the internal client.\n\n2319\n01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:49,820\nSo we map not just the IP, but the IP and\na port number that is then assigned to\n\n2320\n01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:54,200\nclient A, client B, client C, then we're\nable to translate that back and forth and\n\n2321\n01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:56,390\nbe able to hide that internal identity.\n\n2322\n01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:57,860\nComing out through the NAT, and\n\n2323\n01:47:57,860 --> 01:48:01,780\nthen on the way back in, map back to it to\ndeliver the traffic on the return trip.\n\n2324\n01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:04,350\nSo this is what we call\nPort Address Translation so.\n\n2325\n01:48:04,350 --> 01:48:06,790\nAll this is used all the time,\nin your home networks even,\n\n2326\n01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:08,150\nin your corporate networks.\n\n2327\n01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:11,280\nIn fact most of you, if you go pull\nup a command prompt right now,\n\n2328\n01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:13,430\nodds are you've got\na private IP address yet,\n\n2329\n01:48:13,430 --> 01:48:16,350\nyou're still connected to the internet and\nyou're still seeing our videos,\n\n2330\n01:48:16,350 --> 01:48:20,640\nso something is doing some network\naddress translation for you in there.\n\n2331\n01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:21,580\nMagic.\nYeah, I know.\n\n2332\n01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:23,480\nMagic box.\nIt's the little fairies and\n\n2333\n01:48:23,480 --> 01:48:26,348\ngnomes in our devices,\nright, that's what it is.\n\n2334\n01:48:26,348 --> 01:48:31,490\nLittle sprinkle of fairy pixy dust on the\ndevice and everything works like magic.\n\n2335\n01:48:31,490 --> 01:48:33,308\nSo that is how that is going to work.\n\n2336\n01:48:33,308 --> 01:48:36,620\nI just wanna make sure that you're\ncomfortable with the ideas behind that.\n\n2337\n01:48:36,620 --> 01:48:40,670\nAs Mike pointed out correctly,\n100% accurate about that, spot on in\n\n2338\n01:48:40,670 --> 01:48:43,930\nthe sense that we say absolutely we\nuse these technologies everyday.\n\n2339\n01:48:43,930 --> 01:48:44,630\nWe use them at home.\n\n2340\n01:48:44,630 --> 01:48:45,570\nWe use them at work.\n\n2341\n01:48:45,570 --> 01:48:46,440\nWe use them everywhere we go.\n\n2342\n01:48:46,440 --> 01:48:47,420\nWe don't even think about them.\n\n2343\n01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:48,640\nThey're so invisible today.\n\n2344\n01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:50,000\nThey're so ubiquitous.\n\n2345\n01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,860\nAnd they're past these in the sense\nthat a lot of this is just automated and\n\n2346\n01:48:52,860 --> 01:48:54,416\nare handled for us by the software.\n\n2347\n01:48:54,416 --> 01:48:55,980\nYeah.\nWe don't even think about it anymore.\n\n2348\n01:48:55,980 --> 01:48:58,800\nAnd it really helped us extend\nthe lifetime of IPv4 until\n\n2349\n01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:00,940\nwe came up with our new\nsolution with IPv6.\n\n2350\n01:49:00,940 --> 01:49:04,314\nIt did absolutely, which we are now\nimplementing ever so slowly.\n\n2351\n01:49:04,314 --> 01:49:05,662\nEver so slowly.\n\n2352\n01:49:05,662 --> 01:49:07,870\nWe are running out of IP addresses,\nbut let's not rush.\n\n2353\n01:49:07,870 --> 01:49:11,230\nCall that a fix, let's just keep\nplodding along using IPv4 and\n\n2354\n01:49:11,230 --> 01:49:14,550\nnot worry about it because we're never\nreally gonna run out of IP addresses.\n\n2355\n01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:16,060\nThere's no hurry.\n\n2356\n01:49:16,060 --> 01:49:19,050\nIt's a big myth spread by Google and\nAmazon to get you to buy a new Cloud.\n\n2357\n01:49:19,050 --> 01:49:21,915\nIt has nothing to do with real IP\naddresses not being available.\n\n2358\n01:49:21,915 --> 01:49:23,560\n[LAUGH] All right, so.\n\n2359\n01:49:23,560 --> 01:49:26,180\nI digress, I digress, right?\n\n2360\n01:49:26,180 --> 01:49:29,020\nAll right, so routing protocols,\nlet's talk about routing protocols.\n\n2361\n01:49:29,020 --> 01:49:34,370\nSo the idea here with routing protocols is\nagain adding another layer of complexity.\n\n2362\n01:49:34,370 --> 01:49:37,220\nAnother layer of richness\nof detail into our\n\n2363\n01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:40,120\narchitecture that we're building\nhere around networking and security.\n\n2364\n01:49:40,120 --> 01:49:42,110\nYou know we've talked about\nreally deconstructing and\n\n2365\n01:49:42,110 --> 01:49:43,920\nstructuring from the OSI model up.\n\n2366\n01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:46,580\nAnd so now we're gonna add\nsome functionality in here and\n\n2367\n01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:50,310\nreally think about how we're gonna start\nspeaking the language of routing and\n\n2368\n01:49:50,310 --> 01:49:54,090\nmoving information around with protocols\nthat help us to understand how to manage\n\n2369\n01:49:54,090 --> 01:49:56,310\nand send that information back and forth.\n\n2370\n01:49:56,310 --> 01:49:59,100\nAnd so before we do that,\nlet's just talk about this concept\n\n2371\n01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:01,255\nof what a routing protocol represents,\nspecifically.\n\n2372\n01:50:01,255 --> 01:50:04,000\nAnd we'll talk about the two types,\nthe interior and the exterior.\n\n2373\n01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,200\nI mentioned just now that\nthis is like a language.\n\n2374\n01:50:06,200 --> 01:50:07,950\nAnd protocols are languages.\n\n2375\n01:50:07,950 --> 01:50:11,760\nThey are sets of instructions that help\nus to understand how to do something.\n\n2376\n01:50:11,760 --> 01:50:15,350\nAnd as a result of that,\nthe routing protocol specifically,\n\n2377\n01:50:15,350 --> 01:50:19,428\nset of instructions that help us to focus\non how we're gonna move information.\n\n2378\n01:50:19,428 --> 01:50:24,290\nHow we're gonna route it from one point\nto another whether it is internal or\n\n2379\n01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:28,560\nexternal, using either one\nof two mechanisms, right?\n\n2380\n01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:34,630\nAnd so we are gonna use either a distance\nvector solution and we'll define\n\n2381\n01:50:34,630 --> 01:50:39,230\nwhat these are in just a minute for you,\ndistance vector, or a link state, right?\n\n2382\n01:50:39,230 --> 01:50:41,684\nDistance vector, distance equals -vector.\n\n2383\n01:50:41,684 --> 01:50:43,790\n[LAUGH] New routing topology.\n\n2384\n01:50:43,790 --> 01:50:45,510\nRight.\nOrganizational structure we're\n\n2385\n01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:46,340\ncreating here.\n\n2386\n01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:48,240\nMike's going into the protocol business,\nright?\n\n2387\n01:50:48,240 --> 01:50:48,810\nAbsolutely.\n\n2388\n01:50:48,810 --> 01:50:49,450\nGood money there.\n\n2389\n01:50:49,450 --> 01:50:51,800\nYou're just inspector routing 3.0\nbrought to you by Mike, right?\n\n2390\n01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:54,730\nSo, we have distance vector and,\nor we have link state.\n\n2391\n01:50:54,730 --> 01:50:57,870\nAnd these are the two types that are going\nto be used when we talk about routing\n\n2392\n01:50:57,870 --> 01:50:58,950\nprotocol types.\n\n2393\n01:50:58,950 --> 01:51:02,170\nThese are two main types of routing\nprotocols that are available out there.\n\n2394\n01:51:02,170 --> 01:51:04,410\nAnd so\nwe're gonna ascribe that functionality,\n\n2395\n01:51:04,410 --> 01:51:06,920\nwe'll define what distance\nvector versus links state is.\n\n2396\n01:51:06,920 --> 01:51:08,970\nWe're gonna ascribe that to\nall the different interior and\n\n2397\n01:51:08,970 --> 01:51:10,710\nexterior protocols as we go through.\n\n2398\n01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:12,030\nSo that's what we're gonna do.\n\n2399\n01:51:12,030 --> 01:51:13,690\nSo let's talk about how\neach one of these works.\n\n2400\n01:51:13,690 --> 01:51:18,260\nSo distance vector, it's going to be this\nidea of looking at a certain number of\n\n2401\n01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:21,850\nvariables that go into making up how we\nare moving information back and forth.\n\n2402\n01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:23,410\nWe look at distance, as the name implies.\n\n2403\n01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:25,350\nSo hop count is what we look at here.\n\n2404\n01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:27,202\nRight?\nWe're gonna look at effectively\n\n2405\n01:51:27,202 --> 01:51:28,450\nthe number of hops.\n\n2406\n01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:32,240\nHow far is it going to be away\nfrom us to get to that end point.\n\n2407\n01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:34,640\nAnd each stop along the way is a hop, so\n\n2408\n01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:38,460\nwe talk about a hop count if we\nare trying to connect from Mike to I,\n\n2409\n01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:41,120\nright here the way we are,\nthis would be a single hop, right?\n\n2410\n01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:42,230\nBack and forth.\n\n2411\n01:51:42,230 --> 01:51:45,485\nBut if then one of us tries to go\nout beyond this little podium here,\n\n2412\n01:51:45,485 --> 01:51:49,206\nmaybe go to the next desk down in the\nstudio and maybe out the studio door right\n\n2413\n01:51:49,206 --> 01:51:51,906\ninto the lobby and\nthose would be two additional hops.\n\n2414\n01:51:51,906 --> 01:51:55,347\nWe would go one hop,\nstudio desk two hops, lobby door or\n\n2415\n01:51:55,347 --> 01:51:59,460\ndoor to lobby three hops and\nthen maybe lobby to outside four hops.\n\n2416\n01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:03,964\nAnd so we can look at hop count And the\nfurther away something is, the further in\n\n2417\n01:52:03,964 --> 01:52:08,123\ndistance it is, then we have to count\nthat in as a result of how we factor,\n\n2418\n01:52:08,123 --> 01:52:12,320\nwhether that's the best path to\nget to that particular end point.\n\n2419\n01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:16,530\nSo the distance vector routing system\nwill look at a routing protocol\n\n2420\n01:52:16,530 --> 01:52:20,500\nsolution looks at how far away you are and\nis there a cheaper alternative,\n\n2421\n01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:24,930\na less hop intensive route that\nwe can use in order to find U?\n\n2422\n01:52:24,930 --> 01:52:27,740\nAnd we look at vector,\nthe vector part is direction.\n\n2423\n01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:31,760\nSo we look at hop count and direction in\norder to figure out how to see whether or\n\n2424\n01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:32,660\nnot you are close or\n\n2425\n01:52:32,660 --> 01:52:36,810\nfar, near or far, and then as a result\nfigure out what the best path is.\n\n2426\n01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:39,880\nSo distance and vector, direction,\nand, ultimately hop count.\n\n2427\n01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:43,770\nAnd then, when we talk about link state,\nwe're talking about a solution that looks\n\n2428\n01:52:43,770 --> 01:52:48,200\nat the ability to be able to figure out\nwhat the state literally is of our link.\n\n2429\n01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:51,720\nIs it up, is it down, is it a good link,\nright, is it flapping,\n\n2430\n01:52:51,720 --> 01:52:52,650\nis it going up and down?\n\n2431\n01:52:52,650 --> 01:52:53,374\nThat kind of thing.\n\n2432\n01:52:53,374 --> 01:52:54,420\nRight?\nFlappy bird,\n\n2433\n01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:56,810\nangry bird that sort of thing right?\n\n2434\n01:52:56,810 --> 01:52:59,810\nSo we basically are looking at a more\naccurate routing table because what we're\n\n2435\n01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:03,050\ndoing is we're looking at real time,\nor almost real time updates,\n\n2436\n01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:07,480\nbecause routers, or routing protocols,\nthat use link state are gonna send out and\n\n2437\n01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:10,302\nbroadcast updates about\ntheir state to others.\n\n2438\n01:53:10,302 --> 01:53:12,820\nSo they're gonna update routing\ntables based on link state\n\n2439\n01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:16,140\nby using this mechanism of\nsending out this information.\n\n2440\n01:53:16,140 --> 01:53:20,720\nAnd so routing devices that are using\nlink state protocols are gonna have\n\n2441\n01:53:20,720 --> 01:53:24,550\nalmost real-time intelligence about\nthe state of the routes that are laid out.\n\n2442\n01:53:24,550 --> 01:53:29,190\nAnd then routes that go down or routes\nthat become untenable due to congestion or\n\n2443\n01:53:29,190 --> 01:53:33,860\npath costs, things like that because of\nchange in status can be avoided in favor\n\n2444\n01:53:33,860 --> 01:53:37,850\nof better routes, routes that are perhaps\nless congested or things of that nature.\n\n2445\n01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:41,535\nSo linked state routing protocols\nare gonna provide almost near time or\n\n2446\n01:53:41,535 --> 01:53:44,440\nreal-time update intelligence\nthrough these broadcasts.\n\n2447\n01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:47,590\nThese updates that go out in order\nto update what's going on with us\n\n2448\n01:53:47,590 --> 01:53:48,570\nalong the way.\n\n2449\n01:53:48,570 --> 01:53:52,030\nAnd so now that we understand the general\nidea behind the different kinds\n\n2450\n01:53:52,030 --> 01:53:55,430\nof protocols in terms of distance,\nvector, and early state,\n\n2451\n01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:58,580\nlet's take a look at what protocol is\ngonna fall into what category here.\n\n2452\n01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:01,660\nSo we have RIP and\nwe have a designation of v1 and v2\n\n2453\n01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:05,440\nnext to RIP because we have two different,\nyou know, older and newer types of RIP.\n\n2454\n01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:08,690\nRIP routing information protocols,\nwhat RIP stands for.\n\n2455\n01:54:08,690 --> 01:54:10,480\nSo it's a distance vector protocol.\n\n2456\n01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:15,420\nSo RIP will use distance vector in order\nto be able to figure out how to send\n\n2457\n01:54:15,420 --> 01:54:16,670\ninformation.\n\n2458\n01:54:16,670 --> 01:54:18,280\nOpen shortest path first.\n\n2459\n01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:19,420\nDid we do OSPF?\n\n2460\n01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:20,610\nOSPF is down there?\n\n2461\n01:54:20,610 --> 01:54:24,720\nOh, either way, I was going to say we'd go\nback up but doing OSPF so let's do OSPF.\n\n2462\n01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:27,940\nOSPF because I just have it in\nthat order in my particular notes,\n\n2463\n01:54:27,940 --> 01:54:30,190\nthe way I made my notes I\nhappen to put OSPF next.\n\n2464\n01:54:30,190 --> 01:54:32,070\nSo that is a links date algorithm.\n\n2465\n01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:35,380\nSo that's going to send out up updates\nto the routing table using link state.\n\n2466\n01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:39,400\nInterior gateway routing protocol,\nthe next one down, was IGRP.\n\n2467\n01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:41,250\nInterior gateway routing protocol,\n\n2468\n01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:44,790\nthis is going to be a distance vector\nrouting protocol, but it is proprietary.\n\n2469\n01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:48,840\nIt was developed by Cisco and\nis used by them in their gear.\n\n2470\n01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:54,870\nEIGRP, which is just enhanced interior\ngateway routing, again, Cisco proprietary\n\n2471\n01:54:54,870 --> 01:54:59,370\njust an updated version of IGRP, that\nwill also be a distance vector solution.\n\n2472\n01:55:02,980 --> 01:55:06,090\nWe also have intermediate system\nto intermediate system or\n\n2473\n01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:10,870\nwhat is known as IS-IS Or just, you know.\n\n2474\n01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:11,870\nJust is.\n\n2475\n01:55:11,870 --> 01:55:12,740\nJust is, right.\n\n2476\n01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:14,840\nI just am.\nThe positive, the to be, right,\n\n2477\n01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:16,730\nas opposed to the currency.\n\n2478\n01:55:16,730 --> 01:55:19,280\nSo a little grammatical humor there.\n\n2479\n01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:20,980\nWe're jumping off the cliff.\n\n2480\n01:55:20,980 --> 01:55:23,780\nAll right, so IS-IS, right, which is\ngonna be the intermediate state to\n\n2481\n01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:27,230\nintermediate state,\nthat is gonna be a link state protocol.\n\n2482\n01:55:27,230 --> 01:55:29,530\nSo that's gonna use link state as well,\nright?\n\n2483\n01:55:29,530 --> 01:55:32,160\nAnd then for the exterior side,\nwe have what is known as BGP.\n\n2484\n01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:34,465\nThis is gonna be our\nborder gateway protocol.\n\n2485\n01:55:34,465 --> 01:55:37,220\nMm-hm.\nBGP is going to actually be interesting,\n\n2486\n01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:40,650\nit's a combination of link state and\ndistance vector, so it's gonna do both.\n\n2487\n01:55:40,650 --> 01:55:43,960\nSo it actually combines both,\nkinda using the best of both worlds,\n\n2488\n01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:46,640\nsets up as one and\nthen operates as the other.\n\n2489\n01:55:46,640 --> 01:55:48,410\nSo it will combine both.\n\n2490\n01:55:48,410 --> 01:55:52,900\nEGP is a very old external or\nexterior gateway protocol.\n\n2491\n01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:55,280\nIt's referred to as\nexterior gateway protocol.\n\n2492\n01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:57,170\nIt's really out-of-date\nby today's standards.\n\n2493\n01:55:57,170 --> 01:55:59,260\nWe don't EGP by itself anymore.\n\n2494\n01:55:59,260 --> 01:56:01,730\nWe actually, simply, BGP replaced EGP.\n\n2495\n01:56:01,730 --> 01:56:05,010\nBut what we see is we see\nEGP as a general category.\n\n2496\n01:56:05,010 --> 01:56:10,630\nWe refer now to these Exterior protocols\nas EGP protocols exterior gateway,\n\n2497\n01:56:10,630 --> 01:56:14,380\nexcuse me, exterior gateway protocol,\nso BGP is just in that category.\n\n2498\n01:56:14,380 --> 01:56:18,930\nBut it's in and of itself BGP has replaced\nEGP, you don't see EGP being used anymore.\n\n2499\n01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:20,055\nIt's more of a categorical,\n\n2500\n01:56:20,055 --> 01:56:22,965\ndescriptive name now than an outdated\nprotocol that we actually use.\n\n2501\n01:56:22,965 --> 01:56:25,225\nSo would not worry about EGP per se,\n\n2502\n01:56:25,225 --> 01:56:28,165\nmyself, meaning that I don't really\nneed to know anything about it.\n\n2503\n01:56:28,165 --> 01:56:31,200\nI just need to know that it refers\nto exterior gateway protocols and\n\n2504\n01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:33,005\nBGP is a current example of one.\n\n2505\n01:56:33,005 --> 01:56:34,775\nLet's put it that way,\nright, if that makes sense.\n\n2506\n01:56:34,775 --> 01:56:36,465\nSo that's what we're thinking about there.\n\n2507\n01:56:38,150 --> 01:56:40,880\nAnd so,\nI mentioned router flapping a minute ago.\n\n2508\n01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:44,420\nWe joked around it for a second, but you\nwanna make sure that we understand that in\n\n2509\n01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:48,700\nrelation to link state solutions and\nupdates, route flapping or\n\n2510\n01:56:48,700 --> 01:56:52,180\nrouter flapping is this idea of\nthe link state going up and down,\n\n2511\n01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:54,910\nand seeing that that update\nis happening back and forth.\n\n2512\n01:56:54,910 --> 01:56:59,390\nSo a router flap, or router flapping, or\nroute flapping, you can hear it referred\n\n2513\n01:56:59,390 --> 01:57:03,040\nto different ways, is this idea that we\nare constantly seeing this fluctuation,\n\n2514\n01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:07,460\nthis back and forth change in the state\nof a path, or the state of a device.\n\n2515\n01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:11,020\nAs a result of that, that can also lead\nto instability, and perhaps to that route\n\n2516\n01:57:11,020 --> 01:57:14,280\nbeing marked as no longer valid,\nbecause it's not seen as being stable.\n\n2517\n01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:15,770\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n2518\n01:57:15,770 --> 01:57:19,020\nAnd we also will say that if\nrouters don't receive updates\n\n2519\n01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:22,560\nin the link state solution,\nthat since they're out of alignment now,\n\n2520\n01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:24,620\nthey're not updated,\nthat they're in a black hole.\n\n2521\n01:57:24,620 --> 01:57:28,120\nWe talk about this as being\na black hole event for\n\n2522\n01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:30,851\na router when it does not\nreceive a [LAUGH] tape.\n\n2523\n01:57:30,851 --> 01:57:34,565\nAnd so as a result of that, we want to\nmake sure we have that correctly there.\n\n2524\n01:57:34,565 --> 01:57:38,210\n[LAUGH] And so when link state updates\nare not going to be received by\n\n2525\n01:57:38,210 --> 01:57:41,890\nrouters over a period of time we\nrefer to that event as being a black\n\n2526\n01:57:41,890 --> 01:57:44,130\nhole event where the router\nis not being updated.\n\n2527\n01:57:44,130 --> 01:57:46,190\nThe link state updates,\nin other words, are not happening.\n\n2528\n01:57:46,190 --> 01:57:48,870\nJust want to make sure we're\naware of that as well.\n\n2529\n01:57:48,870 --> 01:57:52,000\nSo just, some additional language,\nvocabulary,\n\n2530\n01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,520\nideas we just want to\nshare with you there.\n\n2531\n01:57:55,150 --> 01:57:59,320\nSo we've talked about all of these\ndevices, these communication devices,\n\n2532\n01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:00,810\nrouters, bridges, switches, hubs.\n\n2533\n01:58:00,810 --> 01:58:02,350\nWe've put all that into perspective.\n\n2534\n01:58:02,350 --> 01:58:05,320\nWe want to make sure we spend some\ntime talking about firewalls, and\n\n2535\n01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:09,060\nreally explain and detail through\nthe idea of how firewalls work.\n\n2536\n01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:11,980\nWe've developed a pretty robust and\nthorough list there of\n\n2537\n01:58:11,980 --> 01:58:15,850\nthe different kinds of firewalls by\ngeneration that we will see here.\n\n2538\n01:58:15,850 --> 01:58:20,380\nSo let's first step back a little bit and\ntalk about the concept of firewalls.\n\n2539\n01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:24,290\nWe'll talk about the different policy\ntypes here and the generations.\n\n2540\n01:58:24,290 --> 01:58:27,576\nFirewall is going to be either\na hardware or a software device, right?\n\n2541\n01:58:27,576 --> 01:58:30,570\nSo these could be virtualized,\nthey could be physical today,\n\n2542\n01:58:30,570 --> 01:58:32,810\nthey could be software based,\nhardware based.\n\n2543\n01:58:32,810 --> 01:58:36,010\nIt used to be years ago, the only game\nin town was a hardware based firewall.\n\n2544\n01:58:36,010 --> 01:58:39,200\nWe didn't really have too much,\nat least in enterprise level solutions.\n\n2545\n01:58:39,200 --> 01:58:43,100\nAnyway, we didn't really have too many\nchoices for software-based firewalls, but\n\n2546\n01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:43,600\nwe had one or two.\n\n2547\n01:58:43,600 --> 01:58:47,190\nWe had Check Point for some time, a very\nfamous, very well-known software-based\n\n2548\n01:58:47,190 --> 01:58:51,180\nfirewall, but in general we had\nconsumer-based software firewalls, right?\n\n2549\n01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:53,013\nLike Black Ice- ZoneAlarm [CROSSTALK].\n\n2550\n01:58:53,013 --> 01:58:55,320\nAnd, some of these things, ZoneAlarm,\nanother oldie but a goodie.\n\n2551\n01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:57,550\nRight?\nBut they were not really enterprise grade.\n\n2552\n01:58:57,550 --> 01:59:01,250\nYou didn't see these being run\non servers and for businesses.\n\n2553\n01:59:01,250 --> 01:59:04,510\nSo traditionally firewalls were\nthought of as hardware based early on.\n\n2554\n01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:08,310\nBut we now have enterprise grade firewalls\nthat are hardware and software based.\n\n2555\n01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:11,310\nSo they can be virtualized,\nthey could be running physically today,\n\n2556\n01:59:11,310 --> 01:59:12,710\ndoesn't really matter.\n\n2557\n01:59:12,710 --> 01:59:18,310\nWe have virtual firewalls and virtualized\nenvironments, so VMware, and Microsoft and\n\n2558\n01:59:18,310 --> 01:59:22,060\nCitrix all have firewalls associated\nwith their virtualization platforms\n\n2559\n01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:27,400\nthat are virtualized built right into\nthe kernel, or the virtualization stack.\n\n2560\n01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:28,990\nWe can take physical firewalls and\n\n2561\n01:59:28,990 --> 01:59:32,910\nvirtualize them in some cases\nlike we do network switches.\n\n2562\n01:59:32,910 --> 01:59:35,910\nWe can also take software based\nfirewall implementations and\n\n2563\n01:59:35,910 --> 01:59:37,990\nsimply run them inside of\na virtual machine, and\n\n2564\n01:59:37,990 --> 01:59:41,730\nmake them virtual just by nature\nof virtualizing the underlying OS.\n\n2565\n01:59:41,730 --> 01:59:44,655\nSo firewalls are gonna be\none of several types today.\n\n2566\n01:59:44,655 --> 01:59:45,710\nMm-hm.\n\n2567\n01:59:45,710 --> 01:59:49,537\nHowever having said that,\nthe firewall concept is the same, and\n\n2568\n01:59:49,537 --> 01:59:53,096\nthe idea is do we have one of\nthose on those network diagrams?\n\n2569\n01:59:53,096 --> 01:59:56,045\nMaybe you could just figure\nout how to bring one up for\n\n2570\n01:59:56,045 --> 01:59:58,203\nus quickly just while we are talking.\n\n2571\n01:59:58,203 --> 02:00:03,240\nAnd so the idea behind a network firewall,\ngenerically firewall, is That we are going\n\n2572\n02:00:03,240 --> 02:00:08,150\nto be thinking about this device that sits\nbetween us and the outside world, right?\n\n2573\n02:00:08,150 --> 02:00:12,030\nAnd so as a result of this,\nwe often see the Internet outside,\n\n2574\n02:00:12,030 --> 02:00:15,880\nsomething like this would be a great\nexample, we see the Internet outside.\n\n2575\n02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:20,390\nAnd then we have this device that is\ngonna somehow broker the conversation and\n\n2576\n02:00:20,390 --> 02:00:24,280\nsecure information for us on the inbound,\nand also on the outbound\n\n2577\n02:00:24,280 --> 02:00:27,850\nby seeing the firewall on the left side\nof the router in the diagram there.\n\n2578\n02:00:27,850 --> 02:00:31,180\nAnd then the firewall allows\nus to access well defined and\n\n2579\n02:00:31,180 --> 02:00:34,210\npredetermined paths into areas\nof our internal network.\n\n2580\n02:00:34,210 --> 02:00:36,504\nWhether, it is a DMC as we see over there,\n\n2581\n02:00:36,504 --> 02:00:40,070\noff one of the multi home spurs\non the firewall or down below.\n\n2582\n02:00:40,070 --> 02:00:44,190\nIf we go down directly clockwise there at\n6 o'clock down at the bottom were we get\n\n2583\n02:00:44,190 --> 02:00:49,360\ninto the internal LAN as opposed to over\nthere at like 9 o'clock out to the DMZ.\n\n2584\n02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:52,950\nWhat did we ever do before we\nhad time to refer to things by?\n\n2585\n02:00:52,950 --> 02:00:54,240\nWhat did we do back then?\n\n2586\n02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:56,830\nJust said half past the sundial?\n\n2587\n02:00:56,830 --> 02:00:59,080\n[LAUGH] Before we had the clock and\nthat whole thing.\n\n2588\n02:00:59,080 --> 02:01:01,574\nSo but you can see there,\nwe will refer back and forth and\n\n2589\n02:01:01,574 --> 02:01:04,196\nthe idea of the behind\nthe firewall is simply this.\n\n2590\n02:01:04,196 --> 02:01:08,720\nThat it's gonna act as a gateway device\nthat is going to basically interdict it's\n\n2591\n02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:11,250\ngonna stop and\ninspect traffic in some form.\n\n2592\n02:01:11,250 --> 02:01:13,230\nAnd depending on the generation\nof the firewall,\n\n2593\n02:01:13,230 --> 02:01:15,040\nwe'll go through those in\nthe minute of the notes.\n\n2594\n02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:18,960\nWe're gonna see certain kinds of behavior,\ncertain kinds of intelligence brought\n\n2595\n02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:21,360\nto the table around how\nthese firewalls behave,\n\n2596\n02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:24,270\nand if the firewall's\ndoing packet inspection.\n\n2597\n02:01:24,270 --> 02:01:28,220\nWe call it first gen or\n1G network or excuse me, 1G network,\n\n2598\n02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:29,380\nI sound like a cell phone carrier.\n\n2599\n02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:30,951\n[LAUGH] A 1G firewall.\n\n2600\n02:01:30,951 --> 02:01:34,115\nWhat we're gonna see there is\nbasically a very basic solution,\n\n2601\n02:01:34,115 --> 02:01:37,105\nnot a lot of complexity,\nnot a lot of intelligence brought to\n\n2602\n02:01:37,105 --> 02:01:39,627\nthe table around interdicting packets but\nstill,\n\n2603\n02:01:39,627 --> 02:01:43,670\nwe're gonna be able to tell it there's\nbasic information coming in and out.\n\n2604\n02:01:43,670 --> 02:01:46,360\nAnd monitor or\nperhaps stop that information\n\n2605\n02:01:46,360 --> 02:01:51,060\nfrom flowing based on finding certain\nevidence inside of the data packet header.\n\n2606\n02:01:51,060 --> 02:01:53,620\nThe IP address the Mac address,\nsomething like that.\n\n2607\n02:01:53,620 --> 02:01:57,180\nThat we say yes or no, simply allow or\ndeny a black or a white list.\n\n2608\n02:01:57,180 --> 02:02:00,200\nWhen we get into some of the smarter\nfirewalls, second, third,\n\n2609\n02:02:00,200 --> 02:02:01,160\nfourth generation.\n\n2610\n02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:06,550\nWhat we're seeing is the ability to track\nnot just the actual packet itself and\n\n2611\n02:02:06,550 --> 02:02:10,510\nlook at the structure of the packet, but\nIP addressing in other words for instance.\n\n2612\n02:02:10,510 --> 02:02:14,680\nWe're gonna be looking at actually\nthe services that are originating or\n\n2613\n02:02:14,680 --> 02:02:16,870\nrequest in this,\nthen we're gonna start looking at state.\n\n2614\n02:02:16,870 --> 02:02:19,690\nWe're gonna look at the entire\nstructure of the data stream,\n\n2615\n02:02:19,690 --> 02:02:22,940\nnot just individual packets,\nas a holistic solution.\n\n2616\n02:02:22,940 --> 02:02:25,860\nAnd start tracking not one packet,\nbut an entire data stream.\n\n2617\n02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:27,340\nRIght.\nAnd understand the impact of that on\n\n2618\n02:02:27,340 --> 02:02:28,170\nour network.\n\n2619\n02:02:28,170 --> 02:02:31,590\nAnd as we continue stepping up, we'll be\nable to do this in real time and actually,\n\n2620\n02:02:31,590 --> 02:02:34,340\nartificially and virtually,\nbuild and construct and\n\n2621\n02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:38,040\ndeconstruct entire networking kernels\non the fly to be able to deal with data\n\n2622\n02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:41,890\npackets in these later generation,\nwhat are called Next Gen Firewalls.\n\n2623\n02:02:41,890 --> 02:02:44,150\nSo let's go through and\nactually take a look step by step here.\n\n2624\n02:02:44,150 --> 02:02:47,360\nSo we have five generations of\nfirewalls that we think of, and\n\n2625\n02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:50,660\nwe wanna make sure we understand what\nthe functionality is of each one.\n\n2626\n02:02:50,660 --> 02:02:55,350\nSo one gen or first generation firewalls\nare packet fillers as I mentioned,\n\n2627\n02:02:55,350 --> 02:02:57,410\nthese are typically screening routers.\n\n2628\n02:02:57,410 --> 02:02:59,400\nScreening routers are typically\ngood examples of this.\n\n2629\n02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:03,610\nThey have access control that are often\nused to create this opportunity to screen.\n\n2630\n02:03:03,610 --> 02:03:06,249\nThey will examine sources and\ndestination IPs in the header.\n\n2631\n02:03:06,249 --> 02:03:11,103\nSo they're gonna look at basic data packet\nheader information and they're typically\n\n2632\n02:03:11,103 --> 02:03:15,106\nare found operating on layer three and\nlayer four of the OSI model.\n\n2633\n02:03:15,106 --> 02:03:19,810\nSo our [COUGH] excuse me, our network and\nour transport layers of the OSI model,\n\n2634\n02:03:19,810 --> 02:03:22,730\nbecause they're interjecting\na locate IP address information and\n\n2635\n02:03:22,730 --> 02:03:27,680\nTCCP protocol information and\nthe stack header of this data packet.\n\n2636\n02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:31,120\nSo that's our first gen or\na 1G Firewall packet filters.\n\n2637\n02:03:31,120 --> 02:03:32,970\nAll by today's standards.\n\n2638\n02:03:32,970 --> 02:03:34,400\nRouters, screening boarder routers,\n\n2639\n02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:36,960\ndo this, but\nthis is not the only thing we rely on.\n\n2640\n02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:38,000\nRight.\n\n2641\n02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:41,500\nWe rely on older and\nnewer generation firewall\n\n2642\n02:03:41,500 --> 02:03:44,250\ntechnology kind of mixed together\nin terms of functionality.\n\n2643\n02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:47,290\nBut we don't tend to see enterprise\nnetworks built exclusively and\n\n2644\n02:03:47,290 --> 02:03:49,750\nbuilding their exclusive\ndefensive in depth scenarios.\n\n2645\n02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:51,310\nJust around packet filters today.\n\n2646\n02:03:51,310 --> 02:03:53,720\nWe're gonna add more\ncomplexity to the mix.\n\n2647\n02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:56,990\nSo this is really, really,\nvery basic functionality.\n\n2648\n02:03:56,990 --> 02:04:02,980\nSecond gen or 2G Firewall functionality is\ngoing to be application layer technology,\n\n2649\n02:04:02,980 --> 02:04:05,140\nwe refer to this as\nan application layer firewall.\n\n2650\n02:04:05,140 --> 02:04:08,620\nIt is typically called a proxy and\nwe will have proxy firewalls\n\n2651\n02:04:08,620 --> 02:04:13,270\nthat effectively are gonna be\ndesigned to offer certain services.\n\n2652\n02:04:13,270 --> 02:04:14,730\nSo there are application\nlayer gateways and\n\n2653\n02:04:14,730 --> 02:04:17,150\nwe have different ones that are set up for\ndifferent services.\n\n2654\n02:04:17,150 --> 02:04:20,420\nSo we have a socks proxy,\na wind socks proxy,\n\n2655\n02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:24,360\nmaybe an FTD proxy,\nHTTP proxy for web services.\n\n2656\n02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:25,920\nRight.\nWe have different ones that are designed\n\n2657\n02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:29,620\nspecifically by service\noffering to work with those and\n\n2658\n02:04:29,620 --> 02:04:34,390\nproxy those requests through the firewall\nand examine that traffic and manage it.\n\n2659\n02:04:34,390 --> 02:04:38,140\nSo we may see several of\nthese being deployed.\n\n2660\n02:04:38,140 --> 02:04:42,040\nInside of a typical network based on\nthe necessary requirements of the services\n\n2661\n02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:43,780\nthat we are looking for.\n\n2662\n02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:45,090\nSo these are going to be\n\n2663\n02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:50,440\ntypically referred to not just as\napplication layer proxy firewalls, but\n\n2664\n02:04:50,440 --> 02:04:53,120\napplication layer gateways,\nanother common term we often hear.\n\n2665\n02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,110\nThey work at layer seven of the OSI model.\n\n2666\n02:04:55,110 --> 02:04:58,470\nCuz they're specific to the application\nservices that are being requested.\n\n2667\n02:04:58,470 --> 02:05:00,510\nRight.\nAnd so we wanna just understand that.\n\n2668\n02:05:00,510 --> 02:05:03,450\nAnd again, that kind of functionality\npaired with a first gen\n\n2669\n02:05:03,450 --> 02:05:06,740\npacket filter solution\nwe often see together.\n\n2670\n02:05:06,740 --> 02:05:09,490\nWe often see this, for instance,\nwe can do this in our home devices.\n\n2671\n02:05:09,490 --> 02:05:13,070\nA lot of our home access cable boxes,\nDSL modems, whatever they are.\n\n2672\n02:05:13,070 --> 02:05:16,790\nI have these functionalities built into\nthe firewalls that are going to be\n\n2673\n02:05:16,790 --> 02:05:18,420\ndeployed there by the ISP.\n\n2674\n02:05:18,420 --> 02:05:22,270\nAnd the hardware, they have packet\nfiltering basic access control capability.\n\n2675\n02:05:22,270 --> 02:05:26,660\nThey do have typically a proxy, a second\ngen firewall, a solution built in,\n\n2676\n02:05:26,660 --> 02:05:28,590\nsome sort of application layer proxying.\n\n2677\n02:05:28,590 --> 02:05:31,370\nAnd they may even be looking\nat stateful packet filtering.\n\n2678\n02:05:31,370 --> 02:05:34,210\nHard to say, they're not gonna be\ntypically fourth and fifth gen, and\n\n2679\n02:05:34,210 --> 02:05:39,180\nthe kinda very, very basic low end,\nwe give it to you for free kind of device.\n\n2680\n02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:42,510\nIf you want to buy your own, you may\nobviously get complicated, but the ones\n\n2681\n02:05:42,510 --> 02:05:46,540\nthey send out to you or typically more\noften they're not gonna stop at layer two.\n\n2682\n02:05:46,540 --> 02:05:49,940\nMay verge into layer three depending on\nthe kind of technology you see deployed.\n\n2683\n02:05:49,940 --> 02:05:52,980\nBut typically combine layer one and\nlayer two together or first gen and\n\n2684\n02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:54,450\nsecond gen firewalls.\n\n2685\n02:05:54,450 --> 02:05:55,970\nSo third gen firewall,\n\n2686\n02:05:55,970 --> 02:06:00,000\n3G, state full packet filtering is\nstate full packet filtering firewall.\n\n2687\n02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:03,886\nWorks up and down and looks at all layers\nof the OSI model, looks at the session or\n\n2688\n02:06:03,886 --> 02:06:05,867\nwhat we call the conversation going on.\n\n2689\n02:06:05,867 --> 02:06:09,296\nSo that's gonna be looking at\nthe setup using these protocols and\n\n2690\n02:06:09,296 --> 02:06:10,970\nhow this is all structured?\n\n2691\n02:06:10,970 --> 02:06:15,280\nAnd we're gonna delve in and look at not\njust one packet, not just the header,\n\n2692\n02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:19,300\nnot just the service, but look at\nthe packets associated with that session.\n\n2693\n02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:22,350\nState is maintained, so\nwe look at all the packets coming in and\n\n2694\n02:06:22,350 --> 02:06:25,020\nout based on fragmentation and\noffset around that.\n\n2695\n02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:28,920\nExchange of information and then we\nlook at them in context holistically\n\n2696\n02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:31,330\nas a system, to understand, what they are?\n\n2697\n02:06:31,330 --> 02:06:35,020\nSo we begin to see that we can avoid\nthings like fragmentation attempts.\n\n2698\n02:06:35,020 --> 02:06:36,903\nRight.\nWhere they try to break it up and\n\n2699\n02:06:36,903 --> 02:06:37,746\nthat by- Absolutely.\n\n2700\n02:06:37,746 --> 02:06:38,585\nBreaking it into little smaller pieces.\n\n2701\n02:06:38,585 --> 02:06:42,882\nRight, because you can sneak these attack\npackets in the lower level, the first and\n\n2702\n02:06:42,882 --> 02:06:46,088\nsecond gen firewalls,\ncuz we don't realize that packet 5 and\n\n2703\n02:06:46,088 --> 02:06:48,405\npacket 20 are actually related together.\n\n2704\n02:06:48,405 --> 02:06:49,926\nYeah, it just keeps it\nas one little thing.\n\n2705\n02:06:49,926 --> 02:06:50,844\nCuz we don't keep the stake,\n\n2706\n02:06:50,844 --> 02:06:52,970\nit's each individual packets\nis kind of on its own thing.\n\n2707\n02:06:52,970 --> 02:06:55,750\nSo we look at that and\nwe obviously then have the context.\n\n2708\n02:06:55,750 --> 02:06:57,910\nAnd I often think of them\nas contextual firewalls.\n\n2709\n02:06:57,910 --> 02:07:01,310\nCuz we get the context around\nwhat that conversation is?\n\n2710\n02:07:01,310 --> 02:07:03,370\nSo that's gonna be very important.\n\n2711\n02:07:03,370 --> 02:07:07,390\nSo fourth gen or what we call 4G\nFirewalls, takes that staple packet\n\n2712\n02:07:07,390 --> 02:07:10,050\nfiltering up to the next level\nwith dynamic packet filtering.\n\n2713\n02:07:10,050 --> 02:07:14,070\nWe actually will allow modification\nof firewall configuration and\n\n2714\n02:07:14,070 --> 02:07:16,800\nrules based on traffic flow\nthat we see in real time.\n\n2715\n02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:19,870\nWe refer to these sometimes as\nbeing artificially intelligent or\n\n2716\n02:07:19,870 --> 02:07:23,760\nheuristic based solutions that\nlearn over time by seeing patterns.\n\n2717\n02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:26,080\nAnd then, can kinda grow and as a result,\n\n2718\n02:07:26,080 --> 02:07:28,650\nbecome smarter in traffic management and\nflow.\n\n2719\n02:07:28,650 --> 02:07:30,680\nSo we will see that in\nfourth gen firewalls,\n\n2720\n02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:33,890\nmostly UDP based as you can see,\nthey're not session based.\n\n2721\n02:07:33,890 --> 02:07:36,860\nThey're not looking at the session,\nbut looking at the traffic pattern,\n\n2722\n02:07:36,860 --> 02:07:40,090\nto extract meeting over time,\nso pattern matching.\n\n2723\n02:07:40,090 --> 02:07:43,545\nAnd we may be dropping packets as a result\nof this, because if they're UDP based,\n\n2724\n02:07:43,545 --> 02:07:46,364\nwe may not realize packets are coming\nin that have to be contained.\n\n2725\n02:07:46,364 --> 02:07:49,111\nAnd we may drop some, and\nmay not be able to create that or\n\n2726\n02:07:49,111 --> 02:07:51,286\nsee that linkage the way\nwe do in a stateful.\n\n2727\n02:07:51,286 --> 02:07:55,854\nBut this is another attempt to understand\nthe flow of traffic from a different way,\n\n2728\n02:07:55,854 --> 02:08:00,032\nand put the burden, the onus of modifying\nthe firewall configuration not on\n\n2729\n02:08:00,032 --> 02:08:03,963\nthe administrator, but rather,\npush it back onto the device itself.\n\n2730\n02:08:03,963 --> 02:08:07,001\nBecause the device itself,\nin theory- Can be smarter and\n\n2731\n02:08:07,001 --> 02:08:10,783\nquicker at manipulating this in real\ntime if it begins to have the ability\n\n2732\n02:08:10,783 --> 02:08:14,790\nto see the pattern because its gonna\nbe there right at the point of contact.\n\n2733\n02:08:14,790 --> 02:08:18,390\nSo it can effectively reconfigure itself\nand say you know what, that Mike guy keeps\n\n2734\n02:08:18,390 --> 02:08:22,140\nsending all this traffic in here and\nwe don't want that traffic coming in.\n\n2735\n02:08:22,140 --> 02:08:26,230\nSo we can potentially block Mike,\nblock his ISP, or block his IP address,\n\n2736\n02:08:26,230 --> 02:08:29,580\nrather, and potentially not allow\nhim to send traffic to us anymore.\n\n2737\n02:08:29,580 --> 02:08:33,660\nCuz we hear that he may not be a good\nperson that's acting in good faith.\n\n2738\n02:08:33,660 --> 02:08:35,610\nWe want to keep him out of the network,\nall right?\n\n2739\n02:08:35,610 --> 02:08:36,680\nLock up the daughters!\n\n2740\n02:08:36,680 --> 02:08:37,569\nLock up the children!\n\n2741\n02:08:37,569 --> 02:08:38,501\nRight?\nThat kind of thing.\n\n2742\n02:08:38,501 --> 02:08:39,778\nSo we want to make sure we can do that.\n\n2743\n02:08:39,778 --> 02:08:42,727\nThat's a fourth gen packet\nfiltering firewall.\n\n2744\n02:08:42,727 --> 02:08:46,447\nVery important technology as a leap\nforward if you think about where we were\n\n2745\n02:08:46,447 --> 02:08:50,164\nup until a few years ago, where really,\nthe state of the art was like a layer\n\n2746\n02:08:50,164 --> 02:08:54,475\nthree, or excuse me, a third gen firewall\ntechnology stateful packet filtering have\n\n2747\n02:08:54,475 --> 02:08:56,690\nmade it kind of the standard for\neverybody.\n\n2748\n02:08:56,690 --> 02:08:58,340\nAbout five to ten years ago,\n\n2749\n02:08:58,340 --> 02:09:01,720\nthis was all the rage and we jumped\ninto all this dynamic packet filtering.\n\n2750\n02:09:01,720 --> 02:09:06,610\nNow fifth gen, kernel filtering, or\nnext gen firewalls somewhat more recently,\n\n2751\n02:09:06,610 --> 02:09:09,040\nthis has changed the playing\nfield a little bit and\n\n2752\n02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:12,570\nupped the ante around how we can\ninterdict manage traffic at the border.\n\n2753\n02:09:12,570 --> 02:09:13,770\nRight.\nIt just becomes very important.\n\n2754\n02:09:13,770 --> 02:09:15,200\nAbsolutely.\nEspecially when we think about the cloud.\n\n2755\n02:09:15,200 --> 02:09:18,690\nOf the advent of moving to the cloud and\nputting all of our information out there\n\n2756\n02:09:18,690 --> 02:09:23,010\nin the cloud really changed the dynamic\nof where a firewall is and what it does.\n\n2757\n02:09:23,010 --> 02:09:24,650\nBecause, now we don't have\na well defined border.\n\n2758\n02:09:24,650 --> 02:09:25,290\nRight.\nAnd so it may\n\n2759\n02:09:25,290 --> 02:09:26,610\nbe harder to figure that out, right.\n\n2760\n02:09:26,610 --> 02:09:30,570\nSo, some of this more modern stuff\ncan actually become very valuable.\n\n2761\n02:09:30,570 --> 02:09:33,070\nAlso kernel filtering, what's\nreferred to typically as next gen or\n\n2762\n02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:36,440\nfifth G, fifth generation firewall,\nis a kernel proxy.\n\n2763\n02:09:37,640 --> 02:09:40,810\nSits inside the network stack and\nis actually virtually creating and\n\n2764\n02:09:40,810 --> 02:09:44,630\ntearing down and recreating stacks on\nthe fly, dynamically creates the stack for\n\n2765\n02:09:44,630 --> 02:09:45,910\nanalysis in real time.\n\n2766\n02:09:45,910 --> 02:09:48,800\nWe isolate this inside a virtual sandbox,\nso\n\n2767\n02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:51,440\nwe're doing this in a bubble\ninside of the network stack, so\n\n2768\n02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:54,290\nit's not gonna be able to bleed out and\nget to other traffic, at least thought\n\n2769\n02:09:54,290 --> 02:09:57,730\nprocess anyway is that these packets\ncannot bleed out if they're isolated.\n\n2770\n02:09:57,730 --> 02:09:59,730\nAnd so if we find attack vectors or\n\n2771\n02:09:59,730 --> 02:10:02,690\npackets that look like they don't belong,\nwe can keep them isolated and\n\n2772\n02:10:02,690 --> 02:10:06,390\nkeep them from getting out into\nthe wild here, out into the boundary.\n\n2773\n02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:09,620\nOr out beyond the boundary in the border\nof our network into the interior,\n\n2774\n02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:12,440\nby isolating them until we decide\nthat we're gonna let them go.\n\n2775\n02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:14,560\nSo we are dynamically building up and\nbuilding down, or\n\n2776\n02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:18,080\nin other words building up and\ntearing down the stack, the network stack,\n\n2777\n02:10:18,080 --> 02:10:20,525\nspecific to dealing with each kind\nof packet as it comes through.\n\n2778\n02:10:20,525 --> 02:10:21,160\nUh-huh.\nSo\n\n2779\n02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:25,210\nit's almost literally like\na hand-crafted one-off solution for\n\n2780\n02:10:25,210 --> 02:10:27,060\neach packet type that we see in real time.\n\n2781\n02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:27,860\nOkay.\n\n2782\n02:10:27,860 --> 02:10:28,690\nVery impressive.\n\n2783\n02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:34,121\nIt's basically the microbrewery\nhand crafting concept brought to\n\n2784\n02:10:34,121 --> 02:10:35,670\nnetworking model.\n\n2785\n02:10:35,670 --> 02:10:38,050\nCreating it just for\nyou one beer at a time.\n\n2786\n02:10:38,050 --> 02:10:39,470\nThat's what we're doing here.\n\n2787\n02:10:39,470 --> 02:10:42,369\nIt's a stateful and then, of course,\ndynamic packet filtering, and\n\n2788\n02:10:42,369 --> 02:10:45,435\nthen fifth-gen, or next-gen,\nwhich are kernel-based firewalls.\n\n2789\n02:10:45,435 --> 02:10:47,865\nSo all of these, the five generations,\nit's very important for\n\n2790\n02:10:47,865 --> 02:10:48,765\nyou to be aware of.\n\n2791\n02:10:48,765 --> 02:10:50,645\nWanna make sure we understand each one.\n\n2792\n02:10:50,645 --> 02:10:54,507\nWanna make sure we're comfortable with\nthe general categorical description,\n\n2793\n02:10:54,507 --> 02:10:56,427\nwhat happens at each of these layers.\n\n2794\n02:10:56,427 --> 02:11:00,217\nAs we look at fifth gen, fourth gen, third\ngen, really understanding how to combine\n\n2795\n02:11:00,217 --> 02:11:03,137\nthese firewall types together for\neffect would also be important.\n\n2796\n02:11:03,137 --> 02:11:03,657\nAll right.\nYeah.\n\n2797\n02:11:03,657 --> 02:11:04,957\nSo think about that.\n\n2798\n02:11:04,957 --> 02:11:08,057\nI know below that we also have this idea\n\n2799\n02:11:08,057 --> 02:11:10,827\nof being able to talk about\nthese firewall configurations.\n\n2800\n02:11:10,827 --> 02:11:12,247\nRight.\nSo just this idea of\n\n2801\n02:11:12,247 --> 02:11:13,727\nbeing able to go in and see.\n\n2802\n02:11:13,727 --> 02:11:16,960\nBoundary router, we talked about this,\nand just how we combine them together.\n\n2803\n02:11:16,960 --> 02:11:18,905\nBoundary routers typically\nare packet filtering.\n\n2804\n02:11:18,905 --> 02:11:20,026\nMm-hm.\nBut the operators we set up\n\n2805\n02:11:20,026 --> 02:11:21,060\nthe network layer.\n\n2806\n02:11:21,060 --> 02:11:25,770\nWe have this idea of a dual homed,\na screened host, a screened subnet, and or\n\n2807\n02:11:25,770 --> 02:11:29,530\na proxy firewall which is either\na circuit or an application level, and\n\n2808\n02:11:29,530 --> 02:11:34,350\nI know that we had some diagrams\nwe had put together for\n\n2809\n02:11:34,350 --> 02:11:37,570\nsome of these, and I know you had\nat least one of them open there.\n\n2810\n02:11:37,570 --> 02:11:41,060\nOh, did I?\nBut we did have a couple of these and\n\n2811\n02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:44,560\nwhat we can do is if we can find them,\nbring them up for you really quickly.\n\n2812\n02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:47,350\nWe'll talk about, or just show you,\nwhat these look like.\n\n2813\n02:11:47,350 --> 02:11:51,400\nWe have some of these different diagrams\nthat we had drawn out for you in Visio and\n\n2814\n02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:52,550\njust put together.\n\n2815\n02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:55,490\nSo we wanted to just make sure we gave you\na chance to see what they look like here.\n\n2816\n02:11:55,490 --> 02:11:59,790\nSo we'll give Mike a second to go out and\nto find those different types.\n\n2817\n02:11:59,790 --> 02:12:02,740\nIf you can, if not no big deal,\nwe can bring them up in a little bit.\n\n2818\n02:12:02,740 --> 02:12:04,840\nSo the idea, that just while\nwe're talking through that, or\n\n2819\n02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:08,150\nwhile I'm talking through rather, and just\nwaiting on Mike to be able to find those,\n\n2820\n02:12:08,150 --> 02:12:10,930\nis let's just talk a little bit\nabout the different concepts here.\n\n2821\n02:12:10,930 --> 02:12:13,980\nWhen we have a boundary router,\nthat basically is going to do some packet\n\n2822\n02:12:13,980 --> 02:12:16,880\nfiltering for us, we're talking\nabout just a very simple device.\n\n2823\n02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:20,680\nIt's got two well defined points,\nan end point, or an entry point and\n\n2824\n02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:21,510\nan exit point.\n\n2825\n02:12:21,510 --> 02:12:24,460\nSo it's going to be on the LAN and the\nWAN, and so we're able to very quickly and\n\n2826\n02:12:24,460 --> 02:12:26,680\nvery easily see which\nnetworks they straddle.\n\n2827\n02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:30,210\nWhen we talk about this idea of\nsetting up a DMZ, a screen subnet.\n\n2828\n02:12:30,210 --> 02:12:34,640\nWe talk about this idea of having a\nfirewall that is going to define the outer\n\n2829\n02:12:34,640 --> 02:12:35,810\nperimeter boundary.\n\n2830\n02:12:35,810 --> 02:12:40,190\nWe're then going to be able to see\nthe interior, and go out on a spur.\n\n2831\n02:12:40,190 --> 02:12:43,010\nAnd be able to go over there and\nmaybe come down to another spur.\n\n2832\n02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:44,310\nAnother connection point,\n\n2833\n02:12:44,310 --> 02:12:48,960\nas we saw in that prior diagram, come down\ninto the LAM in some form or another so\n\n2834\n02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:51,630\njust want to make sure we think\nabout that and have a sense of that.\n\n2835\n02:12:53,098 --> 02:12:57,280\nWe also wanna make sure that we understand\nthe concept of being able to create\n\n2836\n02:12:57,280 --> 02:13:00,970\nthis idea of a multihomed or\nwhat's called a Bastion host, where we\n\n2837\n02:13:00,970 --> 02:13:04,031\nmay see just the machine that is going to\nhave multiple number cords entered and\n\n2838\n02:13:04,031 --> 02:13:06,180\njust connecting to different\nalternate VLANs or\n\n2839\n02:13:06,180 --> 02:13:09,780\ndifferent networks that's another way\nof imagining how we could do filtering.\n\n2840\n02:13:09,780 --> 02:13:12,180\nSo just different ideas\ndifferent ways of doing this.\n\n2841\n02:13:12,180 --> 02:13:15,090\nRemember, we may see a DMZ\nthat is simply created off of\n\n2842\n02:13:15,090 --> 02:13:17,500\none firewall with multiple\nconnection points.\n\n2843\n02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:21,350\nWe may see a DMZ that's simply another\nthat is just logically sitting out there.\n\n2844\n02:13:21,350 --> 02:13:24,980\nWe could actually see a DMZ that\nhas two firewalls inside of it,\n\n2845\n02:13:24,980 --> 02:13:28,620\none on the outside the exterior,\none on the inside the interior,\n\n2846\n02:13:28,620 --> 02:13:30,920\nprogrammatically set up differently,\nhopefully.\n\n2847\n02:13:30,920 --> 02:13:34,510\nDifferent ports open, different services\nbeing required, things like that.\n\n2848\n02:13:34,510 --> 02:13:38,010\nAnd as a result of that we then can\nactually physically, as well as logically,\n\n2849\n02:13:38,010 --> 02:13:42,190\nisolate our machines within there to be\nable to understand how to offer services\n\n2850\n02:13:42,190 --> 02:13:45,910\nfrom within the DMZ as a result of\nbeing able to set up that design.\n\n2851\n02:13:45,910 --> 02:13:48,260\nSo these are all kind of\nthe different mechanisms and\n\n2852\n02:13:48,260 --> 02:13:53,202\nways in which we can go ahead and we can\nsee how firewalls can be brought to bear.\n\n2853\n02:13:53,202 --> 02:13:55,987\nAnd there's some shoulds,\nsome best practices,\n\n2854\n02:13:55,987 --> 02:14:00,533\nsome things that may be important for us\nto consider when we think about firewalls.\n\n2855\n02:14:00,533 --> 02:14:04,062\nSo, setting up firewalls architecturally,\nwhere are they going to live?\n\n2856\n02:14:04,062 --> 02:14:08,363\nAre they logically, going to sit in\nfront of or behind a routing device,\n\n2857\n02:14:08,363 --> 02:14:12,467\nare they gonna be our first point of\ncontact or last point of contact?\n\n2858\n02:14:12,467 --> 02:14:15,718\nAre we gonna have dual firewalls or\nare we gonna have a single firewall?\n\n2859\n02:14:15,718 --> 02:14:19,340\nAre we gonna use a hardware based or\na software based firewall?\n\n2860\n02:14:19,340 --> 02:14:21,300\nAs we said earlier,\nthe firewall gonna be virtualized or\n\n2861\n02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:22,880\nis it gonna be physical, right?\n\n2862\n02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:26,240\nNot a big deal if we don't really have\nthe opportunity to find them right now.\n\n2863\n02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:27,150\nYeah, right.\nNo big deal.\n\n2864\n02:14:27,150 --> 02:14:29,060\nSo the idea there basically\nis at the end of the day,\n\n2865\n02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:33,080\nWhat are some of those things that we\nhave to think about architecturally\n\n2866\n02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:36,032\nas we wrestle with the ideas of firewalls\nbeing brought into our networks?\n\n2867\n02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:39,400\nThese are best practice ideas that you\nwant to be thinking about in your mind\n\n2868\n02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:42,500\nas a CISSP, you're gonna be\ncalled on to offer guidance and\n\n2869\n02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:44,190\nsuggestions around architecture.\n\n2870\n02:14:44,190 --> 02:14:47,600\nYou may be called on to validate\na design somebody's put together.\n\n2871\n02:14:47,600 --> 02:14:50,530\nYou may have to manage the creation\nof this architecture or\n\n2872\n02:14:50,530 --> 02:14:53,740\nyou maybe asked to work with a vendor and\nbring them in as an outsourced partner.\n\n2873\n02:14:53,740 --> 02:14:57,040\nAnd they may provide documentation\nto you or all of the above, right?\n\n2874\n02:14:57,040 --> 02:15:00,210\nAnd so as a result, and you may be\nthe consultant that goes out and\n\n2875\n02:15:00,210 --> 02:15:03,480\ndoes that for hire as a CISSP\nto validate your credentials.\n\n2876\n02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:07,160\nSo however we get there, you've got\nto be able to understand logically,\n\n2877\n02:15:07,160 --> 02:15:09,640\nwhat our different approaches\nare with firewalls and\n\n2878\n02:15:09,640 --> 02:15:12,570\nbest practices around this,\nvery important.\n\n2879\n02:15:12,570 --> 02:15:15,400\nSo as we think about firewalls,\nthink about that logic.\n\n2880\n02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:18,390\nOne of the things that is a downside\nto a best practice here is that when\n\n2881\n02:15:18,390 --> 02:15:22,120\nwe have multiple firewalls,\nwe sometimes borrow that configuration,\n\n2882\n02:15:22,120 --> 02:15:23,860\ntalked about in some\nof the other episodes.\n\n2883\n02:15:23,860 --> 02:15:26,790\nAnd we tend to apply that to\nthe same vendor's firewalls.\n\n2884\n02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:28,880\nBut we may not change the user name and\npassword.\n\n2885\n02:15:28,880 --> 02:15:29,980\nThat could be an issue.\n\n2886\n02:15:29,980 --> 02:15:31,950\nJust wanna make sure you're\naware of that as well.\n\n2887\n02:15:31,950 --> 02:15:34,160\nSo just again, think about the concept.\n\n2888\n02:15:34,160 --> 02:15:35,830\nWe also think about the rule sets right?\n\n2889\n02:15:35,830 --> 02:15:40,320\nIf we have a deny all rule that blocks all\ntraffic then we may not let anything in\n\n2890\n02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:41,400\nand that could be a problem.\n\n2891\n02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:44,639\nBecause firewalls are built no matter how\nwe set them up at the end of the day,\n\n2892\n02:15:44,639 --> 02:15:46,619\nthey're very simple\ndevices in one respect.\n\n2893\n02:15:46,619 --> 02:15:50,661\nThey do matching and so they look through\nall these complex rules that we create and\n\n2894\n02:15:50,661 --> 02:15:53,957\nthe first time we get a match,\nwe get a hit, that's where we stop.\n\n2895\n02:15:53,957 --> 02:15:55,447\nThat's where it stops.\n\n2896\n02:15:55,447 --> 02:15:56,911\nSo we go through these rules and\n\n2897\n02:15:56,911 --> 02:16:00,416\nwe tend to have a default rule at the\nbottom of that list that says drop all.\n\n2898\n02:16:00,416 --> 02:16:02,365\nRight.\nBecause at the end of the day if we\n\n2899\n02:16:02,365 --> 02:16:05,470\ncan't make a match,\nthe matches typically allow in, right.\n\n2900\n02:16:05,470 --> 02:16:07,980\nSo the rules above are,\nwhat do we want to allow in?\n\n2901\n02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:11,930\nIf we can't figure out what we want to\nallow in, we want to deny all because we\n\n2902\n02:16:11,930 --> 02:16:16,150\ndon't want unknown traffic coming in if\nwe can't figure out how to manage it.\n\n2903\n02:16:16,150 --> 02:16:18,320\nSo we always have that rule\nin place which is good.\n\n2904\n02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:22,820\nBut if you take that rule out or modify\nit, vendors got smart and a lot vendors\n\n2905\n02:16:22,820 --> 02:16:25,840\nnow say well you can't take out that rule\nbecause that rule needs to be there.\n\n2906\n02:16:25,840 --> 02:16:27,950\nBut you can obviously\nwork around these things.\n\n2907\n02:16:27,950 --> 02:16:30,315\nBut if you take out the rule\nyou're opening the firewall and\n\n2908\n02:16:30,315 --> 02:16:31,363\npassing all the traffic.\n\n2909\n02:16:31,363 --> 02:16:32,059\nThat's a bad thing.\n\n2910\n02:16:32,059 --> 02:16:33,592\nSo think about that.\n\n2911\n02:16:33,592 --> 02:16:37,853\nThink about how you build your rules\nin such a way that you figure out\n\n2912\n02:16:37,853 --> 02:16:42,752\nhow to allow the traffic you want without\ndenying the traffic that you want.\n\n2913\n02:16:42,752 --> 02:16:45,965\nAnd then disallow all the traffic that\nyou don't want and not allow it in,\n\n2914\n02:16:45,965 --> 02:16:48,950\nthis is the secret, ultimately at\nthe end of the day to the architecture.\n\n2915\n02:16:48,950 --> 02:16:51,100\nSo think about that and\njust be aware of that.\n\n2916\n02:16:52,220 --> 02:16:55,619\nAnd make sure that as you think about\nfirewalls, you're thinking about all these\n\n2917\n02:16:55,619 --> 02:16:57,834\nthings as you put them into the blender,\nso to speak,\n\n2918\n02:16:57,834 --> 02:17:01,207\nto come up with the proper mixture of\ningredients to build your secure networks.\n\n2919\n02:17:01,207 --> 02:17:01,834\nAll right, very good.\n\n2920\n02:17:01,834 --> 02:17:04,086\nSo I think we've done\njustice to this area.\n\n2921\n02:17:04,086 --> 02:17:05,479\nCovered this material.\n\n2922\n02:17:05,479 --> 02:17:07,620\nWe got a little more to go, probably.\n\n2923\n02:17:07,620 --> 02:17:08,400\nWe do, we do absolutely.\n\n2924\n02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:10,170\nBut, we'll save that for another episode.\n\n2925\n02:17:10,170 --> 02:17:12,080\nAbsolutely, very good.\n\n2926\n02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:13,340\nOkay.\nAlright, ladies and gentleman.\n\n2927\n02:17:13,340 --> 02:17:15,180\nWell, I hope you guys\nenjoyed the show

discussions.\n\n34\n00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,900\nTalk a little bit about,\ncontinuing to talk about, right,\n\n35\n00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,630\nsome of the material\nwe've been going through.\n\n36\n00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,040\nBut, want to change our flow a little bit\nhere in the sense that some of the things\n\n37\n00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,310\nthat we've been doing up until now,\nin the last two parts of the show and\n\n38\n00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,510\nin the last episodes we've done.\n\n39\n00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,310\nIt's really been all about building\nthe foundational elements.\n\n40\n00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,590\nThe blocks that we use to architect and\n\n41\n00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,260\nto create all the secure\ninfrastructure that we have to manage.\n\n42\n00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,860\nWe're gonna continue that theme, but we're\ngonna broaden it just a little bit here,\n\n43\n00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,370\nat least initially as we start out.\n\n44\n00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:06,615\nAnd talk about going out into\nthe stratosphere as we say.\n\n45\n00:02:06,615 --> 00:02:08,247\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So going out into the clouds and\n\n46\n00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:10,090\ntalk a bit about cloud computing.\n\n47\n00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,820\nReally no good conversation\nabout telecommunications,\n\n48\n00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,570\nabout network,\nspecifically about network security\n\n49\n00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,390\nwould at least today anyway be complete\nwithout a focus on cloud computing.\n\n50\n00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,150\nSo I want to bring together just\na couple minutes worth of discussion and\n\n51\n00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,560\nsome thoughts around the cloud.\n\n52\n00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400\nBring it into this conversation.\n\n53\n00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,000\nI'll put it out there in relation to the\nthree accepted standard models that have\n\n54\n00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,980\nbecome kind of the de facto standards\nof how we interpret cloud computing\n\n55\n00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,160\nin the world today.\n\n56\n00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,300\nI'll lay those out for you and\nthen we'll move along and\n\n57\n00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,940\ntalk about all the other stuff\nthat comes back down to earth and\n\n58\n00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,880\nkind of sits under the cloud In\nrelation to how we manage all that\n\n59\n00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,320\ninfrastructure so, our most common\ncloud service models today.\n\n60\n00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,750\nThe three that we often hear talked about,\n\n61\n00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,200\neverything today could be\nsomething as a service, right?\n\n62\n00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,545\nYou could get DR,\ndisaster recovery as a service.\n\n63\n00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:56,485\nYou can get IT as a service.\n\n64\n00:02:56,485 --> 00:02:57,735\nSo ITAAS in effect.\n\n65\n00:02:57,735 --> 00:03:00,245\nYou can get government as a service.\n\n66\n00:03:00,245 --> 00:03:02,060\nAlthough that's open and conversational.\n\n67\n00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,325\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Definition and\n\n68\n00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:07,230\ntopical discussion in the sense of\nwhat that might or might not be today.\n\n69\n00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,680\nBut certainly the accepted standards,\nthe norms,\n\n70\n00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,480\nthat we tend to frame our conversation\naround are the Sass, the softwares,\n\n71\n00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,920\nthe service pass platform is a service and\nIASS infrastructure is a service.\n\n72\n00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,720\nAnd these three categories of cloud\ncomputing related infrastructure and\n\n73\n00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,240\nservices that we provide in terms of\nrenting of software as well as a platform.\n\n74\n00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,980\nReally help us to understand\nhow consumers and\n\n75\n00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,818\nusers in our networks will consume new\ndefinition of software there, Sfotware.\n\n76\n00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:41,020\n[LAUGH] and so software is gonna be\neffectively rented, you pay as you go.\n\n77\n00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,800\nWhen we do software as a service, where\nit's almost like leasing the software\n\n78\n00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,530\nmonth to month, if you wanna think of it\nthat way, you have a short term contract.\n\n79\n00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,730\nAnd so as long as you maintain and\npay your fee, whatever that usage fee is,\n\n80\n00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,710\nyou effectively have use of a software.\n\n81\n00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:58,900\nThe upside here is that vendors\nare able provide updated patches, and\n\n82\n00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,830\nupdated versions and\nthings of that nature very effectively.\n\n83\n00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,860\nBecause as a result of you leasing\nit from them over the cloud,\n\n84\n00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,490\nthey are able to do patch management and\nmaintenance on that software in real time.\n\n85\n00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,930\nWhereas where it's buried\ninside your networks.\n\n86\n00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,700\nAnd not connected to\nthe vendor in some way.\n\n87\n00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,080\nThen as a result it may or may not be\npatched on a cycle that is going to\n\n88\n00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,390\nkeep it up to date as quickly, and\ntherefore make it as secure, potentially.\n\n89\n00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,470\nSo that's kind of an upside to\nsoftware as a service concept.\n\n90\n00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,500\nOn the platform as a service concept,\n\n91\n00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,250\nthe cloud providers basically are gonna\ngive you the platform itself.\n\n92\n00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,260\nSo they are going to give you things\ntypically like an operating system.\n\n93\n00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,570\nThey're gonna give you the database,\nweb service,\n\n94\n00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,090\nthings of that nature and hardware.\n\n95\n00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,670\nAnd what you're doing is basically\njust putting in the overlay.\n\n96\n00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,090\nWe often see this being used for\napp dev works,\n\n97\n00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,060\na lot of the app dev platforms and app dev\nwork are going to be done in a pass model.\n\n98\n00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,360\n>> Where you're going to do the overlay\nof just your software basically\n\n99\n00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,310\nwhatever it is that you\nwant to run on there,\n\n100\n00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,090\nand then everything else is going\nto be provided by the vendor.\n\n101\n00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,710\nAnd again the upside here would be\nthat since the vendor is taking over\n\n102\n00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,140\nthe responsibility of provisioning,\nremember this is all going to be virtual\n\n103\n00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,170\ninfrastructure right so you're going to be\ngetting virtual machines typically, but\n\n104\n00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:16,480\nsince they're provisioning out that\nvirtual infrastructure for you.\n\n105\n00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,110\nAnd as a result of that are managing\nthe hardware, quote unquote,\n\n106\n00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,310\nthe virtual hardware.\n\n107\n00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,250\nAnd are managing the resources associated\nwith it, doing the online monitoring,\n\n108\n00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,890\nmanagement of that, operating system\npatching, and all of that stuff.\n\n109\n00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:33,370\nYou really only as the end user,\nhave to focus on or\n\n110\n00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,910\nthe customer, have to focus on simply\nthe actual software you lay down on top.\n\n111\n00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,030\nThat's really the only piece you have\nto manage and be responsible for.\n\n112\n00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,800\nAnd then infrastructure is a service.\n\n113\n00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,360\nThe vendor,\nwhoever the vendor is gonna to be,\n\n114\n00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,670\nis going to give you that traditional\ndata center on demand key.\n\n115\n00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,310\nTurn key kind of environment where\nthe hardware, the virtual infrastructure,\n\n116\n00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,520\nis provided so you have a shell in\neffect your actual virtual machine.\n\n117\n00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,890\nAnd they're gonna manage that\nunderlying architecture for you.\n\n118\n00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,270\nSo they're gonna be responsible for\nmaking sure the host is up and\n\n119\n00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,610\nrunning, they'll be responsible for\nmonitoring it, they'll be responsible for\n\n120\n00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,872\nmaking sure you have enough memory,\nenough storage, all that kind of stuff.\n\n121\n00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:13,665\nBut that as Don is pointing out,\nthere is software in the operating system,\n\n122\n00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:19,140\nwill go in and be placed thereby\nthe customer, whoever the customer may be.\n\n123\n00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,130\nSo as a result of that,\nyou're basically getting the architecture\n\n124\n00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,280\nof their infrastructure,\nwhatever the provider is gonna give you.\n\n125\n00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,680\nIf it's a virtual machine\nthat's running VMWare or\n\n126\n00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,540\nif it's running Microsoft's Hyper-V,\nit's running Cisco, whatever it may be.\n\n127\n00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,450\nThat, you're getting, but\neverything else, you manage on top of.\n\n128\n00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,180\nAnd so, you have different graded of\ndifferent ways of basically approaching\n\n129\n00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,150\nthis idea of the cloud-computing platform.\n\n130\n00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,290\nThe goal here would be to really just\nunderstand that whatever we choose to\n\n131\n00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,370\nengage at, whatever level we consume at,\neverything is considered as a service.\n\n132\n00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,418\nWhich means effectively, you're renting,\nyou're paying somebody for\n\n133\n00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:55,840\na transference of funds.\n\n134\n00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,600\nAnd, as a result,\ngetting back some sort of good or service.\n\n135\n00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,539\nYou're paying for\n\n136\n00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:03,430\nsomebody to manage elements of your\nnetwork infrastructure for you.\n\n137\n00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,210\nWell, we often gloss over when we talk\nabout the cloud is this idea that as we\n\n138\n00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:07,750\npush one or\n\n139\n00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:12,420\nmore of these layers out to a provider,\nto some sort of Internet service provider.\n\n140\n00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,930\nIn a multi-tenant model.\n\n141\n00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,570\nA model where we have multiple customers\neffectively doing the same thing we are.\n\n142\n00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,660\nAnd we sit in these little boxes,\nside by side, in effect.\n\n143\n00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,320\nWe have to then really think about,\nwhat is the security overlay?\n\n144\n00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,080\nRight?\nOn a solution like this,\n\n145\n00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,010\nhow are we providing the security?\n\n146\n00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,140\nHow is it going to effectively allow us,\nour end users, the customers,\n\n147\n00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,330\nthat we manage ultimately\nin our businesses.\n\n148\n00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,410\nHow are they going to be considered\nat least as secure if not more secure\n\n149\n00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,570\nthan when we were managing\nall this ourselves?\n\n150\n00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,740\nSo this is the big challenge.\n\n151\n00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,000\nOften the one that is undersold and\nreally kind of softly peddled.\n\n152\n00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,133\nWe don't tend to hear a lot about\nthe downside of cloud computing\n\n153\n00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:52,800\nwhich is somebody else is managing our\nsecurity or elements of it, right?\n\n154\n00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,645\nMaybe depending on what\nkind of model we engage in,\n\n155\n00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:57,971\nwhen we go all the way\nup the stack to SAAS.\n\n156\n00:07:57,971 --> 00:08:01,157\nThe provider is giving us all\nthe infrastructure, and really,\n\n157\n00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:03,756\nwe're relying on them\ntotally to secure the stack.\n\n158\n00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:06,400\nWe don't understand,\nunless we really get in there and\n\n159\n00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,438\nstart talking to the vendor and\nmanaging those conversations,\n\n160\n00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:12,500\nwe don't really understand\nwhat's happening day-to-day.\n\n161\n00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,230\nWe probably have SLAs,\nservice level agreements in place.\n\n162\n00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,430\nAnd we may have the ability to understand\nand have some flexibility, and\n\n163\n00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,780\nsome visibility into that service based\non, typically some sort of dashboard,\n\n164\n00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,330\nadministrative dashboard,\nthat the provider will give us.\n\n165\n00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,390\nThat may tell us this is the version\nof the software you have,\n\n166\n00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,400\nwe're patching this, this kind of stuff.\n\n167\n00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,210\nYou tend to get that kind of\nmaintenance awareness and\n\n168\n00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,540\nthat kind of security\nawareness from the vendor, but\n\n169\n00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,510\nyou don't really get to see\nthe underlying architecture.\n\n170\n00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,210\nYou don't understand what kind\nof servers you're running on,\n\n171\n00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,660\nwhat is the process isolation or\nthe virtual sandbox that's being used.\n\n172\n00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,330\nWhat kind of security\nparameters are put in place\n\n173\n00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,220\nto create secure multi-tenant hosting.\n\n174\n00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,885\nYou don't really have\nany visibility in that.\n\n175\n00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:54,110\n[COUGH] When you go, and\n\n176\n00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,850\nspeak to vendors about this,\nthe vendors are very specific with you.\n\n177\n00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,640\nThey will tell you, listen, for\n30 bucks a month per user, or\n\n178\n00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,100\nwhatever it is you're paying for,\nyou don't have the ability to see that.\n\n179\n00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,810\nWe're not gonna tell you that.\n\n180\n00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,160\nAnd we're not going to expose\nthat information to you.\n\n181\n00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,400\nThey're very up front with you.\n\n182\n00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,090\nHere's your hosting agreement,\nbut unless you're spending eight\n\n183\n00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,060\nfigures with us to host, we're not\nhaving these conversations with you.\n\n184\n00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,350\nWe're just not sitting down and\ntelling you what's going on.\n\n185\n00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,000\nBecause A, we're too busy,\nwe have too many\n\n186\n00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,360\nsmall people that we're aggregating\nup to do that on an individual basis.\n\n187\n00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,140\nAnd B, you're more secure, in effect,\nbecause we don't tell you.\n\n188\n00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,220\nAnd that's kind of the talk\ntrack you hear from vendors is,\n\n189\n00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,400\nif we don't expose it, then you're\njust going to have to trust us.\n\n190\n00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,350\nBut we're good enough, we're big enough,\nwe know what we're doing so,\n\n191\n00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,310\nalmost that whole concept of just\ntrust us and it will be okay.\n\n192\n00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,630\nBut as a result you don't\nhave visibility into that.\n\n193\n00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,773\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n194\n00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:50,940\nAs a CISSP,\none of the key things you have to do for\n\n195\n00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,330\nthe businesses that you're involved with\nis you have to make sure they understand\n\n196\n00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,970\nthe pro and the con, in effect, right?\n\n197\n00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,770\nThe upside and the downside in these\nconversations as you recommend\n\n198\n00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,450\ntechnology and recommend architectures and\nrecommend paths that will lead\n\n199\n00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,500\nthe company down one road versus\nanother in order to create value.\n\n200\n00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,455\nAnd recognize ultimately, at the end\nof the day, how you can safely and\n\n201\n00:10:13,455 --> 00:10:17,265\nsurely provide services, but\ndo so in an ethical, and\n\n202\n00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:21,655\nobviously a focused way that leads\nto security if at all possible.\n\n203\n00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:24,045\nAnd so\nthis is a challenge in today's world.\n\n204\n00:10:24,045 --> 00:10:26,960\nWe see the same challenge coming out and\n\n205\n00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,140\nemerging lateral to this platform\nwith the emergence of big data.\n\n206\n00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,990\nAnd really, how do we deal with\nbig data moving into the cloud and\n\n207\n00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,640\nwhat is that gonna look like.\n\n208\n00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,642\nAnd that's way beyond the scope of the\nconversations we're having here except to\n\n209\n00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:41,820\njust simply throw it out quickly, and\n\n210\n00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,565\njust give you something to think\nabout there as we mention it.\n\n211\n00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:48,800\nBut this whole idea overall of cloud\ncomputing and how we secure it, very\n\n212\n00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,140\nimportant for the security practitioner,\nsecurity professional, to start to\n\n213\n00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,950\nthink about as you engage more and more in\nthese conversations and use these models.\n\n214\n00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,290\nI find it harder and\n\n215\n00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,160\nharder today to find customers that are\nnot somehow being touched by the cloud,\n\n216\n00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,020\nsomehow being touched by this information\nmanagement thought process or scenario.\n\n217\n00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,090\nSo be aware of the fact you're\ngonna see it out there,\n\n218\n00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,800\nif you're not already dealing with it.\n\n219\n00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,150\nYou may be in a smaller business that\nmay or may not be a candidate for\n\n220\n00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,170\nthe cloud today.\n\n221\n00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,960\nYou may be in a very large business\nthat is playing with the cloud.\n\n222\n00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,850\nSmall businesses in this case tend\nto be much more entrepreneurial and\n\n223\n00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,510\nhave moved to the cloud in droves.\n\n224\n00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,050\nWhereas bigger businesses have dragged\ntheir feet a little bit because of the,\n\n225\n00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,150\njust large investments in architecture and\n\n226\n00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,400\ninfrastructure they\nalready own physically.\n\n227\n00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,565\nMaking that move and turning that\nentire ship can be a very lengthy,\n\n228\n00:11:35,565 --> 00:11:38,910\nmulti-year process to kind\nof transition platforms.\n\n229\n00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,210\nSo you may see less adoption\non the large enterprise side,\n\n230\n00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,850\ndepending on where you sit today.\n\n231\n00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,230\nBut it is definitely out there.\n\n232\n00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,200\nIt would be impossible to say it's\nnot gonna touch all of us at some\n\n233\n00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,430\npoint, I think.\n\n234\n00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,110\nWe used to joke about the fact that the\ncloud was, kinda this just marketing hype,\n\n235\n00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,838\nand you hear me joke about it every so\noften when I speak.\n\n236\n00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:58,660\nIt wasn't gonna be a big thing and\nit wasn't here to stay.\n\n237\n00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,800\nWell, it's proved that it's gonna\nbe a big thing, I think right,\n\n238\n00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,500\nand it's definitely going\nto be here to stay.\n\n239\n00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,390\nI think the next big question is what's\ncloud 2.0 gonna look like, right?\n\n240\n00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:10,880\nWhat is that next generation of\nsomething as a service morphing into?\n\n241\n00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,740\nYou've heard me talk in\na couple of our episodes\n\n242\n00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,700\nabout this idea of things like\nmobile device management and\n\n243\n00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,170\nBYOD were all the rage within the last\nfew years, bring your own device.\n\n244\n00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,470\nToday it's really, I frame that\nconversation more as bring your own cloud.\n\n245\n00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:27,800\nAnd so bringing the cloud to your\nbusiness, we've kind of figured that out.\n\n246\n00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,380\nI think cloud 2.0,\nwhich we've already seen but\n\n247\n00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,280\nnow we're seeing the morphing of the\nconsumer cloud with the business cloud.\n\n248\n00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,945\nAnd the fact that those lines are\nblurring, and we're bringing that consumer\n\n249\n00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:44,380\nhome-driven private storage onto our\ndevices, into our enterprises today,\n\n250\n00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,210\nis really the focal point for\nthe CISSP as you look at cloud computing.\n\n251\n00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,230\nBecause that's cloud at\nthe generational nexus,\n\n252\n00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,480\nright at the crossover between private and\npublic consumption.\n\n253\n00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,700\nAnd as a result, we now have to think\nabout what that means from a privacy,\n\n254\n00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,680\nfrom a management, and\nfrom a content-awareness perspective.\n\n255\n00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,680\nThese are all gonna be very important\nthemes as we talk about the cloud.\n\n256\n00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,064\nAll right, I'm off my soap box now.\n\n257\n00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:07,224\nLet's get back to what we're doing.\n\n258\n00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:11,080\nThis is not the CISSP cloud seminar\nthat we're going through here.\n\n259\n00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,105\nBut I did want to throw those ideas out\nto you, make sure you're aware of them.\n\n260\n00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:17,645\nIn a 30 or 40 minute conversation,\nto spend 2, or 3, or\n\n261\n00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:20,380\n4 minutes on a topic is very,\nvery important.\n\n262\n00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,360\nA lot of time spent on this,\nbut it is important for\n\n263\n00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,760\nyou to be aware of the things that\ngo on out there with the cloud.\n\n264\n00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,400\nSo just be aware, thinking about that and\nhow that impacts you.\n\n265\n00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,650\nAll right we have some vocabulary there\nthat we just wanted to throw out and\n\n266\n00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,730\ndefine for you.\n\n267\n00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,290\nSome of these terms are pretty\nstandard in the sense we use them and\n\n268\n00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,020\nhave used them for a long time.\n\n269\n00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,290\nIntranet and Extranet, an intranet\nis traditionally seen as a private,\n\n270\n00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,680\ninternal network.\n\n271\n00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,200\nWould have been an example of an internal\nnetwork that would have been limited,\n\n272\n00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,370\nmaybe through something like a VPN access\nin from the outside that we could see.\n\n273\n00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,170\nMight have been a VLAN that we would\n\n274\n00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,820\nuse to isolate something\ninternally inside the network.\n\n275\n00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,710\nAnd so, things like that would have\nbeen intranets that we could think of,\n\n276\n00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,630\nor examples that we could think of.\n\n277\n00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,747\nAn extranet would be, same thing,\na conceptually private network but\n\n278\n00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:11,953\navailable from the outside, right?\n\n279\n00:14:13,474 --> 00:14:16,748\nSo we extend that private network,\nif you will, to the outside world.\n\n280\n00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:20,660\nSo maybe there was a web portal of some\nkind that we could access through.\n\n281\n00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,725\nSharePoint would be a good example\nof maybe potentially providing\n\n282\n00:14:23,725 --> 00:14:28,930\nextranet-like connectivity or\ncapabilities for management.\n\n283\n00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,440\nBut we would do so through a secure\nweb portal, so maybe through SSL,\n\n284\n00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,990\nHTTPS being used to secure the log on,\nthings of that nature.\n\n285\n00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,850\nAnd there's other conceptual ideas,\n\n286\n00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,260\njust giving you a general idea\nof what that might look like.\n\n287\n00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,850\nWe have EDI, Electronic Data Exchange.\n\n288\n00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,621\nThe concept of EDI is\nbasically this structured,\n\n289\n00:14:46,621 --> 00:14:51,392\norganizational entity that we\nuse to do document management.\n\n290\n00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:54,727\nSo certainly SharePoint can fall into\nthis category just in the sense of being\n\n291\n00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,173\na content management solution.\n\n292\n00:14:56,173 --> 00:15:00,630\nBut invoicing, purchasing, it's broader\ntypically than just document management.\n\n293\n00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,620\nIt's kind of an e-commerce like\nsolution where we can do basically\n\n294\n00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,540\nthe entire life cycle of\nbeing able to represent and\n\n295\n00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,000\noffer products, as well as information\naround them, through this secure channel.\n\n296\n00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,980\nSo an EDI solution is really going\nto be web based and is really gonna\n\n297\n00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,930\nallow commerce to take place, and\nthe documentation of that to go with it.\n\n298\n00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,790\nAll right so then we have a MAN\na Metropolitan Area Network.\n\n299\n00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,900\nMetropolitan Area Network, like a LAN,\na WAN, local area, wide area,\n\n300\n00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,690\nMAN is simply gonna be a network that\nis taken out to the entire city.\n\n301\n00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,310\nWe're seeing this become, something that\nwe've been talking about for some time,\n\n302\n00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,180\nbut this is now something that's becoming\nfairly standard in the sense that most\n\n303\n00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,650\ncities are setting up and maintaining\nnetwork access within their boundaries.\n\n304\n00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,440\nA lot of it is wireless these days,\nso we bring in that whole concept.\n\n305\n00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,777\nAnd they're providing basic services\nto the people that live there.\n\n306\n00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:55,021\nThings like getting online to be\nable to pay your bills, perhaps\n\n307\n00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:59,181\nfinding out about services that the area\nor the city, whatever it is is offering.\n\n308\n00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:01,317\nYou can access basic information.\n\n309\n00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:05,391\nYou typically can, not only do those\nthings, but you can make requests for\n\n310\n00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:07,794\ncertain services, things of that nature.\n\n311\n00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:11,807\nThey also offer free wireless in some\ncities depending on where you are and\n\n312\n00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:13,210\nwhat you're doing.\n\n313\n00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,900\nMaybe in the downtown core, maybe not\neverywhere in the residential areas but\n\n314\n00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,352\nin the downtown core\ntypically they're wiring up.\n\n315\n00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:23,190\nSo Google's kind of leading the charge\non some of this out west with some of\n\n316\n00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,930\nthe areas where they're wiring up and\nsetting up these MAN networks and\n\n317\n00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,290\nthen effectively charging back,\nin some cases, for the use.\n\n318\n00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,440\nSo that's the kind of thing we see there.\n\n319\n00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,080\nSONET.\n\n320\n00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,920\nWhen we talk about SONET this\nis basically a standard for\n\n321\n00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,310\ntransmission over fiber optic cable for\ndata transmission over fiber optic.\n\n322\n00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,060\nThat's what SONET is going to be.\n\n323\n00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,090\nTelecommunications as well as data.\n\n324\n00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:48,330\nSo we see voice and\ndata going over the fiber wire.\n\n325\n00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,670\nSo we just want to be aware of that and\n\n326\n00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,840\nunderstand that that's gonna\nprovide high speed linkage for\n\n327\n00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,760\nus between our offices or maybe over\nlarge geographies, wherever that may be.\n\n328\n00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,780\nWe didn't put up Metro-e, but\nMetro-e would be another example.\n\n329\n00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,720\nMetro ethernet would\nbe something up there.\n\n330\n00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,510\nThow up, along with SONET, kind of in\nthe same box or bucket, if you will.\n\n331\n00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,600\nSo Metro-E is all the rage,\neverybody talks about Metro-E, or has for\n\n332\n00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,390\nawhile now.\n\n333\n00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,570\nJust another example of connectivity that\nwe use in these metropolitan areas to\n\n334\n00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,560\ncreate MAN-level architectures.\n\n335\n00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,330\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> That's what we're on right now.\n\n336\n00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,505\n>> It's what we're on right now.\n\n337\n00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,350\nOkay, so we're on a Metro-E right now.\n\n338\n00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,210\nAlright.\nVery good.\n\n339\n00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,760\nSo, virtual private LAN services,\none you may not have heard of very often.\n\n340\n00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,690\nWe don't tend to speak about this one, but\n\n341\n00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,950\nVPLS, virtual private LAN service,\nit's another one.\n\n342\n00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,980\nIt's basically a layer-2 virtual\nprivate network that is created, or\n\n343\n00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,685\na multi-point layer-2 virtual\nprivate network, I should say,\n\n344\n00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:42,197\nthat connects to more customers,\nto more endpoints together.\n\n345\n00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:50,970\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n346\n00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,100\nAnd the we have the traditional WAN,\nthe Wide Area Network, right?\n\n347\n00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,390\nSo this is going to be our traditional\n[COUGH] area where we go out.\n\n348\n00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,130\nThe Internet's probably the largest\nexample of a wide area network today,\n\n349\n00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,600\ncurrently in the world.\n\n350\n00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600\nOr the World Wide Web,\nwhatever you prefer.\n\n351\n00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,440\nCuz they are different but you can\ncall either one an example of a WAN.\n\n352\n00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,650\nSo the idea there is just to be able to\nout and be able to access information that\n\n353\n00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,480\nis broadly available and brought in across\nmultiple geographies, multiple places.\n\n354\n00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,365\nWe have routers that\ncreate the on-ramps and\n\n355\n00:18:21,365 --> 00:18:23,550\nthe off-ramps to the wide area network.\n\n356\n00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,870\nAnd we've talked a lot about firewalls and\nproxies and\n\n357\n00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,130\nall the other stuff that go\ninto the back end of that.\n\n358\n00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,730\nSo just be aware of\nthe general idea there.\n\n359\n00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,240\nATM is Synchronous Transfer Mode.\n\n360\n00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,040\nThis is going to be just another type\nof architecture that we look at.\n\n361\n00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,100\nSo that's ATM, another, right?\n\n362\n00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,370\nATM, just another type.\n\n363\n00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,860\nThe key here is that we\nused a fixed cell size.\n\n364\n00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:51,280\nTo be able to transfer data to 53 bit\ncell or 53 bit cell size, I should say.\n\n365\n00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,620\nSo this is going to encapsulate data that\nis what ATM does and fix cell sizes and\n\n366\n00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,050\nthen we deliver it over a SONET network so\nATM delivers that over a SONET network.\n\n367\n00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,170\n>> Is that 53 bits or bytes?\n\n368\n00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:03,679\n>> Bytes.\n\n369\n00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,188\n>> Bytes.\n\n370\n00:19:04,188 --> 00:19:05,460\n>> Yes.\nDid I say bits?\n\n371\n00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,680\nI apologize, 54 bytes.\n\n372\n00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,844\nYes.\n>> I just didn't hear.\n\n373\n00:19:07,844 --> 00:19:11,087\nMy eighth grade typing skills\nare hindering my [CROSSTALK].\n\n374\n00:19:11,087 --> 00:19:12,620\n[LAUGH]\n>> I apologize.\n\n375\n00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:18,462\nI apologize to all of you on behalf of Mr.\nPezet for his inability to keep up.\n\n376\n00:19:18,462 --> 00:19:19,350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right.\n\n377\n00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,320\nSo, yes, it was bytes.\n\n378\n00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,941\nI'm sorry.\nAnd\n\n379\n00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:23,620\nit was transferred to our ATM's\ntransferring over SONET-based or\n\n380\n00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,330\nSONET networks.\n\n381\n00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,620\nSo the underlying carrier\nnetwork is typically going\n\n382\n00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,030\nto be a SONET network there.\n\n383\n00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,560\n>> Transferred.\n\n384\n00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,140\n>> Transferred.\n\n385\n00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,450\nWe're transferring over a SONET network.\n\n386\n00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,640\nVery good.\n\n387\n00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,470\nAnd then we have an optical carrier.\n\n388\n00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,270\nI think that's what we're up to, right?\n\n389\n00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,350\n>> Yeah.\n>> OC, so optical carrier network.\n\n390\n00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,430\nOptical Carrier network,\nas you can see there,\n\n391\n00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:51,103\nwill be able to typically each carrier\nnetwork, you say OC-1, OC-2 and OC-3.\n\n392\n00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,400\nWe're bundling multiple networks together.\n\n393\n00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,930\nEach one is rated at\napproximately 52 megabytes.\n\n394\n00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,850\nIt's a little bit less, but\nwe just kind of round up.\n\n395\n00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,370\nIt's very simple that way.\n\n396\n00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,080\nSo the OC number, as Don's writing there,\n\n397\n00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,230\nindicates the number of\nnetworks you're bundling.\n\n398\n00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,890\nSo in effect, if you have an OC-5.\n\n399\n00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,620\nYou would multiply roughly 52 times 5.\n\n400\n00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,870\nYou do so roughly.\n\n401\n00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,460\nShake it, right?\n\n402\n00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,150\nAnd you would get that in that\ncase 260 approximately, megabytes.\n\n403\n00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:21,040\nSo we just did OC-10 there, and\nOC-10 is approximately 520 megabytes.\n\n404\n00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,160\nSo you can just go through and\nquickly do the math, but\n\n405\n00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,070\nthat's the general idea behind that,\nright?\n\n406\n00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,040\nSo just so you're aware of that.\n\n407\n00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,610\nAll right.\nSo.\n\n408\n00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,950\n>> These we see with like,\nISPs a lot, right?\n\n409\n00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,140\nPeople that need the high\nlevels of bandwidth.\n\n410\n00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,770\nWe don't see these in-\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n411\n00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,940\nTypically you're not going to\nconsume one of these at home.\n\n412\n00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,450\nRight?\n\n413\n00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,460\nYou could, but\nyou'd have to get out your checkbook.\n\n414\n00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,560\nThere's significant investment\nin infrastructure you'd have to\n\n415\n00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,880\nput in there to be able to\nbring an OC carrier in.\n\n416\n00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,560\nBut yeah,\nthese are done typically with ISPs.\n\n417\n00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,370\nThese make up the core underlying\narchitecture of the information\n\n418\n00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,230\ntransmission that takes place on\nthe Internet and for the World Wide Web.\n\n419\n00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,820\nThe undersea fiber cables that\nwe talk about, for instance,\n\n420\n00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,290\nthat carry the internet globally.\n\n421\n00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,090\nThose are OC carriers.\n\n422\n00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,035\nRight?\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n423\n00:21:05,035 --> 00:21:08,330\nWe're taking OC-50s and\nOC-100s, that kind of thing,\n\n424\n00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,590\nand just bundling all that stuff up and\nshooting it across the planet.\n\n425\n00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,580\nThat's where we get into these\ngigabit plus networks and\n\n426\n00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,660\nvery, very fast networks.\n\n427\n00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,777\nIt would be cool but you'd have to be Dr.\n\n428\n00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:24,314\nDoom in the arctic ice, evil ice cave\nto be able to bring one of those in.\n\n429\n00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:27,580\n>> Because the satellite internet's\njust not going to cut it.\n\n430\n00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,300\nNo, no.\n\n431\n00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,835\n>> Doctor Doom's like,\ndamn you bandwidth cap!\n\n432\n00:21:30,835 --> 00:21:33,040\n[LAUGH]\n>> But I want to download!\n\n433\n00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,021\nI can't download.\n>> Can't run my BitTorrents.\n\n434\n00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:35,010\n[LAUGH]\n>> Says I have to wait.\n\n435\n00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,810\nWhat's going on with that?\n\n436\n00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,780\nAll right.\nSo we have that kind of solution.\n\n437\n00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,630\nSo you just want to be able to generally\nunderstand the concept of what\n\n438\n00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,930\nthe bandwidth is and\nhow we'd rate it as a result.\n\n439\n00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,210\nGetting an overall amount\nof bandwidth there.\n\n440\n00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,160\nDedicated links, right?\n\n441\n00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,508\nSo we have some dedicated links.\n\n442\n00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,550\nThings like point-to-point solutions\nwhere we have two dedicated or\n\n443\n00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,760\ndefined endpoints and\nwe connect the two together.\n\n444\n00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,170\nClosed circuit in effect, right?\n\n445\n00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:58,340\nDon and I,\nif we were connecting on a point-to-point,\n\n446\n00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,700\nanybody else who's trying to get into that\nconversation would not be able to see that\n\n447\n00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,400\ninformation unless they did something,\nsomehow inserted themselves, right?\n\n448\n00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,160\nSo it'd certainly be a closed\nsystem in that respect.\n\n449\n00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,050\nT-carriers.\n\n450\n00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,090\nWe have a T1 there.\n\n451\n00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:15,030\nT3, there is a T2, there is a T4, we don't\ntend to talk a whole lot about them.\n\n452\n00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,920\nThe idea is just generically that we\nare taking these channels that we're\n\n453\n00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,570\nbundling together,\ncreating a certain amount of bandwidth.\n\n454\n00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,749\nA T1 will run with 24 channels,\nas you can see there, approximately 1.5,\n\n455\n00:22:25,749 --> 00:22:30,498\nit's 1.544, but we just generically refer\nto it as 1.5 Mbps of bandwidth on a T1.\n\n456\n00:22:30,498 --> 00:22:34,580\nWhen we get to a T3, notice it's\nnot as simple as just saying, oh,\n\n457\n00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:39,453\nwe'll just multiply it by three the way we\ndo those OC, because that gets you like\n\n458\n00:22:39,453 --> 00:22:44,640\n4.5 Mbps of bandwidth or whatever it\nwould be, so it's not quite the same.\n\n459\n00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,520\nThere is a bit of a different\napproach there, but a T3 is\n\n460\n00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,140\nconsidered to be approximately 45 Mbps of\nbandwidth and is made up of 672 channels.\n\n461\n00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:58,089\nWe are bundling those channels together,\nmultiplying them by a force-multiplier,\n\n462\n00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:02,569\na fact multiplier, inside the bundlings,\nwe've set them up and\n\n463\n00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:05,515\neffectively giving you 672 channels.\n\n464\n00:23:05,515 --> 00:23:09,920\nThat will give you the go to stream\ndata across almost all of them.\n\n465\n00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,220\nThere's a few that are kept out for\nsetup, and in this case as we bundle and\n\n466\n00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,310\ncreate the T3, we have to take a certain\nnumber of channels out to just\n\n467\n00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,045\nbasically manage the architecture of that\noverall exchange or management process.\n\n468\n00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:21,850\nJust be aware of that.\n\n469\n00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,325\nThe T-carrier concept is\ngoing to be a US-centric,\n\n470\n00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:28,890\nmeaning United States-centric,\nthought process.\n\n471\n00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,205\nWe see T-carriers, here in the US.\n\n472\n00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:36,140\nOverseas in Europe, we have\nthe equivalent, known as an E-carrier.\n\n473\n00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,030\nThe European equivalent of a T,\nwould be an E1 and an E3.\n\n474\n00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,700\nAgain, there are sub-categories,\nE2, E4, etc.\n\n475\n00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,790\nE1 is traditionally seen as being\njust over two Mbps in bandwidth, and\n\n476\n00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:48,290\n32 channels.\n\n477\n00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,795\nNotice there is a difference\nin bump of eight channels and\n\n478\n00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:53,836\na bump of approximately about a half\nMbps of bandwidth on the low end.\n\n479\n00:23:53,836 --> 00:23:57,370\nAnd then again E3, not as simple\nas just multiplying by three,\n\n480\n00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:01,950\na little bit different there, but you get\nroughly about 34 Mbps of bandwidth, so\n\n481\n00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,615\nit is Going to be a little bit lower\nthere and then 512 channels so\n\n482\n00:24:05,615 --> 00:24:08,905\nit's also going to be a little\nbit less and smaller in size.\n\n483\n00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:13,445\nSo just be aware of that, and\nthen we have a multiplexing types,\n\n484\n00:24:13,445 --> 00:24:18,850\njust looking at our notes as we scroll\ndown, so our multiplexing types.\n\n485\n00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,420\nWe have three different kinds of\nmultiplexing, we have statistical time\n\n486\n00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:27,340\ndivision, we have frequency division,\nand wave division.\n\n487\n00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,650\nSo let's just talk about these and\n\n488\n00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:30,598\nmake sure we're comfortable\nwith the ideas here.\n\n489\n00:24:30,598 --> 00:24:35,927\nThe concept of multiplexing is basically\nbundling together all of this information,\n\n490\n00:24:35,927 --> 00:24:40,161\nso this idea with this is that we can\nbasically take those channels and\n\n491\n00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:41,557\nchop them up, right?\n\n492\n00:24:41,557 --> 00:24:45,952\n24 channels like we had with a T1,\nfor instance, can be chopped up and\n\n493\n00:24:45,952 --> 00:24:50,562\nplaced in 24 calls that are running on\nthis channel, in effect is what I was\n\n494\n00:24:50,562 --> 00:24:54,835\ntrying to say, can be bundled and\nplaced inside of that carrier line.\n\n495\n00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:59,435\nSo multiplexing is this idea of being\nable to do this and how we achieve this\n\n496\n00:24:59,435 --> 00:25:02,365\nis the mechanism that we're talking\nabout when we're talking about methods.\n\n497\n00:25:02,365 --> 00:25:06,745\nSo STDM, Statistical Time Division,\nthe acronym there STDM,\n\n498\n00:25:06,745 --> 00:25:11,690\nthis is going to transmit several types\nof data simultaneously over that T1 or\n\n499\n00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:16,590\nT3, so we're gonna have different kinds or\ntypes of data going together all at once.\n\n500\n00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:22,130\nWe analyze all the related solutions\nthere and check the inputs and\n\n501\n00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:25,410\nkind of put all that data out on\nthe wire and manage it as it goes down.\n\n502\n00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,380\nSo, it's statistical,\nimplying we're doing math and\n\n503\n00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,670\nlooking at the information that's coming\nback, and average loads and things of that\n\n504\n00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:36,090\nnature are looked at as we kind of manage\nthrough how all that data is transiting\n\n505\n00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:40,526\nacross the, in this case, the T carriers,\nif that's what we are talking about.\n\n506\n00:25:40,526 --> 00:25:44,150\n[COUGH] Frequency division.\n\n507\n00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,310\nOkay.\nFrequency division,\n\n508\n00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,330\nor what's called FDM,\nfrequency division multiplexing.\n\n509\n00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,800\nThis is gonna be where we\nare going to use wireless,\n\n510\n00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,848\nwe're actually using wireless\nspectrum to move the data.\n\n511\n00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,079\nAnd we divide that frequency into narrow,\nor the band rather, is divided into\n\n512\n00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:07,887\nnarrow frequency elements, so if we add\na one gigahertz channel, we effectively\n\n513\n00:26:07,887 --> 00:26:12,370\nslice that down into subchannels,\nmaybe, of let's do something simple.\n\n514\n00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:17,001\nSo if it's one gig we may slice it\ntheoretically into 33 megahertz\n\n515\n00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:19,926\nchannels and\nthen we would bundle those and\n\n516\n00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:25,140\nkind of send each single down one of\nthose, and so you would get what, 33.\n\n517\n00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,765\nUp to a gig you would get 330.\n\n518\n00:26:30,765 --> 00:26:31,890\nLight on my math this morning.\n\n519\n00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,986\nSomething like 30 channels of 33 megahertz\nup to a Gigahertz or 300 channels or\n\n520\n00:26:34,986 --> 00:26:37,050\nsomething like that\n>> It's too early for\n\n521\n00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,398\nmath involving threes.\n\n522\n00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:39,293\n[LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n523\n00:26:39,293 --> 00:26:42,447\nwe would have three gigahertz divided\ninto one megahertz channels each and\n\n524\n00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,210\nyou would have those, whatever that is.\n\n525\n00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,265\nYou get the general idea, right?\n\n526\n00:26:45,265 --> 00:26:49,517\nWe would effectively divide that down into\nsmaller units of what we're trying to\n\n527\n00:26:49,517 --> 00:26:53,829\nillustrate for you, and as our result we\nwould have these little slices that can be\n\n528\n00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:55,723\nused to send individually as we go.\n\n529\n00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:59,140\nSo the idea there,\nthen we just have multiple channels or\n\n530\n00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,054\nmultiple spurts of bandwidth kind of\nshooting down that wire simultaneously, so\n\n531\n00:27:04,054 --> 00:27:09,520\nit would look like it is just divided out\nand that's what the multiplexing will do.\n\n532\n00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,110\nAnd then wave division is used in\nfiber-optic communications, so\n\n533\n00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,830\nthis is where we're going to\nbe using light as opposed to\n\n534\n00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,810\nthe other solutions we've been\ntalking about, and we multiplex\n\n535\n00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:22,760\nthe optical carriers to then be able to\neffectively send the signal down the wire.\n\n536\n00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,536\nSo we bring them together into a single\nwire and send that carrier signal, or\n\n537\n00:27:26,536 --> 00:27:29,848\nthose carriers signals down the wire\nthat way with wave division.\n\n538\n00:27:37,306 --> 00:27:38,270\n>> All right.\n\n539\n00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,410\n>> All right, very good.\n\n540\n00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,860\nSo we have the different kinds of\nmultiplexing that we will see,\n\n541\n00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,380\ndepending again on the kind\nof channel mechanism we need.\n\n542\n00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,765\nWhen we're using fiber obviously,\nwave division becomes important.\n\n543\n00:27:50,765 --> 00:27:56,625\nFrequency division for wireless and wire\ntraditional kinda standard data solutions\n\n544\n00:27:56,625 --> 00:28:01,681\non copper will be statistical time, so\nthis is gonna be what we often see.\n\n545\n00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,400\nStandard Cooper,\na Mini Cooper, only standard.\n\n546\n00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,070\n>> See, I'm that much ready to\njust be done with copper and\n\n547\n00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,215\nmove on to other things, see?\n\n548\n00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:16,720\n>> [LAUGH] All right, so\nwe have all that, so then we have a,\n\n549\n00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,680\nlook at some of the WAN level technologies\nthat kind of take us to the next place.\n\n550\n00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,060\nSo again reminding you this is\njust basically a long laundry list\n\n551\n00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,710\nof terms we're throwing at you.\n\n552\n00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,420\nVocabulary items and quick definitions,\n\n553\n00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,980\nhigh level discussions around technologies\nthat you just have to be aware of.\n\n554\n00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,480\nAs you may be preparing\nto answer some questions\n\n555\n00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,240\nyou may want to have awareness\nof these kinds of things.\n\n556\n00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,520\nWe understand you're probably not going\nto a lot of work with most of this stuff.\n\n557\n00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,660\nMost of us never see multiplexers,\n\n558\n00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,940\nmost of us don't set them up\nunless you work for an ISP.\n\n559\n00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,360\nYou probably will never trip across one\nunless you happen to see one in your\n\n560\n00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,020\nwiring closet, depending on the kind\nof bandwidth you're bringing in and\n\n561\n00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,890\nwhere it is coming from and what it does.\n\n562\n00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,540\nYou may never see one.\n\n563\n00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,880\nSo this is the kind of thing you just want\nto be aware of, but having said that,\n\n564\n00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,175\nit's still important to have awareness.\n\n565\n00:29:00,175 --> 00:29:04,200\n>> And if this is the first time you've\nheard any of these terms, right?\n\n566\n00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,930\nWe kind of make the assumption that\nthis is really a review for you,\n\n567\n00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:09,890\nthat you should have been working in\nthe field for a certain period of time.\n\n568\n00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,390\nBut maybe your expertise is in\nsome of these other domains and\n\n569\n00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,770\nnot the networking domain.\n\n570\n00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:17,530\nSo if this is the first time you've heard\nof it remember you can jump on over\n\n571\n00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:20,700\nto our network plus show,\nthe compTIA network\n\n572\n00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,350\nplus certification covers all of\nthis stuff in great detail, right.\n\n573\n00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,210\nHere is just one of ten domains.\n\n574\n00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:29,140\nBut, in the network plus show,\nit's the whole thing.\n\n575\n00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,660\nSo, we go in depth on a lot of this stuff,\nreally break it down, show some examples.\n\n576\n00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,690\nSo, if you're just bewildered.\n\n577\n00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:39,850\nIf Adam has overfilled your cup with\nnetworking information this morning,\n\n578\n00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,170\ndon't panic, right?\n\n579\n00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,400\nJump over to that network plus show and\ncheck it there.\n\n580\n00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,760\nIt's part of your subscription,\nit doesn't cost you extra, it is there and\n\n581\n00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,810\navailable for you.\n\n582\n00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:51,340\nBut if you have already seen\nthis stuff here's the review,\n\n583\n00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,069\nhere is what you can\nexpect to see on the exam.\n\n584\n00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,532\n>> So it's not only blue shoot,\nblue shoot.\n\n585\n00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:58,610\nIt is not only blue shirt day,\nI just blew it, right?\n\n586\n00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,440\nIt's not only blue shirt day, but\nit's also buffer overflow day, right?\n\n587\n00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,060\nSo talk about that.\n\n588\n00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,990\n>> That's right,\nit's a buffer overflow attack [LAUGH].\n\n589\n00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,520\n>> So we're executing an attack\nin real time for you.\n\n590\n00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,440\nAnd helping you to understand\nhow that would happen.\n\n591\n00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,290\nSo Don raises a really good point,\nand one that I often try to make sure\n\n592\n00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,470\nmy students are aware of as we talk\nabout this kind of technology.\n\n593\n00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,690\nIt's one of the biggest\nareas of the ten domains,\n\n594\n00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,330\nprobably the biggest area in terms of\nknowledge coverage and management.\n\n595\n00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,650\nWhen we go through this\nin a class environment,\n\n596\n00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,440\nit typically is an entire day of lecture.\n\n597\n00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,400\nSo, imagine spending the better part\nof eight hours going through this\n\n598\n00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,310\nmaterial and then maybe some crypto\non top of it, just for good measure.\n\n599\n00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:36,915\nAnd so this can definitely\nbe a little overwhelming,\n\n600\n00:30:36,915 --> 00:30:39,895\nthere's just hundreds of terms that\nare being thrown at you, you may or\n\n601\n00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:42,115\nmay not be comfortable with all of them.\n\n602\n00:30:42,115 --> 00:30:45,245\nThe conceptual idea of making sure\nthat you understand the right level of\n\n603\n00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:48,830\nknowledge to approach this material from\nis what we're trying to put across to you.\n\n604\n00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:54,160\nYou don't need to become that expert\nin wireless LAN technologies or\n\n605\n00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,440\nthat expert in multiplexing and\northogonal division,\n\n606\n00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,970\nmultiplexing frequency management, you\njust have to have a working knowledge of\n\n607\n00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:06,850\nthe vocabulary in order to make sure that\nyou can master these knowledge items, and\n\n608\n00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,040\nthen if asked answer questions\nintelligently, thoughtfully,\n\n609\n00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,575\nand, most importantly,\ncorrectly about them as we go.\n\n610\n00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:16,150\nAn so, leaving you with that thought,\nand really just making you feel\n\n611\n00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,180\nhopefully a little bit better about all\nof the stuff that we're throwing at you,\n\n612\n00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,780\nwe'll smooth over, right,\nsome of those rough edges as we go,\n\n613\n00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,910\ncontinue to talk about these terms,\nand where we need to go in and\n\n614\n00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,550\nreally drill in for depth, we've done\nthat with you and we'll continue to.\n\n615\n00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,820\nDNS is a good example of that.\n\n616\n00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,220\nIn the episode that we did where we\nspent time really diagramming out,\n\n617\n00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,900\nit was a work of art,\nyou should have been there.\n\n618\n00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,865\nIt was magnificent, right?\n\n619\n00:31:37,865 --> 00:31:41,780\nSo we diagrammed out the entire\nstructure of how DNS works for\n\n620\n00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,930\nyou, really took you through the root\nall the way down into the top and\n\n621\n00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:47,610\nsecondary level domains and\ndrew that picture for you.\n\n622\n00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,570\nBut you'll notice we don't\ndo that with everything.\n\n623\n00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,918\nAnd as a result that's an area where you\nneed to think about going a little deeper.\n\n624\n00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:55,950\nThese areas as just a high\nlevel of vocabulary terms,\n\n625\n00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,400\nwe're quickly defining an area where you\ndon't need to spend quite as much time on.\n\n626\n00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,660\nLet's put it that way.\n\n627\n00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,337\nAll right, I think we're good.\n>> Yeah,\n\n628\n00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:03,572\nI think this is a pretty good\nspot to stop and take a break.\n\n629\n00:32:03,572 --> 00:32:05,528\nGive everybody a chance to\nget their head above water.\n\n630\n00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:09,098\nAnd when we get Back, we've got\nour WAN technologies to jump into.\n\n631\n00:32:09,098 --> 00:32:10,433\nTon of stuff there, right?\n\n632\n00:32:10,433 --> 00:32:13,684\nLots of different products available for\nus to use in the real world.\n\n633\n00:32:13,684 --> 00:32:15,230\n>> Absolutely.\n\n634\n00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,700\n>> Definitely stuff we want to dive into.\n\n635\n00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,611\nBut we'll take a break, and\nstay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n636\n00:32:20,611 --> 00:32:28,645\n[SOUND].\n\n637\n00:32:28,645 --> 00:32:30,328\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n638\n00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:34,951\nSo we left off after a long laundry list\nof acronym soup, and we're about to dive\n\n639\n00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:39,246\ninto wide area networks, which is\nwhole new collection of acronym soup.\n\n640\n00:32:39,246 --> 00:32:42,602\n>> Acronym soup,\nI want to order that when we go for lunch.\n\n641\n00:32:42,602 --> 00:32:44,350\nAcronym soup.\n\n642\n00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,280\nBring me a bowl of TLA,\nthree letter acronyms, right?\n\n643\n00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,540\n>> Do you eat that with crackers or\na [LAUGH].\n\n644\n00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,770\n>> Yeah, with crackers, right?\n\n645\n00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,480\nCrackers.\nSo I often thought my dream job,\n\n646\n00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,440\nwhen I was growing up,\nwhen I decided that I would do IT for\n\n647\n00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,780\na living,\nsince we're talking about acronyms,\n\n648\n00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,890\nwas that I would wanna be the person\nwho was in charge of acronyms for IT.\n\n649\n00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:08,920\nIf I could be the head of the three\nletter acronym department,\n\n650\n00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,730\nI thought that would be so cool.\n\n651\n00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:11,790\nI looked and looked and looked.\n\n652\n00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:16,270\nI never found that job posted anywhere, so\nif any of you have an acronym department\n\n653\n00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,640\nand are looking for\nsomebody to run it, then let me know.\n\n654\n00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,120\nCuz that would be,\nI think that would be a cool job.\n\n655\n00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,000\nYou sit in a room all day.\n\n656\n00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,660\nI imagined that you would sit in a room.\n\n657\n00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,580\nYou'd have balloons on the wall.\n\n658\n00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,165\nDarts.\n\n659\n00:33:26,165 --> 00:33:28,490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You would throw darts at the wall.\n\n660\n00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,630\nExplode the balloon.\n\n661\n00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:32,430\nBehind it would be some sort of\nan acronym and a description.\n\n662\n00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,590\nAnd that's what you would call things.\n\n663\n00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,840\nCuz it is seemingly so\n\n664\n00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,630\nrandom in terms of how we name some\nof these things and what they are.\n\n665\n00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,780\nAnd I'm convinced that\nsomewhere in the government,\n\n666\n00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:46,550\nsomewhere, there is an office buried\na antechamber in the basement of some\n\n667\n00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,130\ngodforsaken building somewhere\nin the middle of nowhere, and\n\n668\n00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,715\nthis is what they do,\nthey come up with those acronyms, so.\n\n669\n00:33:51,715 --> 00:33:53,773\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [COUGH] That's my thought on that for\n\n670\n00:33:53,773 --> 00:33:56,430\nthe day, but\nthat's where I think acronyms come from.\n\n671\n00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,130\nSo let's talk about some more\nacronyms having said that, right?\n\n672\n00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,550\nI think we left off.\n\n673\n00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,490\nWe were just about to start talking\nabout some WAN technologies.\n\n674\n00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:07,960\nAnd so with CSU, DSU,\nChannel Service Unit,\n\n675\n00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,425\nData Service Unit is what the CSU,\nDSU stands for.\n\n676\n00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:16,935\nThis is going to allow us to be able\nto ultimately take digital equipment\n\n677\n00:34:16,935 --> 00:34:20,865\nthat is gonna be used to connect LAN and\nWAN solutions together.\n\n678\n00:34:20,865 --> 00:34:23,645\nAnd so what were going to do is\nessentially bridge that divide between\n\n679\n00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:25,490\ndifferent interconnection types.\n\n680\n00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:29,840\nFrom the LAN to the WAN and this is\nwhat the unit is or this device is and\n\n681\n00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,740\nthis is what it does.\n\n682\n00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:36,790\nSo basically, what we do is the DSU part,\nthe Data Service Unit is going to convert\n\n683\n00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:43,500\ndigital signals from routers and\nfrom switches and multiplexers.\n\n684\n00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,470\nAll these different places where\nwe will get that information.\n\n685\n00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,110\nAnd transmit them over\nthe provider's digital lines.\n\n686\n00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,480\nThis is what it does.\n\n687\n00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,170\nThat is the DSU, not the CSU.\n\n688\n00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:52,700\n>> Oops.\n\n689\n00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,730\n>> You've got CSU there.\n\n690\n00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,690\nSo we'll fix that.\n\n691\n00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,530\nJust catch that for just a second.\n\n692\n00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,490\nBut it's the DSU.\n\n693\n00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,190\n>> Got it.\n>> The Data Service Unit that does that.\n\n694\n00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,920\nAll right.\n\n695\n00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,360\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n696\n00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,270\nThe CSU connects the network directly\nto the service provider's line.\n\n697\n00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,040\nThat's what the CSU does.\n\n698\n00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,030\nSo this is kind of a unit that\ndoes two things simultaneously.\n\n699\n00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:14,810\nIf you've never seen one of these, they\nwould be perhaps in your wiring closets,\n\n700\n00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,200\nfor instance,\nwhere you bring in your T line or\n\n701\n00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,760\nwhatever you may have been bringing\nin from the outside vendor.\n\n702\n00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,550\nAnd you would have had this sitting\ntypically as a rack mounted solution,\n\n703\n00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,938\nmaybe up on the wall, it would\njust depend on how they put it in.\n\n704\n00:35:24,938 --> 00:35:29,986\nBut you would see the CSU DSU there,\nsometimes a black box of some kind where\n\n705\n00:35:29,986 --> 00:35:34,979\nthey would cable up the actual T1 and\nbring that carrier cable up into it.\n\n706\n00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:38,039\nAnd then you'd open it up and\nit was this big box with lots of space and\n\n707\n00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,160\nalmost nothing in it.\n\n708\n00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,520\nRight so we had a couple of these hanging\non the wall in one of our offices and\n\n709\n00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,480\nyeah, they were massive boxes and\nthen you would actually open them up.\n\n710\n00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,465\nThey have a key to open up the side.\n\n711\n00:35:46,465 --> 00:35:49,924\nIt was the plug in for the cable coming\nin, but most of it was just empty space.\n\n712\n00:35:49,924 --> 00:35:52,593\nSo there isn't a lot\nthat goes on [CROSSTALK]\n\n713\n00:35:52,593 --> 00:35:54,200\n>> Do we wanna show some of those?\n\n714\n00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,540\nI know we've got some right over.\n\n715\n00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,120\n>> Yeah, sure.\n\n716\n00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,960\n>> I could [CROSSTALK]\n>> Oh, you wanna bring one on to camera?\n\n717\n00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,890\nOkay.\n>> I'll tell you what.\n\n718\n00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,050\nWhy don't you stall for a second.\n\n719\n00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,360\nI'll grab it right through\nthat door over there.\n\n720\n00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,270\n>> Sure absolutely.\n\n721\n00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,093\nSo let's talk about acronyms.\n\n722\n00:36:04,093 --> 00:36:04,697\nWhere do they come from?\n\n723\n00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:06,120\nNo [LAUGH] I'm only kidding.\n\n724\n00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,760\nSo let's continue talking, and\nDon will actually go and get one for\n\n725\n00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,950\nus which is great.\n\n726\n00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,180\nSo this idea of CSU DSU right?\n\n727\n00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,840\nThis is one of the many WAN\ntechnologies that we have to deal with.\n\n728\n00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,490\nWe also deal with switches, and\nswitching more importantly.\n\n729\n00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:19,490\nThank you,\nswitching more importantly, and so\n\n730\n00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:23,960\nthis idea of packet switches and\ncircuit switches and this idea of how\n\n731\n00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,480\nwe set up WAN level technologies\nis also something to consider.\n\n732\n00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,970\nUnder packet switching,\nI threw a couple of examples up there for\n\n733\n00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,340\nus just to make sure we had a sense of\nwhat kind of technologies we'll end up\n\n734\n00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,410\ntalking about here.\n\n735\n00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,330\nWe have X25, which is an older technology.\n\n736\n00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,030\nNot really widely used today.\n\n737\n00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,648\nWe have frame relay which replaced X25.\n\n738\n00:36:42,648 --> 00:36:44,668\nThese will be packet switching solutions.\n\n739\n00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:48,701\nAnd when we're talking about our packet\nswitching solution we don't set up\n\n740\n00:36:48,701 --> 00:36:50,151\na dedicated virtual link or\n\n741\n00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:53,504\ndedicated virtual circuit the way\nwe do with a circuit switch.\n\n742\n00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:58,015\nBut rather we packetize and break up\nthe data and then send it out across these\n\n743\n00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:02,880\nparticular frames or across this,\nusing X25, across this solution.\n\n744\n00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,450\nAnd so the difference here is that packet\nswitching is gonna go out, and basically,\n\n745\n00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:11,250\nyou can almost imagine a spider web, or\nsome sort of a web where two endpoints\n\n746\n00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:14,530\nare there and in the middle, we have\na cloud where we're connecting through.\n\n747\n00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,750\nThis would be a packet switching\nsolution where we're moving data\n\n748\n00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,760\nthrough these networks in packetized form,\nwonderful.\n\n749\n00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,840\nAnd then where we have\ncircuit switching solutions.\n\n750\n00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,610\nSomething for instance,\nan ISDN solution there.\n\n751\n00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:29,490\nWe're going to create a dedicated\nlink between two end points.\n\n752\n00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,260\nAnd then we're going to be able to send\ndata through those links as we move.\n\n753\n00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:38,540\nAnd so through the magic of modern TV,\nwe're about to bring Mr. Bisset back in.\n\n754\n00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,250\nAnd he's going to be\nactually able to show us\n\n755\n00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,210\nsome of this old technology\nthat we were talking about.\n\n756\n00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,950\n>> Now that you mention it I\nwish we had a Star Trek effect.\n\n757\n00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,980\nI could have-\n>> Teleported in.\n\n758\n00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,920\n>> Could have beamed out and\nbeamed back in.\n\n759\n00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:51,040\n>> Adam you mentioned you\ncrack open that big box.\n\n760\n00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,150\nAnd it's mostly empty and\nthere's something in it.\n\n761\n00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,820\nHere's the something that's in it.\n\n762\n00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,600\nIt's just a circuit board like this.\n\n763\n00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,210\nThere's not all that much to it.\n\n764\n00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,660\n>> The front is what you see,\nright, exactly.\n\n765\n00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,890\n>> You get some readouts.\n\n766\n00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:04,420\nThese are little lights that give\nyou status messages and stuff.\n\n767\n00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,640\nYou hear this referred to as a smart\njack because it's kind of handling\n\n768\n00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,540\nThat termination for\nthe telephone company, and\n\n769\n00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,290\nit's got some logic in it that they\ncan reach out and monitor the status.\n\n770\n00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,240\nThat's why they call it a smart jack.\n\n771\n00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:17,600\nBut this is what we need to\nconnect to with our equipment, and\n\n772\n00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,260\nthat's where we need a CSU DSU.\n\n773\n00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:24,355\nAnd they come in two You can get CSU DSUs\nthat are external units, like this.\n\n774\n00:38:24,355 --> 00:38:25,515\nThey look like a modem.\n\n775\n00:38:25,515 --> 00:38:29,775\nAdam, you mentioned that, and\nthere's not all that much to them.\n\n776\n00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:31,775\nYou plug the phone company's\nstuff into one port,\n\n777\n00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:34,365\nyou plug your stuff into another,\nand off you go.\n\n778\n00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:36,405\nThis is a pretty small one,\nthere were much,\n\n779\n00:38:36,405 --> 00:38:38,705\nmuch bigger ones that were out there,\ndepending on how many lines.\n\n780\n00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:42,750\nIf you were terminating a T3,\nthis little jobby isn't going to do it.\n\n781\n00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,640\nThis is designed for\nlike a T1 managing about 24 channels.\n\n782\n00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,150\nRemember a T3 has 672 channels.\n\n783\n00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,880\nYou need some better stuff than this.\n\n784\n00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,300\nYou'll see on a lot of routers and\n\n785\n00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,920\nstuff today where they have\nCSU DSU's built into them.\n\n786\n00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,060\nAnd so I grabbed one of these too.\n\n787\n00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,080\nThis is a Cisco WAN Interface Card or\na WIC,\n\n788\n00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,600\nand it is really tiny, but\nit has a CSU DSU built into it.\n\n789\n00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,880\nNow it's designed just for\na T1, just for 24 channels.\n\n790\n00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,660\nBut it is will allow you to basically\ntake the telephone company's line and\n\n791\n00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,850\nplug it right into the router.\n\n792\n00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:15,595\nIt's doing the conversion\nhere on the chip and\n\n793\n00:39:15,595 --> 00:39:17,261\nthen running into the router's back plan.\n\n794\n00:39:17,261 --> 00:39:22,182\nSo you see various varieties of\nCSU DSUs that are out there,\n\n795\n00:39:22,182 --> 00:39:24,159\nbut these are a couple.\n\n796\n00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:26,896\nI just thought it would be neat to show\nsome because I knew we had them right in\n\n797\n00:39:26,896 --> 00:39:27,577\nthat other room.\n\n798\n00:39:27,577 --> 00:39:30,400\n>> That's great, so various varieties,\nanother acronym, a vv.\n\n799\n00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,540\nAnd by the way our Internet\nconnection is down.\n\n800\n00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,300\nI don't know why.\n\n801\n00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:33,870\n>> Oh, oh no.\n\n802\n00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,210\n[LAUGH]\n>> I think it's because, you know,\n\n803\n00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:38,630\nwe might have to put some of those\nback where you found them, right?\n\n804\n00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,720\n>> Quickly, plug them back in.\n\n805\n00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,490\nIt's good that we buffer here so that we\nhave the amount of media that could stream\n\n806\n00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:44,900\nout while we're fixing\nthis behind the scenes.\n\n807\n00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,700\nWe're actually sitting down and\nhaving a coffee right now.\n\n808\n00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,380\nTaking a break while\nyou're watching us talk.\n\n809\n00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,731\n>> Through the miracles\nof video buffering.\n\n810\n00:39:50,731 --> 00:39:51,615\n[LAUGH]\n>> Exactly.\n\n811\n00:39:51,615 --> 00:39:52,942\nLook they're kind of hollow.\n\n812\n00:39:52,942 --> 00:39:54,102\nThey look like holographs.\n\n813\n00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:54,711\nWhat's going on?\nAll right so\n\n814\n00:39:54,711 --> 00:39:57,964\nwe were talking about circuit switching\npacket switching as you were off there.\n\n815\n00:39:57,964 --> 00:40:00,565\nSo let's just quickly\nkinda recap some of that.\n\n816\n00:40:00,565 --> 00:40:02,922\nWe may wanna just capture\na couple of quick items as we go.\n\n817\n00:40:02,922 --> 00:40:04,268\nSo with circuit switching.\n\n818\n00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:08,918\nConnection oriented solution\nas we talked about.\n\n819\n00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:14,300\nTraffic flows across those\nconnections in a predictable matter.\n\n820\n00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,780\nWe always have a path, in other words we\nknow what the path is, defined endpoints,\n\n821\n00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:20,660\nthat kind of thing.\n\n822\n00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,540\nWe are typically gonna be using this for\nvoice, more often than not.\n\n823\n00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,360\nSo we will see circuit switch\nsolutions being used for voice.\n\n824\n00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,030\nSo ISDN,\none example of what that might be.\n\n825\n00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,040\nPacket switching up top I believe right,\npacket switching.\n\n826\n00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,280\nSo we're gonna have different paths\nto be able to go from place to place.\n\n827\n00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,820\nAs we packetize the data.\n\n828\n00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,110\nSo there's no dedicated virtual\ncircuits that are being created there\n\n829\n00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:43,540\nthat are sitting in dedicated and\nreal time.\n\n830\n00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,980\nThese circuits are being brought up for\npathways that are being used and\n\n831\n00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,290\nthen they're being torn down again.\n\n832\n00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:49,920\nSo it's not dedicated.\n\n833\n00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,830\nTraffic is bursty.\n\n834\n00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:51,490\nIt's packetized.\n\n835\n00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,670\nSo it's bursty in nature.\n\n836\n00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,170\nAnd we are typically seeing data being\ncarried here, as opposed to voice.\n\n837\n00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,220\nSo we would see this being used or\n\n838\n00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,550\ntraditionally having\nbeen used to carry data.\n\n839\n00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:02,140\nJust so we know.\n\n840\n00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,780\nAll right.\n\n841\n00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,130\nThen we're gonna talk about.\n\n842\n00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,790\nOr as soon as Don finishes just.\n\n843\n00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,550\nNoting everything out\nthat I just there for us.\n\n844\n00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,180\nWe're gonna talk a bit\nabout virtual circuits.\n\n845\n00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,130\nThis idea, and I just mentioned this\nidea of permanent circuits being in\n\n846\n00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:20,110\nplace versus switch circuits that\nare basically broken down on demand and\n\n847\n00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,040\ntorn back down and\nbuilt back up again on demand.\n\n848\n00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,060\nAnd so a permanent virtual circuit\nis a permanent endpoint sitting\n\n849\n00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:31,810\nbetween two different well defined\nsolutions and that permanent virtual\n\n850\n00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,630\ncircuit sits there when it just\navailable on demand all of the time.\n\n851\n00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,600\nThink of a phone company, right, and\n\n852\n00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:41,130\nyou at the end point having a phone\ntraditional analog wired phone land phone.\n\n853\n00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,100\nYou would pick up your phone.\n\n854\n00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,530\nYou would always connect back to\nswitch office through to the basically\n\n855\n00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,060\nthe switching architecture.\n\n856\n00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,380\nThat was a permanent circuit.\n\n857\n00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,050\nYour phone was always wired up and\nready to go.\n\n858\n00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,831\nSo, we can think of it that way whereas\na switch virtual circuit will be one that\n\n859\n00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:57,310\nwill pick up on demand and\nbasically create a path.\n\n860\n00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,920\nThe next time it would be different.\n\n861\n00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,910\nIt was not gonna follow the same\npath all the time and so\n\n862\n00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,760\nthis is something that effectively is\njust created when we have a need and\n\n863\n00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,395\nthen is torn down and we use the best\npossible path available at the time.\n\n864\n00:42:09,395 --> 00:42:12,189\nSo, that's really what we wanna keep\nin mind and just be aware of that.\n\n865\n00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:20,480\nWhen you have a virtual circuit,\na permanent virtual circuit.\n\n866\n00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,860\nWhat I was gonna say was\ntypically this would be.\n\n867\n00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,260\nI think we talked about the idea of\na private line like a phone customer,\n\n868\n00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,120\nbut basically, the other thing there\nwould be that you have an agreed\n\n869\n00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,240\nupon amount of bandwidth\nassociated with this, right?\n\n870\n00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,570\nSo, you may contract for a T1, for\n\n871\n00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:36,710\ninstance, right, permanent virtual circuit\nwould be an example, would be a T.\n\n872\n00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:40,970\nAnd you would agree to, with a phone\ncompany or ISP, 1.5 extra bandwidth, or\n\n873\n00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:45,160\nwhatever it would be, and so that's what\nyou got for as long as you paid for it.\n\n874\n00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,520\nThat's effectively what you would get.\n\n875\n00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,930\nWith the prominent virtual server.\n\n876\n00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:49,152\nSo just keep that in mind.\n\n877\n00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:51,080\nThat's what we're often\ntalking about there.\n\n878\n00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,420\nWhereas the switch virtual circuit\nwas typically the dialup solution,\n\n879\n00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,970\nolder technology you would access on\ndemand, and affect as we said, and\n\n880\n00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:02,360\ncreate the circuit on the fly and\nuse it and then continue on.\n\n881\n00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:06,960\nSo we are going to talk a bit about\nSLIP and about point-to-point protocol.\n\n882\n00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,750\nSo let's talk about some of these\nvery old by today's standards,\n\n883\n00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:14,170\nold protocols that were used to create\nconnections and move data back and forth.\n\n884\n00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,660\nSLIP is serial line interface protocol.\n\n885\n00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:21,730\nThis was a mainframe protocol primarily\nused in Unix systems, mainframe systems,\n\n886\n00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:27,080\nwide open, no password protection, no\nthought about encrypting data of any kind.\n\n887\n00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,750\nYou basically got everything out on the\nwire, we moved the data back and forth but\n\n888\n00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:31,470\nit was wide open.\n\n889\n00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:33,930\nThere was no confidentiality\ninvolved at all.\n\n890\n00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:36,400\nReally no way to create\nintegrity around the data.\n\n891\n00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,480\nAnd back in the day, at that point, we\nreally weren't worried about that stuff,\n\n892\n00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,130\nif you think about it.\n\n893\n00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:40,810\nWe were aware of it.\n\n894\n00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:41,400\nDon't get me wrong.\n\n895\n00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,640\nBut we didn't really think people\nwould interdict into a line and\n\n896\n00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,840\nsteal that kind of data.\n\n897\n00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,060\nIt just wasn't a thought process\nthat people had back then.\n\n898\n00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,770\nWe're talking about at the dawn,\nin effect, or\n\n899\n00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:53,690\nvery close to the dawn of\nthe modern computer age.\n\n900\n00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:57,330\nSo in the 70s, in the 80s, that kind of\nthing when these protocols were being\n\n901\n00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,470\nused, people didn't really\nthink about hacking.\n\n902\n00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,960\nIt just wasn't being done, right?.\n\n903\n00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,950\nAt least, not in this way.\n\n904\n00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:03,940\n>> No.\nI like to think of myself\n\n905\n00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,715\nas the dawn of the modern computer age.\n\n906\n00:44:05,715 --> 00:44:06,783\nBa-dum-da.\n\n907\n00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,640\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, we do need, I was gonna say,\n\n908\n00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,390\nat least if we had one sound effect,\nthat would be,\n\n909\n00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:14,330\nthe rimshot would be the one\nthat we needed to have for that.\n\n910\n00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,620\nThat would be it, absolutely.\n\n911\n00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,710\n>> The rimshot or the cricket chirp.\n\n912\n00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:17,950\n>> Or a cricket chirp, right.\n\n913\n00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:18,819\nWhy is there nothing happening?\n\n914\n00:44:18,819 --> 00:44:21,350\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Why is it silent for ten seconds?\n\n915\n00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:22,050\nWhat happened?\n\n916\n00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:22,750\nYes, all right.\n\n917\n00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:26,835\nSo that's gonna be the new one for\nyou, the dawn of the networking age.\n\n918\n00:44:26,835 --> 00:44:28,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That will be your\n\n919\n00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,300\nnew bottom third, I think.\n\n920\n00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,320\nSo, all right, so\nSLIPs interline interface protocol, right?\n\n921\n00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,608\nThat's very old protocol.\n\n922\n00:44:34,608 --> 00:44:38,880\nReplaced early on, you don't see slipping\nused anywhere today outside of maybe a lab\n\n923\n00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,390\nsomewhere if they happen to be\nshowing you a historical demo.\n\n924\n00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,180\nReplaced by PPP point to point protocol.\n\n925\n00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,040\nSo point to point protocol,\nsimilar idea here,\n\n926\n00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,890\nwe step up one generation\non the technology.\n\n927\n00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:54,099\nWe do have this idea to be able to\ncreate dedicated connections between two\n\n928\n00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:54,962\nend points.\n\n929\n00:44:54,962 --> 00:44:57,860\nBut again,\ninformation was sent in the clear,\n\n930\n00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:01,650\nreally nothing that we were thinking of\nthere that would allow us to think about\n\n931\n00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:06,710\nnormal logical security that we would\nconsider to be important today.\n\n932\n00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:11,720\nSo one of the key things with SLIP which I\ndidn't mention, which we should probably\n\n933\n00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,779\njust go back and capture quickly was\nthat it was actually able to encapsulate\n\n934\n00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,752\nprotocols other than just IP, and\nso it was good in the sense that.\n\n935\n00:45:20,752 --> 00:45:25,690\n[COUGH] I'm sorry, I apologize.\n\n936\n00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,360\nPPP, I meant, I was looking at the thing.\n\n937\n00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:30,855\nI meant PPP, not SLIP.\n\n938\n00:45:30,855 --> 00:45:35,000\n[LAUGH] That's why, cuz you wrote replaced\nby PPP, and I meant to reference PPP.\n\n939\n00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,420\nSo able to encapsulate multiple protocols,\nnot just IP.\n\n940\n00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,310\nWhich SLIP could not.\n\n941\n00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:42,620\nSLIP was a simple solution, did not\nreally work for multiple protocols.\n\n942\n00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,660\nAlso, PPP is able to do multiple\nauthentication mechanisms where, again,\n\n943\n00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,750\nSLIP is not really able to do any of this.\n\n944\n00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,230\nSo we can support different\nauthentication solutions there.\n\n945\n00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:53,290\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n946\n00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,940\nAnd it was better at compression.\n\n947\n00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,740\nMore efficient as\na protocol overall as well.\n\n948\n00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:01,680\n>> You know my favorite feature of PPP?\n\n949\n00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,930\nIf I could choose a favorite of all the\namazing features of PPP, was multi-link.\n\n950\n00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,740\nWell, found that PPP was pretty awesome.\n\n951\n00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:12,740\nIn SLIP, my very first Internet\nconnection, the first service provider I\n\n952\n00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,770\npaid to get Internet access, I had SLIP,\nand they offered SLIP and PPP.\n\n953\n00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,515\nThey introduced it while I was a customer.\n\n954\n00:46:17,515 --> 00:46:20,010\n>> Okay.\n>> And to me as a customer,\n\n955\n00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,140\nI didn't really care about\nauthentication back then, so\n\n956\n00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,120\nthere wasn't anything\nreally driving me to PPP.\n\n957\n00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,630\nI wasn't gonna send IPX, SPX over\nthe line, and whatever which PPP can do.\n\n958\n00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:30,030\nBut it was multi link\nthat got me to switch.\n\n959\n00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:34,910\nThe idea that I could have\ntwo of my 1200 baud modems.\n\n960\n00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:38,400\nIf I could have two of these and\nget 2400 baud that would be pretty sweet.\n\n961\n00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,720\n>> You could bundle them and\n>> And you couldn't do that under SLIP, so\n\n962\n00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,980\nit was neat, or a lot of improvements.\n\n963\n00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,690\nSo many that SLIP just disappeared.\n\n964\n00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:46,750\n>> Yeah, literally slipped away,\nas we say.\n\n965\n00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:47,810\n>> It slipped away.\n\n966\n00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:48,590\n>> Slipped away.\n\n967\n00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:49,926\nAll right.\n[NOISE] Right?\n\n968\n00:46:49,926 --> 00:46:52,859\nThat was almost as good as\nDon of the networking aid.\n\n969\n00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:55,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so multi-link PPP.\n\n970\n00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,690\nAgain, kind of a dinosaur\nby today's standards.\n\n971\n00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,790\nAlthough the thought process and\nthe architectural leap in\n\n972\n00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:04,900\nterms of capabilities that PPP represented\nwas rolled forward into the more modern\n\n973\n00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,800\nprotocols that we're using,\nthe more modern connectivity solutions.\n\n974\n00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,790\nSo it is there kind of in the background.\n\n975\n00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:11,330\nYeah, we see the impact of it.\n\n976\n00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,076\nAuthentication comes to the fore,\n\n977\n00:47:13,076 --> 00:47:16,636\nmultiple protocols being able to be\nbrought together comes to the fore.\n\n978\n00:47:16,636 --> 00:47:20,312\nMulti linking in one form or another\ncomes to the fore in these newer protocol\n\n979\n00:47:20,312 --> 00:47:24,104\nsolutions, but this was really the first\nmodern, what we think was the modern\n\n980\n00:47:24,104 --> 00:47:27,802\nequivalent of modern connectivity or\nmodern day connectivity that we see.\n\n981\n00:47:27,802 --> 00:47:31,270\nSo SIP and H.323 solutions.\n\n982\n00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:37,626\nSIP is gonna be a voice protocol that we\nare using or we see used on voice systems.\n\n983\n00:47:37,626 --> 00:47:41,050\nH.323 gateways are going to manage and\n\n984\n00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:44,740\nhelp us to create standards around\nthe use of voice in our solutions.\n\n985\n00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:49,317\nAnd so these technologies are things\nthat we wanna make sure we are aware\n\n986\n00:47:49,317 --> 00:47:49,857\nof as well.\n\n987\n00:47:49,857 --> 00:47:54,613\nThinking about this idea of being\nable to use a standard, in this case,\n\n988\n00:47:54,613 --> 00:47:59,132\nsomething like SIP To be able to sit\ndown and think through how we're\n\n989\n00:47:59,132 --> 00:48:04,129\ngoing to implement a voice solution,\nSIP underlines all the stuff we do for\n\n990\n00:48:04,129 --> 00:48:09,946\nvideo conferencing for instance, doing the\naudio video of any kind, any streaming.\n\n991\n00:48:09,946 --> 00:48:12,095\nSIP is gonna be there in.\n\n992\n00:48:12,095 --> 00:48:13,395\nIn one form or another.\n\n993\n00:48:13,395 --> 00:48:16,045\nWe may have something like RTP,\nreal time protocol,\n\n994\n00:48:16,045 --> 00:48:17,465\nwhich I think is down there somewhere.\n\n995\n00:48:17,465 --> 00:48:20,225\nWe may have something like\nthat being used as well, but\n\n996\n00:48:20,225 --> 00:48:25,675\nthe idea that basically we are going\nto see these kinds of solutions\n\n997\n00:48:25,675 --> 00:48:30,025\nis very important because we're gonna\nneed specifically designed protocols,\n\n998\n00:48:30,025 --> 00:48:32,980\nspecifically designed gateways\nlike these to deal with voice.\n\n999\n00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,300\nBecause voice is different, right?\n\n1000\n00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,560\nIt's different than the normal data\nthat we send when we're sending\n\n1001\n00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,530\na file to a printer.\n\n1002\n00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,150\nAnd we have to treat it differently.\n\n1003\n00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,400\nWe have to quality of service,\nor QOS it differently.\n\n1004\n00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,990\nWe typically are streaming this\nis a non TCP-like environment.\n\n1005\n00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:50,780\nSo this is all going to be\ngoing primarily over UDP.\n\n1006\n00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,491\nAnd as a result of that,\nif we drop voice packets,\n\n1007\n00:48:53,491 --> 00:48:56,462\nwe miss critical information\nbecause all of a sudden,\n\n1008\n00:48:56,462 --> 00:48:59,900\nwe miss part of the conversation,\npart of the video drops out.\n\n1009\n00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,674\nSo we have flicker in the frame rate or\n\n1010\n00:49:01,674 --> 00:49:05,112\nif we drop enough we actually lose\nthe connection Connection freezes,\n\n1011\n00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,420\ndifferent ways to see\nerrors occurring there.\n\n1012\n00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:11,030\nBut, whatever it is, because we're\nnot automatically going to resend.\n\n1013\n00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:14,610\nAnd really there's no good way to resend\nthat because you can't replay the voice\n\n1014\n00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:15,430\nunless you buffer it.\n\n1015\n00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:18,800\nAnd so, we offset technologies\nthat may allow us to do that.\n\n1016\n00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,895\nBut because we do that and we don't\nreally have a way of reconnecting and\n\n1017\n00:49:21,895 --> 00:49:24,250\nresending on the fly the way we do a TCP,\n\n1018\n00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,880\nwe have to really structure these\nprotocols and these gateways in such a way\n\n1019\n00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,050\nthat they maximize the integrity of\nthe data as we send it and receive it.\n\n1020\n00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:34,530\nSo, just be aware of some of these things\nas we're throwing them out to you.\n\n1021\n00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:36,780\nThis is an area that you may or\nmay not do a lot of work in.\n\n1022\n00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:40,670\nAnd, you know, a lot of the CISPs that I\ndeal with and I meet on a regular basis\n\n1023\n00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:43,470\nhave good general working knowledge\nof the networking area overall.\n\n1024\n00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:47,670\nThey spend a lot of time doing this,\nbut unless you specialize in voice, and\n\n1025\n00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:50,790\nyou know, it's really such\na sub-specialty, but such an important one\n\n1026\n00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:53,680\nthat you may not really know\nmuch about how it works, right?\n\n1027\n00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,840\nSo just think about that.\n\n1028\n00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:57,710\nAll right, so we have all of that.\n\n1029\n00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:01,810\nBy the way, when we talk about,\njust a quick little aside.\n\n1030\n00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:04,330\nThere was one thing that was in\nthe back of my mind that I wanted to\n\n1031\n00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:05,290\nthrow up there.\n\n1032\n00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:08,490\nWhen we talk about instant messaging.\n\n1033\n00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:12,520\nWhen we talk about SPIN,\nSpam Over Instant Messaging, so\n\n1034\n00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,690\nthat's just one of those things that\ncomes up that you may see somewhere.\n\n1035\n00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:19,590\nso when we think of ways of flooding\nthe networks with this garbage data\n\n1036\n00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:23,950\nwe tend to see instant messaging traffic\nbeing referred to as SPIN when it is like\n\n1037\n00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:26,440\nspam effectively but\non an instant messaging solution.\n\n1038\n00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,590\nSo just think about that and\nbe aware of that.\n\n1039\n00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:33,100\nAlright, ISDN we're talking about some\nadditional connectivity types here.\n\n1040\n00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,670\nIntegrated Services Digital Network\nwhat we call ISDN.\n\n1041\n00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,640\nThere's different kinds of\nISDN as you can see there.\n\n1042\n00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,840\nWe have I called out just a couple, and\nthere are actually more by the way.\n\n1043\n00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,090\nThese are just two of the most basic and\noften most referred to or\n\n1044\n00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:49,141\ntalked about ones, but it seems like\nthe list is almost a mile long.\n\n1045\n00:50:49,141 --> 00:50:50,707\nXDL or DSL as well, right,\n\n1046\n00:50:50,707 --> 00:50:55,090\nhave like 10 or 12 different types\nassociated with it at one point.\n\n1047\n00:50:55,090 --> 00:51:00,000\nBut for ISDM the two most prevalent\nones were BRI, Basic Rate Interface.\n\n1048\n00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,750\nThere are two what are called B channels.\n\n1049\n00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:06,150\nThe B channels were the bearer channels,\nwhich is what the terminology came from.\n\n1050\n00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,830\nThis is where the data\nwas actually sent across.\n\n1051\n00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:10,800\nAnd then a D channel, which was for\n\n1052\n00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,530\nbasically architectural error control\ncorrection design and setup and breakdown.\n\n1053\n00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,960\nSome management, in effect, right?\n\n1054\n00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,175\nYou would think D for data,\nbut you would be wrong.\n\n1055\n00:51:19,175 --> 00:51:21,260\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Why would we do that?\n\n1056\n00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:22,720\nThat would be logical, right?\n\n1057\n00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,970\nSo two B channels.\n\n1058\n00:51:23,970 --> 00:51:25,350\nThey're channels for data.\n\n1059\n00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,840\nOne D channel, which was\nbasically our management channel.\n\n1060\n00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,940\n64 kilobits of data per\nB channel on the BRI.\n\n1061\n00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:36,470\nAnd when we combine them together 144\nkilobits of bandwidth overall is typically\n\n1062\n00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:37,270\nwhat we would see there.\n\n1063\n00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:43,180\nPrimary rate interface, or what was\nknown as PRI 23 B channels, again B for\n\n1064\n00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,830\nbarer, D for data.\n\n1065\n00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:46,580\nSo we had 23 data channels,\n\n1066\n00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,820\none D channel which was our management\nchannel there for overhead.\n\n1067\n00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,020\nAnd then 64 kilobits again\non the B channels for data.\n\n1068\n00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:57,480\nThat's how we get a 1.5\nmegabits aggregate.\n\n1069\n00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:58,500\nWe put them together.\n\n1070\n00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,260\nThis will be basically the same thing\nas a T1 when you bundle it all up.\n\n1071\n00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,250\nAnd your PRI will give you a T1 when\nyou bundle 23 channels together.\n\n1072\n00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,140\nSo we have DSL.\n\n1073\n00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,620\nDigital subscriber line, excuse me.\n\n1074\n00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,600\nAnd we would have broadband there, right?\n\n1075\n00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,180\nSo it is broadband solution.\n\n1076\n00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:18,500\nUp to 52 megs, typically over\ncopper is what DSL can provide.\n\n1077\n00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:20,340\nStill in use today,\npretty prevalent, right?\n\n1078\n00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:24,760\nWe have business grade DSL with things\nlike at least in the south here,\n\n1079\n00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,090\nin the south Florida area,\nin the southern part of Florida.\n\n1080\n00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:30,200\nProbably for you guys as well,\nthough, up here we have Cox.\n\n1081\n00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,450\nRight.\nCox is the big carrier.\n\n1082\n00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:32,240\n>> Cable provider.\n\n1083\n00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,030\n>> Right, we have Comcast down south.\n\n1084\n00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:36,010\n>> Our cable monopoly is Cox,\nyours is Comcast.\n\n1085\n00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:36,740\n>> Is Comcast.\n\n1086\n00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,890\nRight.\nExactly.\n\n1087\n00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:40,910\nHowever you get there, but the idea\nis basically that they are providing\n\n1088\n00:52:40,910 --> 00:52:45,050\nyou a business grade DSL, as they call it,\nor that's how they brand it down by us.\n\n1089\n00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:49,990\nAnd the idea would be, you're bringing\nin this DSL based technology.\n\n1090\n00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:54,930\nAnd so we get, I think we have something\nlike 50 megs coming in to our area\n\n1091\n00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:58,430\nwhen we use it in any of our offices,\nand we're able to bring that in, and\n\n1092\n00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:01,750\nthen burst if we need it, but\nwe're running at a guarantee.\n\n1093\n00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,750\nAnd we just bring in multiple iterations,\n\n1094\n00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,770\nmultiple cable modems in\neffect to do that so.\n\n1095\n00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:10,470\n>> Yeah, cable is nice because you can get\na pretty consistent level of bandwidth\n\n1096\n00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:11,490\nwith it.\n\n1097\n00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:13,470\nDSL, because of\nthe technologies being used,\n\n1098\n00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:17,350\ncuz it's being thrown up regular phone\nlines, the further away you are from\n\n1099\n00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:20,680\nthe telephone company's switches,\nthe less bandwidth you get.\n\n1100\n00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,610\nSo it's a little bit variable,\nwe don't have as fixed a number.\n\n1101\n00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:24,870\nThat doesn't mean that DSL isn't good.\n\n1102\n00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:28,280\nIn many cities you can get better\nbandwidth on DSL than you can on cable.\n\n1103\n00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:32,190\nIt's not the case here in Gainesville,\nbut in other cities that may be true.\n\n1104\n00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:33,990\nSo, you know, Jeff,\ndefinitely pay attention to that.\n\n1105\n00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:36,020\nIt does vary from region to region.\n\n1106\n00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:36,650\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n1107\n00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,190\nWell, and you know,\n\n1108\n00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:40,170\nthe trick there is to just understand\nwhat your provider is offering.\n\n1109\n00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:42,500\nAnd do the,\nkind of the comparison to market, right?\n\n1110\n00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,070\nUnderstand what you get and\nwhat you don't.\n\n1111\n00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,260\nAlso want to pay special attention,\nupstream versus downstream, right,\n\n1112\n00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,360\nbecause a lot of times that\nmagic number they throw at you\n\n1113\n00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,580\nis not in the direction you want.\n\n1114\n00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,450\nRight?\nSo you just want to be aware of\n\n1115\n00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:55,860\nhow much bandwidth you\nget in each direction,\n\n1116\n00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:57,330\nbecause it's not typically\ngoing to be the same.\n\n1117\n00:53:57,330 --> 00:53:58,600\nYou're not going to get\nthe same speed up and\n\n1118\n00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,530\ndown unless you spend a lot more money.\n\n1119\n00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:01,580\nIn order to be able to do that.\n\n1120\n00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,890\nRight?\nDedicated IPs and things of that nature.\n\n1121\n00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:05,800\nAll right, so where were we on our list?\n\n1122\n00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,760\nI think we got through to DSL.\n\n1123\n00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,900\nJust talk quickly about cable modems,\nit's always connected.\n\n1124\n00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,200\nIt's a broadband solution as well.\n\n1125\n00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,160\nThen we have virtual private networks,\nwe have VPNs.\n\n1126\n00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,140\nSo again, just walking through\na bunch of technology items,\n\n1127\n00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:20,650\nthrowing out some definitions for\nyou explaining or\n\n1128\n00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:23,090\nhelping to put them into\ncontext around how they work.\n\n1129\n00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:24,980\nSo a VPN, virtual private network.\n\n1130\n00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:27,750\nWe probably have seen VPNs most of us,\n\n1131\n00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:30,340\ndepending on how long we\nhave been working in IT.\n\n1132\n00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,580\nHave used the VPN in business, or\nat least have been aware of it.\n\n1133\n00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:37,139\nMay still have VPNs in your network\nalthough they are becoming a little less\n\n1134\n00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:37,770\nprevalent.\n\n1135\n00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:39,720\nThey're kind of going away slowly,\nbut surely.\n\n1136\n00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,420\nWe have newer technology that's\nable to do a lot of this without\n\n1137\n00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,540\nthe whole need to use the VPN client and\n\n1138\n00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:48,630\nthe software overlay that was often\nvery complicated for people to manage.\n\n1139\n00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:51,470\nAlso we had some technology there,\ndifferent technology types that would be\n\n1140\n00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:55,000\nused PPTP,\npoint to point tunneling protocol.\n\n1141\n00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,450\nWe have L2TP,\nlayered two tunneling protocol, IP sect,\n\n1142\n00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:03,600\ninternet protocol security,\nSSL, secure socket layer.\n\n1143\n00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,720\nThese are all VPN technologies and\n\n1144\n00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,730\nprotocols that would\nhave been used with them.\n\n1145\n00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:13,700\nThe idea with this would have been that\nwe would have the ability to be able\n\n1146\n00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:18,150\nto take technology,\nat the when DPNs became prevalent,\n\n1147\n00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:20,442\nthe Tunneling Protocol\nstarted become prevalent.\n\n1148\n00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:24,770\nTake technology that would allow us\neffectively to take data packets,\n\n1149\n00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:27,010\neffectively whatever\nthe data would have been.\n\n1150\n00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:31,380\nWrap them or somehow encapsulate them,\nthe language we would use with tunneling,\n\n1151\n00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,270\nwrap them up and\nencapsulate them inside the tunnel.\n\n1152\n00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:35,650\nWith these protocols and\n\n1153\n00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:39,440\nthen in fact we send them down the wire\ninside this almost like a tube.\n\n1154\n00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,550\nI often think of going to\nthe drive-through at the bank.\n\n1155\n00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:43,230\nRight?\nAnd having the pneumatic tube,\n\n1156\n00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:45,800\nthe air tubes, where you put stuff in and\nshoot it over.\n\n1157\n00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,142\nAnd so your money,\nyour deposit or whatever it was,\n\n1158\n00:55:48,142 --> 00:55:51,071\nwould be in the little carrier box,\nalmost like the data packet,\n\n1159\n00:55:51,071 --> 00:55:53,648\nit would shoot down the tube and\nshow up on the other side.\n\n1160\n00:55:53,648 --> 00:55:56,539\nAnd so the tube system was\nthe tunneling protocol and\n\n1161\n00:55:56,539 --> 00:55:59,241\nyou were sending data back and\nforth as a result.\n\n1162\n00:55:59,241 --> 00:56:02,987\nAnd so our first iteration of this\nwas PPTP, we go from point-to-point,\n\n1163\n00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:04,716\nto point-to-point tunneling.\n\n1164\n00:56:04,716 --> 00:56:08,190\nThis is like the next\ngeneration of that technology.\n\n1165\n00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:10,470\nThis is a client server based model so\n\n1166\n00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:13,070\nwe would have client server’s\nwell defined end points.\n\n1167\n00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:17,070\nWe take PPP and kind amp it up, so\nwe tunnel the point-to-point traffic.\n\n1168\n00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:21,880\nIn effect, it's what PPTP does, works at\nthe data link layer of the OSI model, so\n\n1169\n00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,030\nit works at layer two, of the OSI model.\n\n1170\n00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,200\nAnd is only gonna be over IP networks.\n\n1171\n00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,825\nSo we can only transmit over\nan IP network when we use PPTP.\n\n1172\n00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,820\nSo we'll just make some\nquick notes there as we go.\n\n1173\n00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:40,082\nAll right so L2TP,\nlayer-2 tunneling protocol,\n\n1174\n00:56:40,082 --> 00:56:43,580\nthis is gonna be a combination,\na hybrid solution.\n\n1175\n00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,510\nSo we took PPTP,\n\n1176\n00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:48,330\nwanted to improve on it cuz there were\nsome significant downsides to it,\n\n1177\n00:56:48,330 --> 00:56:52,390\nlimited to IP only for instance, only\noperating at the data link layer, right.\n\n1178\n00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:54,920\nSo there were other things we\nmay want to incorporate there.\n\n1179\n00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:59,220\nSo we take, excuse me,\nwe take the PPTP protocol and\n\n1180\n00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:04,330\ncombine it with L2F, which is Cisco's\nproprietary layer-2 protocol.\n\n1181\n00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:07,960\nAnd we link the two together,\nin effect, we bind them and\n\n1182\n00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,660\nas a result of that L2F,\nLayer-2 Forwarding.\n\n1183\n00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:13,130\nI'm sorry,\nI should've said that real quickly.\n\n1184\n00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,840\nAnd as a result, Cisco Proprietary\nProtocol will then combine them together,\n\n1185\n00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,240\nwhat we get is we get effectively L2TP,\nLayer-2 Tunnelling.\n\n1186\n00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:25,970\nSo again, we extend and\nwe add to functionality\n\n1187\n00:57:25,970 --> 00:57:32,190\nfound in PPTP by adding in L2F in effect,\nthis works also at the data link layer.\n\n1188\n00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:36,200\nBut this allows us to be able to extend\nout beyond just IP based networks.\n\n1189\n00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:39,653\nSo, in other words, what the key\nthing that we really got here was,\n\n1190\n00:57:39,653 --> 00:57:44,330\nby adding L2F, was the ability to be able\nto extend just beyond an IP based network.\n\n1191\n00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:48,345\nAnd we combine with IPsec, that's\nthe other thing we kind of bring in here,\n\n1192\n00:57:48,345 --> 00:57:53,150\nlayer-2 typically, is gonna be used with\nIP sect to be able to create security.\n\n1193\n00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:58,770\nBecause L2TP by itself, does not\nhave built in native encryption and\n\n1194\n00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:01,650\nor any authentication\nmechanisms to speak up, so\n\n1195\n00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:05,880\nit sends that in a tunnel but it doesn't\ndo anything to encrypt the data or\n\n1196\n00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,770\nreally authenticate\nthe endpoints in of itself.\n\n1197\n00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:11,650\nAnd so we often talk about L2TP\nbeing implemented with IPsec.\n\n1198\n00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,500\nSo that's important to be aware of.\n\n1199\n00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,870\n>> That was one of the big selling points\nfor L2TP because PPTP, let me just add it\n\n1200\n00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:19,460\nhere, I don't know how important this is,\nbut it used to use MPPE.\n\n1201\n00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,440\n>> Right,\nMicrosoft Point-to-Point encryption.\n\n1202\n00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:27,900\n>> And with that one, I don't think I\never knew what that actually stood for.\n\n1203\n00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,330\nMicrosoft Point-to-Point Encryption,\nMPPE was pretty weak,\n\n1204\n00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:34,905\nbecause it was built around\nthe US encryption export laws.\n\n1205\n00:58:34,905 --> 00:58:38,423\nAnd so we have this silly law here that\nsays if you're a US company, you create\n\n1206\n00:58:38,423 --> 00:58:41,425\nsome kind of encryption software, if\nyou're gonna sell it to other countries or\n\n1207\n00:58:41,425 --> 00:58:45,655\nrelease it to other countries, you have\nto limit it to, I believe it's 40 bits.\n\n1208\n00:58:45,655 --> 00:58:47,990\nIs it 40 bits of encryption strength?\n\n1209\n00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:48,560\n>> Something small, yeah.\n\n1210\n00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:52,852\n>> So, whatever that limit is, it's\nlow and MPPE fell within that rule, so\n\n1211\n00:58:52,852 --> 00:58:55,360\nit was not a very strong encryption level.\n\n1212\n00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:00,550\nSo you'll see a lot of people don't want\nto use PPTP anymore because of that,\n\n1213\n00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,690\nand so\nwe start looking to other alternatives.\n\n1214\n00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:04,900\nSince L2TP uses IPsec,\n\n1215\n00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,330\nobviously you get a lot of control\nover what you choose for encryption.\n\n1216\n00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:10,550\nAnd you can pick something\nsignificantly higher.\n\n1217\n00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:13,971\nIn fact, I think you're pretty much forced\nto pick something higher than MPPE.\n\n1218\n00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:18,227\n>> You are, AES,or DES, triple DES\nsomething like that, the MD algorithms for\n\n1219\n00:59:18,227 --> 00:59:21,235\nhashing and\nauthentication is there as well.\n\n1220\n00:59:21,235 --> 00:59:22,790\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We have much more robust\n\n1221\n00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,430\nsecurity built in.\n\n1222\n00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,990\nIt's funny, though, because if you\nthink about the fact that yes,\n\n1223\n00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:28,570\nwe have to meet the export laws.\n\n1224\n00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:31,990\nAnd the driving force behind that was\nbasically that the US government, right,\n\n1225\n00:59:31,990 --> 00:59:36,110\nwanted encryption that was low enough\nthat obviously as we now well know\n\n1226\n00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:39,740\nthey could easily read with\nlittle to no difficulty.\n\n1227\n00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:44,300\nAnd so as a result of that, you get these\nolder technologies that really were\n\n1228\n00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:48,430\ncrafted in such a way, that they could do,\nand we know now that, through\n\n1229\n00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:51,600\nsome of the leaks that we've heard, that\nthis kind of stuff was going on for years.\n\n1230\n00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,800\nAnd they basically did this in order to\nbe able to effectively snoop on traffic\n\n1231\n00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,730\nas it moved through\nthe wires around the world.\n\n1232\n00:59:56,730 --> 00:59:59,630\nAnd they continue to, they just have\nbetter toys now and as a result,\n\n1233\n00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:03,490\nthey can use stronger encryption cuz we\nstill can break it at the end of the day.\n\n1234\n01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:06,540\nAll right, so that kind of takes\nus to the first part of VPNs,\n\n1235\n01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:10,500\nI know we still have IPsec and SSL,\nwanted to quickly talk about those,\n\n1236\n01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,830\nbut maybe do a deeper dive on IPsec.\n\n1237\n01:00:12,830 --> 01:00:16,284\nSo, maybe when we come back we can start\nin and just really pick up there and\n\n1238\n01:00:16,284 --> 01:00:17,582\nthen continue on.\n\n1239\n01:00:17,582 --> 01:00:19,370\n>> All right, well lets stop here and\ntake a break.\n\n1240\n01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:21,530\nWhen we come back we've got IPsec and\nother excitement.\n\n1241\n01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:23,913\nStay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n1242\n01:00:23,913 --> 01:00:31,004\n[MUSIC]\n\n1243\n01:00:31,004 --> 01:00:32,790\n>> Food and coffee.\n\n1244\n01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,450\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n1245\n01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:38,800\nWe're discussing what it's gonna take to\nmake it through the rest of this episode,\n\n1246\n01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,030\nand Adam's operating in\na coffee deficit right now.\n\n1247\n01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:45,765\nYes, feed me, feed me Seymour.\n\n1248\n01:00:45,765 --> 01:00:49,010\n>> All right, well let's get back into it,\nwe left off on IPsec, right?\n\n1249\n01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:49,550\n>> We did, we did.\n\n1250\n01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:50,876\n>> So let's jump back into that.\n\n1251\n01:00:50,876 --> 01:00:53,390\n>> So we're gonna just continue\nto talk a little bit about it and\n\n1252\n01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:56,530\nwhat I thought would be good was\nto drill down a little bit and\n\n1253\n01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:58,870\nactually walk through,\nlooking at IPsec live.\n\n1254\n01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:05,160\nSo Mike is gonna bring up the Microsoft\nManagement console or the, did I say Mike?\n\n1255\n01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,425\nDon is gonna bring up\nthe Microsoft Management console.\n\n1256\n01:01:07,425 --> 01:01:08,194\n>> [LAUGH] I'm Mike 2.0, remember?\n\n1257\n01:01:08,194 --> 01:01:09,900\n>> You're Mike 2.0, that's right.\n\n1258\n01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,410\nDon of the network and Mike 2.0.\n\n1259\n01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:17,130\nAnd so, what we're gonna do is just\nwalk you through what's setting up or\n\n1260\n01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:21,870\nat least looking at the configuration of\nIPsec on a Microsoft machine would be.\n\n1261\n01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:26,680\nSo we just wanna point out that we created\nan MMC, a blank management console, and\n\n1262\n01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,870\nthen loaded the IPsec\nmanagement interface here.\n\n1263\n01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:31,820\nThat's how Don got to this area.\n\n1264\n01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:36,459\nAnd then, what we did is, he just went\nahead and created a default solution here.\n\n1265\n01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:41,440\nWe're gonna look at the default\nresponse solution for IP filtering.\n\n1266\n01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,170\nSo we'll highlight and drill in and\nwe'll just go in and edit.\n\n1267\n01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:46,840\nSo it's selected,\nwe're just gonna go in and edit there.\n\n1268\n01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,452\nWhat we can see is we have Security\nMethods and Authentication Methods.\n\n1269\n01:01:50,452 --> 01:01:55,986\nRemember IPsec is gonna bring to the party\nfor us with L2TP, this idea of security.\n\n1270\n01:01:55,986 --> 01:01:59,024\nSo this is gonna be the confidentiality\narea with encryption and\n\n1271\n01:01:59,024 --> 01:02:02,961\nthen authentication, which we'll get to\nin a minute, will be the authentication\n\n1272\n01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:06,055\nheaders, and that will be actually\nwhere we create integrity and\n\n1273\n01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,630\nfigure out how we're gonna do integrity.\n\n1274\n01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:12,530\nSo on the security area,\nwe have the ability there to either\n\n1275\n01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:16,190\nuse the default encryption solution,\nwhich you'll see is triple des.\n\n1276\n01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:19,510\nor we can go ahead and create a custom\none, so let's highlight that one, and\n\n1277\n01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:22,280\nlet's just edit the default,\nthe triple DES.\n\n1278\n01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,443\nAnd so what we see there is security\nmethod can be set up to do both\n\n1279\n01:02:25,443 --> 01:02:27,307\nintegrity and encryption, right.\n\n1280\n01:02:27,307 --> 01:02:30,994\nSo we can do both together, we could do\nintegrity only, or we could do custom and\n\n1281\n01:02:30,994 --> 01:02:32,820\nwe can then go in and specify settings.\n\n1282\n01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:37,455\nSo let's do that, let's go in, and under\nhere what we then are able to do is you'll\n\n1283\n01:02:37,455 --> 01:02:40,860\nsee, Data and\naddress integrity without encryption.\n\n1284\n01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:43,090\nSo basically,\njust integrity with no encryption.\n\n1285\n01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:46,540\nAnd then we have a pull down on\nthe algorithm pick list there.\n\n1286\n01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:47,640\nWe have MD5 and SHA1.\n\n1287\n01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,655\nProbably a good place to remind you\nguys that when we do these algorithms,\n\n1288\n01:02:51,655 --> 01:02:55,865\nwe use these algorithms and we do them\nwith hashing to create the integrity for\n\n1289\n01:02:55,865 --> 01:02:57,836\nthe data, we get fixed bit output.\n\n1290\n01:02:57,836 --> 01:03:03,338\nAnd we get 128 bits for\nMD5, we get 160 for SHA1.\n\n1291\n01:03:03,338 --> 01:03:05,440\nSo we just wanna make sure\nwe're thinking about that.\n\n1292\n01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,390\nWe'll pick that whole conversation,\nthat whole thought process up again\n\n1293\n01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:11,180\nin a future conversation in\nour cryptography area and\n\n1294\n01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:13,910\ntalk all about that and\nspend a lot of time on that.\n\n1295\n01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:16,892\nData integrity and\nencryption together, what we call ESP,\n\n1296\n01:03:16,892 --> 01:03:18,650\nencapsulating security payload.\n\n1297\n01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:21,640\nYou'll see the integrity algorithms,\nthey're still there, but\n\n1298\n01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:24,320\nyou'll also see that we have\nour encryption algorithms.\n\n1299\n01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,223\nWe have DES or triple DES, so,\n\n1300\n01:03:26,223 --> 01:03:31,420\nthe other thing to remember here with\nDES and triple DES is algorithms, right.\n\n1301\n01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:33,486\nData encryption standards\nwith algorithm or\n\n1302\n01:03:33,486 --> 01:03:36,180\nrather with the name of\nDES is gonna represent.\n\n1303\n01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:40,080\nAnd when we think about DES and triple\nDES, we're thinking about using DES and\n\n1304\n01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,260\nmultiplying the bit string by three.\n\n1305\n01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:45,250\nThere's also something called double DES\nwhich is just multiplying it by two.\n\n1306\n01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:49,608\nAnd so when we take that bit strength and\nmultiply it out 56 bits and\n\n1307\n01:03:49,608 --> 01:03:52,591\nthen we multiply it out for\nDES individually,\n\n1308\n01:03:52,591 --> 01:03:57,504\n56 bits then we multiply that by 3 we\nget 168 bits when we do triple DES.\n\n1309\n01:03:57,504 --> 01:04:00,272\nAnd so, pretty strong,\neven by today's standards.\n\n1310\n01:04:00,272 --> 01:04:04,758\nBut is being replaced because DES has been\nproven to be based on the mathematics and\n\n1311\n01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:09,308\nthe computing power available to us to be\nvulnerable to people actually decrypting\n\n1312\n01:04:09,308 --> 01:04:10,101\nit over time.\n\n1313\n01:04:10,101 --> 01:04:13,190\nAnd so we've moved away from DES recently.\n\n1314\n01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:17,230\nWe're now seeing AES, the new\nAdvanced Encryption Standard that is\n\n1315\n01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:20,510\nbeing used over the last several years,\nkind of made its way out.\n\n1316\n01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:23,740\nAnd AES is kind of replacing\na lot of this today.\n\n1317\n01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:26,102\nBut DES and\nTriple DES are still being used in IPsec.\n\n1318\n01:04:26,102 --> 01:04:27,940\nAnd it's the standard it was set up for.\n\n1319\n01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:31,610\nAnd notice we can set up session keys\nthere, and generate keys every so\n\n1320\n01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:33,930\nmany kilobytes and/or every so\nmany seconds.\n\n1321\n01:04:33,930 --> 01:04:38,180\nWe have an option there, time and/or\ndata volume to generate keys with.\n\n1322\n01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:41,500\nImportant to be generating new\nkeys on a consistent basis.\n\n1323\n01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:45,970\nBecause if somebody were able to get the\nexisting key, and we kept using the key\n\n1324\n01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:49,500\nover and over and over again, they would\nbreak the encryption on all of our data.\n\n1325\n01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,760\nSo this effectively randomizes\nthe cycling of the key\n\n1326\n01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,730\nbased on a value we put in here.\n\n1327\n01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:56,450\nSo many kilobytes generated.\n\n1328\n01:04:56,450 --> 01:04:57,745\nSo many seconds.\n\n1329\n01:04:57,745 --> 01:05:01,240\nAnd what'll happen is we then generate\nnew session encryption keys for this,\n\n1330\n01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:03,090\nevery time we go through and do that.\n\n1331\n01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:05,990\nSo this is how we would\nset up the security.\n\n1332\n01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:08,640\nThe authentication, if you just\nwanna cancel out of that one, Don.\n\n1333\n01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,510\nI think we can get out of that one.\n\n1334\n01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:13,210\nWe can go and go to the,\njust the authentication method.\n\n1335\n01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:16,135\nJust take a look there, let's edit that.\n\n1336\n01:05:16,135 --> 01:05:18,560\nLet's just zoom in because\nwe have an option here.\n\n1337\n01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,690\nSo we will see that we can use,\n\n1338\n01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:25,500\nand by default as it says there, we will\nuse Kerberos, the Kerberos V5 protocol.\n\n1339\n01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:28,100\nSo this is in a Microsoft world,\nso it's the active directory.\n\n1340\n01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:31,910\nBut remember, more generically,\nany LDAP provider will provide that.\n\n1341\n01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,730\nAnd we can use Kerberos with that.\n\n1342\n01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,360\nWe can use digital identity\nwith certificates.\n\n1343\n01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:38,510\nA CA, a certificate of authority,\ncan be listed,\n\n1344\n01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,800\nto be able to bring in a certificate.\n\n1345\n01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,660\nOr we can use what's known as a string,\n\n1346\n01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:44,610\nwhich is effectively\njust a pre-shared key.\n\n1347\n01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:49,780\nIt's a randomized character string of some\nkind, whatever that will be, that we use\n\n1348\n01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:53,300\nwhen it has to be known by both parties\nwho have to program the key on both sides.\n\n1349\n01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,800\nThe sender and the receiver,\nin effect, have to have that key.\n\n1350\n01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,300\nThat's why it's called pre-shared, cuz\nboth people have to know it ahead of time.\n\n1351\n01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:02,950\nAnd if that's plugged in, then we have\nto use that to validate or authenticate\n\n1352\n01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:07,930\nthat we really are connecting to somebody\nthat we want to be able to talk to.\n\n1353\n01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:09,765\nThis is my pre-shared key, right?\n\n1354\n01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:11,450\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This is my password.\n\n1355\n01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:12,420\n>> Right.\n\n1356\n01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:13,540\n>> So that's what we could do there.\n\n1357\n01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:16,490\nAnd then, we would send that to the other\nside, set up the connection there.\n\n1358\n01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:18,060\nAnd then we would add that in.\n\n1359\n01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:20,640\nSo this is how we would\nset up authentication.\n\n1360\n01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,376\nAnd you can see there\nthat this is my password,\n\n1361\n01:06:22,376 --> 01:06:24,880\nit's now a pre-shared\nkey that Don has chosen.\n\n1362\n01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,390\nSo when we talk about IPsec,\nwe talk about these two distinct parts,\n\n1363\n01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:32,340\nwe talk about the encapsulating security\npayload, which is the encryption piece.\n\n1364\n01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:36,750\nWe talk about the authentication headers,\nthe Which is the authentication piece,\n\n1365\n01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:41,300\ndone individually or together and set up\nand then specified for this connection.\n\n1366\n01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:43,860\nNow, IPsec can be optional or\nmandatory, right?\n\n1367\n01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,020\nOr not at all, actually.\n\n1368\n01:06:45,020 --> 01:06:48,800\nSo three different ways of doing this,\nbut if we say we want to use best effort,\n\n1369\n01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,530\nthen we're gonna try to match\nusing IPsec if it's possible, but\n\n1370\n01:06:52,530 --> 01:06:57,080\nwe will allow non-IPsec protected\nconnectivity to take place.\n\n1371\n01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,570\nIf we are mandating, right?\n\n1372\n01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:02,010\nMaking it mandatory, then we will drop\nany connection that does not use IPsec.\n\n1373\n01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:04,604\nSo we have that option as well.\n\n1374\n01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:07,330\n>> And you can be really\nfine-grained with this stuff too,\n\n1375\n01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:10,430\nbecause if you set your computer,\nyou say, all right I want to be secure,\n\n1376\n01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:13,820\nso I’m gonna require IPSec for\neverything, right?\n\n1377\n01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:17,238\nBut what's going to happen the first\ntime you try to browse to Amazon.com?\n\n1378\n01:07:17,238 --> 01:07:20,620\nThey’re not gonna have the authentication\ninformation to authenticate with you or\n\n1379\n01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,000\nto build up that session.\n\n1380\n01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,690\nAnd so when you create these policies,\na lot of times you'll attach a filter\n\n1381\n01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:28,120\nto it that,\nhere I just have this dynamic list, right?\n\n1382\n01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,310\nBut I might create additional lists\nthat say, if I'm talking to an IP\n\n1383\n01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:35,360\non my local subnet, yes,\nrequire IPsec, ensure it's encrypted.\n\n1384\n01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:39,620\nBut if I'm talking to somebody out on the\nInternet, don't use IPsec, or request it,\n\n1385\n01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:40,560\nbut don't require it.\n\n1386\n01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,740\nSo you've got tons of\nflexibility in there, and\n\n1387\n01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:46,470\nit all just comes down to what\nyour operating system supports.\n\n1388\n01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:48,180\n>> Right, very,\nvery important point to make.\n\n1389\n01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:52,300\nAnd so the other thing to consider here\nwith IPsec is that we use it in one of two\n\n1390\n01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:55,220\nmodes, or it can be used,\nin effect, in one of two modes.\n\n1391\n01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:59,120\nWe have it in either what's called\ntunnel mode or transport mode.\n\n1392\n01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:02,510\nAnd so we wanna make sure we just quickly\nunderstand the difference between the two.\n\n1393\n01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:07,650\nThe idea here would be that,\nwhen we set up tunnel mode, we often\n\n1394\n01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:11,800\ntraditionally think of this as tunneling\nbetween end points, between routers.\n\n1395\n01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,930\nSo we tunnel on the WAN, right,\nwe transport on the LAN,\n\n1396\n01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:16,460\nis what we often say.\n\n1397\n01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:20,246\nAnd so we use transport mode when\nwe are moving between a endpoint,\n\n1398\n01:08:20,246 --> 01:08:23,720\nlike a workstation,\nup to the LAN side of the router.\n\n1399\n01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:25,816\nThen we will tunnel WAN to WAN.\n\n1400\n01:08:25,816 --> 01:08:30,645\nSo router WAN endpoint\nto router WAN endpoint.\n\n1401\n01:08:30,645 --> 01:08:31,592\nAnd so as a result,\n\n1402\n01:08:31,592 --> 01:08:35,630\nwe see tunnel mode only being implemented\nbetween WAN level endpoints, right?\n\n1403\n01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:39,040\nTypically routers as those endpoints, or\nmaybe a firewall as we move through, and\n\n1404\n01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,900\nthen how our architecture is set up.\n\n1405\n01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:43,210\nSo just understand that and\nhopefully remember that.\n\n1406\n01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:44,930\nRight?\nWe transport on the LAN,\n\n1407\n01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:46,420\nwe tunnel on the WAN.\n\n1408\n01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:50,840\nThat is the phrase, or turn of phrase,\nyou often hear around IPsec.\n\n1409\n01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,680\nAll right, very good, so we've kind\nof covered all those protocols and\n\n1410\n01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:54,650\nall those ways of doing things.\n\n1411\n01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:58,020\nLet's maybe go back to our hit list real\nquick, clean up, add a couple of things in\n\n1412\n01:08:58,020 --> 01:09:01,230\nthere, and then we should be good,\nI think, to be able to move on.\n\n1413\n01:09:01,230 --> 01:09:04,420\nSo with IPSec we want to make sure\nthat we obviously are aware that we\n\n1414\n01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:07,850\ncan handle multiple VPN\nconnections simultaneously here.\n\n1415\n01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:13,650\nWe do see that we are able\nto provide both encryption\n\n1416\n01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:17,350\nas well as authentication, so we do both.\n\n1417\n01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,863\nThis is limited to IP-based networks only,\nright?\n\n1418\n01:09:23,863 --> 01:09:25,584\nHence, Internet protocol IP, right?\n\n1419\n01:09:25,584 --> 01:09:29,840\nSo Internet, rather, link,\nlet me try that again.\n\n1420\n01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,870\nIt is limited to IP based networks.\n\n1421\n01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:33,660\nRight.\nGotta\n\n1422\n01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:36,620\nget all the synapses firing in\nthe right way at the same time there.\n\n1423\n01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,844\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1424\n01:09:37,844 --> 01:09:42,654\nAnd this, because it is focused on IP,\nis focusing on the network layer, or\n\n1425\n01:09:42,654 --> 01:09:44,320\nlayer 3 of the OSI model.\n\n1426\n01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,510\nWant to just make that distinction for\nyou there as well.\n\n1427\n01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:48,920\nSo, Layer 3 of the OSI model.\n\n1428\n01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:52,340\nAll right, very good, or the mode.\n\n1429\n01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,338\nLayer 3 of the OSI mode.\n\n1430\n01:09:53,338 --> 01:09:54,743\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Model.\n\n1431\n01:09:54,743 --> 01:09:56,670\nAll right, so SSL, right?\n\n1432\n01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:58,920\nSSL, we have Secure Socket Layer.\n\n1433\n01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:02,368\nThis is gonna work at the transport layer,\nso\n\n1434\n01:10:02,368 --> 01:10:07,198\nthis is gonna be at the fourth layer,\nLayer 4 of the OSI model.\n\n1435\n01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:10,318\nAnd this is really focused\nprimarily on web traffic, right,\n\n1436\n01:10:10,318 --> 01:10:14,110\nwe really see SSL being used across\nthe web, this is really where we see it.\n\n1437\n01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:19,020\nIt is going to be where we put in and use\nthis extra layer of security on our web\n\n1438\n01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:22,780\ntraffic to be able to protect\na very small amount of traffic.\n\n1439\n01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:24,360\nJust focused, really, on the web, but\n\n1440\n01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,570\nis used to create this secure\nadditional layer for us\n\n1441\n01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:32,380\nthat we then can use to safely safeguard,\nto safely send and receive information and\n\n1442\n01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:35,390\ndo so with the proper amount of\nsecurity and focus on the web.\n\n1443\n01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:39,110\nThink about how you do things today\nwhere you are implementing pretty much\n\n1444\n01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,650\nany secure online transaction.\n\n1445\n01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:47,010\nPaying your bills, surfing the web,\nusing some sort of secure website,\n\n1446\n01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:48,710\nwhatever it is,\nlogging into see your mail.\n\n1447\n01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:51,140\nWhatever you do on the web\nthat requires security.\n\n1448\n01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:55,780\nSSL is going to be sitting at the heart of\nthat transaction and be used in some way.\n\n1449\n01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:59,200\nThere may be other overlays, there may\nbe other things going on with that.\n\n1450\n01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,900\nBut SSL is really that underlying\narchitectural element that\n\n1451\n01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,870\nprovides most of that security today.\n\n1452\n01:11:03,870 --> 01:11:05,620\nRight.\n>> And some vendors have taken that and\n\n1453\n01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:07,690\nrun with it and\nturned it into a more full solution.\n\n1454\n01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:11,579\nSo you'll see like, F5 with their\nFirePasses or Cisco with AnyConnect,\n\n1455\n01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:15,899\nOpenVPN, where they'll actually let you\ntunnel all of your traffic through SSL,\n\n1456\n01:11:15,899 --> 01:11:18,690\nusing it as if it were like IPsec,\nor whatever.\n\n1457\n01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:21,776\nIt's not as flexible as the other ones,\nbut it does make it a little easier for\n\n1458\n01:11:21,776 --> 01:11:24,165\nclient setup, so\nyou will see that stuff from time to time.\n\n1459\n01:11:24,165 --> 01:11:26,905\n>> And we wanna make,\nnow that's actually a really good point,\n\n1460\n01:11:26,905 --> 01:11:30,542\nI'm glad you brought that up because we\nkid around sometimes about hey users, and\n\n1461\n01:11:30,542 --> 01:11:32,040\nthe whole security thing.\n\n1462\n01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:34,720\nIf we didn't have them\nwe'd have nothing to do.\n\n1463\n01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,200\nAnd all that's true, don't get me wrong.\n\n1464\n01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,809\nBut at the end of the day, Don raises\na very, very important point, which is,\n\n1465\n01:11:39,809 --> 01:11:43,494\nsome of this stuff can be fairly complex\nand complicated to set up and to manage.\n\n1466\n01:11:43,494 --> 01:11:46,356\nAnd one of the things we\noften focus on is the CISSP.\n\n1467\n01:11:46,356 --> 01:11:48,573\nIt's really this idea of\nspreading awareness, right?\n\n1468\n01:11:48,573 --> 01:11:50,640\nAnd being able to understand\nthat we have to push.\n\n1469\n01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,273\nThe users and\neverybody that's under our charge, so\n\n1470\n01:11:53,273 --> 01:11:55,622\nto speak,\npeople that we are responsible for.\n\n1471\n01:11:55,622 --> 01:11:58,785\nMaking sure they they\nunderstand how to be as good as\n\n1472\n01:11:58,785 --> 01:12:02,410\nthey can possibly be within\nour networks at being secure.\n\n1473\n01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:06,311\nAnd so, if we make things transparent and\nwe make things easier to approach,\n\n1474\n01:12:06,311 --> 01:12:10,214\nwe create these new and innovative\nsolutions that use existing technology,\n\n1475\n01:12:10,214 --> 01:12:13,934\nrock solid, really good, and make it\nmore usable for the end user without\n\n1476\n01:12:13,934 --> 01:12:17,840\nthe headache or the concern of being\nvery complicated makes it easier.\n\n1477\n01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,830\nOur jobs ultimately become easier\nbecause they will be more secure and\n\n1478\n01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:23,150\nwe'll have better systems.\n\n1479\n01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:26,470\nAnd so this is really important as\na thought process for you as well.\n\n1480\n01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:28,740\nSo I'm glad you brought that up,\nit's actually really good.\n\n1481\n01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:31,283\nYou could take a cookie out of petty cash.\n\n1482\n01:12:31,283 --> 01:12:33,245\n[CROSSTALK] You get a gold star.\n\n1483\n01:12:33,245 --> 01:12:34,850\nGold star for you.\n\n1484\n01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:36,790\nAll right, so authentication protocols.\n\n1485\n01:12:36,790 --> 01:12:38,169\nLet's continue our discussion here.\n\n1486\n01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:43,280\nSo you can see we've listed out some of\nthe more common authentication protocols.\n\n1487\n01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:44,710\nPassword Authentication Protocol.\n\n1488\n01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:45,330\nPAP.\n\n1489\n01:12:45,330 --> 01:12:46,570\nAn oldie but a goodie.\n\n1490\n01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:47,860\nRight?\nReally not used anymore.\n\n1491\n01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:49,720\nPasswords were sent in the clear.\n\n1492\n01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:52,240\nIt does not say password\nencryption protocol.\n\n1493\n01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:54,130\nThe focus is on authentication.\n\n1494\n01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:56,110\nSo PAP really not very secure at all.\n\n1495\n01:12:56,110 --> 01:13:00,360\nWe're really just using it to authenticate\nover the old style PPP connections.\n\n1496\n01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,400\nThat's where we would see PAP being used.\n\n1497\n01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,340\nChallenge Handshake Authentication\nProtocol we call CHAP.\n\n1498\n01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,800\nCHAP is different and\ndistinct from Microsoft CHAP.\n\n1499\n01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:13,060\nCHAP is the globally recognized\nstandard protocol, and then Microsoft\n\n1500\n01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:17,610\nimplements their own version of that by\nmodifying that and creates MS CHAP and or\n\n1501\n01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:23,100\nMS CHAP V2, the newer version of that so\nwe often hear confusion around that.\n\n1502\n01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:27,230\nOh isn't that kind of the thing Microsoft\ndoes, isn't it the same, well kind of but\n\n1503\n01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:30,290\nCHAP came before MS CHAP,\nlet's just be clear about that.\n\n1504\n01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:34,330\nSo the challenge hand shake authentication\nprotocol, what this does is this basically\n\n1505\n01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:37,420\nsends some sort of a challenge\nyou have to respond to.\n\n1506\n01:13:37,420 --> 01:13:41,010\nSo in effect we don't send a password,\nwhat we do is we send a challenge,\n\n1507\n01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:43,370\nwe have a challenge response\nmechanism between client and\n\n1508\n01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:46,019\nserver that allows us\nto validate who we are.\n\n1509\n01:13:47,150 --> 01:13:48,720\nSo please be aware of that.\n\n1510\n01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,290\nWe use this again for\nauthentication purposes.\n\n1511\n01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:55,000\nWould've been used, or could've been used,\nto cross PPP as well, but\n\n1512\n01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,750\nwas going to because we didn't\nsend the password in the clear.\n\n1513\n01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:00,480\nBut rather a hash of the password or\nsome sort of challenge.\n\n1514\n01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,320\nWe were not exposing it,\nwith seeing this being more secure.\n\n1515\n01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,630\nSo, please be aware of that.\n\n1516\n01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:08,450\nMicrosoft CHAP implements CHAP\nwithin the Microsoft world.\n\n1517\n01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:09,870\nThese days, it is MS-CHAP V2.\n\n1518\n01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:12,390\nNewer, more secure, and more robust.\n\n1519\n01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:16,000\nAnd then Extensible Authentication\nProtocol, which is known as EAP.\n\n1520\n01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,390\nThis allows us to be able to bring in\nalternate authentication mechanisms,\n\n1521\n01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:24,310\nnewer technologies so I mentioned and\nwe listed a couple there for\n\n1522\n01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:28,215\nyou, lightweight EAP or\nLEAP to use with some wireless solutions.\n\n1523\n01:14:28,215 --> 01:14:30,935\nEAP-TLS, transport layer security.\n\n1524\n01:14:30,935 --> 01:14:35,605\nEAP-IKE2, these were different solutions\nor different things that are being used.\n\n1525\n01:14:35,605 --> 01:14:39,800\nEAP-TLS brings in digital\ncertificate based authentication so\n\n1526\n01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,510\nwe can see the advent of\ndigital certificates there.\n\n1527\n01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:46,380\nEAPI 2 is used for the mutual key\nexchange and session key exchange.\n\n1528\n01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:48,160\nIt's under Setup with IPsec.\n\n1529\n01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:51,900\nWe'll take a look at that and talk more\nabout that in our cryptography section.\n\n1530\n01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,620\nBut this is used basically symmetric and\n\n1531\n01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:56,990\nasymmetric key exchanges\nacross secure environments.\n\n1532\n01:14:56,990 --> 01:15:00,590\nSo EAP is really just basically\nextending authentication\n\n1533\n01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:01,790\nto include newer technologies.\n\n1534\n01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:05,070\nThat's really what we're\nseeing there as it grows.\n\n1535\n01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:06,880\nAll right.\nSo again, put that in context.\n\n1536\n01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,330\nWrite a whole laundry list\nof things we have to do.\n\n1537\n01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:13,205\nWhere did we spend some time drilling\ndown on you, or drilling down for you?\n\n1538\n01:15:13,205 --> 01:15:15,510\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Drilling down on top of you.\n\n1539\n01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:20,160\nWhere did we spend some time with you\nwalking through a demo, explaining some\n\n1540\n01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:24,180\nthings, spending three or four or\nfive minutes going deep into an area.\n\n1541\n01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:26,110\nThat was within IPsec, right?\n\n1542\n01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:29,200\nWhere do we spend just a few minutes,\nvery high-level discussion\n\n1543\n01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,850\nof what protocols are and maybe just\nnoting one or two items around them.\n\n1544\n01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:34,180\nThat was the list we just went through.\n\n1545\n01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:37,950\nSo have that right balance to be clear on\nthe kind of focus you want to bring onto\n\n1546\n01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:40,880\nthe table as your working through\nthis amount of material, right.\n\n1547\n01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:44,630\nSo let's talk a bit about wireless and\nwireless technologies.\n\n1548\n01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:49,120\nWe have what are we called spread spectrum\ntechnology that is used in wireless.\n\n1549\n01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:51,420\nWe also have something called\nmultiplexing technology.\n\n1550\n01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:54,740\nKind of two different\napproaches to how we do this.\n\n1551\n01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:58,340\nAnd so, in the spread spectrum\narea we have two types.\n\n1552\n01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:02,710\nWe have frequency hopping and\ndirect sequencing or direct sequence.\n\n1553\n01:16:02,710 --> 01:16:07,020\nIn multiplexing we have Orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing.\n\n1554\n01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:09,550\nSo let's quickly just highlight\nsome of the key takeaways or\n\n1555\n01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:10,950\npoints here for these.\n\n1556\n01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:15,950\nAnd so when we have an FHSS or frequency\n\n1557\n01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:19,730\nhopping solution we basically are gonna\ntake the total amount of bandwidth which\n\n1558\n01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:24,950\nwe refer to as spectrum, and we're going\nto split that into smaller sub channels.\n\n1559\n01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:26,830\nThis is what frequency hopping does.\n\n1560\n01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:31,256\nI don't know if you remember back\nmany many years ago probably.\n\n1561\n01:16:31,256 --> 01:16:32,830\nOh I don't know, I was in my teens,\n\n1562\n01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:35,190\nthis was probably over 30\nsomething years ago now.\n\n1563\n01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:36,050\n>> 100, 200 years ago.\n\n1564\n01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:41,365\n>> Yeah back when dinosaurs roamed\nthe planet and all that kind of stuff.\n\n1565\n01:16:41,365 --> 01:16:46,160\nBut back in the in the early to\nmid 80s all the rage were these\n\n1566\n01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:49,450\nSony cordless phones so I don't know if\nyou remember the multi channel phones.\n\n1567\n01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:52,775\nThey were really expensive for\nhome use, so analogue phones, right,\n\n1568\n01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:57,700\nwere all the rage, we talked about the\nrotary dial phones at one point, right,\n\n1569\n01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:01,190\nso we had moved passed that but now you\nhad these cordless wireless phones.\n\n1570\n01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:05,200\nAnd so this was all the rage, and Sony\nput out like, the hand set at the time.\n\n1571\n01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:05,850\nAnd so you went out,\n\n1572\n01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:08,790\nthese were a couple of hundred dollars\nback then, they were very expensive.\n\n1573\n01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:13,480\nAnd you would get them, and they had\nthe base, and they had the big hand set.\n\n1574\n01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:16,060\nRight?\nAnd they had the channel selector on\n\n1575\n01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:18,540\nthe kind of faceplate and\nyou could hit a button and\n\n1576\n01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:21,020\nit would randomly go through\nthe red dots and select.\n\n1577\n01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:24,960\nIt would frequency hop and select\nthe best channel that was available for\n\n1578\n01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,240\nsignal strength at the time.\n\n1579\n01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:29,470\nI think there were ten at that point and\nso you would constantly,\n\n1580\n01:17:29,470 --> 01:17:30,570\nif you're sitting and\nlistening really good,\n\n1581\n01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:33,560\nyou could hit the button and play channel\nroulette, that's what we used to call it.\n\n1582\n01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:36,370\nBut, it's basically frequency hopping,\nand it would just\n\n1583\n01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:40,090\njump to whichever channel was strongest\nat the time, and the ten channels or\n\n1584\n01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:43,510\nwhatever it had split the bandwidth up\ninto, or the spectrum in this case.\n\n1585\n01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:45,795\nSo that's what frequency hopping is.\n\n1586\n01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:51,350\nWhereas Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum,\nthe other option here,\n\n1587\n01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:56,350\nthis is going to go ahead and we're\ngoing to apply sub bits to a message.\n\n1588\n01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:58,490\nSo we're basically gonna\napply a little tag or\n\n1589\n01:17:58,490 --> 01:18:03,480\na sub-bit that is going to then be\nused to generate this kind of offset.\n\n1590\n01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:05,290\nAnd so we could take a look at this, and\n\n1591\n01:18:05,290 --> 01:18:09,760\nas a result of that we're basically then\ngoing to packetize and break up the data\n\n1592\n01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,490\nand then reassemble it on the other side\nusing these little tags or sub bits.\n\n1593\n01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,960\nAnd so we're gonna sequence the data,\nin effect.\n\n1594\n01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,830\nThis is almost like what we do with IP\nwhere we fragment IP traffic, right?\n\n1595\n01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:23,030\nAnd then we're able to put a tag,\na fragment offset as we call it,\n\n1596\n01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:24,566\nin the header on every packet.\n\n1597\n01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:26,805\nAnd we reassemble it on the other side.\n\n1598\n01:18:26,805 --> 01:18:30,665\nIt's like getting the Ikea instructions\nfor your furniture, right, and\n\n1599\n01:18:30,665 --> 01:18:31,625\nputting it together.\n\n1600\n01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:33,365\nSo this is what it should look like.\n\n1601\n01:18:33,365 --> 01:18:35,065\nNow here's all the pieces, right?\n\n1602\n01:18:35,065 --> 01:18:37,670\nLet's make sure we go by number and\nbuild it all together.\n\n1603\n01:18:37,670 --> 01:18:41,660\nSo direct sequencing is really just going\nto be able to go through and create this.\n\n1604\n01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:44,940\nNow the sub-bits are referred to as chips.\n\n1605\n01:18:44,940 --> 01:18:46,960\nThis is what we call them.\n\n1606\n01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,340\nAnd the sequencing of how we\nactually put the bits together\n\n1607\n01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,240\nis referred to as the chip code.\n\n1608\n01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:56,530\nRemember that program\nChips back in the 70s?\n\n1609\n01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:57,550\n>> Erik Estrada.\n\n1610\n01:18:57,550 --> 01:18:58,290\nYeah.\nYeah.\n\n1611\n01:18:58,290 --> 01:18:59,020\n>> Yeah.\n\n1612\n01:18:59,020 --> 01:19:01,370\nSo this is called the chip code or\nchipping code.\n\n1613\n01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:03,380\nSometimes referred to\nas the chipping code.\n\n1614\n01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:06,660\nSo the chip code or chipping code\nis what that sequencing is called.\n\n1615\n01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:12,750\nAll right, so we have that chipping\ncode is often referred to that way.\n\n1616\n01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:15,270\nAll right, and\nthen multiplexing technology, so\n\n1617\n01:19:15,270 --> 01:19:19,720\nour orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing, OFDM.\n\n1618\n01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:23,050\nSo, this is gonna be a digital\nmulticarrier solution.\n\n1619\n01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:24,220\nSo we're using this, and\n\n1620\n01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:29,040\nwhat we are doing is basically compacting\nall of these channels together into and\n\n1621\n01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,700\nkind of shrinking them down and\nreducing the bandwidth.\n\n1622\n01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:35,747\nAnd so this is almost like the garbage\ncompactor for digital transmission.\n\n1623\n01:19:35,747 --> 01:19:40,978\nWe're bundling and really kinda squeezing\ntogether, making very small, where\n\n1624\n01:19:40,978 --> 01:19:46,354\nthings might have been much bigger before,\nand so we are then going to, as a result,\n\n1625\n01:19:46,354 --> 01:19:51,841\nnarrowly manage that channel bandwidth In\neffect that's what we're really doing.\n\n1626\n01:19:51,841 --> 01:19:54,064\nWe have our three technologies there.\n\n1627\n01:19:54,064 --> 01:19:58,530\nThree items that fall into\ntwo technology categories.\n\n1628\n01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:03,360\nWe have our FHSS, DSSS, and\n\n1629\n01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:08,270\nwe have our OFDM, Orthogonal\nFrequency Ddivision Multiplexing.\n\n1630\n01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:11,300\nSo these are gonna be different\nkinds of technologies that are found\n\n1631\n01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:12,270\nin wireless solutions.\n\n1632\n01:20:13,570 --> 01:20:16,390\nSo then, speaking of wireless,\nwe have different components for wireless.\n\n1633\n01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:20,590\nWe have access points, what we call WAPs,\nWireless Access Points.\n\n1634\n01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:21,970\nAre these can take many forms right?\n\n1635\n01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:25,690\nThey may be something you go and buy,\nkind of at a base level as a consumer.\n\n1636\n01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:27,080\nVery, very simplistic.\n\n1637\n01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,800\nYou may have a more robust\none that are used for\n\n1638\n01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:34,170\nbusinesses so some of the Meraki gear for\ninstance on the Cisco side today,\n\n1639\n01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:37,570\nwireless Cloud based\nsolutions are being used.\n\n1640\n01:20:37,570 --> 01:20:38,920\nThese are more enterprise grade.\n\n1641\n01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:43,250\nCan handle hundreds maybe thousands of\naggregated access requests simultaneously.\n\n1642\n01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,900\nSo you can scale up and\nscale out at different levels.\n\n1643\n01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:51,160\nYou wanna go into the magical\ncloset of networking goodness and\n\n1644\n01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,930\npull out a wireless access point.\n\n1645\n01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:53,840\nDo we have one of those?\n\n1646\n01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:54,510\n>> I definitely could.\n\n1647\n01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:55,194\nActually, don't we have one sitting there?\n\n1648\n01:20:55,194 --> 01:20:56,715\nNo I don't see it.\n>> We may have one.\n\n1649\n01:20:56,715 --> 01:20:58,430\nI see a switch there.\n\n1650\n01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:00,040\n>> I know we had a stack of Cisco ones.\n\n1651\n01:21:00,040 --> 01:21:02,335\nLet me go on an adventure-\n>> You want to maybe go on a quick hunt?\n\n1652\n01:21:02,335 --> 01:21:03,238\n>> And I'm sure I can grab one.\n\n1653\n01:21:03,238 --> 01:21:05,640\nOkay, yeah let's do that real quick.\n\n1654\n01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,102\nSo we'll just keep talking.\n\n1655\n01:21:07,102 --> 01:21:12,230\nDon's gonna go to the toy box and\nsee what we can provide for us.\n\n1656\n01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:15,990\nSo we have access points, writing them,\nwe'll show you one here in a minute.\n\n1657\n01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:16,990\nYou may have one at home.\n\n1658\n01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:18,800\nYou probably do if you're using wireless.\n\n1659\n01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,540\nYou might have it as a wireless router or\nsome sort of wireless end point device\n\n1660\n01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:24,540\nthat you bought where it\ndoes multiple things.\n\n1661\n01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:29,080\nIt's not just a strict access point but\nit aggregates bandwidth up for you and\n\n1662\n01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:36,070\nbrings in ISP based connection from your\ncable, modem, whatever they give you.\n\n1663\n01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:38,990\nAnd then, it's gonna have wireless\ncapability even as a router,\n\n1664\n01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:40,330\nin a firewall, in all sorts of stuff.\n\n1665\n01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:42,390\nSo you've got a whole\nbunch of different things.\n\n1666\n01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:45,140\nWe may have the SSID or have the SSID.\n\n1667\n01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:49,700\nThe SSID is gonna be the unique identifier\nthat the wireless access point broadcasts\n\n1668\n01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,440\nout in order to be able to\nmake it available to us.\n\n1669\n01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:58,230\nSo when we go into wireless and\nwe see oh, this is itprotv.wireless or\n\n1670\n01:21:58,230 --> 01:22:01,240\nwhatever it is for\nthe wireless access point in the studio.\n\n1671\n01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:05,570\nWe're then able to find it based\non the SSID, the service set ID,\n\n1672\n01:22:05,570 --> 01:22:08,130\nwhich is what SSID represents.\n\n1673\n01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:09,970\nSo when we deal with these components,\n\n1674\n01:22:09,970 --> 01:22:12,340\nwe're dealing with the building\nblocks of wireless.\n\n1675\n01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:14,770\nAnd so oh, very good, so\nwe have some presents here.\n\n1676\n01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:17,390\nAnd so\nwhat we'll do is just quickly take a look.\n\n1677\n01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:22,076\nAnd so we have whoops, just with all of\nour gear here we wanna make sure we don't\n\n1678\n01:22:22,076 --> 01:22:24,363\npull anything off the podium as we go.\n\n1679\n01:22:24,363 --> 01:22:25,342\n>> Yeah, let's get-\n>> So\n\n1680\n01:22:25,342 --> 01:22:26,334\nwe'll give you that, there we go-\n>> That power cable over there.\n\n1681\n01:22:26,334 --> 01:22:27,190\n>> Perfect, all right.\n\n1682\n01:22:27,190 --> 01:22:30,550\nSo I'm gonna give you the heavier of\nthe two, cuz I'm feeling weak for\n\n1683\n01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:32,230\nthe lack of caffeine here.\n\n1684\n01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:34,090\nBut what we have is two different models,\nright?\n\n1685\n01:22:34,090 --> 01:22:37,260\nAnd so we'll kind of hold this up and\nyou can see.\n\n1686\n01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:38,700\nSo this is a Linksys.\n\n1687\n01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:41,530\nGot the standard little\nantennas that you can use here.\n\n1688\n01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:44,475\nAlso really god for video games.\n\n1689\n01:22:44,475 --> 01:22:46,050\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Little console there, but\n\n1690\n01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:49,450\nthis is going to be\na Wireless G Broadband Router.\n\n1691\n01:22:49,450 --> 01:22:54,590\nSo it's a 2.4 gigahertz 802.11\ng solution with speed boost.\n\n1692\n01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,730\nAnd so what we have on the back of this,\nis we have just some connection points.\n\n1693\n01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:02,590\nYou can see RJ45 connectors\non the back of that.\n\n1694\n01:23:02,590 --> 01:23:06,030\nSo we have some LAN connections there,\nin the block of four.\n\n1695\n01:23:06,030 --> 01:23:09,550\nProbably a WAN connection that\nwill go over here, on this side,\n\n1696\n01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:10,930\nwe bring that in from the ISP.\n\n1697\n01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:12,400\nA little reset button cuz\n\n1698\n01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,230\nyou'll never need that-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1699\n01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:14,530\n>> With these devices.\n\n1700\n01:23:14,530 --> 01:23:18,730\nBut very, very basic and\nwe can direct the antennas to kinda\n\n1701\n01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:22,820\nfocus out the bandwidth and\nkind of focus the signal there.\n\n1702\n01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:24,020\n>> Now that one is a home-\n>> A home.\n\n1703\n01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:26,840\n>> Or a small office, and they're\ncombo devices in smaller home office.\n\n1704\n01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,550\nThat one's a router/switch/access point.\n\n1705\n01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:33,140\nBut in a enterprise environment,\nyou need dedicated equipment, and\n\n1706\n01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:33,800\nthat's what this is.\n\n1707\n01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:36,400\nThis is a dedicated wireless access point.\n\n1708\n01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:37,450\nIt is not a router.\n\n1709\n01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:40,580\nIt is not a switch,\nit is just an access point.\n\n1710\n01:23:40,580 --> 01:23:43,930\nAnd as a result it's able to handle\nmore simultaneous connections.\n\n1711\n01:23:43,930 --> 01:23:45,980\nA few big differences you'll notice.\n\n1712\n01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:48,700\nFirst off, there's only,\nwell you see two ports.\n\n1713\n01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,650\nBut one is a network jack,\nand one is a console port.\n\n1714\n01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:54,770\nSo there's really just one network jack,\none way in, one way out of this thing.\n\n1715\n01:23:54,770 --> 01:23:56,045\nTwo men enter, one man leaves.\n\n1716\n01:23:56,045 --> 01:23:56,920\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n1717\n01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,282\nyou'll also notice that\nthere's no antennas on it.\n\n1718\n01:23:59,282 --> 01:24:04,440\nInstead, they're covered up with these\nannoyingly difficult to remove connectors.\n\n1719\n01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:08,610\nYou'll see there's these screw connectors\nthat look like RF cable type connectors.\n\n1720\n01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:12,660\nAnd basically, you buy the appropriate\nantennas to attach it because you might\n\n1721\n01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:14,690\nhave ones that mount into a ceiling tile.\n\n1722\n01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:18,320\nThey might be exterior antennas,\nomnidirectional, unidirectional.\n\n1723\n01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,850\nAll sorts of different antennas to choose.\n\n1724\n01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:21,080\n>> Yogi, let's talk to Yogi end.\n\n1725\n01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,766\n>> The yogi's,\n[CROSSTALK] all sorts of stuff.\n\n1726\n01:24:23,766 --> 01:24:25,510\nDepending on what your environment.\n\n1727\n01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:27,910\nThese are designed to be very flexible and\n\n1728\n01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:32,060\nhandle larger connections, so\nconsiderably more expensive.\n\n1729\n01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:36,680\nThis one, the one you showed\nAdam is maybe $40 at Best Buy.\n\n1730\n01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:40,401\nThese are normally like, $800,\n$1200, a lot of money, but\n\n1731\n01:24:40,401 --> 01:24:44,072\nit's because it's giving you that\nenterprise level connectivity.\n\n1732\n01:24:44,072 --> 01:24:44,730\n>> Okay, it's very good.\n\n1733\n01:24:44,730 --> 01:24:46,780\nSo that's actually a very\ngood comparison for us.\n\n1734\n01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:47,300\nSee?\n\n1735\n01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:51,570\nSo thank you for bringing the two\nlittle show and tell items here.\n\n1736\n01:24:51,570 --> 01:24:53,465\n>> From the ITProTV computer junkyard.\n\n1737\n01:24:53,465 --> 01:24:54,140\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yes,\n\n1738\n01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:59,030\nthe graveyard of IT that we have sitting\noff the camera, you don't see here.\n\n1739\n01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:02,190\nAll right, so we were talking a little bit\nabout or just continuing to talk through\n\n1740\n01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:04,500\nthese ideas, so\nit's just some of the components.\n\n1741\n01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:08,420\nObviously, you have wireless access cards\nin your devices that are connecting up\n\n1742\n01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:12,310\nto these variety of different ones there,\nwhatever it may be.\n\n1743\n01:25:12,310 --> 01:25:15,370\nIt's not just computers today that\nare using these wireless solutions.\n\n1744\n01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:17,140\nWe have all sorts of end points.\n\n1745\n01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:20,710\nYour car may have some sort of\ncomputer capability built into it,\n\n1746\n01:25:20,710 --> 01:25:24,260\nmaybe accessed wirelessly today, for\nmaintenance and things like that.\n\n1747\n01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:27,190\nCertainly devices like watches,\nand those fitbands,\n\n1748\n01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:30,310\nand all that kind of stuff,\nwirelessly accessed and available.\n\n1749\n01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:33,315\nSo variety of technology items out there.\n\n1750\n01:25:33,315 --> 01:25:35,930\nYour toaster ovens and\nyour coffee pots as well.\n\n1751\n01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:39,645\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So when we talk about security with\n\n1752\n01:25:39,645 --> 01:25:43,940\nwireless, we talk about this idea of\nseveral protocol iterations there.\n\n1753\n01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:47,280\nWe have WEP, that oldie but\na goodie that everybody loves and uses.\n\n1754\n01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,665\nAnd you should all obviously\nbe aware of WEP hopefully.\n\n1755\n01:25:49,665 --> 01:25:51,821\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And know that it is really not for\n\n1756\n01:25:51,821 --> 01:25:54,390\nuse in production environments anymore.\n\n1757\n01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:55,600\nIt has been broken.\n\n1758\n01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,700\nIt is considered to be\nan unsecure protocol but\n\n1759\n01:25:57,700 --> 01:25:59,970\nit was part of the 802.11\nstandard early on.\n\n1760\n01:25:59,970 --> 01:26:03,860\nIt was kind of our first swipe, our first\ntake at wireless based security, and so\n\n1761\n01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:05,440\nwe want to just be aware of that.\n\n1762\n01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,640\nWe kind of tried to replace WEP and\nupgrade it.\n\n1763\n01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,420\nMake it a little bit better\nwith something known as TKIP.\n\n1764\n01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:14,120\nAnd TKIP, Temporal Key Integrity Protocol,\n\n1765\n01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:17,540\nwas gonna deal with one of the main\nissues with why WEP was broken,\n\n1766\n01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:20,660\nwhich was the weakness of the key\nspace and the reuse of keys.\n\n1767\n01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:22,872\nThe key space is\nthe overall number of keys.\n\n1768\n01:26:22,872 --> 01:26:25,360\nThat potential available\nbased on variables.\n\n1769\n01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:29,320\nAs you run through the algorithm, how many\niterations can you get that are unique?\n\n1770\n01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:34,050\nAnd so TKIP was feeding in key material,\ntrying to expand that key size and\n\n1771\n01:26:34,050 --> 01:26:36,640\nmake it or key space,\nrather and make it get bigger?\n\n1772\n01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:38,220\nThe problem was that ultimately though,\n\n1773\n01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:41,600\nwe were still limited by the overall\narchitecture that was used.\n\n1774\n01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,810\nThe algorithms that were\nbeing implemented within WEP.\n\n1775\n01:26:43,810 --> 01:26:46,970\nThe architecture of the system itself,\nin such a way that it still really,\n\n1776\n01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:50,430\nit was like putting a Band-Aid\non a bleeding wound.\n\n1777\n01:26:50,430 --> 01:26:52,850\nIt stopped the hemorrhaging for\na little bit there, but\n\n1778\n01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:55,140\nultimately we still bled out.\n\n1779\n01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:57,640\nSo this didn't really work very well, and\n\n1780\n01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:00,210\nultimately we kind of move away\nfrom that whole thought process.\n\n1781\n01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:01,830\nBut it was a patch in time, and\n\n1782\n01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:05,070\nmade WEP more secure until we could\ncome up with something better.\n\n1783\n01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:09,480\nAnd that something better was\nultimately WPA, and then WPA2.\n\n1784\n01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,752\nWe see a change in standards\nalong the way, so 802.1x and\n\n1785\n01:27:11,752 --> 01:27:17,000\n802.11i kind of come out and create\nsome new standards for us along the way,\n\n1786\n01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,100\nbut Wi-Fi Protected Access,\nWPA, excuse me, and WPA2.\n\n1787\n01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:27,110\nUltimately, bring more to the party in\nthe sense that they allow us to step us,\n\n1788\n01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:28,850\nso to speak, and\ncreate a different approach.\n\n1789\n01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:31,090\nSo let's quickly talk about what this is.\n\n1790\n01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:35,745\nSo on the WPA side, we use the 802.1x\nstandard for access control.\n\n1791\n01:27:35,745 --> 01:27:37,911\nSo this is where we see\nthat standard coming in.\n\n1792\n01:27:37,911 --> 01:27:41,005\n802.1x, there you go, or pre-shared key.\n\n1793\n01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:42,323\nWe can actually use either one.\n\n1794\n01:27:42,323 --> 01:27:45,208\nSo typically we use the pre-shared\nkey a lot of the times and\n\n1795\n01:27:45,208 --> 01:27:48,441\nwe set it up where it's just point\nto point within the network, but\n\n1796\n01:27:48,441 --> 01:27:50,309\nwe could use 802.1x either one.\n\n1797\n01:27:50,309 --> 01:27:53,650\nPSK, pre-shared key, I assume right?\n\n1798\n01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:54,900\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1799\n01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,760\nFor authentication underneath WPA,\n\n1800\n01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:01,700\nwe are going to be using EAP,\nExtensible Authentication Protocol.\n\n1801\n01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:02,230\nAll right.\n\n1802\n01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:04,010\nSo, EAP will be used there.\n\n1803\n01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:10,470\nRemember we talked about WPA and\nWPA2, it uses both.\n\n1804\n01:28:10,470 --> 01:28:11,530\nEAP will be in both.\n\n1805\n01:28:13,650 --> 01:28:14,710\nI was just gonna do 802.\n\n1806\n01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:18,355\nI was gonna do WPA first if you wanted,\njust to keep it consistent.\n\n1807\n01:28:18,355 --> 01:28:19,130\n>> Yeah.\n>> If that's okay.\n\n1808\n01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:21,060\nAll right.\nSo we're doing EAP there for\n\n1809\n01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:22,370\nauthentication.\n\n1810\n01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:29,390\nAnd then for encryption, for WPA we're\ndoing TKIP and we use RC4, specifically,\n\n1811\n01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:34,410\nso we are using TKIP with RC4,\nthat is going to be what we use there.\n\n1812\n01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:38,785\nAnd then for integrity,\nwe are using something known as MIC.\n\n1813\n01:28:38,785 --> 01:28:41,030\nM-I-C, MIC, is what is used.\n\n1814\n01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:44,470\nThat's for integrity with WPA.\n\n1815\n01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:49,330\nAnd then for WPA2 we're going to use\nthe 802.1x standard preshared keys,\n\n1816\n01:28:49,330 --> 01:28:51,490\nso you might just wanna quickly copy that.\n\n1817\n01:28:51,490 --> 01:28:54,580\nWe're using EAP for\nthe authentication method.\n\n1818\n01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:56,410\nThe real difference is\ngonna be the last two.\n\n1819\n01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:59,680\nInstead of TKIP and\nMIC we're gonna use something else.\n\n1820\n01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:05,620\nSo with encryption we're going to use\nwhat is known as AES Countermode.\n\n1821\n01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:08,730\nSo we're seeing the advent of\nthat new authentication and\n\n1822\n01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:11,760\nnew encryption mechanisms that\nwe started to talk about.\n\n1823\n01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,590\nSO AES Countermode will be used for,\nno, this is for encryption, I'm sorry.\n\n1824\n01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:17,250\nFor encryption, right?\n\n1825\n01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:24,723\nAnd then for authentication we are going\nto use what's known as AES CBC-MAC.\n\n1826\n01:29:24,723 --> 01:29:28,310\nAES CBC change block MAC.\n\n1827\n01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:29,620\nRight?\nSo we are gonna be using that.\n\n1828\n01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:34,420\nAll right.\nSo this is what we are using there for\n\n1829\n01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:35,990\nencryption and for integrity.\n\n1830\n01:29:35,990 --> 01:29:40,110\nSo this lays out for us at a high level\nwhat the difference between WPA and\n\n1831\n01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:44,400\nWPA2 is as we kind of step up and\ncreate more secure solutions.\n\n1832\n01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,780\nRemember WPA was better than WEP.\n\n1833\n01:29:46,780 --> 01:29:51,370\nBetter than TKIP with WEP, but\nultimately using TKIP with RC4 was good.\n\n1834\n01:29:51,370 --> 01:29:55,630\nBut again the RC series, some of them\nhave become susceptible to cracking and\n\n1835\n01:29:55,630 --> 01:29:57,655\nso we move up to WPA2 and\n\n1836\n01:29:57,655 --> 01:30:03,185\nimplement AES because it is now considered\nto be the standard for encryption.\n\n1837\n01:30:03,185 --> 01:30:04,245\nThe government is using it.\n\n1838\n01:30:04,245 --> 01:30:07,735\nIt's being widely deployed to\nreplace things like DES and\n\n1839\n01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:10,067\ntriple DES because it is\nconsidered much more secure.\n\n1840\n01:30:10,067 --> 01:30:11,947\nSo that means that the NSA has the keys,\n\n1841\n01:30:11,947 --> 01:30:13,776\nbut they haven't said anything yet-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1842\n01:30:13,776 --> 01:30:15,220\n>> As opposed to all the other ones.\n\n1843\n01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:16,097\nAll right, very good.\n\n1844\n01:30:16,097 --> 01:30:20,057\nSo we've gotten to another good place for\nus to take a small breather,\n\n1845\n01:30:20,057 --> 01:30:24,570\ngive you guys a small break to catch\nyour breath as well and then come back.\n\n1846\n01:30:24,570 --> 01:30:27,200\nI think we're going to have one more\nepisode where we're going to come back and\n\n1847\n01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:27,950\nfinish up.\n\n1848\n01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:29,460\nWhat do we have potentially coming up?\n\n1849\n01:30:29,460 --> 01:30:31,060\nI think it's some\nwireless standards there.\n\n1850\n01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:34,430\n>> Got to cover the standards,\nand then mobile wireless, right?\n\n1851\n01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:35,240\nCellular wireless.\n\n1852\n01:30:35,240 --> 01:30:35,910\nReally good stuff.\n\n1853\n01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:36,420\n>> Okay, very good.\nSo\n\n1854\n01:30:36,420 --> 01:30:38,710\nwe've got some additional\ninteresting things to think about.\n\n1855\n01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:41,400\nHope you'll come back and\njoin us for those in a few minutes.\n\n1856\n01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,100\nUntil then, we'll take a small break and\nwe'll see you soon.\n\n1857\n01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:48,210\n>> [INAUDIBLE].\n[SOUND] All right,\n\n1858\n01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:53,605\nwelcome back everybody.\n\n1859\n01:30:53,605 --> 01:30:56,810\nSo we left off talking a little\nbit about wireless security.\n\n1860\n01:30:56,810 --> 01:31:00,610\nNow we're gonna jump into some of the\nunderlying wireless infrastructure itself.\n\n1861\n01:31:00,610 --> 01:31:02,590\nAnd boy this is my favorite part, Adam.\n\n1862\n01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:05,813\nThis is were we we start\ngoing to the IEEE standards.\n\n1863\n01:31:05,813 --> 01:31:06,981\nThis is where the fun happens.\n\n1864\n01:31:06,981 --> 01:31:08,688\n>> [NOISE]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1865\n01:31:08,688 --> 01:31:10,681\n>> Awesome.\n\n1866\n01:31:10,681 --> 01:31:11,270\nAwesome.\n\n1867\n01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:14,300\nAll right, so let's get back\nto what we were talking about.\n\n1868\n01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:17,514\nSo Don mentioned were gonna talk\nabout some IEEE standards and so\n\n1869\n01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:21,681\njust a quick word about IEEE, right, you\nmay again as a security professional, or\n\n1870\n01:31:21,681 --> 01:31:25,787\nmay not have some exposure to standards,\nthey are gonna be one of the underlying,\n\n1871\n01:31:25,787 --> 01:31:28,700\nunderpinning things that\nwe do need to be aware of.\n\n1872\n01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:31,820\nThe standards in this area, the wireless\nstandards that we're talking about\n\n1873\n01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:36,160\nare gonna take a variety of different\napproaches to bandwidth, and\n\n1874\n01:31:36,160 --> 01:31:39,350\nwhat frequency that we're gonna use,\nor spectrum we're gonna use.\n\n1875\n01:31:39,350 --> 01:31:42,750\nAnd we'll walk through those, but if you\nhaven't ever been to the IEEE website,\n\n1876\n01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:45,200\nit's probably worth your time\nto quickly go out there.\n\n1877\n01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:45,878\nRight?\n\n1878\n01:31:45,878 --> 01:31:49,130\nIEEE.org, I believe, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n1879\n01:31:49,130 --> 01:31:52,270\nOf course, there is the possibility I\ncould be, but there we are, IEEE.org.\n\n1880\n01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:57,060\nThey are going to produce a wide\nvariety of standards across many,\n\n1881\n01:31:57,060 --> 01:31:58,780\nmany areas for different things.\n\n1882\n01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:01,510\nIt's not just the little slice of\nwhat we're gonna take a look at here.\n\n1883\n01:32:01,510 --> 01:32:03,950\nBut it would be worth your time\nto poke around a little bit,\n\n1884\n01:32:03,950 --> 01:32:07,570\nmaybe get familiar with, or\nat least understand the role of the IEEE.\n\n1885\n01:32:07,570 --> 01:32:12,100\nWhat it does, they host events, they put\non workshops, they have publications.\n\n1886\n01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:16,580\nSo, it's worth your time as a CISSP\ncandidate, as a security professional,\n\n1887\n01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:19,750\nto become more aware of these kinds\nof bodies and what they represent.\n\n1888\n01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:22,850\nSo just a little word there, if you will.\n\n1889\n01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:26,420\nMaybe we'll put the URL in I guess\nthe notes maybe, just capture that.\n\n1890\n01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:27,900\n>> We can do that.\n>> So everybody has that.\n\n1891\n01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:32,290\nOkay so just so that we know\nwhere that is and what that is.\n\n1892\n01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:33,450\nThere we go, okay perfect.\n\n1893\n01:32:33,450 --> 01:32:35,970\nSo let’s talk about our\nwireless standards.\n\n1894\n01:32:35,970 --> 01:32:40,120\nSo 802.11a, 11b, 11g, 11n,\nnow these are the names or\n\n1895\n01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:44,690\nthe designations of the working\ngroups that actually are responsible\n\n1896\n01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:47,980\ninside of the IEEE for\nthe standards that are created for\n\n1897\n01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:50,860\nthese different types of\nwireless access solutions.\n\n1898\n01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:55,230\nSo, just be aware of the fact that the\ndesignation is actually the designation of\n\n1899\n01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:58,380\nthe working group that is in charge\nof this particular standard.\n\n1900\n01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:03,778\nSo the 802.11a standard is going to\nbe a five gigahertz spectrum for\n\n1901\n01:33:03,778 --> 01:33:08,914\nbandwidth and then, or for\ntransmission, and then 54 megabits for\n\n1902\n01:33:08,914 --> 01:33:14,063\nbandwidth is what the speed rating is for\n802.11a technology.\n\n1903\n01:33:14,063 --> 01:33:21,063\nAnd it uses OFDM, the orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing, as it's method.\n\n1904\n01:33:21,063 --> 01:33:26,103\n802.11b, Is gonna be a 2.4\ngigahertz spectrum transmitting\n\n1905\n01:33:26,103 --> 01:33:30,813\nat 11 megabits per second,\nusing direct sequencing, or DSSS.\n\n1906\n01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:35,733\n802.11g will be 2.4 gigahertz, so\nnotice that b and g are gonna be\n\n1907\n01:33:35,733 --> 01:33:40,980\ntransmitting on the same spectrum but\nnotice that B and G use different speeds.\n\n1908\n01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:44,897\nG will transmit at 54 megabits and\n\n1909\n01:33:44,897 --> 01:33:49,605\nuses OFDM as opposed\nto DSSS as its method.\n\n1910\n01:33:49,605 --> 01:33:53,160\nAnd then 802.11n is going\nto be at the 5 gigahertz\n\n1911\n01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,450\nspectrum up to 100 megabits of bandwidth.\n\n1912\n01:33:56,450 --> 01:34:01,960\nAnd uses what's called MIMO,\nor this is going to be in and\n\n1913\n01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:06,745\nout technology that we use to aggregate\nand basically consolidate the bandwidth\n\n1914\n01:34:06,745 --> 01:34:09,450\nover all the streams that are coming in,\nto be able to send and receive.\n\n1915\n01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:11,730\nSo MIMO technology.\n\n1916\n01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:16,450\nAll right, multiple in multiple\nout is what we refer to MIMO as.\n\n1917\n01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:17,856\n>> I don't think we've\nused that acronym yet.\n\n1918\n01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,314\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Maybe we haven't.\n\n1919\n01:34:19,314 --> 01:34:20,938\nYou're right.\nI was kinda thinking we had.\n\n1920\n01:34:20,938 --> 01:34:22,271\nSo I apologize.\n\n1921\n01:34:22,271 --> 01:34:27,730\nAnd then 802.15 is going to be,\nthere we go.\n\n1922\n01:34:27,730 --> 01:34:30,730\nI gotta focus my eyes when you do\nthat quickly up and down [LAUGH].\n\n1923\n01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:35,010\nSo 802.15 wireless personal\narea network so we cal WPANs.\n\n1924\n01:34:35,010 --> 01:34:37,810\nSo, things like bluetooth would\nfall into this category here.\n\n1925\n01:34:37,810 --> 01:34:40,760\nI had asked Don to put Bluesnarfing\nup there which is just one of\n\n1926\n01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:44,056\nthe attacks that we see potentially\naggregated against Bluetooth,\n\n1927\n01:34:44,056 --> 01:34:46,290\nso you just want to be aware of that.\n\n1928\n01:34:46,290 --> 01:34:48,580\nThat's when you will\npotentially go out and\n\n1929\n01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:51,640\nseek to borrow somebody's\nBluetooth capabilities there.\n\n1930\n01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:52,695\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1931\n01:34:52,695 --> 01:34:56,770\nBlue-jacking is also something\nthat may occur there as well.\n\n1932\n01:34:56,770 --> 01:34:59,063\nSo just something else to be aware of.\n\n1933\n01:34:59,063 --> 01:35:02,646\nIt's another one that we see\nsometimes in WPAN networks.\n\n1934\n01:35:02,646 --> 01:35:09,090\nSo then we have 802.16 WMAN wireless\nmetropolitan area networks.\n\n1935\n01:35:09,090 --> 01:35:11,120\nThis is being branded as WiMAX.\n\n1936\n01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:17,590\nThis is what we are kinda seeing or\nhearing as the marketing hype for\n\n1937\n01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:21,665\nthe name around what WMANS are going\nto be, but WiMAX is just basically\n\n1938\n01:35:21,665 --> 01:35:25,560\nWi-Fi that is going to be available\nthroughout metropolitan area networks.\n\n1939\n01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:29,280\nSo we're going to see cities wired up\nin effect with high speed access, and\n\n1940\n01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:31,440\nthat's what WiMAX is\nsupposed to represent.\n\n1941\n01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,425\nSo these are the standards that\nyou would want to be aware of.\n\n1942\n01:35:33,425 --> 01:35:36,056\nWe talked about 802.3 for ethernet, and\n\n1943\n01:35:36,056 --> 01:35:39,976\nsome of the others that have come up\nin some of our other discussions.\n\n1944\n01:35:39,976 --> 01:35:42,148\n802.5 for token ring for instance, right?\n\n1945\n01:35:42,148 --> 01:35:44,110\nSo those are also IEEE standards.\n\n1946\n01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:45,567\nThat you would want to be aware of.\n\n1947\n01:35:45,567 --> 01:35:46,776\nTaken together,\n\n1948\n01:35:46,776 --> 01:35:51,939\nthese are one of those areas where some\nflashcards may be of interest to you.\n\n1949\n01:35:51,939 --> 01:35:55,660\nJust be able to note down the bandwidth,\nright?\n\n1950\n01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:59,360\nThe spectrum, and\nthe method that is used to provide it, and\n\n1951\n01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:03,750\nthen have that quickly along with 802\ndot designation, whatever that may be.\n\n1952\n01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,240\nSo, just keep that in mind.\n\n1953\n01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:07,610\nBe thinking through that as you prepare,\nstudy through, and\n\n1954\n01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:09,880\nultimately master this material.\n\n1955\n01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:13,610\nWe have mobile wireless access methods,\nthat we want to make sure we talk about.\n\n1956\n01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:16,430\nMultiple access technologies,\nas they're referred to.\n\n1957\n01:36:16,430 --> 01:36:18,770\nSo we have four different types,\nas you can see there.\n\n1958\n01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:22,820\nWe've actually seen Orthogonal\nFrequency Division access already, but\n\n1959\n01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:24,340\nwe see it as Multiple Access here.\n\n1960\n01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:25,970\nSo OF DMA.\n\n1961\n01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:30,550\nWe also see code division multiple access,\nCDMA, time division multiple access.\n\n1962\n01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:33,120\nI thought it would be cool to go from the\nbottom up this time, instead of top down.\n\n1963\n01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:36,110\nJust change it up a little,\nkeep everybody on their toes.\n\n1964\n01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:40,280\nTime division multiple access and\nfrequency division multiple access.\n\n1965\n01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:42,080\nThese should sound\nsomewhat familiar to you,\n\n1966\n01:36:42,080 --> 01:36:46,100\nbecause there gonna be very similar to\nwhat we see on the wireless side for LANs.\n\n1967\n01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:49,340\nBut were just now talking about mobile\nwireless in effect cellular, right,\n\n1968\n01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:52,380\nwireless, what we think of it, and\nyou'll see down there mobile generations.\n\n1969\n01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:54,135\nWe'll go through those in just a minute.\n\n1970\n01:36:54,135 --> 01:36:57,425\nSo, let's talk about quickly kind of high\nlevel, what each of these things do.\n\n1971\n01:36:57,425 --> 01:37:02,025\nSo, FDMA, Frequency Division Multiple\nAccess here, the available frequency\n\n1972\n01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:05,950\nis divided into sub bands, much like\nwe saw with the wireless network.\n\n1973\n01:37:05,950 --> 01:37:08,720\nWe call these channels,\nthe subanswer is called channels.\n\n1974\n01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:13,010\nAnd channel is assigned, or one channel is\nassigned to each subscriber, each user.\n\n1975\n01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:14,870\nBasically, someone on their cell phone.\n\n1976\n01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:18,220\nSo, when you have an FDMA solution,\n\n1977\n01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:21,060\nyou basically are given a channel when\nyou connect and turn on your phone.\n\n1978\n01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:24,760\nAnd that's how you're transmitting and\nreceiving, or sending and receiving.\n\n1979\n01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:27,350\nA time division, multiple access or TDMA,\n\n1980\n01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:32,180\nwe take the radio frequency spectrum\nchannels, and divide them into time slots,\n\n1981\n01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:36,730\nas opposed to just channels that are\ndivided up with FDMA, and then at various\n\n1982\n01:37:36,730 --> 01:37:41,020\ntime periods, we can share the same\nchannel basically by time slicing.\n\n1983\n01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:44,730\nThis is much like the IRQ concept\nthat we see in plug and play, and\n\n1984\n01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:48,510\nmodern system today,\nwhere if you remember back in the day,\n\n1985\n01:37:48,510 --> 01:37:51,860\nwe used to have to go in and\nhard code IRQs and set them up.\n\n1986\n01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:54,970\nSo you would hard code your sound card,\nor something like that, right?\n\n1987\n01:37:54,970 --> 01:37:56,890\nMaybe channel two or whatever it was.\n\n1988\n01:37:56,890 --> 01:37:59,210\nBut you couldn't have two\ndevices share the same IRQ,\n\n1989\n01:37:59,210 --> 01:38:03,870\nthe same interrupt, in old Windows,\nor Wintel based systems.\n\n1990\n01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:05,690\nNow today, we use time slicing,\n\n1991\n01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:10,220\nin effect IRQ slicing, to be able to share\nthat same channel, that same interrupt.\n\n1992\n01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:11,810\nRight?\nSo devices are hooked up,\n\n1993\n01:38:11,810 --> 01:38:15,400\nwhen was the last time you had to go in,\nand actually put a device in manual, and\n\n1994\n01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:16,090\nput an IRQ in.\n\n1995\n01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:16,800\nBeen a long time.\n\n1996\n01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:18,460\n>> That's been a long time, right?\n\n1997\n01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:20,905\n>> That's an old school, an OG, right?\n\n1998\n01:38:20,905 --> 01:38:23,030\n[LAUGH] Original gangster kind of thing.\n\n1999\n01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:23,870\nAn IT gangster.\n\n2000\n01:38:23,870 --> 01:38:25,760\n>> That's what we can have for you.\n\n2001\n01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:26,680\n>> IT gangster.\n\n2002\n01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:31,320\nI mean Don The Don of the IT gangsters,\ninstead of the Don of the network, right?\n\n2003\n01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:35,310\nSo, we can see that that kind of thing\nhappens here, because we effectively slice\n\n2004\n01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:39,290\nup the channels, assign a time\nspecification to them, and as we're\n\n2005\n01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:42,740\nswapping in and out, you're basically able\nto access that channel almost on demand.\n\n2006\n01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:44,980\nThere's a small delay, but\nyou don't really realize that.\n\n2007\n01:38:44,980 --> 01:38:48,310\nSoftware in the phone, and the technology\nkind of overlays that for you, and so\n\n2008\n01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:51,240\nyou don't realize you may be buffered\nat a certain point, trying to get in,\n\n2009\n01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:54,250\ncertain amount of information is\nstored quickly, and then sent through\n\n2010\n01:38:54,250 --> 01:38:57,230\nthe channels when it's released by\nthe other phone, that kind of thing.\n\n2011\n01:38:57,230 --> 01:38:59,950\nSo you don't really see that, but\nthat's how we're doing it in effect.\n\n2012\n01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:03,820\nThat's the magic, the sleight of\nhand that goes on behind the scenes.\n\n2013\n01:39:03,820 --> 01:39:07,840\nCDMA, code division multiple access.\n\n2014\n01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:12,890\nThis is where we assign a unique code to\neach voice call, or data transmission, and\n\n2015\n01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:15,640\nthat basically identifies it\nuniquely from every other one.\n\n2016\n01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:20,000\nSo this would be much like a user inside\nof a directory, being assigned a UUID or\n\n2017\n01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,420\nsome sort of GUID ,and as a result, we\ncan then uniquely tag each transmission,\n\n2018\n01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:26,290\nbased on that particular identifier.\n\n2019\n01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:30,280\nMultiple transmissions simultaneously,\n\n2020\n01:39:30,280 --> 01:39:33,040\nand we just basically assign\na unique identifier to each one.\n\n2021\n01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:39,390\nJust trying to figure out\nhow I want to word this.\n\n2022\n01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,470\nOkay.\nThere we go.\n\n2023\n01:39:41,470 --> 01:39:42,710\nAlright, very good.\n\n2024\n01:39:42,710 --> 01:39:45,285\nAlright, and then OF,\ngotta scroll up just a little,\n\n2025\n01:39:45,285 --> 01:39:47,150\ncuz we're loosing the edge of that.\n\n2026\n01:39:47,150 --> 01:39:52,120\nSo LFDMA right, frequency division\nmultiple access,there we go.\n\n2027\n01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:55,860\nThis is just gonna be basically\na combination of FDM And\n\n2028\n01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:59,230\nTD, FDMA and TDMA combined together.\n\n2029\n01:39:59,230 --> 01:40:01,140\nSo we're going to combine\nthe best elements of both,\n\n2030\n01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:04,630\nin order to do\nthe Orthogonal Frequency Division.\n\n2031\n01:40:04,630 --> 01:40:06,240\nSo, that's what we come up with there.\n\n2032\n01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:08,750\nWe get, you know, basically a set\nof channels that are carved up, and\n\n2033\n01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:12,710\nthen we use time slicing in order to be\nable to access them effectively on demand.\n\n2034\n01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:14,668\nSo, it brings together the best\nof both worlds if you will,\n\n2035\n01:40:14,668 --> 01:40:16,510\nif you If you think of it that way.\n\n2036\n01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:18,740\nSo these are gonna be our\nmultiple access methods.\n\n2037\n01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:19,880\nRight?\nSo we have four of them.\n\n2038\n01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:22,110\nAgain, we want to make sure\nyou are comfortable with them.\n\n2039\n01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:23,530\nLet's talk about the mobile generations or\n\n2040\n01:40:23,530 --> 01:40:26,820\nthe Gens of cell technology\nthat we link these to.\n\n2041\n01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:30,419\nAnd we went ahead and we put them in\ncontext for you, and just kind of set\n\n2042\n01:40:30,419 --> 01:40:34,980\nthem up, and said in Gen One or Gen Two,\nthis is the access method you would see.\n\n2043\n01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:40,080\nSo 1g or 1st gen cell phone\ntechnology will be analog, right?\n\n2044\n01:40:41,390 --> 01:40:43,690\nFor mobile technology there.\n\n2045\n01:40:43,690 --> 01:40:48,090\nAnd we have FDMA that is being used, so\nyou remember 1st gen mobile technology?\n\n2046\n01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:50,890\nDo you remember like the old\nMotorola bricks, things like that?\n\n2047\n01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:53,970\n>> Yep the old gigantic Zack\non Saved by

have TVMA, that is being\nused there as the access method.\n\n2059\n01:41:22,190 --> 01:41:25,630\n3G which has recently been something\nthat we're moving away from.\n\n2060\n01:41:25,630 --> 01:41:28,160\nBut it's still fairly prevalent,\ndepending on where you are.\n\n2061\n01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:32,330\n>> Packet switched,\nwe use CDMA as the access method there.\n\n2062\n01:41:32,330 --> 01:41:35,880\n4G, or fourth generation technology,\nwhat is now most common,\n\n2063\n01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:38,800\nmost prevalent, depending on\nthe part of the world you're in.\n\n2064\n01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,160\nIt's pretty much ubiquitous\nin most places today.\n\n2065\n01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:43,280\nWe see packet switching taking place,\n\n2066\n01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:46,550\nwe have up to a giga bit in\ntheory in bandwidth access.\n\n2067\n01:41:46,550 --> 01:41:49,355\nI say in theory, because it really\ndepends on how the system is implemented.\n\n2068\n01:41:49,355 --> 01:41:52,640\nWhat your carrier chooses to do, and\nwether or not you're paying enough money\n\n2069\n01:41:52,640 --> 01:41:55,590\nfor them to give you that amount of\nbandwidth at the end of the day.\n\n2070\n01:41:55,590 --> 01:41:58,670\nBut the system itself, the architecture\nof it is designed to allow for\n\n2071\n01:41:58,670 --> 01:42:01,040\nup to a giga bit of bandwidth being\nprovisioned out to end point.\n\n2072\n01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:04,140\nSo just be aware of that next time\nyou talk to your cell carrier,\n\n2073\n01:42:04,140 --> 01:42:06,940\nsay what's with this crappy\nbandwidth you keep giving me, right?\n\n2074\n01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:08,820\nWhy can't I ever download anything, and\n\n2075\n01:42:08,820 --> 01:42:12,090\nOFDMA is what is used there\nas access method as well.\n\n2076\n01:42:13,390 --> 01:42:15,990\nSo this over all as we\nlook at the mobile area,\n\n2077\n01:42:15,990 --> 01:42:19,580\nwireless area, we take the access methods,\ncombine them with the generations,\n\n2078\n01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:23,160\nand understand how they come together,\ngives us the advents.\n\n2079\n01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:27,600\nThe advance of the technology, as we see\nit moving kind of gen to gen, right?\n\n2080\n01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,390\nSo these are cellular network, absolutely\ncorrect, very important to note that.\n\n2081\n01:42:31,390 --> 01:42:36,121\nThere is kind of an area there where we\nmay see, for instance, two and a half G,\n\n2082\n01:42:36,121 --> 01:42:41,070\nand 3.5 G where we're kind of\ntransitioning, but it's good enough for\n\n2083\n01:42:41,070 --> 01:42:44,530\nwhere you are, basically to kind of be\naware of that, and just think about that.\n\n2084\n01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:47,230\nLet's think about phone security,\nmobile phone security for a minute.\n\n2085\n01:42:47,230 --> 01:42:51,070\nWe talk a lot about best practices,\nand just talk about awareness and\n\n2086\n01:42:51,070 --> 01:42:52,080\nthings like that.\n\n2087\n01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,160\nCommon sense stuff, right?\n\n2088\n01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:54,740\nDon't leave your phone unlocked.\n\n2089\n01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:57,760\nLot of phones, modern phones, so that\nyou can have some sort of a pin key or\n\n2090\n01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:58,850\nmaybe a pass key.\n\n2091\n01:42:58,850 --> 01:43:00,730\nThat is a picture pass or\nsomething like that.\n\n2092\n01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:03,100\nSo you want to be make sure\nyou're aware of that, obviously.\n\n2093\n01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:04,270\nDon't leave it somewhere.\n\n2094\n01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:06,390\nDon't leave it laying around,\nand then get up and walk away.\n\n2095\n01:43:06,390 --> 01:43:07,890\nThere are people who will take it.\n\n2096\n01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:09,920\nIt's small enough,\npeople can quickly grab that.\n\n2097\n01:43:09,920 --> 01:43:11,250\nIt's not like a laptop.\n\n2098\n01:43:11,250 --> 01:43:13,980\nAnd the downside, there is that it's small\nenough that you can't really chain it to\n\n2099\n01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:15,630\nsomething to keep it secure either.\n\n2100\n01:43:15,630 --> 01:43:17,330\nSo you may want to be aware of that.\n\n2101\n01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:20,480\nYou want to obviously make sure that you\nmay, if you have the opportunity to,\n\n2102\n01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:21,798\nI know we've talked in the past.\n\n2103\n01:43:21,798 --> 01:43:24,330\nAbout you.know some phone\nsystems like Blackberry\n\n2104\n01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:25,830\nis the one that I carry for instance.\n\n2105\n01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:29,154\nThat it can use encryption, you know\nthe Blackberry is seen as being one of\n\n2106\n01:43:29,154 --> 01:43:31,524\nthe more secure cellular\nphones that are out there.\n\n2107\n01:43:31,524 --> 01:43:35,678\nIn terms of the operating system,\nit is compliant enough that it is used by\n\n2108\n01:43:35,678 --> 01:43:39,297\nthe military and by the government So\nthose kinds of solutions.\n\n2109\n01:43:39,297 --> 01:43:41,265\nYou heard about the new\nBlackphones that are coming out?\n\n2110\n01:43:41,265 --> 01:43:42,821\n>> I have, yeah, I have.\n\n2111\n01:43:42,821 --> 01:43:44,790\n>> That Boeing has one-\n>> A lot of attention.\n\n2112\n01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:48,214\n>> There's also one in the Czech Republic\nthat's been made that's separate\n\n2113\n01:43:48,214 --> 01:43:52,382\nfrom Boeing, but also it's basically\nreally, really self sufficient and secure.\n\n2114\n01:43:52,382 --> 01:43:53,915\nThe Blackphone that's\navailable commercially,\n\n2115\n01:43:53,915 --> 01:43:57,440\ncuz the Boeing Black Phones that\nare being talked about right now.\n\n2116\n01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,870\nIf you haven't heard about this or seen\nabout it, you may wanna Google about it.\n\n2117\n01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:04,280\nBoeing, as in Boeing the airline company,\nhas put out a Blackphone,\n\n2118\n01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:05,526\nthat's what it's called.\n\n2119\n01:44:05,526 --> 01:44:08,782\nAnd it is being designed specifically for\nthe military and for the US government and\n\n2120\n01:44:08,782 --> 01:44:11,871\nit is not available commercially, you\nwon't be able to get your hands on one.\n\n2121\n01:44:11,871 --> 01:44:15,639\nBut it will, aside from being\ntotally secure and locked down,\n\n2122\n01:44:15,639 --> 01:44:18,910\nuses a proprietary open\nsource operating system, and\n\n2123\n01:44:18,910 --> 01:44:23,790\nuses a inherently secure kernel and\neverything else, you can see it there.\n\n2124\n01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:27,260\nIt's designed to be tamper proof, and\nso if you try to crack open the handset,\n\n2125\n01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:31,500\nget at the internal electronics, in any\nway modify it, it actually self-destructs.\n\n2126\n01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:34,780\nSo it's the Mr.\nPhelp's smartphone, effectively.\n\n2127\n01:44:34,780 --> 01:44:36,630\nAnd then out beyond the Boeing one,\n\n2128\n01:44:36,630 --> 01:44:39,700\nthere's a model coming out of the Czech\nRepublic that's just generically called,\n\n2129\n01:44:39,700 --> 01:44:42,280\nthe Blackphone,\nthat is gonna have all these capabilities.\n\n2130\n01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:45,450\nBut it doesn't self-destruct,\nit's not quite wired up that way, so\n\n2131\n01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:48,560\nit doesn't blow up on you\nif you try to open it up.\n\n2132\n01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,400\nBut it is all the rage these days.\n\n2133\n01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:53,440\nIt seems to be where some of\nthe industry stuff is going.\n\n2134\n01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:55,290\nThis is just one little example of things,\n\n2135\n01:44:55,290 --> 01:44:58,825\nbut you're trying to figure out how we\nreally secure that small end point.\n\n2136\n01:44:58,825 --> 01:45:01,340\nBut implementing encryption is\ndefinitely gonna be something we wanna\n\n2137\n01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:03,090\nmake sure we do and we think about.\n\n2138\n01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:06,620\nWant to also just think more\nbroadly about awareness,\n\n2139\n01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:08,310\nand we come back to this idea time and\nagain.\n\n2140\n01:45:08,310 --> 01:45:09,560\nBut situational awareness.\n\n2141\n01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:12,920\nI often sit down in coffee shops,\nI'm in a plane, wherever I may be.\n\n2142\n01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,290\nAnd I hear people talking\nabout just the most\n\n2143\n01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:17,670\nincredible conversations on their phones.\n\n2144\n01:45:17,670 --> 01:45:19,320\nAnd it's not just that\nside of the conversation.\n\n2145\n01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:22,280\nBecause usually it's loud enough\nthat you hear the other person.\n\n2146\n01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:25,200\nEffectively if you, whether you want to or\nnot sometimes, right?\n\n2147\n01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,410\nIt's like a broadcast, you're hearing\nit whether you want it or not.\n\n2148\n01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:28,619\nYou probably are hearing bits and\n\n2149\n01:45:28,619 --> 01:45:30,702\npieces of the other person on\nthe other side of the phone.\n\n2150\n01:45:30,702 --> 01:45:34,991\nBut I hear corporate acquisitions,\nI hear about mergers,\n\n2151\n01:45:34,991 --> 01:45:37,837\nI hear about people's private lives.\n\n2152\n01:45:37,837 --> 01:45:40,875\nI hear about all sorts of crazy stuff\nwhen I'm just out in public randomly,\n\n2153\n01:45:40,875 --> 01:45:43,350\nbecause people don't think\nabout what goes on around them.\n\n2154\n01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:44,000\nThey think, well,\n\n2155\n01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,360\nI'm on the phone and so I'm just gonna\nhave my conversation, all right?\n\n2156\n01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:50,260\nOr they're wearing the earpieces,\nthe earbuds.\n\n2157\n01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:51,020\nAnd they got the mic.\n\n2158\n01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:52,110\nI love that one, right?\n\n2159\n01:45:52,110 --> 01:45:53,060\nAnd they're talking into the mic.\n\n2160\n01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:54,140\nSo they think they'll be cool.\n\n2161\n01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:55,535\nThey'll pull the mike up to their mouth.\n\n2162\n01:45:55,535 --> 01:45:57,220\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then they'll yell.\n\n2163\n01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:58,090\nSo they'll talk just as loud.\n\n2164\n01:45:58,090 --> 01:46:00,180\nBut they pull it up here so\nthey think nobody's gonna hear them.\n\n2165\n01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:00,720\nRight?\n\n2166\n01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:02,600\nSo you gotta think about this kinda stuff.\n\n2167\n01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:04,400\nRight?\nBecause this is the kinda thing\n\n2168\n01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,740\nthat gets people in trouble.\n\n2169\n01:46:05,740 --> 01:46:09,380\nPeople will be around you socially\nengineering that information away from you\n\n2170\n01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:10,880\nif you're not paying attention to it.\n\n2171\n01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:14,180\nSo you'll be thinking about that as\nwe think about mobile phones and\n\n2172\n01:46:14,180 --> 01:46:17,960\nkind of start to think about wrapping up\nour conversations in the network space.\n\n2173\n01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:18,700\nInstant messaging,\n\n2174\n01:46:18,700 --> 01:46:22,120\nanother good example of a place where\ncommon sense doesn't always prevail.\n\n2175\n01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:25,360\nWe think of it as texting,\nSMS texting today on cell phones.\n\n2176\n01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:28,490\nBut instant messaging more broadly\nacross the other computer.\n\n2177\n01:46:28,490 --> 01:46:31,280\nYou endpoint to endpoint\nwhatever it may be, again,\n\n2178\n01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:33,670\nwhat would you send out across a text.\n\n2179\n01:46:33,670 --> 01:46:34,670\nIs that appropriate?\n\n2180\n01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:36,950\nIs there information that\nshould not be exposed?\n\n2181\n01:46:36,950 --> 01:46:40,670\nIs somebody on the other side of\nthat divide able to see that text?\n\n2182\n01:46:40,670 --> 01:46:43,670\nIs that text being archived somewhere,\nthat instant message?\n\n2183\n01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:45,800\nIt's being archived in\nsome sort of system.\n\n2184\n01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:48,140\nSomebody's gotta potentially\ngot access to it.\n\n2185\n01:46:48,140 --> 01:46:51,120\nSo, are you sending things that probably\nshould not see the light of day?\n\n2186\n01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:54,970\nAnd we've seen, clearly based on Edward\nSnowden, the leaks that came out there.\n\n2187\n01:46:54,970 --> 01:46:58,000\nBut just more broadly this whole\nidea that's really come to form\n\n2188\n01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,440\nthe last couple years about\nthe fact that there are many,\n\n2189\n01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:04,350\nmany parties that touch this information\nthe minute it leaves your device.\n\n2190\n01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:08,800\nWhether it's the provider, who we\nknow now, clearly is keeping logs and\n\n2191\n01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:13,110\nrecords of this stuff, and may or may not\nbe compelled legally to provide them.\n\n2192\n01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:14,520\nRight?\nDepending on what country you're in and\n\n2193\n01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:15,420\nwhere you live.\n\n2194\n01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:18,510\nIf you have transborder flows\nwhere you're moving information\n\n2195\n01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:21,970\nfrom one entity to the other\nthere are different policies\n\n2196\n01:47:21,970 --> 01:47:25,030\nthat govern that information based on\nwhere it starts and where it ends.\n\n2197\n01:47:25,030 --> 01:47:27,560\nAnd where it ends up is\nthe policy you gotta worry about.\n\n2198\n01:47:27,560 --> 01:47:30,880\nAnd so if you're storing data in the UK,\nright, or better yet\n\n2199\n01:47:30,880 --> 01:47:32,820\nlet's say in Germany or somewhere, but\n\n2200\n01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:37,230\nyou do business here, you are as\na company bound by safe harbor laws.\n\n2201\n01:47:37,230 --> 01:47:40,320\nAnd so you have to be aware of that\nbecause the data privacy laws in Europe\n\n2202\n01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:43,470\nare much more stringent traditionally\nthan they are here in the US.\n\n2203\n01:47:43,470 --> 01:47:47,400\nAs so you have to be aware of all of these\nthings as we talk about data security,\n\n2204\n01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:50,310\nnetwork security, as a CISSP.\n\n2205\n01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:52,690\nIt is going to ultimately,\nat the end of the day,\n\n2206\n01:47:52,690 --> 01:47:56,850\nfall to you within the company to be\nresponsible for guiding the company.\n\n2207\n01:47:56,850 --> 01:47:59,180\nI've talked about this in\nsome of our other episodes.\n\n2208\n01:47:59,180 --> 01:48:02,880\nGuiding the company towards\nunderstanding what they need to do\n\n2209\n01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:06,400\nin the most efficient way possible,\nthe most effective way possible.\n\n2210\n01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:09,620\nBut also to make sure they're aware of\ncompliance, they're aware of standards and\n\n2211\n01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:10,790\nregulatory issues.\n\n2212\n01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:13,170\nThey're aware of threats,\nvulnerabilities and concerns.\n\n2213\n01:48:13,170 --> 01:48:15,300\nAround this approach versus that approach,\nso\n\n2214\n01:48:15,300 --> 01:48:17,620\nyour really have to be\naware of all these things.\n\n2215\n01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:19,800\nYou don't have to be\na master of all of them but\n\n2216\n01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:23,260\nyou do have to have situational awareness\naround them, and know what you don't know.\n\n2217\n01:48:23,260 --> 01:48:26,760\nAnd this is the thing that security\nprofessionals will often miss, right?\n\n2218\n01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:28,050\nWe're very good at certain thing.\n\n2219\n01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,940\nCISSP you have to master ten domains.\n\n2220\n01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:33,200\nTen bodies of knowledge.\n\n2221\n01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:36,160\nAnd we tell you you've got to get good\nat all of them at a certain level.\n\n2222\n01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:39,940\nBut the reality is you may go back out to\nthe real world after you become a CISSP.\n\n2223\n01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:42,230\nAnd not too much with\ncryptography after that.\n\n2224\n01:48:42,230 --> 01:48:45,375\nYou may implement cryptography here and\nthere every so often.\n\n2225\n01:48:45,375 --> 01:48:47,890\n[LAUGH] But\nyou may not do much with it after that.\n\n2226\n01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:50,910\nSo as a result it may not be your thing,\nand I get that.\n\n2227\n01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:54,000\nSoftware development and\nsystem development lifecycles may not be\n\n2228\n01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,870\nthe purview of most security\nprofessionals today.\n\n2229\n01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:58,720\nSo, you have to understand\nwhat you're good at,\n\n2230\n01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:01,780\nbut also understand where you\nhave some weaknesses, right?\n\n2231\n01:49:01,780 --> 01:49:03,040\nSome vulnerabilities, some threats,\n\n2232\n01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:06,700\nsome risks that you wanna help\noffset by bringing in experts.\n\n2233\n01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:10,170\nTalk to your peers,\ntalk to your colleagues.\n\n2234\n01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:14,390\nWe sit up here we have banter, Don and I,\nor Mike and I as we host and we talk about\n\n2235\n01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:18,210\nthings we are comfortable with some things\nperhaps not as comfortable with others.\n\n2236\n01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:21,250\nSome of us you know specialize\nin certain areas some of us do\n\n2237\n01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:23,190\nthings on a regular basis others don't and\n\n2238\n01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:27,910\nso one of us may go deeper on a topic then\nanother and offer commentary on a topic\n\n2239\n01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:30,440\nbecause we have something to share\nbecause it's valuable there.\n\n2240\n01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:33,100\nSo, we kind of have that\ntacit working knowledge and\n\n2241\n01:49:33,100 --> 01:49:36,890\nunderstanding of the fact that we're both\ngonna jump in and talk about things,\n\n2242\n01:49:36,890 --> 01:49:40,370\ncuz we bring that expertise to\nthe table to support each other.\n\n2243\n01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:41,770\nIt's a really critical though process,\n\n2244\n01:49:41,770 --> 01:49:45,960\nyou see it at play in every one of the\nepisodes of IT TV that you work through,\n\n2245\n01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:48,440\nnot just in this topical area but\nfor any of our programs.\n\n2246\n01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:50,280\nOr any of our shows, for anything, and\n\n2247\n01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:54,220\nit's a very very effective way to\nunderstand how to consume information\n\n2248\n01:49:54,220 --> 01:49:57,200\nbecause no matter what the focus is,\nyou're hearing\n\n2249\n01:49:57,200 --> 01:50:01,120\nthe best information from that person\nthat's most qualified to give it to you.\n\n2250\n01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:04,640\nAnd that's really what you have to think\nabout when you think about being a CISSP\n\n2251\n01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,490\nis, what am I good at?\n\n2252\n01:50:05,490 --> 01:50:06,700\nWhat do I know?\n\n2253\n01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:10,190\nAnd then where do I have some weaknesses\nand where do I need to ask for help?\n\n2254\n01:50:10,190 --> 01:50:13,140\nAnd if you can figure that out,\nthat's probably the single\n\n2255\n01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:16,880\nmost important thing I can teach you or\njointly we can make you aware of.\n\n2256\n01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:19,840\nIf you are humble enough to be\nable to understand that and\n\n2257\n01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:23,510\ndo that on a regular basis,\njust imagine how incredible\n\n2258\n01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:26,590\nthe networks you going to build and\nhow secure they're going to be over time.\n\n2259\n01:50:26,590 --> 01:50:29,770\nSo, probably a great way to\nleave us with a parting thought.\n\n2260\n01:50:29,770 --> 01:50:31,610\n>> Yeah, now I feel like we're in church.\n\n2261\n01:50:31,610 --> 01:50:33,980\nYou leave them with a parting thought.\n\n2262\n01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:34,810\nHonest.\n\n2263\n01:50:34,810 --> 01:50:37,036\nSo the moral of the story is.\n\n2264\n01:50:37,036 --> 01:50:38,432\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right,\n\n2265\n01:50:38,432 --> 01:50:41,070\nI think we wrapped up\nnetworking at this point.\n\n2266\n01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:43,660\nI obviously a wealth information,\nas you know,\n\n2267\n01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:45,490\njust by the fact we had\nyou go into part 3.\n\n2268\n01:50:45,490 --> 01:50:50,700\nSo, I do want to remind you guys, if you\nhave questions on any of this, if you\n\n2269\n01:50:50,700 --> 01:50:53,800\nwant a deeper explanation, keep in mind\nthat with a lot of this networking stuff,\n\n2270\n01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:57,450\nyou can jump over to The Network Plus show\nand we go in depth on a lot of it there.\n\n2271\n01:50:57,450 --> 01:51:00,940\nBut even if you are in a hurry and\nyou don't want to go watch those shows,\n\n2272\n01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:03,460\ntake advantage of the various\nways you can ask us questions.\n\n2273\n01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:06,290\nLive during the show,\nyou can go to itpro.tv/live.\n\n2274\n01:51:06,290 --> 01:51:10,320\nYou can post your questions right in\nthe chat room right beneath the video.\n\n2275\n01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:13,900\nWe see it monitored during the show,\nand answering, get those taken care of.\n\n2276\n01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:18,480\nIf you're watching this recorded, after\nhours, middle of the night, whatever, use\n\n2277\n01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:23,850\nthe Q&A link at the top of every itpro.tv\nweb page, head in there, that takes\n\n2278\n01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:27,060\nyou tot he Q&A forms, you can post your\nquestions there, we monitor and answer.\n\n2279\n01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:29,770\nWe want to make sure you guys get\nthe information that you need, so\n\n2280\n01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:32,900\nthat your going in to that exam with\nanswers in your head instead of questions.\n\n2281\n01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:35,730\nThat's gonna be one of the keys\nto success on the exam.\n\n2282\n01:51:35,730 --> 01:51:36,640\n>> Lot's of questions on the page.\n\n2283\n01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:37,980\nSo you don't want to\nbring any in with you.\n\n2284\n01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:40,790\nThey give you enough there, so\nmake sure you leave them out and\n\n2285\n01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:41,970\njust take the answers in with you.\n\n2286\n01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:43,370\nGreat advice absolutely.\n\n2287\n01:51:43,370 --> 01:51:44,149\n>> Absolutely.\n\n2288\n01:51:44,149 --> 01:51:48,085\nAll right well, signing off for\nIT Pro tv I'm Don Pezet.\n\n2289\n01:51:48,085 --> 01:51:49,152\n>> I'm Adam Gordon.\n\n2290\n01:51:49,152 --> 01:51:51,405\nThank you all so much, we'll see you soon.\n\n2291\n01:51:51,405 -->

Fantastic. Good.\n\n8\n00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:45,550\nCouldn't be better.\n\n9\n00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,840\nWe're getting ready to dive\ninto our next episode of CISSP.\n\n10\n00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,470\nWe are.\n\n11\n00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,000\nWe're going to hit some risk and\ngovernance today, I guess.\n\n12\n00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,780\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n13\n00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,670\nSo we're going to talk little bit\nabout the ideas behind risk and\n\n14\n00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,800\ninformation security management\nfrom a risk awareness perspective.\n\n15\n00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,910\nAlso governance, what is the role\nof governance in an organization?\n\n16\n00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:04,980\nWhy is it important?\n\n17\n00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,500\nWhat are the things we use and\n\n18\n00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,860\nthink about in order to be able to drive\ngovernance home with our user community?\n\n19\n00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,700\nWhen we start talking about information\nsecurity in any of the areas, any of\n\n20\n00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,500\nthe ten bodies of knowledge that we speak\nabout within the CISSP, we've gotta start\n\n21\n00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,470\nthat conversation, frame that conversation\nout by really thinking about three things.\n\n22\n00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,050\nWe talk about these as the pillars,\nthe underlying structures or\n\n23\n00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,110\npillars of information security.\n\n24\n00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,540\nSo we think of them as being\nconfidentiality, as integrity, and\n\n25\n00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,260\navailability.\n\n26\n00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,341\nI know we've put together, I should say\nyou, I don't wanna take any credit for it.\n\n27\n00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:38,060\n[LAUGH] Because you did all the hard work.\n\n28\n00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,610\nAll I did was tell you let's look in this\narea and let's talk about these things,\n\n29\n00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,430\nbut we put together some notes and\nsome vocabulary we want to share with\n\n30\n00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,400\neverybody, so\nif we could put those up on the screen.\n\n31\n00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,330\nWanna put those up there for us, Jason?\n\n32\n00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,600\nThere we go, so we've got the three\nitems listed there, availability,\n\n33\n00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,470\nintegrity, confidentiality These are gonna\nbe recurring themes for us as we talk\n\n34\n00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,000\nthrough this material throughout\nthe entire life cycle of this CISSP.\n\n35\n00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,480\nConfidentiality is gonna be\nthis idea at the bottom there\n\n36\n00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,360\nof this level of secrecy and\nthis idea of keeping information secure.\n\n37\n00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,430\nSafeguarding information,\n\n38\n00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,400\nkeeping it out of the hands of\npeople that don't belongs to.\n\n39\n00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,870\nRight.\n\n40\n00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,920\nWe had a document perhaps,\nmaybe we we're a manager,\n\n41\n00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,090\nhad a team of people that we work with and\nthat are underneath us, and\n\n42\n00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,465\nwe're doing reviews,\nmaybe annual reviews or quarterly reviews.\n\n43\n00:02:27,465 --> 00:02:28,190\nMm-hm.\n\n44\n00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,820\nWe don't want any body else on\nthe team to see anyone else's reviews.\n\n45\n00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,190\nWe don't want other managers to be\nable to see other employees, or\n\n46\n00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,688\nother team members of ours' reviews.\n\n47\n00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:38,530\nMm-hm.\nNor do we wanna see theirs.\n\n48\n00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,430\nRight.\nSo the security professional, the CISSP,\n\n49\n00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,670\nwould really be thinking about how to\nuse confidentiality to put in place\n\n50\n00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,980\nsystems that would address the risk of\nthe exposure of the information and would\n\n51\n00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,150\ngovern the use of that information to keep\nit secure throughout it's life cycle.\n\n52\n00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,060\nYeah, making sure that only the authorized\nusers actually have access to\n\n53\n00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,130\nthat information.\n\n54\n00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,990\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n55\n00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,830\nSo that's where we see confidentiality.\n\n56\n00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,660\nIntegrity would be this idea\nof accuracy and reliability,\n\n57\n00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,490\ngreat use of terminology there.\n\n58\n00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,707\nReally focuses, excuse me,\nthird time's the charm.\n\n59\n00:03:12,707 --> 00:03:16,950\n[LAUGH] Focus us on the idea\nof this protection and\n\n60\n00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,610\ninformation with confidentiality.\n\n61\n00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,350\nNow let's make sure that\nthe integrity of the information,\n\n62\n00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,000\nthat the information itself has\nnot been modified in any way,\n\n63\n00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000\nwhether it's in transit,\nwhat we call data on the wire.\n\n64\n00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,770\nYou'll often hear us refer to things that\nway, or data at rest when it is stored or\n\n65\n00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,690\nsomehow sitting in a file\nsystem in the cloud.\n\n66\n00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,630\nThat mythical place that all\ndata seems to disappear into,\n\n67\n00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,530\nnever quite know where it is or\nwhat it's doing.\n\n68\n00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,640\nI'm convinced it's out having a good time,\njoy riding on the internet somewhere,\n\n69\n00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,050\nthen it comes back when we want it.\n\n70\n00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,260\nI think of that Ferris Bueller scene,\n\n71\n00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,730\nfrom the movie,\nwhere the guy's got the Porsche.\n\n72\n00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,818\nJust coming over that hill, and\nflying through the air, slow motioning it\n\n73\n00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:01,780\nFlying to the valet parker, hair is waving\nin the breeze, a crazy look in his eyes.\n\n74\n00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,260\nThat's what I think of when I\nthink of my data and the cloud.\n\n75\n00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,170\nYeah.\nJoy riding through the streets and\n\n76\n00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,980\nbyways of the internet in\nsomebody's borrowed Porsche.\n\n77\n00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,760\nThat's right.\nThat's what I think of.\n\n78\n00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,320\nSo when we think of integrity,\nwe think of this idea.\n\n79\n00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,610\nThis focus on information\nnot being modified.\n\n80\n00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,480\nYou have it there at the end of\nthe definition where it says any\n\n81\n00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,620\nunauthorized modification is prevented.\n\n82\n00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,530\nWhen we think about availability, we think\nabout this idea of making sure, again,\n\n83\n00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,900\ngreat use of vocabulary here,\nreliable and timely access to data.\n\n84\n00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,990\nMaking sure that individuals,\nthose that are authorized,\n\n85\n00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,840\nthose that have the right to be there, so\nwe are saying they should see the data.\n\n86\n00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,090\nNow we are going to make sure the data\nis available to them when it is time,\n\n87\n00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:44,990\nwhatever that window is.\n\n88\n00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,720\nIt could be a two hour window\nat the end of a business day,\n\n89\n00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,669\nwhere they have to compile and close\nout some reports, it could be 24 by 7,\n\n90\n00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:55,340\ncan be anything in between.\n\n91\n00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,720\nIf the information they need to\ndo their job is not available,\n\n92\n00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,540\nthen I'm not doing my job.\n\n93\n00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,100\nAs a CISSP,\nwe potentially have an issue there.\n\n94\n00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:04,540\nWe may not be doing our job to\nthe fullest extent that we should be,\n\n95\n00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,980\nabsolutely correct.\n\n96\n00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,050\nWe want to make sure that we are focused\non these three pillars, very important as\n\n97\n00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,530\nbuilding blocks for everything we do,\neverything we talk about in this area.\n\n98\n00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,690\nHaving said that, let's move on, let's\ntalk about some of these other terms.\n\n99\n00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,750\nYou've got some really interesting\ndefinition items up there.\n\n100\n00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,180\nI want to make sure we put this\ninformation into context when we think\n\n101\n00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,030\nabout information security, and we think\nabout this idea of managing information,\n\n102\n00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,845\nwe really have to start\nout with vocabulary.\n\n103\n00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:30,910\nI often talk about this with my students.\n\n104\n00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:35,150\nI talk about this in the context of\nhaving conversations with my customers\n\n105\n00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,805\nabout this.\n\n106\n00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:36,770\nMm-hm.\nIt's a language.\n\n107\n00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,460\nRight.\n\n108\n00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,300\nIf you wanna learn to\nbe fluent in security,\n\n109\n00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,490\nyou have to learn to speak the language.\n\n110\n00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,310\nIt's like anything else,\nyou put time in and you can sit down and\n\n111\n00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,210\ntalk to the natives.\n\n112\n00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,490\nIf you don't, they're going to know\nthat you're from somewhere else, and\n\n113\n00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,980\nthey're not going to take you seriously.\n\n114\n00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:54,810\nYou find that some people try to use\nthese terms interchangeably maybe,\n\n115\n00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,380\nnot really fully understanding what the\nmeaning of the word is when they use them.\n\n116\n00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,282\nOr incorrectly.\n\n117\n00:06:01,282 --> 00:06:04,065\nIncorrectly using it, so in other words,\nas you were pointing out trying to use it\n\n118\n00:06:04,065 --> 00:06:07,115\nover here when, in fact, we're really\ntalking about something totally unrelated.\n\n119\n00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:08,575\nIt makes it very difficult to your point,\n\n120\n00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:11,625\nabsolutely correct, to communicate and\ncommunicate effectively.\n\n121\n00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:15,120\nThis is the secret, by the way,\nthere are several secrets associated but\n\n122\n00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,340\nbeing a CISSP,\ncontrary to urban myth and legend.\n\n123\n00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,760\nSo there are some that\nare really important and\n\n124\n00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,020\nsome that are often misunderstood.\n\n125\n00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,990\nOne of the big ones Mike just hit on is\nthis idea of effective communication.\n\n126\n00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,180\nBeing able to share this knowledge in such\na way that those around you benefit from\n\n127\n00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,180\nyour experience and really effectively\ncreating the opportunity for awareness,\n\n128\n00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,460\nand security awareness.\n\n129\n00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,470\nAwareness of the surrounding,\nwhat we call situational awareness and\n\n130\n00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,490\nin other areas and in other pursuits is\nvital to your success both with CISSP and\n\n131\n00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:51,710\nas somebody who leads security\nefforts in any of these areas.\n\n132\n00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,090\nSo let's define some of these terms.\n\n133\n00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,880\nWe often think of these terms as\nbeing things that we build on.\n\n134\n00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,290\nThese are building blocks and\nways in which we will understand\n\n135\n00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,150\nhow information is going to\ncome into our organization.\n\n136\n00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,670\nHow we are going to potentially\nprocess it, and how ultimately,\n\n137\n00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,385\nwe're going to be able to\nmanage it through a life cycle.\n\n138\n00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:11,920\nThey're not in exact order, we're going\nto play around with the order a little\n\n139\n00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,110\nbit but we do want to talk through them\nall, so the order they're in is fine.\n\n140\n00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:20,110\nBut let's start with the threat agent,\nI think number two there.\n\n141\n00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,428\nSo this idea that it's\nas a formal definition.\n\n142\n00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:24,290\nWe'll give you the formal and\n\n143\n00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,980\nthen we'll kind of translate\nthat into normal person speak.\n\n144\n00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,704\nRight.\n[LAUGH]\n\n145\n00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:30,959\nWe'll go into English mode here cuz\nthis is the non-normal person language,\n\n146\n00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,655\nthe language of the information security\nprofessionals, the language of obscurity.\n\n147\n00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,660\n[LAUGH] We practice confidentiality,\nas we speak in real time.\n\n148\n00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,300\nThis idea of threat agents being entities\nthat can exploit a vulnerability.\n\n149\n00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,980\nSo what does that really mean?\n\n150\n00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,406\nWhat it means is that it is some thing,\na threat agent could be a individual,\n\n151\n00:07:48,406 --> 00:07:52,846\nit could be a machine, it could be\na machine being used to target something.\n\n152\n00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:56,990\nIt could be a piece of\nsoftware acting as malware.\n\n153\n00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,551\nSo we're not quite sure what the threat\nagent is at this point and it's not as\n\n154\n00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:04,131\nimportant to know what it is- In terms\nof defining it as a categorical item.\n\n155\n00:08:04,131 --> 00:08:04,697\nMm-hm.\nOr\n\n156\n00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:08,425\nrather just to say it is something\nthat can exploit vulnerabilities,\n\n157\n00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:12,920\nvulnerabilities being weaknesses as\nyou see in the definition right above.\n\n158\n00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,850\nSo this idea of something being\nable to find a weak spot, and\n\n159\n00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:18,770\ntake advantage of that weak spot is\nwhat we think of as a threat agent.\n\n160\n00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,340\nOkay.\n\n161\n00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,840\nSometimes called, or referred to as\na threat actor in some documentations,\n\n162\n00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,795\nsome terminology.\n\n163\n00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,790\nRight, mm-hm.\nEffectively, from our perspective,\n\n164\n00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,700\nthe same thing.\n\n165\n00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,340\nSo, vulnerabilities,\nas we see right up at top there,\n\n166\n00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,730\nthe idea here of weakness or\na lack of counter measure.\n\n167\n00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:40,450\nSo really what do we see that is\npotentially going to be a position,\n\n168\n00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,789\nan area, a thing that somebody,\na threat agent will act on,\n\n169\n00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,505\nand hope to take advantage\nof if we use that.\n\n170\n00:08:47,505 --> 00:08:52,365\nSo if we see that you are very focused\non a certain kind of security, but\n\n171\n00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,730\nvery lax, and really not focused\nin another area on security,\n\n172\n00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,990\nwe may see that as a vulnerability when\nwe do our reconnaissance of your network.\n\n173\n00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,720\nAnd as a result, the threat agent may be\nthe entity that will then take advantage\n\n174\n00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,940\nof that hole, right?\n\n175\n00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:08,470\nAnd that's what a vulnerability is, it's\na hole, something that we can potentially\n\n176\n00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,050\ncrawl through in some way, in order to\ntake advantage of within your network.\n\n177\n00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,060\nOr if you think about just\na representation in your mind,\n\n178\n00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,150\nkind of a picture of what that may be.\n\n179\n00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,010\nThink of a hole, if we can get\nthrough the hole to the other side,\n\n180\n00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,480\nwe're inside the network.\n\n181\n00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,770\nSo we have a threat,\n\n182\n00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:26,330\nthis idea of the danger of a threat\nagent exploiting vulnerability.\n\n183\n00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,700\nSo kind of wrapping up those first two\ndefinitions, we put those two things\n\n184\n00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,240\ntogether and say well, if the threat\nagent acts on a vulnerability they find,\n\n185\n00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,680\nwe call that a threat.\n\n186\n00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,520\nThat is what we,\neffectively we say is happening there.\n\n187\n00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,150\nThe risk is going to be\nthe probabilities you could see there,\n\n188\n00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,990\nof a threat agent exploiting\na vulnerability and the associated impact.\n\n189\n00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,020\nSo risk is gonna be threat plus something,\nright?\n\n190\n00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,960\nIt's the threat, the possibility\nthat this is gonna happen and\n\n191\n00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,260\nthen the impact of what that actually\nmeans is what we say risk is.\n\n192\n00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,040\nSo just threat plus impact,\nthat's a great way of thinking about it,\n\n193\n00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,505\nwe actually have a little formula\nthat effectively does that for us.\n\n194\n00:10:02,505 --> 00:10:04,560\nMm-hm.\nAnd then we have exposure,\n\n195\n00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,550\npresence of a vulnerability,\nexposing the organization to the threat.\n\n196\n00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,570\nSo exposure is this possibility, right,\nwhat is the possibility this can happen,\n\n197\n00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,920\nand as a result, we rate that.\n\n198\n00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,120\nWe may rank that as low,\nmedium, high for instance,\n\n199\n00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,310\nand look at that in some sort of\nprobability-impact exposure matrix.\n\n200\n00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,365\nWe invite you to have a piece of pie,\nright?\n\n201\n00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:23,650\nUh-huh.\nAs we talk about that, so\n\n202\n00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,380\nwe'll talk about that.\n\n203\n00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,790\nWe actually have a graphic for\nprobability impact and\n\n204\n00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,375\nexposure we'll share with\nyou in a little while.\n\n205\n00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,040\nMm-hm.\nAnd we have controls, right?\n\n206\n00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,780\nSafeguards are controls,\nthese are things as you can see,\n\n207\n00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,850\nput in place to reduce a risk,\ntypically referred to as a countermeasure,\n\n208\n00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,080\nas you call out in your definition there.\n\n209\n00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,565\nSo we often hear these referred\nto simply as countermeasures.\n\n210\n00:10:40,565 --> 00:10:45,170\nAnd so if we think about putting all this\ntogether in a logical flow, some sort of\n\n211\n00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:50,385\nidea of how we begin in some area and move\nthrough a life cycle with these terms.\n\n212\n00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:51,350\nRight.\n\n213\n00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,750\nWhat we wanna understand is the following.\n\n214\n00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,550\nWe would think of basically\na threat agent, right,\n\n215\n00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,920\nwhich is this actor, that potentially\ncan take advantage of vulnerabilities.\n\n216\n00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,250\nSo we would think of a threat\nagent really leading to, or\n\n217\n00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,350\nseeing the opportunity for threats, right?\n\n218\n00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,290\nThreats can occur based on threat\nagents being available to us, and\n\n219\n00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,520\nbeing in a system in some way.\n\n220\n00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,060\nAnd threats will exploit\nvulnerabilities as we can see there,\n\n221\n00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,575\nso threats really kind of\nexploit vulnerabilities, right?\n\n222\n00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:22,700\nMm-hm.\nA threat agent will obviously\n\n223\n00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,290\nact to exploit the vulnerability.\n\n224\n00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,070\nVulnerabilities can lead to risk, right?\n\n225\n00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,750\nWe know that they can lead to\nrisks if we're not careful.\n\n226\n00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,400\nRisks can damage assets, I don't really\nthink we have assets up there per se, but\n\n227\n00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,880\nan asset is just the idea\n\n228\n00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,910\nof measuring something that\nis important to the business.\n\n229\n00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,830\nSo an asset could be human capital,\ncould be an intellectual property,\n\n230\n00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,970\ncould be physical machines or\nthings of that nature.\n\n231\n00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,230\nSo we're gonna focus this\nidea of risk being impactful,\n\n232\n00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,050\npotentially having a negative\nimpact on assets in some way.\n\n233\n00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,040\nWhatever those things are,\n\n234\n00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,220\nthey're something that's\nimportant to the business.\n\n235\n00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,910\nSo we can potentially damage, or\n\n236\n00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,270\nperhaps somehow create negative\nvalue around an asset,\n\n237\n00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,710\nby seeing risks becoming available,\nor perhaps being focused on them.\n\n238\n00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:11,885\nAnd then assets obviously can, if we have\nan asset, we can see exposure happening.\n\n239\n00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:14,310\nSo if risk is associated with an asset,\n\n240\n00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,270\nthat asset being acted on can then\nlead to an exposure for the business.\n\n241\n00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,830\nWe apply obviously safeguards,\nwhat we call countermeasures there or\n\n242\n00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,200\ncontrols to that exposure\nto try to minimize it and\n\n243\n00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,440\nin some respects hopefully maybe even\nmake it go away, depending on what it is.\n\n244\n00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,000\nRight.\n\n245\n00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,260\nAnd those safeguards are then looped back\nup to the top in a continuous cycle, so\n\n246\n00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,495\nwe kinda see it go like this.\n\n247\n00:12:34,495 --> 00:12:35,910\nUh-huh.\nWhere we then say okay,\n\n248\n00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,710\nso we countermanded, put a counter measure\nin place against this particular issue.\n\n249\n00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,460\nBut now there's new vulnerabilities,\nnew threats, new risks, and new exposures.\n\n250\n00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,390\nAnd as a result, those threat\nagents are now gonna come back and\n\n251\n00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,935\nperhaps come at us in a different way.\n\n252\n00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,960\nRight.\nSome how, some way, some where,\n\n253\n00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,390\nwe're going to see them, so this is\nthat cycle of I fixed it over here, and\n\n254\n00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,502\nnow I'm seeing something\nelse bubble up over here.\n\n255\n00:12:57,502 --> 00:12:59,680\nRight, right.\nThis is what we're talking about.\n\n256\n00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,145\nSo, putting all this in context,\nit's very important for\n\n257\n00:13:03,145 --> 00:13:06,970\nus to truly understand the impact and\nnature of this vocabulary.\n\n258\n00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,650\nSo maybe just a quick stop here for\na moment, quick knowledge check for\n\n259\n00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,050\nyou early on as we're starting\nto get into the material.\n\n260\n00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,910\nYou notice, we walk through the\ndefinitions of things, we put some things\n\n261\n00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,030\nin the notes, we call these things out,\nwe discuss them with you.\n\n262\n00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:24,000\nThese are key terms, key areas of focus,\nwhat I call key knowledge areas for\n\n263\n00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,440\nyou that you want to be preparing around\nto make sure you're able to answer\n\n264\n00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,790\nquestions about as you look to\nultimately prepare for the CISSP exam.\n\n265\n00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,717\nSo just putting that in context for\nyou, important to know, right?\n\n266\n00:13:35,717 --> 00:13:36,783\nYeah, flashcards.\n\n267\n00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:41,010\nFlashcards, yes, my old stand by, I often\ntalked about the security mechanism for\n\n268\n00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,841\nproper preparation will be flash cards.\n\n269\n00:13:42,841 --> 00:13:44,410\nThat's right.\nSo it is a good idea.\n\n270\n00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,278\nMike and I joke a little bit about\nit sometimes in our discussions.\n\n271\n00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,010\nBut I'll often recommend to my students\nthat flash cards are the way to go.\n\n272\n00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,910\nThere's probably several hundred\nvocabulary terms at the end of this\n\n273\n00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,670\nwhole process, and\nthis area of knowledge in particular.\n\n274\n00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,370\nYou may need to master,\nas a security practitioner,\n\n275\n00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,340\nto be successful on an exam\nlike the CISSP, right?\n\n276\n00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,340\nSix hours, 250 questions, there's a lot\nof stuff they're gonna want you to\n\n277\n00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:08,460\nknow about, a lot of things\nyou're gonna have to remember.\n\n278\n00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,750\nAnd although memorization is one way to\ngo, you can't memorize everything, right?\n\n279\n00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,180\nAt least, I haven't been able to, there's\nalways stuff I forget I got to look up,\n\n280\n00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:19,610\nand things I may not do for awhile that I\njust may not remember until I sit down and\n\n281\n00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,250\ntake a look at them.\n\n282\n00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,760\nSo, memorization by itself is\n\n283\n00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,385\nnot the only mechanism you want\nto bring to bare here, right?\n\n284\n00:14:25,385 --> 00:14:27,580\nRight.\nYou gotta have some rote learning,\n\n285\n00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,190\nsome rote memorization, but\n\n286\n00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,804\nyou also gotta have the ability to\nrecall informational in context.\n\n287\n00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:34,230\nMm-hm.\nAnd that involves studying it, and\n\n288\n00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,960\nreally mastering it by really\nunderstanding and internalizing.\n\n289\n00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,960\nSo make sure you do that as well,\nvery important.\n\n290\n00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,240\nAnd so let's talk a bit about, since we\ntalked about this idea of vocabulary, and\n\n291\n00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,630\ntalked about some of these things.\n\n292\n00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,820\nI think the next item on our list was\ngonna be control types, and I wanna talk\n\n293\n00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,880\na little bit about control types,\nwhat they are, put them in context here.\n\n294\n00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,390\nSo we have three types of\ncontrols that we speak about.\n\n295\n00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:59,690\nWe have them listed as administrative,\ntechnical, and physical controls.\n\n296\n00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,550\nWe wanna make sure we understand the three\ndifferent types and what they are.\n\n297\n00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,450\nSo, let's just talk\na little bit about this,\n\n298\n00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,130\nmake sure we are comfortable\nwith this idea, right?\n\n299\n00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,870\nDifferent functionalities of\ndifferent security control types\n\n300\n00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,540\nare gonna be important for\nus to really understand.\n\n301\n00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,420\nAnd so we want to make sure that we\nhave control functionalities down below,\n\n302\n00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,010\nwe see them there.\n\n303\n00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,000\nBefore we get into\nthe categories of control types,\n\n304\n00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,944\nlet's just put this out there kind\nof as an overall thought process.\n\n305\n00:15:22,944 --> 00:15:25,030\nWe'll come back and\nsort of start mixing and matching.\n\n306\n00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,370\nBut we talked about these three categories\nof control types, and then what we do is\n\n307\n00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,165\nwe talk about these functionalities\nthat are associated with them, right?\n\n308\n00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,901\nMm-hm.\nSo we talk about deterrent as you can see,\n\n309\n00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:39,834\npreventative, corrective, recovery,\ndetective, and compensating as being\n\n310\n00:15:39,834 --> 00:15:44,340\ncontrol functionality types, or\nexcuse me control functionalities that\n\n311\n00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,719\nare associated with these control types,\nis what I really meant to say.\n\n312\n00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:52,015\nAnd by putting these together we're gonna\nwalk through a little exercise of doing\n\n313\n00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:53,744\nsome mixing and matching here in a minute.\n\n314\n00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,324\nRight.\nBut\n\n315\n00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:58,527\nas we do that we begin to build out Almost\nlike a charter or matrix if you will.\n\n316\n00:15:58,527 --> 00:16:03,043\nIn our minds mentally a grid of how we\ncan associate different control types and\n\n317\n00:16:03,043 --> 00:16:04,100\nwhat they are?\n\n318\n00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:09,140\nAnd so let's think about some of\nthe different types of control.\n\n319\n00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,600\nAnd let's think about\nsome of the different\n\n320\n00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,930\nways in which we may see them associate.\n\n321\n00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,780\nSo you have administrative controls,\n\n322\n00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,070\nlet's just think about this logically and\nyou'll think about what these are.\n\n323\n00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,010\nWhen we think about\nadministrative controls,\n\n324\n00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,080\nwe may be thinking about things\nlike policies for instance right.\n\n325\n00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,105\nSo a policy is a good example of\na little of administrative control.\n\n326\n00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:31,395\nWe may be thinking of some sort of\nthing like separation of duties.\n\n327\n00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:34,285\nWhere we have certain roles\nassigned to certain people and\n\n328\n00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,815\nthen those people are doing those things\nand backing up and restoring, for example.\n\n329\n00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:41,415\nIt's a really good example of this,\nwhere we keep those duties separate and\n\n330\n00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:45,935\nas a result we never let the same person,\ndo both the back up and restore operation.\n\n331\n00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:48,965\nBecause effectively they have the ability\nto manipulate data if they do that.\n\n332\n00:16:48,965 --> 00:16:49,481\nRight, they can do both.\n\n333\n00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:53,280\nThey can restore certain data but\nnot others and manipulate what was there.\n\n334\n00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,500\nCover their tracks a little easier.\n\n335\n00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,780\nCover their tracks, absolutely.\n\n336\n00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,070\nSo that's something definitely to just\nbe thinking about and be aware of.\n\n337\n00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,880\nWe could think of things such as job\nrotation generically as administrative\n\n338\n00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,470\ncontrol as well, we could also think of\nthings like security awareness training,\n\n339\n00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,850\nas an administrative control.\n\n340\n00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:13,320\nAnd these are all examples,\nof administrative control types.\n\n341\n00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,228\nSo just some examples.\n\n342\n00:17:14,228 --> 00:17:17,180\nNot a proratative list,\nnot an exhaustive list in a sense,\n\n343\n00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,100\nsaying only these and nothing else.\n\n344\n00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,800\nBut it is a beginning of you understanding\nthe different types of control elements.\n\n345\n00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:26,050\nDifferentiate between those\nadministrative and technical and physical.\n\n346\n00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,070\nAbsolutely, so\nlet's talk about technical controls.\n\n347\n00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,970\nLet's put some types up there.\n\n348\n00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,410\nLet's throw some stuff up there.\n\n349\n00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,955\nThe old goody and\nold fashioned one, access control.\n\n350\n00:17:33,955 --> 00:17:38,680\nThat's right our ACL is probably the most\ncommon technical control we think of.\n\n351\n00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,015\nThings such as encryption, when we\ntalk about using encryption around.\n\n352\n00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:45,560\n[COUGH] Not just in\ncryptography specifically, but\n\n353\n00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,370\naround confidentiality there'll\nbe a technical control.\n\n354\n00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:54,560\nBelieve it or not, something like a router\nor an IDS are technical controls.\n\n355\n00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,530\nSo we wanna think of those.\n\n356\n00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,600\nThese are hardware based typically,\nobviously.\n\n357\n00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,730\nBut they are gonna be hardware or software\nbased, we think of them as devices.\n\n358\n00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,130\nStill controlling access.\n\n359\n00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,300\nControlling access or controlling\ndocumentation on what is going on.\n\n360\n00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,870\nSo I when IDS will log\nnot just access Right.\n\n361\n00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,310\nBut will log other things.\n\n362\n00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,045\nWhat are you doing, what's in the packet?\n\n363\n00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:14,370\nRight.\nThings of that nature.\n\n364\n00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,430\nSo those will be technical controls.\n\n365\n00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,648\nWe may see something like data\nbackup as being a technical control,\n\n366\n00:18:20,648 --> 00:18:21,840\nbelieve it or not.\n\n367\n00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,060\nJust want to think about that as well.\n\n368\n00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,650\nData backup may be a good\nexample of technical control.\n\n369\n00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,620\nSo be aware of that,\n\n370\n00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,090\nwhen we think of physical controls we\ncan think of things like locks on doors.\n\n371\n00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,770\nGood old fashion door lock,\nwe may think of something like a guard.\n\n372\n00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,875\nA guard walking a post somewhere,\nit's going to be a physical control.\n\n373\n00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:46,095\nA fence, physical control.\n\n374\n00:18:46,095 --> 00:18:48,245\nWe may have close circuit TV, so\n\n375\n00:18:48,245 --> 00:18:53,637\nCCTV, video, just generically cameras\nthings like that, will be potentially.\n\n376\n00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:56,537\nLighting, can also be conceived,\ncan be construed rather, and\n\n377\n00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:58,287\nseen as a physical control.\n\n378\n00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:00,317\nBecause proper lighting in certain areas,\n\n379\n00:19:00,317 --> 00:19:03,931\nto either create not just\nlittle isolated pools of light.\n\n380\n00:19:03,931 --> 00:19:05,827\nRight.\nWe want overlapping coverage,\n\n381\n00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:09,310\nbut that is gonna be considered a control,\ncuz we're creating safety and\n\n382\n00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,890\nsecurity as a result of lighting\nup areas where people can be seen.\n\n383\n00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:14,660\nAnd as a result not have\nthe bad guys hanging out and\n\n384\n00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,780\npotentially trying to do harm.\n\n385\n00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,800\nSo if we think about some of these\ndifferent control types, and\n\n386\n00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,300\nwhat we do is we wanna overlay\nthe functionality- Right.\n\n387\n00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,630\nOf what some of them may be.\n\n388\n00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,120\nAnd so for example,\nlet's go back up to the top and\n\n389\n00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,890\nlet's just talk about some\nof the ones we chose.\n\n390\n00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,660\nSo something like a security policy.\n\n391\n00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:37,590\nSo a security policy would be seen as\na preventative control functionality.\n\n392\n00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,790\nBecause the ideas that this is going to,\nif it's implemented the right way, prevent\n\n393\n00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,220\npeople from doing something that they\nshould not be doing through awareness and\n\n394\n00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,020\nthrough education.\n\n395\n00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,200\nSo it is seen as a preventative\ncontrol function.\n\n396\n00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,190\nBut it is under\nthe administrative control type.\n\n397\n00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,747\nAnd so this thought process of what\nis the control type and as a result,\n\n398\n00:19:56,747 --> 00:20:01,010\nwhat is the functionality that we\nwant to then associate with it.\n\n399\n00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:04,220\nYou have to match, I said we're going to\nhave to play a little mix and match game.\n\n400\n00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,350\nYou have to match the two\ntogether as you look to prepare,\n\n401\n00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,060\nbecause you have to understand\nthe control category.\n\n402\n00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,630\nRight.\nOr the control type,\n\n403\n00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,360\nalong with the functionality\nit represents.\n\n404\n00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,890\nSo we'll detail that out for\nthe ones we've talked about.\n\n405\n00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,010\nBut you are obviously,\ngonna have to think through that and\n\n406\n00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,495\nmake sure you are comfortable with that.\n\n407\n00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:22,040\nRight.\nSo separation of duties,\n\n408\n00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,820\nthis would also be preventative.\n\n409\n00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,670\nWe think of this as a preventative area or\na preventative control type or\n\n410\n00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,000\nfunctionality rather excuse me,\nI keep saying type.\n\n411\n00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,910\nWhat else do we do up there?\n\n412\n00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:32,443\nJob rotation.\n\n413\n00:20:32,443 --> 00:20:32,976\nJob rotation.\n\n414\n00:20:32,976 --> 00:20:35,020\nThat would be considered detective.\n\n415\n00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,450\nA detective in the sense that we're\ndetecting that you're doing something or\n\n416\n00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,400\nnot doing something.\n\n417\n00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,884\nRight.\nSo we'd rotate you through,\n\n418\n00:20:41,884 --> 00:20:44,030\ngonna be able to find that out.\n\n419\n00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,040\nWe also have security awareness training.\n\n420\n00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,935\nThis would be considered preventative,\nas well.\n\n421\n00:20:47,935 --> 00:20:51,981\nCuz if we make you aware by training you,\nthe thought process is then as a result,\n\n422\n00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:55,375\nyou're less likely to do something\nthat is not acceptable behavior\n\n423\n00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,915\nbased as [INAUDIBLE] So\nit won't happen in the first place.\n\n424\n00:20:57,915 --> 00:20:59,700\nWe're preventing it from\nhappening altogether.\n\n425\n00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,255\nWe would hope.\n\n426\n00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:01,380\nWe would hope.\nBut then of course we\n\n427\n00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,940\nhave common sense that comes in,\nand we have human nature.\n\n428\n00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,000\nYeah, yeah.\nWe realize that\n\n429\n00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,710\nno matter how much training we provide as\ngood security professionals we toil away,\n\n430\n00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,790\ndo our due diligence and\n\n431\n00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:14,450\nbelieve in the fact that people will\nact honorably if given the chance.\n\n432\n00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,530\nAnd then we go out to the real world and\nget proven wrong, and\n\n433\n00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,930\nalmost every opportunity.\n\n434\n00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:19,970\nI know.\nPeople just bring stupidity with them\n\n435\n00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,550\nthrough the door of\nthe business every day.\n\n436\n00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,670\nAll right, so ACL's Access Control List.\n\n437\n00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,880\nWe will se ACL's as being\npreventative measures as well.\n\n438\n00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,660\nSo they are control functionalities\nthat are preventative on encryption.\n\n439\n00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:38,080\nEncryption will be seen as being\npreventative router and or IDS.\n\n440\n00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,818\nA router is considered to be preventative,\nan IDS is detective, so we wanna probably.\n\n441\n00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:44,650\nLet's separate those.\nSeparate those two.\n\n442\n00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,910\nI didn't realize you put them\ntogether in the list there.\n\n443\n00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,275\nSo routers preventative or\nconsidered to be preventative whereas,\n\n444\n00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:54,130\ncuz it has an ACL, it's kind of preventing\naccess control, is monitoring that and\n\n445\n00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,720\nas a result is seen as preventative.\n\n446\n00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,330\nWhereas, an IDS will be\nclassified as detective more so.\n\n447\n00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,120\nAnd then a data backup is\nactually seen as a recovery.\n\n448\n00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,770\nRecovery functionality there.\n\n449\n00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,550\nIt's I think down at\nthe very bottom of our list.\n\n450\n00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,030\nI don't know that we actually,\ntowards the bottom there.\n\n451\n00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:15,040\nLet's go back and let's deal with\nthe physical ones we called out.\n\n452\n00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,570\nI think I said fences in there, somewhere\nthat was down towards the bottom.\n\n453\n00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,590\nSo let's do locks.\n\n454\n00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,950\nLocks are seen as preventative.\n\n455\n00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,970\nGuards are going to be seen as or\n\n456\n00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,410\nbe thought of most likely\nas preventative as well.\n\n457\n00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,470\nA fence would be seen as deterrent,\nmore often than not, discourages people.\n\n458\n00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,085\nYou look at the fence, eight feet high.\n\n459\n00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:36,130\nYeah.\nYou think to yourself, yeah,\n\n460\n00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,227\nI'm gonna go down the street and play\nwith your friends more often than not.\n\n461\n00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:41,710\n[LAUGH] So hopefully that's\nat least how it works anyway.\n\n462\n00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,240\nClosed circuit TV detective,\nwe're gonna be monitoring and looking for\n\n463\n00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,910\nthings to happen there.\n\n464\n00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:52,380\nAnd then of course lightning, as we said,\nis seen as also a discouraging omen.\n\n465\n00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,670\nSo it's gonna be, much like a fence,\na deterrent solution.\n\n466\n00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,790\nWe're gonna discourage people by\nhopefully having good lighting.\n\n467\n00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,771\nUnless they have a BB gun and\nthey're a good shot,\n\n468\n00:23:00,771 --> 00:23:03,833\nin which case we may just be encouraging\nthem to pick the lights off- [LAUGH] As\n\n469\n00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,110\nopposed to discouraging them\nfrom doing anything else.\n\n470\n00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,760\nBut we want to map this\nidea of the control element\n\n471\n00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,670\nwith the functionalities together.\n\n472\n00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,510\nAgain, not an exhaustive\nlist of these by the way.\n\n473\n00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,695\nI believe we're gonna put together\na little chart- We are, yeah.\n\n474\n00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,235\nFor everybody,\nhave it in the notes for you.\n\n475\n00:23:18,235 --> 00:23:20,020\n[COUGH] Out beyond the one\nwe just did here quickly.\n\n476\n00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,500\nWe're going to reproduce just a nice\nlittle fuller look at some of this stuff.\n\n477\n00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,450\nLay it out for you nicely,\nit'll be available to you.\n\n478\n00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:29,350\nSo just be aware of that, but this is\na good opportunity for you to go through\n\n479\n00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,650\nthis exercise and just think about how\nwe take these three control types?\n\n480\n00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,640\nAnd how we then link them to\nthese functionality elements?\n\n481\n00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,650\nAnd as we detail out the controls,\n\n482\n00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,700\nunderstanding the kind of\nfunction they provide.\n\n483\n00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,763\nRight.\n\n484\n00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:45,855\nIn terms of the control is one of\nthe things that a CIISP has to know,\n\n485\n00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:46,904\nnot only how to do, but\n\n486\n00:23:46,904 --> 00:23:50,178\nalso how to guide the business to be\nable to understand the value of it.\n\n487\n00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,710\nRight?\nSo this is important,\n\n488\n00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,546\nbecause there's the business\ninvests in better lighting,\n\n489\n00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:58,220\nbetter closed circuit tvs or do we just\nsimply invest in fences and guards?\n\n490\n00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,610\nWhat's the return under\nthe fiscal controls there.\n\n491\n00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,330\nDo we need card key access\nwith you know smart locks or\n\n492\n00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,900\nare we ok with just dumb locks?\n\n493\n00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,890\nDoor key.\n\n494\n00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,930\nBut what's the value to the business?\n\n495\n00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,200\nAnd what are we gonna invest\nversus what we're gonna get back?\n\n496\n00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,910\nThis is part of what CISSP has to do.\n\n497\n00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,020\nWe have to help the business\nhave this value conversation.\n\n498\n00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,001\nAnd understand what each control can do,\n\n499\n00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:21,557\nas a result what the value\nis when they expect from it.\n\n500\n00:24:21,557 --> 00:24:22,380\nRight.\n\n501\n00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,350\nVery important view, that.\n\n502\n00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,640\nSo these are some of the skills you\nwill be asked to bring to the table.\n\n503\n00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,880\nAs you look to become not\nonly a CISSP in practice, but\n\n504\n00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,370\nyou may already be doing\nthis kind of stuff.\n\n505\n00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:36,700\nYou know, you may be the person that sits\nin the meeting with the business and\n\n506\n00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,410\ntalks about new technology.\n\n507\n00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,400\nAnd is this technology gonna be important?\n\n508\n00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,660\nWhat can we do for bring mobile\ndevice management to the forefront?\n\n509\n00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:47,680\nIf we let people bring their own mobile\ndevices in, hook them up to email, and\n\n510\n00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,840\nbring their own cloud storage\nin as a result of that.\n\n511\n00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,170\nBecause you'll wrap beyond the hey,\nbring your device to work concept.\n\n512\n00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,740\nBYOD is very last year, right?\n\n513\n00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,170\nSo it's not the fashionable thing anymore,\nright?\n\n514\n00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,280\nWe've already dealt with BYOD, right?\n\n515\n00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,900\nWhat we really need, is we need to be\ntalking about BYOC, bring your own cloud.\n\n516\n00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,120\nBecause with these devices, right?\n\n517\n00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,690\nWhere everybody's bringing\ntheir own cloud and\n\n518\n00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,710\ntheir own storage mechanisms in, right?\n\n519\n00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,360\nAnd, so as a result, it's not just about,\nhey, where is the endpoint?\n\n520\n00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,439\nIt's more like where is the data\non the endpoint, right?\n\n521\n00:25:16,439 --> 00:25:18,050\n[LAUGH] Because the data is the cloud.\n\n522\n00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:21,510\nAs I said, the Ferris Bueller analogy,\nracing through the streets, and\n\n523\n00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:24,610\nthe Porsche is airborne, having a good\ntime, and whether we know it or\n\n524\n00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,300\nnot, [LAUGH] right?\n\n525\n00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,500\nAt the end of the day,\nour data's going for a ride.\n\n526\n00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,820\nQuestion is, who's driving?\n\n527\n00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,650\nAnd so all those risk associated\nwith those technologies nab right\n\n528\n00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,020\ninto my enterprise.\n\n529\n00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,540\nBasically.\nThey could very well be, right?\n\n530\n00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,940\nThey could actually be driven\nright up to the door, so to speak,\n\n531\n00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,200\nand be convinced that they may or\nmay not be important.\n\n532\n00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,020\nSo we wanna make sure that\nwe're thinking about things.\n\n533\n00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,460\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n534\n00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,970\nAnd I saw Don, for you guys watching live,\nDon just threw up, in the chatroom there,\n\n535\n00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,120\nthe spreadsheet we were talking about.\n\n536\n00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,380\nIt's a little bit more in-depth, the\nmatrix, that you guys can look at that's\n\n537\n00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,340\nallowing you to map those control\ntypes to their functionality.\n\n538\n00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,250\nIs that something we could\njust preview quickly or\n\n539\n00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:02,220\nis that not something maybe just while\nI'm rattling on about something else.\n\n540\n00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,710\nAbsolutely.\nCome up with another movie analogy while\n\n541\n00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:06,350\nwe're doing that and we'll see if maybe\nwe can just look at it real quick.\n\n542\n00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,210\nSo you know while we're doing that, right,\n\n543\n00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,760\nwe're talking about this idea of these\ncontrol types, these functional elements.\n\n544\n00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,340\nSo think about that.\n\n545\n00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:16,530\nThe other thing that I\nthink is important is.\n\n546\n00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:19,740\nOut beyond that, let's talk about the\nbroader definition of security in relation\n\n547\n00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,500\nto a framework, right?\n\n548\n00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,300\nAnd so, we'll preview that for\nyou in just a second.\n\n549\n00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,400\nBut let me just at least throw\nthis out there as an item.\n\n550\n00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,890\nSo there's an idea of security frameworks,\nthere's many of them out there.\n\n551\n00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,640\nWe've been talking about\none little element of them,\n\n552\n00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,980\nwhich is how do we implement controls\naround the information management.\n\n553\n00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,590\nThis idea of governance is more broadly\nthat we're talking about in this\n\n554\n00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,725\nparticular section is this idea framework.\n\n555\n00:26:38,725 --> 00:26:40,910\nMm-hm.\nHow do we build the infrastructure that\n\n556\n00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,770\nallows us at the strategic,\nat the tactical, and\n\n557\n00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,825\nat the operational levels of\nthe business to manage security?\n\n558\n00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:49,470\nMm-hm.\nThis is what a framework can do for\n\n559\n00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,560\nus if it's going to be\nthought of correctly.\n\n560\n00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560\nSo there are many,\nmany frameworks out there.\n\n561\n00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,870\nThings like Itel which are customer\nservice IT centric- Mm-hm.\n\n562\n00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,800\nBut customer service framework\ntouch on security, but\n\n563\n00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,920\nare not focused exclusively on it.\n\n564\n00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,640\nOther frameworks like Cobit is gonna\nbe a framework that focuses on IT\n\n565\n00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,680\ngovernance and security.\n\n566\n00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,270\nA very important framework for\nus to be aware of.\n\n567\n00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,010\nSo security frameworks is a thought\nprocess for the security professional.\n\n568\n00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:16,190\nVery important for you to become\neducated around and be aware of.\n\n569\n00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,130\nAnd if you're not familiar with them,\nstart thinking about them.\n\n570\n00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,560\nStart becoming more aware of them,\nbecause these are reference points for\n\n571\n00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,430\nyou to have your conversations with\nyour peers, but also with the business.\n\n572\n00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,880\nAnd as a security professional,\n\n573\n00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,740\nas a CISSP, you have to speak\nthe language of the practitioner, but\n\n574\n00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,590\nalso the language of the business and\nunderstand how to translate the two.\n\n575\n00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,460\nAnd so,\nit's a great way of thinking about it,\n\n576\n00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,130\nas Mike's putting up there,\nact as a reference point or\n\n577\n00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:42,830\nacting as reference points,\ncommon language for communication, right?\n\n578\n00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,830\nSo this is very important,\nit's what frameworks provide.\n\n579\n00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,250\nAll right so I know, I think you\nhave the ability to bring that up.\n\n580\n00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:52,180\nSo let's just quickly take a look at the\nlittle chart we're thinking about here.\n\n581\n00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,640\nSo we can see that this lays out for\nus a little bit more thorough vision, but\n\n582\n00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,330\nmore exhaustive, more stuff in there,\nall these different kinds of controls.\n\n583\n00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,300\nThank you for not making me type that out.\n\n584\n00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,950\nSee I told you, if we just figure out\nhow to do it, but don't make you do it.\n\n585\n00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:07,840\nYou'd be a lot happier.\n\n586\n00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,950\nSo, it is great, and\nDon thank you for the work on that.\n\n587\n00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,320\nHe was able to put that together for us.\n\n588\n00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,570\nAs we put our heads together\nbefore the episode and\n\n589\n00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,370\nsaid, how are we gonna put this\ninformation into a useable format?\n\n590\n00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,800\nDon was kind enough to volunteer\nto use the color blue to signify\n\n591\n00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,660\nall these great things for\nus here as you can see.\n\n592\n00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,260\nSo Dan's having a blue day today,\nit looks like, a little bit.\n\n593\n00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,240\nBut it is very helpful for you,\n\n594\n00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,830\nhopefully, to be able to focus on\nhow to present this information.\n\n595\n00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,500\nAnd also how to use it as a study guide.\n\n596\n00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,110\nYou know be helpful for you to look to\nprepare for the exam, to go through this.\n\n597\n00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,850\nRight, absolutely.\nSo Definitely good and\n\n598\n00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:44,062\nvaluable resource force.\n\n599\n00:28:44,062 --> 00:28:46,860\nAll right, I think we have burnt\nthrough an episode I think so,\n\n600\n00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,230\nboy time flies when you are having fun.\n\n601\n00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,200\nDoesn't it?\n\n602\n00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,300\nI will tell you what ladies and gentlemen,\nwe will take a quick break here.\n\n603\n00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,760\nAs you guys get up stretch the legs,\ndo what you got to do, and\n\n604\n00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,940\nwe will be back in just a few\nto continue on with our CISSP.\n\n605\n00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:05,870\nSee you in a few [SOUND] All right\nwelcome back everybody to our risk,\n\n606\n00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:11,640\nI'm sorry I forgot it is what we're doing.\n\n607\n00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,320\nOur risk and [CROSSTALK] Then we could\njust jump all over the place, right?\n\n608\n00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,784\nYeah. Sure.\nIf you watch all of the episodes,\n\n609\n00:29:17,784 --> 00:29:20,961\nyou will [CROSSTALK] I got an awesome\npresentation on how to brew the perfect\n\n610\n00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:21,671\ncup of coffee.\n\n611\n00:29:21,671 --> 00:29:23,410\n[LAUGH] We could trot that out here,\nif you want.\n\n612\n00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,287\nI got diagrams and everything.\n\n613\n00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:25,080\n[LAUGH] It's really cool.\n\n614\n00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,780\nAnd the way you are on your coffee,\nI might actually watch that one.\n\n615\n00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,200\nThat's a serious episode right there.\n\n616\n00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,970\nYes.\nThat is, that is.\n\n617\n00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:34,470\nWelcome back to our risk and\ngovernance episode here.\n\n618\n00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,790\nContinuing on where we left off.\n\n619\n00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:40,660\nWe've talked about some fundamentals\nof fundamental principals security the,\n\n620\n00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,300\nthe IEC pillars We talked about some\nof our security definitions and\n\n621\n00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,950\nlaid some framework there,\nsome foundations there so.\n\n622\n00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,780\nContinuing onto that, we'll head on into,\nwhat do we have next?\n\n623\n00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,570\nWell we're gonna just cycle back\nto frameworks for a minute,\n\n624\n00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,700\ntalk a bit about that.\n\n625\n00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,690\nProbably a good thing to\nreview there quickly,\n\n626\n00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,410\nadd a little depth to in our notes,\nand we'll continue on.\n\n627\n00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,950\nThere was actually one other\nthing I wanted to throw out,\n\n628\n00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:03,570\nI wanted to go back to the three\ncontrol types for a minute.\n\n629\n00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,530\nIf you put the notes up,\n\n630\n00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:08,740\njust give you another point of reference\nthat we often hear, which is technical\n\n631\n00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:13,720\ncontrols are often commonly referred to\nas logical controls as well, by the way.\n\n632\n00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:18,390\nAnd we often see administrative controls\nbeing referred to as soft controls.\n\n633\n00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:23,050\nThis is more slang, IT shorthand,\nmaybe not official but\n\n634\n00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:26,220\nsoft controls, where as physical controls\nare referred to as hard controls\n\n635\n00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,200\nas a result of thinking through that.\n\n636\n00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,470\nJust some alternate ways of\nrepresenting that information for you.\n\n637\n00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,090\nRight, and then as we...\n\n638\n00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,380\nAll about getting the language Yeah.\n\n639\n00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,300\nGetting the language down.\n\n640\n00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,540\nSo you've got the formal language.\n\n641\n00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,555\nNow, we're kinda getting\nto the subcultural context.\n\n642\n00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:40,645\nMm-hm.\nOn the underflow there.\n\n643\n00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:43,390\n[LAUGH] But logical controls would\nbe the one I would focus on there.\n\n644\n00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,075\nMaybe put a little asterisk next to that.\n\n645\n00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:47,030\nMm-hm.\nCuz you often hear those two terms used\n\n646\n00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,160\ninterchangeably.\n\n647\n00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,330\nTechnical or logical controls\nare referred to in the same breath.\n\n648\n00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,650\nAnd they do mean the same thing.\n\n649\n00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,450\nRight.\nJust so you're clear on that.\n\n650\n00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,580\nAnd then as we continue down,\nlet's go back to frameworks.\n\n651\n00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,280\nLet's just talk about some other things\nthat go up under frameworks there.\n\n652\n00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,660\nWe'll get down to risk analysis,\n\n653\n00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,245\nkind of previewing that for\neverybody in a couple minutes.\n\n654\n00:31:03,245 --> 00:31:04,500\n[INAUDIBLE] Exactly.\n\n655\n00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,180\nDidn't see that,\npay no attention to that by the way.\n\n656\n00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,900\nWe're good at previewing that stuff,\nthat pops up all the time when you and\n\n657\n00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,010\nI are working together.\n\n658\n00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,640\nSo, security framework right?\n\n659\n00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,310\nLet's talk about this idea that we\nhave ISO standards out there, ISO,\n\n660\n00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,780\nInternational Standards Organization.\n\n661\n00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,960\nSo the ISO standards are gonna\nbe very important for\n\n662\n00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,620\nus in this area,\nspecifically the 27,000 series.\n\n663\n00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,618\nAs in CISSP candidate as a security\nmanagement, security practitioning\n\n664\n00:31:30,618 --> 00:31:35,194\nprofessional you want to be aware of the\ncurrent standards that exist, the emerging\n\n665\n00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:39,917\nstandards that are out there ISO27000\nseries is gonna be very important for you.\n\n666\n00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:43,737\nIn particular, to be aware of and\nbecome a little bit more conversant with.\n\n667\n00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,118\nMm-hm.\nSo please be aware of that.\n\n668\n00:31:45,118 --> 00:31:50,316\nIt's built on the original\nStandards that build into ISO27000\n\n669\n00:31:50,316 --> 00:31:56,144\nnow are the British standard,\nthe BS7799 Standard which was the British\n\n670\n00:31:56,144 --> 00:32:01,270\nstandard that was used for\ninformation security management 77.\n\n671\n00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:01,830\n77.\n99.\n\n672\n00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,920\nThere we go, right, 7799.\n\n673\n00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,730\nAnd so that was the original grouping\nof standards that kind of is behind\n\n674\n00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:11,550\nthe scenes and underneath is some of\nthe bedrock that underlies ISO27000 today.\n\n675\n00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:14,370\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n676\n00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,015\nIt's one of those historical\nnotations we often throw out.\n\n677\n00:32:17,015 --> 00:32:18,645\nGo out and talk about this material.\n\n678\n00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,455\nBut it's important kind of as a starting\npoint for you to be aware of.\n\n679\n00:32:21,455 --> 00:32:26,245\nSo there's a long laundry list of\nthe ISO27000 Series Standards.\n\n680\n00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:29,405\nThey go from 27,001\ncurrently up to 27,037.\n\n681\n00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,905\nSo there are many, many of them.\n\n682\n00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:34,410\nWe're not going to detail them\nall out here for you today.\n\n683\n00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,135\n[LAUGH] What I would\nsuggest you do is go out,\n\n684\n00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:41,790\nuse your fingers to go out and\nGoogle a little bit, do a little.\n\n685\n00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,580\nRomp through the ISO Standards there,\nread up on them a little bit.\n\n686\n00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,620\nBe aware of them.\n\n687\n00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:50,880\nPut this in context for you, right, this\nis not an exam about ISO Standards, right?\n\n688\n00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,680\nSo being a CISSP is about being aware of,\nand\n\n689\n00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,880\napplying common sense and\nindustry best practices.\n\n690\n00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,450\nTo everyday issues.\n\n691\n00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:02,050\nIt is not about becoming an expert\nin just ISO standards, so\n\n692\n00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,320\nwe want you to be aware of them.\n\n693\n00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,770\nWe don't want you to be\nbecome an ISO expert,\n\n694\n00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,770\nunless that is what you are looking to do.\n\n695\n00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,830\nSo, put that in perspective,\nhopefully and understand that.\n\n696\n00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,590\nJust be aware of that for what it is.\n\n697\n00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,150\nWhen we are talking about frameworks, we\nalso have a lot of different frameworks.\n\n698\n00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,920\nWe mentioned a couple, ITIL and COBIT.\n\n699\n00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,860\nThought I'd threw just\na few more out there for\n\n700\n00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,660\nyou that you may come\nacross at some point.\n\n701\n00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,050\nMay just want to have some passing\nknowledge of at least the awareness of.\n\n702\n00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,670\nSo when we talk about this\nidea of enterprise frameworks,\n\n703\n00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:34,900\nwe talk about things like, TOGAF,\nT-O-G AF is the acronym TOGAF.\n\n704\n00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,610\nWe may talk about DoDAF.\n\n705\n00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:39,150\nCapital D, small O, D A F.\n\n706\n00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:39,990\nDoDAF.\n\n707\n00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,518\nWe talk about MODAF.\n\n708\n00:33:41,518 --> 00:33:43,450\nAs in Mo' Money, right?\n\n709\n00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,770\nMoDAF.\n\n710\n00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,160\nSo, these are all frameworks.\n\n711\n00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,010\nMODAF is actually capital M and capital O.\n\n712\n00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,210\nThat one is all capitalized.\n\n713\n00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,830\nSo, these are different frameworks\nthat are developed either through\n\n714\n00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,690\ndifferent military,\nand/or defense solutions.\n\n715\n00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:00,510\nThese are all typically focused on MODAF\nfor instance is a British Ministry of\n\n716\n00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:05,150\nDefense standard, DODAF is\nthe US Department of Defense standard,\n\n717\n00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:09,720\nTOGAF comes from the group called the open\ngroup that does open architecture\n\n718\n00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,040\nframeworks, so these are all different\nkinds of enterprise frameworks and\n\n719\n00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,540\nthey exist out there.\n\n720\n00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,720\nThere are a lot of other ones.\n\n721\n00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:22,920\nSABSA, S-A-B-S-A, is another framework\nthat is out there, very, very popular.\n\n722\n00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,050\nSo it's an enterprise architecture and\ndevelopment model.\n\n723\n00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,140\nSo there are many of these out there.\n\n724\n00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:33,290\nCOSO, C-O-S-O, is a corporate\ngovernance framework, along with COBIT.\n\n725\n00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,550\nThese are seen as corporate\ngovernance frameworks.\n\n726\n00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:38,550\nLots of different ones you\ncould look at out there.\n\n727\n00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,360\nJust, again, thinking about them.\n\n728\n00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,740\nBeing aware of them.\n\n729\n00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,840\nYou may hear them in discussions.\n\n730\n00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,870\nI wouldn't run out and\n\n731\n00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:48,490\nbecome operationally aware of these if\nyou don't work in the defense areas.\n\n732\n00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,160\nRight.\nYou may never come across DoDAF or\n\n733\n00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,160\nMODAF, right?\n\n734\n00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,320\nBecause, if you work in\nthe military sector,\n\n735\n00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,390\nDoDAF is something you are familiar with.\n\n736\n00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,320\nIf you don't, you may actually\nnever see it in the private sector.\n\n737\n00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,120\nWe don't really refer to DoDAF at all.\n\n738\n00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,960\nRight.\nWe may use some of the elements of it,\n\n739\n00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,380\nbecause it's built on this concept\nof best practice architecture.\n\n740\n00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,920\nBut we will have it branded under\nsomething else like COSO, or COBIT,\n\n741\n00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,200\nor SABSA, or whatever it may be.\n\n742\n00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,480\nSo, as a result, you really don't want\nto spend a lot of time understanding\n\n743\n00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,300\nthe intricacies of all of these, but\n\n744\n00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:18,730\nrather just awareness of\nthe fact that they exist.\n\n745\n00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,890\nRight so just be aware of that.\n\n746\n00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,730\nAnd then many many more of them,\nby the way as well,\n\n747\n00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,970\nwe're not going to detail out all of them.\n\n748\n00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:28,200\nBut just talking point for you to at\nleast think through and be aware of.\n\n749\n00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,140\nSo having said that, you may have your\nown favorite frameworks of course.\n\n750\n00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,882\nWe'd encourage you, if you do have any,\n\n751\n00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:35,880\nwant to throw them in the chat window,\ntell us about them, that would be awesome.\n\n752\n00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,270\nWould love to hear about those.\n\n753\n00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:41,720\nIf not, then obviously just keep\nin mind that these exist and\n\n754\n00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,580\nthere are many of them out there for\nyou to look at.\n\n755\n00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,138\nSo when we talked about framers,\n\n756\n00:35:46,138 --> 00:35:49,423\nwe wrapped up this idea of how we put\neverything together in some sort of\n\n757\n00:35:49,423 --> 00:35:52,410\na referenceable solution that\nevery body has access to.\n\n758\n00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,790\nWe think about this idea as being\nable to share this information\n\n759\n00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,550\nmake people aware of it, that's one\nof the key things with the framework.\n\n760\n00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,660\nFor it to be successful and applied\nproperly, we have to communicate it and\n\n761\n00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,990\ncreate an awareness of it and\nmake sure we are telling people story\n\n762\n00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:09,940\nbehind that framework and\nhow it then becomes relevant to that so\n\n763\n00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,170\ncreate relevancy is very\nimportant in that regard.\n\n764\n00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:17,270\nOne of the ways to create relevancy is\nthrough this idea of risk identification,\n\n765\n00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,180\nrisk management,\n\n766\n00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,623\nrisk awareness, all things we deal\nwith when it comes to risk, right?\n\n767\n00:36:21,623 --> 00:36:23,660\nSo we don't want to have\nthe big red flashing light.\n\n768\n00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,695\nIt doesn't come up above my head but\nit should.\n\n769\n00:36:25,695 --> 00:36:27,790\n[LAUGH] It should say, hey this is cool.\n\n770\n00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,350\nBut more importantly what it\nreally should say is risk, right?\n\n771\n00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:32,830\nBecause everywhere we go there is a risk.\n\n772\n00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,180\nThere is a risk of things\nthat could go wrong.\n\n773\n00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:38,450\nThings that are going right stop\ngoing right, and start going wrong\n\n774\n00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:42,250\nthings that have never gone on\nbefore can suddenly start happening.\n\n775\n00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,490\nRisk, in other words,\nis all around us, everywhere we go.\n\n776\n00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,120\nI mean you look at everything we do\npotentially has a risk associated with it.\n\n777\n00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,560\nWe want to understand risk and really\nthis is one of the key areas that in this\n\n778\n00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:56,660\nparticular body of knowledge, focus area,\nin this part of the domains of knowledge\n\n779\n00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:01,980\nthat practitioners, CISSPs are really\nvaluable because they bring this idea and\n\n780\n00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,830\nthis awareness of the dialog\naround risk to the business.\n\n781\n00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,770\nAnd we can have the dialog discussion\nabout risk in relation to identifying\n\n782\n00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:12,560\nrisk, what is risk, risk management,\nlet's deal with the ways in which we can\n\n783\n00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,515\nidentify risk and then somehow\nmanage it through the organization.\n\n784\n00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:19,950\nLife-cycle, and then making sure we\nunderstand how to not lose our heads,\n\n785\n00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,330\nnot go crazy, not just go to pieces\nthe first time something goes wrong, but\n\n786\n00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:27,910\nrather plan, be proactive, have policies,\nhave standards, have guidelines, have\n\n787\n00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:31,600\nprocedures that help us to manage risk\nthrough the life-cycle of the business.\n\n788\n00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,420\nThis is all very important things.\n\n789\n00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,640\nYou know let's talk about risk.\n\n790\n00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,670\nLet's talk about what risk is.\n\n791\n00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:41,360\nLet's talk about why we have risk and\nwhy we face risk as an organization.\n\n792\n00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:45,560\nYou know we typically will have\nassets as we identified earlier that\n\n793\n00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,710\nthreat actors may want to take advantage\nof in some way through vulnerabilities.\n\n794\n00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:54,550\nTrying to use our language from our\nearlier episode, so we have assets that\n\n795\n00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,760\nthreat actors or threat agents,\nthey want to take advantage of,\n\n796\n00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,050\nthey want to somehow manipulate through\nvulnerabilities that are discovered,\n\n797\n00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:06,050\nthat lead to threats which\nultimately lead to risks.\n\n798\n00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,340\nAnd so we want to understand those things,\n\n799\n00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,270\nidentify them, understand what they\nare and why they're important to\n\n800\n00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:14,310\nthe business by way of starting to\nidentify and then understand risk.\n\n801\n00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,090\nAnd so, one of the things we will\ntalk about doing in one of our future\n\n802\n00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,090\ndiscussions, will be this idea\nof business impact analysis.\n\n803\n00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,340\nDifferent from risk,\ndifferent from risk management.\n\n804\n00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:27,170\nAlthough, done side by side typically, the\noutput of this business impact analysis,\n\n805\n00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,520\nof a BIA, becomes typically the input for\nrisk assessment\n\n806\n00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,860\nas we'll understand the things that are\nimportant to the business prioritized and\n\n807\n00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,020\nas a result then deal with risks.\n\n808\n00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,400\nSo we want to understand what is important\nin order then to assess the risks that\n\n809\n00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,980\neach of those identities brings with them\nmeaning you know an asset being linked to\n\n810\n00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:50,000\nthe businesses being mission critical\nis going to be potentially at more risk\n\n811\n00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,980\nthan an asset that is lowered\ndown on that priority chain.\n\n812\n00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,530\nSo whether or not we have a ability to\nmake fresh coffee in the morning is\n\n813\n00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:00,381\nprobably [LAUGH] not as impactful from\na risk perspective as it is that we may or\n\n814\n00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:02,665\nmay not be able to get our email for\ninstance,\n\n815\n00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:06,040\nright .Unless we happen to be in\nthe business of selling coffee.\n\n816\n00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,250\nIn which case, then, not being able\nto create coffee could be a very big\n\n817\n00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,838\nliability, very big risk for\nour business, right.\n\n818\n00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:16,040\nSo want to make sure we\nunderstand risk in the context\n\n819\n00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,940\nof what it is the business does, and what\nthe information that is under management\n\n820\n00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,700\nthe assets under management represents.\n\n821\n00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,900\nSo understand risk within or\nin the context of the business.\n\n822\n00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,130\nVery important thought\nprocess there because if we\n\n823\n00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,630\ngo out of our way to identify and\nthen react a certain risk but\n\n824\n00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,358\nthey are contextually not\nrelevant to our business.\n\n825\n00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:41,316\nWe're going to waste a lot of time and\nenergy on focus maybe in this area over\n\n826\n00:39:41,316 --> 00:39:45,879\nhere when in fact we should be focused\nover here on the threat actors,\n\n827\n00:39:45,879 --> 00:39:47,867\nthe threat agents out there.\n\n828\n00:39:47,867 --> 00:39:51,588\nMay even be behind the idea we've been\nredirected to focus over here and\n\n829\n00:39:51,588 --> 00:39:55,495\nas a result of that, Are gonna be waiting\nfor us to be distracted to then take\n\n830\n00:39:55,495 --> 00:39:59,480\nadvantage of the opportunities that\nassets over here may actually entail.\n\n831\n00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,290\nSo, wanna make sure we're thinking about\nthis since we start talking about risk.\n\n832\n00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,836\nSo, we can have a risk\nmanagement policy in place.\n\n833\n00:40:06,836 --> 00:40:10,540\nRisk management is gonna be very\nimportant as an overarching concern,\n\n834\n00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:15,010\noverarching indicator of being prepared\nand being proactive in the business.\n\n835\n00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,570\nSo, risk management policies are good.\n\n836\n00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:17,860\nWe'll talk about those.\n\n837\n00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,570\nAlso, have a risk management team.\n\n838\n00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,040\nWhat's the risk management policy gonna do\nif we don't have people to implement it\n\n839\n00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,260\nand keep an eye on it.\n\n840\n00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,410\nCan't believe people identified as\nbeing key to the risk management\n\n841\n00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,750\nthought process or\npart of risk management teams.\n\n842\n00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,865\nSo, we start by doing a risk assessment,\nhow do we figure out the risks we face.\n\n843\n00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:36,280\nWana do a risk assessment in\norder to figure that out.\n\n844\n00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,125\nAnd s,o let's talk about\na risk assessment may be.\n\n845\n00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:42,495\nIt is really a method to\nidentify vulnerabilities\n\n846\n00:40:42,495 --> 00:40:46,785\nthat we may have associated with assets\nin the business, vulnerability and\n\n847\n00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:48,885\nthreats actually that may be associated.\n\n848\n00:40:48,885 --> 00:40:52,230\nSo, when we think about a risk assessment,\nwe're thinking about\n\n849\n00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,870\nidentifying vulnerabilities and\nthreats that our assets may face.\n\n850\n00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,270\nThis will be important.\n\n851\n00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,720\nAnd so, as a result of doing a risk\nassessment, if we're doing it\n\n852\n00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,490\nthe right way, will get back a freeze\nframe, a moment in time picture\n\n853\n00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:12,130\nof what that current what we call risk\nprofile for these assets may look like.\n\n854\n00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,340\nAnd so, if we do a risk assessment today,\nright here right now,\n\n855\n00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,250\non something that we are doing for\ninstance maybe putting information down in\n\n856\n00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,460\nour notes, the risk assessment could be,\nwell, what if the keyboard stops working.\n\n857\n00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,100\nIt may not be able to put those down.\n\n858\n00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,120\nDo we have a different mechanism,\nwhat we call a coping strategy or\n\n859\n00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,730\na mitigation strategy?\n\n860\n00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:33,080\nCould be voice control.\n\n861\n00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,240\nWe talked about naturally speak in one\nof our breaks you and I were talking.\n\n862\n00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,720\nMaybe, get naturally speak, or naturally\nspeak in here, with a little dragon type.\n\n863\n00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,570\nI put the word into the upper management,\nbut they haven't gotten back to me yet.\n\n864\n00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:45,140\nYeah, right.\nSo, we can actually then just have Siri or\n\n865\n00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,380\nsomething like that.\n\n866\n00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,800\nWe can have an automated process,\n\n867\n00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,810\nthen maybe voice control and\nallow us to do that.\n\n868\n00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,930\nWe could just go out and\nhire ourselves an intern.\n\n869\n00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:53,980\nThat could also be\nanother coping strategy.\n\n870\n00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,190\nTransfer that risk right over.\n\n871\n00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:57,020\nWe could transfer the risk\nto that intern and\n\n872\n00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,230\nmake them in charge of information intake.\n\n873\n00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,690\nGive it a very fancy title so\nthey think they have an important job.\n\n874\n00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,750\nSo, we have all these ways.\n\n875\n00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,860\nWe'll deal with these mechanisms,\nby the way, in just a minute.\n\n876\n00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,120\nBut the idea is that we wanna understand,\nwe do our risk assessment first.\n\n877\n00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:14,630\nAnd so, ultimately the risk assessment\nthen is gonna have four main goals.\n\n878\n00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,300\nThe risk assessment will lead us\nto risk analysis, the output, and\n\n879\n00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,040\nthen those risk analysis items.\n\n880\n00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:23,340\nFour main goals associated\nwith risk analysis, so\n\n881\n00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,335\nwe wanna make sure we are aware of,\nso what are they?\n\n882\n00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:29,800\nWe're going to identify assets and\ntheir value to the organization.\n\n883\n00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,130\nThat's part of doing a risk assessment.\n\n884\n00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,580\nSo, what are the assets?\n\n885\n00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,290\nWhat is their importance?\n\n886\n00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:37,350\nHow important is this asset?\n\n887\n00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,630\nHow important is that machine?\n\n888\n00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,840\nThings like that.\n\n889\n00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,280\nWant to identify vulnerabilities and\n\n890\n00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,050\nthreats, another main\ngoal of this process.\n\n891\n00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,290\nIdentify vulnerabilities and threats.\n\n892\n00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:48,180\nWant to quantify.\n\n893\n00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,840\nMeasure.\nQuantify means to measure.\n\n894\n00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,660\nWanna quantify, wanna measure,\nas we said the business impact and\n\n895\n00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:59,460\nthe probability of some sort of bad\nthing happening for these threats.\n\n896\n00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:03,730\nSo, wanna understand that, what's called\nthe BIA, the business impact analysis, and\n\n897\n00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,390\nunderstand what that impact potentially,\nexcuse me, could be.\n\n898\n00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:10,790\nAnd then,\nwe wanna also make sure we balance.\n\n899\n00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:15,487\nCome up with some way of understanding an\neconomic balance between the application\n\n900\n00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:16,964\nof a counter-measure and\n\n901\n00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:20,740\nthe threat that the risk potentially\nrepresents to the business.\n\n902\n00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,298\nSo, don't go out and\nspend the $25,000 to mitigate the risk,\n\n903\n00:43:24,298 --> 00:43:26,603\nif the risk is only a $5,000 exposure.\n\n904\n00:43:26,603 --> 00:43:28,585\nAnd we'll talk about this, and this idea,\n\n905\n00:43:28,585 --> 00:43:31,059\nwe have a formula that helps\nus to manage through that.\n\n906\n00:43:31,059 --> 00:43:31,660\nRight.\n\n907\n00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,510\nSo, we'll talk about l equals\nc times arrow, later on.\n\n908\n00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,580\nWe're not gonna get to it right now.\n\n909\n00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:40,070\nBut this idea of annual loss expectancy is\ngonna help us understand how often does\n\n910\n00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:44,823\nthis thing occur, what does it cost, is a\nsingle loss expectancy times arrow and, or\n\n911\n00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:46,029\nrate of occurrence.\n\n912\n00:43:46,029 --> 00:43:47,944\nIt tells us what it costs\nover the course of the year.\n\n913\n00:43:47,944 --> 00:43:51,784\nAnd if it costs more, the risk does,\nthe vulnerability does,\n\n914\n00:43:51,784 --> 00:43:53,480\nthen the how to measure.\n\n915\n00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,120\nThat's a good deal, let's go do that.\n\n916\n00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,160\nIf the counter measure costs more, we may\nor may not do it based on the amount of\n\n917\n00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,450\ntime, the number of years that we look at\nthat counter measure being applied for.\n\n918\n00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:05,400\nSo, we are gonna talk through that and\nhelp you to understand that, but\n\n919\n00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,910\nrisk analysis has those\ngoals associated with it, so\n\n920\n00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:09,350\nwe wanna make sure we understand that.\n\n921\n00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,900\nWe do the risk assessment and\nthen analyze the results.\n\n922\n00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:14,110\nAnd those are the things that\nwe wanna really understand.\n\n923\n00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,605\nAnd the idea would be to have\na cost benefit analysis,\n\n924\n00:44:16,605 --> 00:44:20,322\nof what the risk is versus what we have to\ndo to fix it, to truly understand risk,\n\n925\n00:44:20,322 --> 00:44:22,548\ntruly understand what\nthe impact of it will be.\n\n926\n00:44:22,548 --> 00:44:25,812\nAnd as a result, whether or\nnot we can then claim that risk and\n\n927\n00:44:25,812 --> 00:44:29,973\nsomehow manage it through the information\nand asset management life cycle.\n\n928\n00:44:29,973 --> 00:44:33,918\nOr if we have to avoid that risk and\nperhaps just not engage in the behavior\n\n929\n00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:37,746\nthat will lead us to be exposed by\nthat risk becoming part of what we do.\n\n930\n00:44:37,746 --> 00:44:39,730\nSo, please be aware of that.\n\n931\n00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,995\nSo, risk analysis has to be very\nimportant, has to be supported by the most\n\n932\n00:44:44,995 --> 00:44:48,564\nsenior management elements of\nthe organization to be successful.\n\n933\n00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:49,656\nRight, you have to have the backing.\n\n934\n00:44:49,656 --> 00:44:54,074\nWe don't have senior management buy in or\nbacking, typically will mean us c level\n\n935\n00:44:54,074 --> 00:44:58,365\nexecutives in the organization have to be\non board with this idea of identifying\n\n936\n00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:01,645\nrisk and then trying to figure\nout a way to manage through it.\n\n937\n00:45:01,645 --> 00:45:05,526\nIf they are not, we could actually\nsee risks going un-categorized,\n\n938\n00:45:05,526 --> 00:45:09,081\nrisks going unrecognized, and\npotentially un-managed, and\n\n939\n00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:12,730\nthat can also lead to catastrophic\nevents if we're not careful.\n\n940\n00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:13,716\nSo, please be aware of that.\n\n941\n00:45:13,716 --> 00:45:16,157\nThe risk management team or\nthe risk analysis team,\n\n942\n00:45:16,157 --> 00:45:18,657\nrather I should say excuse\nme folks on risk analysis.\n\n943\n00:45:18,657 --> 00:45:21,459\nRisk analysis team has to\nbe made up of specialists,\n\n944\n00:45:21,459 --> 00:45:25,480\nindividuals that specialize in certain\naspects of this kind of behavior.\n\n945\n00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,370\nSo, you want people that\nunderstand business analysis.\n\n946\n00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:32,650\nBAs, business analysts,\nthey're good at doing this kind of work.\n\n947\n00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:37,080\nYou want change management specialists,\npeople from the PMO, project management\n\n948\n00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,760\noffice that understand how to manage,\ndocument, and deal with change,\n\n949\n00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,110\nwould be good people to think about as\nbeing potentially candidates for this.\n\n950\n00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,838\nYou want IT knowledge specialists,\n\n951\n00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:50,079\npeople that specialize in these areas\nto be part of this team as well.\n\n952\n00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,893\nBecause they are gonna bring that\ntechnical knowledge down into the team and\n\n953\n00:45:53,893 --> 00:45:57,167\nsay, okay, when we look at email,\nwe have this kind of a system,\n\n954\n00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:58,314\nit does these things.\n\n955\n00:45:58,314 --> 00:46:01,890\nHere's where the potential\nexposure points are.\n\n956\n00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,160\nAnd let's then understand that.\n\n957\n00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,310\nWhereas the business analysts and\nthe change managers\n\n958\n00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:09,600\nare gonna have to help us to understand\nhow to document and prioritize.\n\n959\n00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,660\nAnd that's really what they do.\n\n960\n00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,110\nSo, that's where we're going\nto see the value there.\n\n961\n00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:17,660\nSo, different specialists being brought\nto bear based on the make up of a team,\n\n962\n00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,570\nvery important as a thought process.\n\n963\n00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:20,090\nAbsolutely.\n\n964\n00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:22,350\nSo, we can think of different\nways of making up a team.\n\n965\n00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,120\nA team could be virtual.\n\n966\n00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,700\nRight.\nMay not be everybody in the same place\n\n967\n00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,240\nphysically doing this at the same time.\n\n968\n00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,880\nCould be a physical team where everybody\nmeets together in the same place.\n\n969\n00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,210\nWell, it could be a hybrid.\n\n970\n00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,008\nYeah And we could also outsource,\nyou're absolutely right.\n\n971\n00:46:35,008 --> 00:46:39,329\nYou have the down side of risk analysis\non the analysis being outsourced.\n\n972\n00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:42,682\n[LAUGH] So, the down side there could be\nif you outsource, what are you getting?\n\n973\n00:46:42,682 --> 00:46:44,910\nMaybe going with a reputable firm.\n\n974\n00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:49,250\nSo, that firm may add value, which could\nalso potentially be going with somebody,\n\n975\n00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:52,160\nmeaning an entity who\nmay not be appropriate.\n\n976\n00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,270\nI often see a mismatch with a lot\nof my clients, my customers,\n\n977\n00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,620\nwhen they go out and they look for\nan outsource provider.\n\n978\n00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:03,050\nIs that provider gonna be in the silo,\nin the vertical that you are in, and\n\n979\n00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,530\nit's very important that they\nhave expertise in that field.\n\n980\n00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,520\nDo they do health care,\ndo they do finance,\n\n981\n00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,560\ndo they do extractive resource management,\nmining, things like that?\n\n982\n00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,914\nIf you're in a specialty vertical, and you\ngo out and get a generalist, it's gonna be\n\n983\n00:47:16,914 --> 00:47:21,033\nreally tough to do a good risk analysis\nbecause there's risk associated with your\n\n984\n00:47:21,033 --> 00:47:25,058\nvertical that is unique to the specifics\nof your environment, and what you do.\n\n985\n00:47:25,058 --> 00:47:30,109\nAnd I can tell you for a fact,\nin bio-pharmaceutical area in finance,\n\n986\n00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:34,320\nin extractive industries,\nthere is a tremendous amount of\n\n987\n00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,549\nsilo specific risk that\ngeneralists are just not aware of.\n\n988\n00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:43,837\nIf you don't know that industry, you\nwill not, retail's another good example.\n\n989\n00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:47,686\nYou will not understand product placement\nand the risk associated with product\n\n990\n00:47:47,686 --> 00:47:51,134\nplacement versus product loss if\nyou're not specializing in retail,\n\n991\n00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,752\nyou're just not gonna get that.\n\n992\n00:47:52,752 --> 00:47:55,028\nSo, you're not gonna assess for that,\nyou're not gonna understand that.\n\n993\n00:47:55,028 --> 00:48:00,170\nAnd so as a result, you really got to look\nfor, when you outsource, specialization.\n\n994\n00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:01,660\nThat is a risk in and of itself.\n\n995\n00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:06,570\nDo your vendor understand your vertical,\nand if they don't, how do you know?\n\n996\n00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,540\nAnd how do you go get that information\nto get that expertise, right?\n\n997\n00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,700\nSo it's very important as well.\n\n998\n00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,110\nVery, very important as well.\n\n999\n00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:15,520\nAnd I don't work in all verticals,\nI work in some, I don't work in all.\n\n1000\n00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,430\nBut the ones that I do work in,\nI spend a lot of time in.\n\n1001\n00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:22,660\nThe ones that i don't, I have created\na network, peer of colleagues especially\n\n1002\n00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:28,130\npeople I can warmly refer my\ncustomers to as somebody who I feel\n\n1003\n00:48:28,130 --> 00:48:32,870\nin my professional practice, my opinion\nas a CISSP in good standing will\n\n1004\n00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:37,750\nrepresent them and their interest well and\nyou have to bring that social network.\n\n1005\n00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,950\nWe were joking about social networking\noffline right during the break and\n\n1006\n00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,350\nhow some of us do and\ndon't engage in social networking,\n\n1007\n00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:47,020\nright I don't typically do much of that.\n\n1008\n00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:51,050\nAs some of you that may have some\nknowledge of me, or who I am, or\n\n1009\n00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:51,775\nwhat I do, know.\n\n1010\n00:48:51,775 --> 00:48:53,930\n[LAUGH] I could go on and on, and rant and\n\n1011\n00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,572\nrave for five minutes,\nmy standard soap box.\n\n1012\n00:48:55,572 --> 00:48:57,160\n[LAUGH] Right.\nAbout social networking.\n\n1013\n00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,360\nBut I don't do much of this.\n\n1014\n00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,230\nI don't do Facebook.\n\n1015\n00:48:59,230 --> 00:48:59,955\nI don't do Twitter.\n\n1016\n00:48:59,955 --> 00:49:00,930\nMm-hm.\nI don't do that stuff.\n\n1017\n00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,530\nNot because I don't think it's valuable.\n\n1018\n00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:04,250\nBut just because it's not\nsomething that i think for\n\n1019\n00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:06,380\nme makes a lot of sense professionally.\n\n1020\n00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,410\nI do find myself on LinkedIn,\nwe talked about that a little bit as well.\n\n1021\n00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,110\nBy the way, I encourage all of you\nlistening if you're interested.\n\n1022\n00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,820\nI think I did this in one of\nour other episodes as well.\n\n1023\n00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,360\nYes you did.\n\n1024\n00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,870\nFeel free Feel free to\nfind me on LinkedIn.\n\n1025\n00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,100\nAnd all kidding aside I'm being\ntotally serious about this.\n\n1026\n00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,640\nI'm out there if you want to link\nup to me and send me an invite.\n\n1027\n00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,790\nHappy to include you in my little\ncircle there of people that I know and\n\n1028\n00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,250\npeople that I work with and talk about.\n\n1029\n00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,100\nYou know because I think it's important\nto build that professional network.\n\n1030\n00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,500\nRight Especially as your\nlooking to become a CISSP.\n\n1031\n00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:38,200\nYour looking to broaden your community,\nbroaden you professional association.\n\n1032\n00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:38,900\nDo that.\n\n1033\n00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,040\nFeel free to do that and\ndo that with other people.\n\n1034\n00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,600\nYeah, this is how you go about web\nof trust and how you can become\n\n1035\n00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,530\nmore valuable to your business\nbecause you find those professionals,\n\n1036\n00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,340\nthose practitioners that\nare valuable to you and\n\n1037\n00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:52,090\nyou can then recommend them to\nother people that have a need and\n\n1038\n00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:54,700\nthis is how you connect and find that\nknowledge out there at the end of the day.\n\n1039\n00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,000\nVery important, very important.\n\n1040\n00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,620\nSo my name is Mike, find me out there.\n\n1041\n00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,790\n[LAUGH] I'm only kidding,\nI'm only kidding, but it is important so\n\n1042\n00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,320\nthink about doing that as well,\nit's obviously very important.\n\n1043\n00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,270\nSo you understand\nthe value of information,\n\n1044\n00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:08,640\nunderstand the value of assets,\nvery important there Talked about that.\n\n1045\n00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,860\nIdentifying vulnerabilities and\n\n1046\n00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:12,880\nthreats one of the key take\naways of risk analysis.\n\n1047\n00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,710\nThe idea there is that\nwe want to make sure\n\n1048\n00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:18,510\nwe identify as much as\npossible what is known to us.\n\n1049\n00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,870\nBut there is this element of risk that\nwe are never going to zero in on totally\n\n1050\n00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:25,210\nWe're never going to lock down\n100% because our risk profile\n\n1051\n00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,450\nis going to be incomplete.\n\n1052\n00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:28,630\nBecause we can never\nzero out all the risks.\n\n1053\n00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:32,550\nAnd we are going to face certain risks\nthat are just not well defined today.\n\n1054\n00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:34,930\nBut at some point in the future\nare going to be well defined.\n\n1055\n00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:38,260\nAnd at that point we will hopefully\nrecognize and identify them.\n\n1056\n00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,150\nSo there are these zero day exploits as we\noften refer to them in the industry that\n\n1057\n00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:47,420\nare lurking out there in code,\nin systems, all sorts of places, right?\n\n1058\n00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,330\nSometimes referred to as\nthe butterfly effect,\n\n1059\n00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:51,700\nrandomness in a project management speak.\n\n1060\n00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,400\nWe often talk about the butterfly effect.\n\n1061\n00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,650\nThis is that era,\nthe element of randomness.\n\n1062\n00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,960\nThat we just don't really know about,\nwe can't account for, right?\n\n1063\n00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,120\nAnd as a result we have to\nbe open to that as well.\n\n1064\n00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,200\nWe can never look at a risk\nassessment as being complete,\n\n1065\n00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,310\nwe look at it as simply being at that\nmoment in time as good as we can make it.\n\n1066\n00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:11,130\nBut it is open to interpretation,\nand ultimately open to revision.\n\n1067\n00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:14,490\nAnd that is why we continuously go back\nand have to do these time and again.\n\n1068\n00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:17,530\nBecause we have to go back and\nconstantly reinvent.\n\n1069\n00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:21,280\nWhat that risk assessment means to the\nbusiness to understand that while it was\n\n1070\n00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,250\ngood today or yesterday or a month or\nwhenever ago, we face new risks today.\n\n1071\n00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,870\nWe have implement new technologies, we\nimplement new services, we restructure our\n\n1072\n00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:33,770\nnetwork, maybe we change what our business\nis doing, we add a new branch or something\n\n1073\n00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:37,010\nthat's going to introduce a whole new set\nof risks that we've got to be aware of.\n\n1074\n00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,690\nThere are, there absolutely is, right.\n\n1075\n00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:39,540\nAnd that is very important.\n\n1076\n00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,850\nAnd so There is some standardization\nout there in the risk world.\n\n1077\n00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,650\nI want to talk about that NIST\ndocumentation for a minute.\n\n1078\n00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:47,830\nWe may even want to throw a url up for\n\n1079\n00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:49,850\none of the NIST publications\nI'm going to give you.\n\n1080\n00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:52,490\nI'll give you a second to just go look.\n\n1081\n00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:53,950\nOkay.\nWe're going to talk about NIST.\n\n1082\n00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:56,020\nYou want to go to nist.gov.\n\n1083\n00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,260\nN, I, S, T is NIST.\n\n1084\n00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,880\nNIST is the National Institute for\nStandards and\n\n1085\n00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,250\nTechnology, the US government, so\nnist.gov as you can see there.\n\n1086\n00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:07,660\nAnd on the NIST site you've got\na huge library of documentation.\n\n1087\n00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,200\nWe're looking for SP.\n\n1088\n00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,380\nSP stands for Special Publication,\nall the NIST documentation is labelled,\n\n1089\n00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,693\nit starts out this way.\n\n1090\n00:52:16,693 --> 00:52:22,410\n800-30, and this is going to be\nthe standard for risk assessment guidance.\n\n1091\n00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:26,390\nThat one right there, probably is going to\nbe the one, or at least gives us a general\n\n1092\n00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:29,040\noverview of it, so\nit will tell us a little bit about it.\n\n1093\n00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,520\nSo the idea, now well there's been\nseveral revisions of it, or there may be.\n\n1094\n00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,380\nThere's a link for it down there.\n\n1095\n00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:33,280\nI think it's on revision one now.\n\n1096\n00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,170\nThat we're on,\nthe final pdf is down there.\n\n1097\n00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,690\nRight over there,\nthat's 39, the one above.\n\n1098\n00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,850\nNow go up above, maybe download it at.\n\n1099\n00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,400\nThere, yeah that's the one.\n\n1100\n00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,520\nRevision one right there.\n\n1101\n00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,800\nSo that pdf url that's the one we\nwant to share with people right now.\n\n1102\n00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,420\nSo this is going to be the current\nstandard in the US government anyway and\n\n1103\n00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,490\nfor US based governmental concerns,\n\n1104\n00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:56,170\nthis is going to be the standard\nthat is used there.\n\n1105\n00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:58,120\nIt's also used by many public sector and\n\n1106\n00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:02,440\nprivate sector solution providers\ntoday to manage and deal with risk.\n\n1107\n00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:07,450\nSo this is 800-30 Rev 1, Revision one for\nthis special publication.\n\n1108\n00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:11,080\nThis is going to be the risk methodology\nused by predominantly as you will see\n\n1109\n00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,988\na lot of Fortune 500, Fortune\nthousand companies use this as well.\n\n1110\n00:53:14,988 --> 00:53:17,660\nSo being a security\nprofessional being a CISSP,\n\n1111\n00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,430\nbeing aware of something like this,\nvery valuable for\n\n1112\n00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:23,910\nyou to be able to speak that language and\nalign yourself with these standards.\n\n1113\n00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,010\nRight.\nSo this will be a good one for\n\n1114\n00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:25,900\nyou to be aware of.\n\n1115\n00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,770\nVery good.\nWe also have something called FRAP\n\n1116\n00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:33,260\nwhich is another risk analysis, risk\nmanagement mechanism that's available.\n\n1117\n00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:36,680\nFRAP stands for\nfacilitated risk analysis process.\n\n1118\n00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,668\nI'll say that slowly.\n\n1119\n00:53:37,668 --> 00:53:41,934\n[LAUGH] [LAUGH]\nFacilitated Risk Analysis Process.\n\n1120\n00:53:41,934 --> 00:53:45,580\nJust what the acronym stands for.\n\n1121\n00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:50,270\nAnd you will find we use a lot of acronyms\nin IT, you probably know this already.\n\n1122\n00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:54,780\nAnd, good thing about this exam, you don't\nhave to know the acronym because we always\n\n1123\n00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,720\nspell out the acronyms in this\nkind of exam because there may\n\n1124\n00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:00,860\nbe more than one meaning, more than\none reference for that acronym, so\n\n1125\n00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,856\nyou're not going to worry about studying\na bunch of acronyms, but you are going to\n\n1126\n00:54:03,856 --> 00:54:07,210\nhave at least want to have a general\nidea of what some of them mean, right.\n\n1127\n00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:11,590\nSo FRAP is just another one of\nthose methodologies, as is Octave.\n\n1128\n00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:13,190\nOctave is another methodology.\n\n1129\n00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,540\nWhen we talk about risk and\nrisk analysis and risk modalities and\n\n1130\n00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,690\nmeasurement of risk.\n\n1131\n00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:19,380\nThis is another methodology.\n\n1132\n00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:23,490\nNot really worried what Octave stands for\nper say, methodology you can just\n\n1133\n00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:26,240\nlook up Octave and obviously find\nout what it is if you're interested.\n\n1134\n00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,870\nThe ideas that we typically\nwell defined inputs.\n\n1135\n00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:33,490\nSo, inputs that are well defined,\nwell defined process in the middle,\n\n1136\n00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:36,740\nwell defined outputs on the back end to\nmanage risk is really what we want to\n\n1137\n00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,530\nunderstand there.\n\n1138\n00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:40,790\nSo, there's lots of different\nmethodologies when we talk about risk.\n\n1139\n00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:43,760\nI've just listed a few of them for\nyou there are many others by the way.\n\n1140\n00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,700\nNot so important to know all of them, but\nrather just to make sure we understand\n\n1141\n00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:52,140\nconceptually that as a practitioner,\nthere are many, many different choices or\n\n1142\n00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:55,580\ntools that we have at our disposal,\nbased on the kind of risk management and\n\n1143\n00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,530\nrisk analysis that we\nmay want to engage in.\n\n1144\n00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,860\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1145\n00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:02,690\nThere is an ISO standard specifically for\n\n1146\n00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:05,010\nthe implementation of\na risk management program.\n\n1147\n00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:09,250\nThis will be ISO 27,000,\nit's in the 27,000 series.\n\n1148\n00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:15,080\nTwo seven zero zero five, 27,005 is the\nISO standard there specifically for that.\n\n1149\n00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,160\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1150\n00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:22,160\nAnd when you look at that kind of\na standard, what you're looking at is,\n\n1151\n00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,020\nagain, internationally recognized best\npractice documentation that anybody from\n\n1152\n00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:31,430\nany entity, government, quasi-government,\npublic private sector can look too for\n\n1153\n00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:34,060\nguidance when we talk\nabout ISO standardization.\n\n1154\n00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,050\nAgain, so please be aware of that as well.\n\n1155\n00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:39,990\nWhen we talk about risk analysis approach,\nI think down below there we did have some\n\n1156\n00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:43,070\nnotes we probably just want to introduce\nhere, at least as a talking point or\n\n1157\n00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,190\na starting point.\n\n1158\n00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:47,440\nYou may want to put a space\nbetween Octave and ISO just so\n\n1159\n00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,790\neverybody under understand said\nsomething different on a sub point.\n\n1160\n00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:50,336\nThere we go.\nSo\n\n1161\n00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:53,881\nlet's quickly introduce this idea\nof risk analysis approaches.\n\n1162\n00:55:53,881 --> 00:55:57,565\nRight, so quantitative risk\nanalysis as you can see there,\n\n1163\n00:55:57,565 --> 00:56:02,333\nqualitative risk analysis, quantitative\nDeals with this idea of what we call\n\n1164\n00:56:02,333 --> 00:56:06,379\nhard measures, so numbers and\ndollars typically are what we think\n\n1165\n00:56:06,379 --> 00:56:11,130\nof here as we look at either KPI's or\nmetrics around how we measure risk.\n\n1166\n00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:14,100\nSo what is the dollar\nvalue impact of this risk?\n\n1167\n00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,390\nThat would be a quantitative measure.\n\n1168\n00:56:16,390 --> 00:56:20,200\nWhereas a qualitative measure\nis seen as a soft measure,\n\n1169\n00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,620\nit is not easily defined,\nit is more of an opinion.\n\n1170\n00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,790\nHow are you feeling today?\n\n1171\n00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:27,610\nHow secure do we feel?\n\n1172\n00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:28,910\nHow secure are we?\n\n1173\n00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:30,435\nA little bit fuzzy.\n\n1174\n00:56:30,435 --> 00:56:32,930\n[LAUGH] Hard to put a number on that.\n\n1175\n00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:35,150\nRight, uh-huh.\nI'm feeling like a two today,\n\n1176\n00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:37,170\non a scale of five.\n\n1177\n00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:38,431\nWe can create up our own terms and\n\n1178\n00:56:38,431 --> 00:56:41,016\njust assign kind of meaning\n[CROSSTALK] within our organization.\n\n1179\n00:56:41,016 --> 00:56:45,014\nWe can but they are called qualitative\nmeasures because they are typically\n\n1180\n00:56:45,014 --> 00:56:47,300\nopinion based as opposed to fact based.\n\n1181\n00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,700\nRight, and that's the difference there.\n\n1182\n00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,220\nSoft versus hard measures.\n\n1183\n00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:55,020\nSo we obviously can rely on quantitative\nmeasures in relation to risk analysis and\n\n1184\n00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,580\nrisk assessment because\nthey give us hard facts.\n\n1185\n00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,440\nRight, we can look at it and\ngo $10,000 every time that thing happens.\n\n1186\n00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,597\nHappens five times a month,\nwe're spending $50,000 a month,\n\n1187\n00:57:05,597 --> 00:57:08,910\n$600,000 a year to address this issue.\n\n1188\n00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:11,670\nIf we spend $30,000 we just netted\n570,000 for the business, right?\n\n1189\n00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,982\nThere's nothing fuzzy or soft about that.\n\n1190\n00:57:13,982 --> 00:57:18,380\n[LAUGH]\nNo, not at all, not at all.\n\n1191\n00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:22,410\nRight, but when we deal with qualitative\nrisk analysis we're dealing with the idea\n\n1192\n00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:25,380\nthat we may not be able to\nmeasure it specifically, but\n\n1193\n00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,460\nit could be something like the impact\nto our business reputation.\n\n1194\n00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,200\nWhat is our standing in the community?\n\n1195\n00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:33,800\nHard to put a specific dollar value\non that, extremely important.\n\n1196\n00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,960\nTarget is struggling with that, right?\n\n1197\n00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,050\nIf we think about what\nhappened with Target recently.\n\n1198\n00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:40,580\nI don't know how many of you maybe\nstill comfortable shopping at Target or\n\n1199\n00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:44,320\nmay not be, not suggesting at all\nthat there's any liability, or\n\n1200\n00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,410\nthere is liability either way\nassociated with making that choice.\n\n1201\n00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:51,870\nWe saw anecdotally and clearly evident,\nno arguing the fact that\n\n1202\n00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:54,110\nthere was liability associated\nwith it a certain point.\n\n1203\n00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:56,700\nBut it's probably safe to say that\nthey've taken steps to mitigate,\n\n1204\n00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,000\nto minimize that, right?\n\n1205\n00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:58,900\nBut having said that,\n\n1206\n00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:03,980\nsome people may just feel that the damage\nto that vendor's reputation is such that\n\n1207\n00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,980\nas a qualitative measure they don't\nfeel as secure shopping there.\n\n1208\n00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:10,840\nBut it's hard to put that into words and\nmeasure what that is, and\n\n1209\n00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,880\nthat is more of a qualitative measure.\n\n1210\n00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,510\nSo we want to make sure we understand\nthe difference there between the two.\n\n1211\n00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:19,093\nRight, very important to think about\nthat as we learn about risk, and\n\n1212\n00:58:19,093 --> 00:58:21,260\nunderstand risk, and measure risk.\n\n1213\n00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,872\nWe often see terms or\n\n1214\n00:58:22,872 --> 00:58:26,990\nsee the analysis quoted in reference in\nterms of qualitative and quantitative.\n\n1215\n00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:28,510\nRight so very important to think about.\n\n1216\n00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:32,020\nYou may not have done this kind of\nan assessment before by the way, so\n\n1217\n00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:34,870\nyou may or may not have had\nthe opportunity to do a quantitative\n\n1218\n00:58:34,870 --> 00:58:37,060\nversus qualitative\ncomparison of something.\n\n1219\n00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:40,190\nBut if you think about the logic\nof this you can find many ways and\n\n1220\n00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,260\nexamples where this would apply.\n\n1221\n00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:45,460\nAnd we are typically in our\nrole as security professionals,\n\n1222\n00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:49,760\ninformation security professionals in\nparticular forced and asked to deal with\n\n1223\n00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,050\nin the business every day, elements of\nrisk that have both quantitative and\n\n1224\n00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:55,270\nqualitative associations with them.\n\n1225\n00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:58,540\nSo we may be asked, hey what is\nthe value of implementing this system?\n\n1226\n00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,830\nWhat's the dollar impact in the business?\n\n1227\n00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,250\nSomething like that and\nwe may also be asked whether or\n\n1228\n00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:05,820\nnot we feel this will make us more secure.\n\n1229\n00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:10,580\nI have a lot of senior level\nconversations with C level executives and\n\n1230\n00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,490\nbusinesses all over the world\nabout this kind of stuff.\n\n1231\n00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:16,310\nHow successful are we gonna be?\n\n1232\n00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:19,490\nHow secure are we gonna be\nas a result of doing this?\n\n1233\n00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:23,850\nWhen we want to go into the cloud we want\nto virtualize whatever that technology\n\n1234\n00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:24,495\nmay be.\n\n1235\n00:59:24,495 --> 00:59:30,921\nHow, excuse me, how secure how successful\nwill we be if we do this or that.\n\n1236\n00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:33,930\nYou know, that could be a quantitative or\nqualitative discussion, but\n\n1237\n00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:37,452\nwhat I typically do is try to frame\nit from both sides for somebody.\n\n1238\n00:59:37,452 --> 00:59:39,390\nSo you know we can look\nat dollar value here, Mr.\n\n1239\n00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:42,411\nand Mrs CEO, or CIO or CTO or whatever.\n\n1240\n00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:45,870\nYeah let's talk numbers but then let's\nalso talk about what this means to\n\n1241\n00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:48,960\nposition your business in\nrelation to your competitors.\n\n1242\n00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,330\nAnd are you more secure as a result of\nbeing able to claim high ground on this\n\n1243\n00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,790\ntechnology area,\nthat's a qualitative measure\n\n1244\n00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:57,050\nbecause in the mind of the customer\nit's going to be hard to measure that.\n\n1245\n00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:00,260\nSo it would probably be a good place for\nus to think about risk and to be assessing\n\n1246\n01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:04,190\nrisk, and to understand that we can\nmeasure it from both perspectives.\n\n1247\n01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:07,925\nVery good, well I think we're going\nto take a quick little break here and\n\n1248\n01:00:07,925 --> 01:00:09,469\njoin us in just a few minutes.\n\n1249\n01:00:09,469 --> 01:00:12,649\nWe'll be right back okay?\n\n1250\n01:00:12,649 --> 01:00:17,027\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back one more time\n\n1251\n01:00:17,027 --> 01:00:21,769\neverybody to our risk and\ngovernance episode.\n\n1252\n01:00:21,769 --> 01:00:24,570\nThis time I actually plugged\nthe mic in and turned it on.\n\n1253\n01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:25,950\nYes, the folks out there are very happy,\n\n1254\n01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:28,888\nthey want to hear you and\nwhat you've got to say, so They do.\n\n1255\n01:00:28,888 --> 01:00:31,410\nYeah we're getting ready\nto dive into some ALES.\n\n1256\n01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:34,170\nQuantitative risk analysis.\n\n1257\n01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,280\nYeah, there you go.\n\n1258\n01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,320\nThat's what I was saying.\n\n1259\n01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,550\nQuantitative risk analysis.\n\n1260\n01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,550\nI like that.\nYeah, well we mentioned risk and\n\n1261\n01:00:39,550 --> 01:00:41,460\nrisk analysis in our last episode.\n\n1262\n01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,980\nSpend some time developing\nthat thought process with you.\n\n1263\n01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,870\nDifferentiate between qualitative and\nquantitative.\n\n1264\n01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:47,750\nAs we were wrapping up.\n\n1265\n01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:51,540\nWanna circle back remind you of that, but\nmore importantly build out the thought\n\n1266\n01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:55,500\nprocess about how we actually engage\nin a quantitative risk analysis.\n\n1267\n01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,450\nAs I mentioned, you may or may not have\nhad an opportunity to do this in your\n\n1268\n01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,610\nprofessional practice up until now.\n\n1269\n01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:03,640\nWe kinda do it intuitively,\nbut we may not name it this,\n\n1270\n01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,310\nwe may not realize there's\na formula we associate with it.\n\n1271\n01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:10,590\nI mentioned the formula in passing\nin our last episode which was ALE,\n\n1272\n01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:14,300\nAnalyze Loss Expectancy is\nmade up of two components.\n\n1273\n01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:18,515\nSLE, what we call single loss expectancy,\ntimes ARO.\n\n1274\n01:01:18,515 --> 01:01:20,552\nA-R-O, annualized rate of occurrence.\n\n1275\n01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,260\nSo I want to walk through this with you,\nbut\n\n1276\n01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,130\nyou know we do a lot of this in our\nprivate lives on a regular basis.\n\n1277\n01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:27,060\nAnd I often talk to my customers,\n\n1278\n01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:30,790\nmy students about the fact that\nsecurity is about common sense.\n\n1279\n01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,180\nThey teach you nothing else.\n\n1280\n01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,120\nIf you learn nothing else about security,\n\n1281\n01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:37,070\nif you understand that if you\nbring common sense to the table,\n\n1282\n01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:41,040\nthen you are well armed and probably gonna\nbe more successful on a regular basis\n\n1283\n01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,420\nthan those around you that\nare lacking in common sense.\n\n1284\n01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:47,840\nYou've already made a tremendously forward\nin terms of professional growth and\n\n1285\n01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,580\nyou now have material for\ncomedic stories and anecdotal lore.\n\n1286\n01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:54,420\nBut after work when you make of\nyour colleagues and workers,\n\n1287\n01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,710\ncoworkers because they did something\nsilly and you stood by and watched them\n\n1288\n01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:01,490\nfall into the black hole before you offer\nto handle lift them out after the fact.\n\n1289\n01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:03,618\nAll right so common sense, very important.\n\n1290\n01:02:03,618 --> 01:02:07,320\nSo you know, I often remember and\nI usually will talk about one or\n\n1291\n01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,240\nmore of these antidotes or\n\n1292\n01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,460\nstories when I talk about this,\nyou I remember being in college.\n\n1293\n01:02:12,555 --> 01:02:16,695\nAnd I remember living on my own,\nI moved out of my house at that point,\n\n1294\n01:02:16,695 --> 01:02:19,275\nmoved away to go to college so\nI was living away from my home and\n\n1295\n01:02:19,275 --> 01:02:22,295\nI remember being on my own for\nalmost the first time.\n\n1296\n01:02:22,295 --> 01:02:23,305\nI traveled before but\n\n1297\n01:02:23,305 --> 01:02:26,696\nnever lived outside of my house for\nany great length for time right.\n\n1298\n01:02:26,696 --> 01:02:30,370\nAnd so I remember going food shopping and\nyou think about the mundane things,\n\n1299\n01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:31,500\nyou don't always think about this stuff,\n\n1300\n01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:34,780\nbut going food shopping when you live\non your own is a pretty standard thing.\n\n1301\n01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:37,089\nYou want to eat,\nyou go food shopping right?\n\n1302\n01:02:37,089 --> 01:02:40,390\n[COUGH] So as a result,\nwhen you live at home with your folks,\n\n1303\n01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,800\nwhen you live with somebody you may or may\nnot do food shopping on a regular basis,\n\n1304\n01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:44,890\nbut when you live on your own you have to.\n\n1305\n01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:46,250\nYou have to do it on a regular basis.\n\n1306\n01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:49,180\nSo if you're well armed,\ncommon sense, right?\n\n1307\n01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,040\nDon't go food shopping when you're hungry.\n\n1308\n01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,310\nBecause if you go food shopping when\nyou're hungry- Come back with some\n\n1309\n01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:54,470\ninteresting things, don't you?\n\n1310\n01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:57,600\nYou buy a lot of stuff that you\nnormally would never buy, normally.\n\n1311\n01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,470\nAnd not only that, but\nyou buy a lot of it.\n\n1312\n01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:01,820\nSo you wonder how do you\npossibly gonna get through.\n\n1313\n01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:05,050\nRight, three or four cases of Twinkies,\nor whatever that might be.\n\n1314\n01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:08,110\nSo everything looks good when you\ngo shopping, and you're hungry.\n\n1315\n01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:11,360\nI remember at that point, I specifically\nremember this was living in Tampa.\n\n1316\n01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:14,260\nI was going to USF, and I went shopping.\n\n1317\n01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,460\nI went food shopping one night and I was\nreally I'd just been working like all day,\n\n1318\n01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,520\nI worked a double.\n\n1319\n01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,720\nAnd I got home I was just famished,\nand I went to the food store.\n\n1320\n01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:25,970\nWalking around Cash and Carry,\nwhich is like Publix or\n\n1321\n01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:30,060\none of those big, Kroger or whatever\nit may be depending on where you live.\n\n1322\n01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:34,210\nThese days Whole Foods and\nFresh Market are all the rage.\n\n1323\n01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,210\nSo it was sort like it was that,\nand so I went in and\n\n1324\n01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:40,580\nwent shopping, I remember I went up\nto the deli and I wanted a sandwich.\n\n1325\n01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:42,870\nI was just hungry.\nI wanted something quickly.\n\n1326\n01:03:42,870 --> 01:03:44,060\nGrabbed a loaf of bread, right?\n\n1327\n01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,020\nGrabbed, I don't know, a pound of meat.\n\n1328\n01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:46,960\nA pound of cheese.\n\n1329\n01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,390\nTurkey and cheese, whatever it was.\n\n1330\n01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:51,733\nAnd I walked around Cash and\nCarry making sandwiches and\n\n1331\n01:03:51,733 --> 01:03:55,083\neating while I was food\nshopping because was so hungry.\n\n1332\n01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:58,658\nAnd yeah this is a college town you\nsee this kind of craziness going\n\n1333\n01:03:58,658 --> 01:04:03,208\non all the time, but the idea is that when\nyou go food shopping when you're hungry,\n\n1334\n01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:07,238\nthe idea of the quantitive risk analysis\nwas it cost me a lot more money Cuz I\n\n1335\n01:04:07,238 --> 01:04:10,359\nwasn't prepared,\nI didn't have safeguards in place.\n\n1336\n01:04:10,359 --> 01:04:11,540\nI hadn't eaten before\nI went food shopping.\n\n1337\n01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:14,970\nDidn't do my list of what I needed,\ndidn't have my budget, my coupons.\n\n1338\n01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:20,080\nI just went in there and said anything I\nsee, right, that gets in-between me and\n\n1339\n01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:22,740\nmy appetite, if it's gonna work,\nthat's what we're doing.\n\n1340\n01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,586\nSo, you gotta be prepared, right.\n\n1341\n01:04:24,586 --> 01:04:27,563\nYou know, risk and\nrisk management, risk analysis,\n\n1342\n01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:30,070\nall about showing up ready to play, right.\n\n1343\n01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,220\nReally important.\n\n1344\n01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:35,420\nIf you're the guy, you're the girl who's\nprepared, who does the risk analysis,\n\n1345\n01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:40,000\nunderstands the numbers, works it out,\nyou're gonna be much, much better off in\n\n1346\n01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,680\ndealing with countermeasure application,\nunderstanding the impact,\n\n1347\n01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:46,590\nbottom line value, to the business\nof whether you spend the money or\n\n1348\n01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:49,980\nnot than somebody who just walks and says\nyeah, I think we should buy five of those.\n\n1349\n01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:52,810\nRight.\n[LAUGH] Okay, right, how are we gonna\n\n1350\n01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:55,750\nknow if we're making money, it's not about\nmaking money, it's about mitigating risk.\n\n1351\n01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:59,065\nBy the way, if somebody says that to you,\nrun quickly the other way.\n\n1352\n01:04:59,065 --> 01:05:01,620\n[LAUGH] And\ntake your checkbook with you, right?\n\n1353\n01:05:01,620 --> 01:05:03,920\nYou don't want to deal with them.\n\n1354\n01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,040\nIf they tell you it's all\nabout mitigating risk,\n\n1355\n01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,650\nit doesn't matter what you spend, right.\n\n1356\n01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:10,650\nI hear this from vendors sometimes, and\n\n1357\n01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:14,300\nI shudder when I sit in meetings\nwith my customers and I hear either,\n\n1358\n01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:17,710\nanecdotal evidence of them having dealt\nwith a vendor who told them this.\n\n1359\n01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:22,010\nOr I am there as part of a team\nhelping them to work through this, and\n\n1360\n01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:24,380\nwe're interviewing\nvendors about solutions.\n\n1361\n01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:25,650\nAnd it's not about the money,\n\n1362\n01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:28,120\nit's about the fact that we\ncan do a better job for you.\n\n1363\n01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,020\nWell yeah, it is about that,\nbut it's also about the money.\n\n1364\n01:05:31,020 --> 01:05:32,370\nIf you're gonna do a better job for\n\n1365\n01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:36,030\nme that's gonna cost me 6 times\nwhat everybody else is gonna cost,\n\n1366\n01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:41,440\nyou better bring 10 times the value, or\n12 times the value for that investment.\n\n1367\n01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,550\nBecause if you are giving\nme the same investment,\n\n1368\n01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:48,000\nthe same value as your\ncompetitors at six times a cost,\n\n1369\n01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,060\nunfortunately, I can't write that check,\nnot in good conscience.\n\n1370\n01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:53,860\nI don't have enough zeros in\nthe bank account for that, right?\n\n1371\n01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,330\nYeah So, as a result we've\nreally got to understand this.\n\n1372\n01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:59,410\nSo, we do quantitative risk measurement,\nright, number based.\n\n1373\n01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:02,590\nLet's walk through this thing,\nand I know that Mike kind of put\n\n1374\n01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:04,620\ntogether a little scenario for\nus, which I think is great.\n\n1375\n01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:07,290\nWe're gonna walk it through and\nkind of put the pieces in place.\n\n1376\n01:06:07,290 --> 01:06:11,650\nSo, we have this idea of SLE,\nwhat we refer to as SLE, S-L-E.\n\n1377\n01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:13,390\nSingle Loss Expectancy.\n\n1378\n01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:16,800\nWhat would the loss be from\na single event occurring,\n\n1379\n01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,500\nthis risk happening one time, right.\n\n1380\n01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:23,050\nGo shopping, too hungry one time, buy all\nthe extra food, spend an extra 50 bucks.\n\n1381\n01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:25,910\nRight That's my single loss\nexpectancy from one event.\n\n1382\n01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:29,800\nMy SLE, in that case would be single\nloss expectancy would be $50, right.\n\n1383\n01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:32,920\nSo ARO,\nannualized rate of occurrence, A-R-O.\n\n1384\n01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:36,060\nHow many time in a year do I\ngo shopping when I'm hungry?\n\n1385\n01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:40,516\nIf this is an every week event, I'm going\nto have a pretty expensive ballooning of\n\n1386\n01:06:40,516 --> 01:06:42,920\nmy budget taking place, right.\n\n1387\n01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:46,870\nAnd so how often does this risk, how\noften does this risk come home to roost?\n\n1388\n01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:52,030\nAnd then the A-L-E, ALE, Annualized\nLoss Expectancy, how often does that\n\n1389\n01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:56,180\nsingle loss expectancy times the number of\ntimes that it actually happens, together.\n\n1390\n01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,930\nWhat does that costs us over the year?\n\n1391\n01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:01,790\nYeah So if I went food shopping when\nI'm hungry once a month at 50 bucks\n\n1392\n01:07:01,790 --> 01:07:03,665\nevery time, so 12 times in a year.\n\n1393\n01:07:03,665 --> 01:07:08,050\n$50 times 12, do the quick\nmath in our head, carry the 0,\n\n1394\n01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:10,093\ndivide by 5, what do we get?\n\n1395\n01:07:10,093 --> 01:07:11,212\n5,100, I think?\n[CROSSTALK] No.\n\n1396\n01:07:11,212 --> 01:07:12,390\n[LAUGH] I'm just kidding.\n\n1397\n01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:14,205\nRight, we get 2, isn't it always 2?\n\n1398\n01:07:14,205 --> 01:07:16,675\nThat's the answer, square root of 2.\n\n1399\n01:07:16,675 --> 01:07:20,135\nSo we get $600 in this case,\nright, 50 times 12,\n\n1400\n01:07:20,135 --> 01:07:23,535\nwill give us $600 in\nprojected annualized loss.\n\n1401\n01:07:23,535 --> 01:07:27,125\nSo then we gotta say well,\ncould I implement a risk countermeasure,\n\n1402\n01:07:27,125 --> 01:07:31,435\ncould I somehow implement a solution\nthat would save me that $600,\n\n1403\n01:07:31,435 --> 01:07:33,675\nbut not cost me as much.\n\n1404\n01:07:33,675 --> 01:07:36,655\nAnd if I can do that I then have a good,\ntheoretically right,\n\n1405\n01:07:36,655 --> 01:07:38,250\na good counter measure.\n\n1406\n01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:40,317\nSo let's look at a real IT based example,\nnot talking about going shopping and\n\n1407\n01:07:40,317 --> 01:07:40,860\ngrocery shopping.\n\n1408\n01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:43,452\nGrocery Shopping.\n\n1409\n01:07:43,452 --> 01:07:46,272\nBut you have this example and\nwe have to maybe roll up just a little bit\n\n1410\n01:07:46,272 --> 01:07:48,960\ncuz I'm blocking my corner,\nyeah it's blocking part of that.\n\n1411\n01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,830\nAll right so let's let Mike walk\nus through real quick, right.\n\n1412\n01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:52,742\nYeah, so we're going start out.\n\n1413\n01:07:52,742 --> 01:07:54,562\nWe're gonna go out, and\nwe're going to purchase a firewall.\n\n1414\n01:07:54,562 --> 01:07:57,370\nWe're gonna take a look at you know,\nwhy we purchased that particular firewall.\n\n1415\n01:07:57,370 --> 01:07:59,740\nWhat is its purpose,\nwhat is its capabilities, and\n\n1416\n01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:03,440\nyou know figure out how\nmuch that's gonna cost us.\n\n1417\n01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:08,704\nBut if we have a breach that occurs,\nwe can look at that cost of that breach,\n\n1418\n01:08:08,704 --> 01:08:15,078\nor that SLE, that single loss expectancy,\nand we may rate that as, say, $5,000.\n\n1419\n01:08:15,078 --> 01:08:19,119\nSo that means every time that somebody\nbreaches that firewall it's gonna cost\n\n1420\n01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:20,130\nus $5,000.\n\n1421\n01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:25,220\nAnd then we have to look at how often\nthat's gonna occur on an annual basis,\n\n1422\n01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,600\nwhich is our A-R-O, or ARO,\nAnnual Rate of Occurrence.\n\n1423\n01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:33,410\nAnd if we determine that that is\ngoing to occur three times a year,\n\n1424\n01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:39,670\nthen we're going to multiply that SLE by\nthat ARO, and we come up with $15,000.\n\n1425\n01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:42,980\nSo we're expecting that a compromise\n\n1426\n01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:45,190\nof our firewall is gonna\ncost us $15,000 a year.\n\n1427\n01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:49,360\nSo then we're gonna turn around,\nand we can use that information to\n\n1428\n01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:54,210\nhelp us determine what we might want\nto spend on purchasing that firewall.\n\n1429\n01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:59,540\nIf we can buy something\nthat'll cost us less or maybe\n\n1430\n01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:04,910\na little more than what our ALE is gonna\nbe, we might feel that it's worth it.\n\n1431\n01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:08,270\nIf it's gonna cost us\nway more than our ALE,\n\n1432\n01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:11,100\nmaybe we don't wanna purchase\nthat particular firewall.\n\n1433\n01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:14,330\nOkay, and so\nMike brings up a very interesting point.\n\n1434\n01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:18,280\nWe talk about this, which is amortization\nis what we use, the financial management\n\n1435\n01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:22,930\nterm we use for it, which is what's the\ncapital expenditure, we call CAPEX, and\n\n1436\n01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:26,560\noperational expenditure,\nOPEX in the financial management world.\n\n1437\n01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:31,260\nSo what is the CAPEX,\ncapital expenditure, amortized out over\n\n1438\n01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:35,070\nthe life cycle of this mitigation,\nthis safeguard we're gonna put in place.\n\n1439\n01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:39,830\nSo if we use Mike's example and\njust draw it out one more layer, right.\n\n1440\n01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:42,660\nIf we go that $15,000 assessment and\nsay okay,\n\n1441\n01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,310\nwe think in a year we're gonna spend,\npotentially, or\n\n1442\n01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:50,160\nlose $15,000 on firewall breaches,\nthen what we have to do is say,\n\n1443\n01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:55,190\nwill our fix cost us less than $15,000.\n\n1444\n01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:56,830\nWe know that's probably a bargain, right?\n\n1445\n01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:58,687\nRight, [CROSSTALK].\nWe'll recoup that cost in less than\n\n1446\n01:09:58,687 --> 01:09:59,740\na year, right?\n\n1447\n01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,810\nSo we know it's gonna be easily,\nmoney that if we spend,\n\n1448\n01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,225\nwe're going to get back\nin less than a year.\n\n1449\n01:10:04,225 --> 01:10:05,750\nMm-hm.\nBecause we know to Mike's point that he\n\n1450\n01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:08,788\nwas just mentioning, probably gonna\nkeep that firewall in place for\n\n1451\n01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:11,680\na minimum of typically three,\nmaybe as long as five years.\n\n1452\n01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,730\nSo our amortization rate, our schedule for\n\n1453\n01:10:14,730 --> 01:10:19,205\namortizing, for cutting down the value\nof that expense on buying the firewall,\n\n1454\n01:10:19,205 --> 01:10:22,030\nis typically prorated over\na three to five year period.\n\n1455\n01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:24,251\nWe have to do the same\nwith our safeguards,\n\n1456\n01:10:24,251 --> 01:10:28,261\nwe have to have to amortize and prorate\nthe capital expense against the actual\n\n1457\n01:10:28,261 --> 01:10:31,118\nexpense of owning that device for\nthat period of time.\n\n1458\n01:10:31,118 --> 01:10:35,935\nAnd so if it took $30,000,\ndouble the cost of the breach in a year,\n\n1459\n01:10:35,935 --> 01:10:41,570\nit took 30,000 to implement a safeguard,\nwould it still be a good safeguard?\n\n1460\n01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,870\nWell if we look at the fact that\nwe will own that firewall for\n\n1461\n01:10:43,870 --> 01:10:47,850\nat least three to five years, maybe\nthree years, we would be recouping that\n\n1462\n01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:51,270\ninvestment at the end of the second\nyear of the life cycle of the device.\n\n1463\n01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:56,220\nSo we may now begin to say, well you know,\n$30,000 spent, we're actually netting\n\n1464\n01:10:56,220 --> 01:11:00,830\n15 of the end of the 3 year life cycle,\nif the breach costs us $15,000 a year.\n\n1465\n01:11:00,830 --> 01:11:04,930\nBut it's gonna take us, effectively, three\nyears to recognize that savings, so could\n\n1466\n01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:09,710\nwe come up with a way to do something\nthat will get us part of the way there or\n\n1467\n01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:12,570\nmaybe, is less expensive and\nmore inclusive.\n\n1468\n01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:14,275\nSo all these different ways to do this.\n\n1469\n01:11:14,275 --> 01:11:18,845\nSo we have to weigh what the actual cost\nwill be of the breach, as we pointed out.\n\n1470\n01:11:18,845 --> 01:11:21,785\nAlso weigh the cost of the counter\nmeasure and understand the time,\n\n1471\n01:11:21,785 --> 01:11:25,325\nthe life cycle involved in managing both\nof those throughout the enterprise, right?\n\n1472\n01:11:25,325 --> 01:11:25,835\nRight, I agree.\n\n1473\n01:11:25,835 --> 01:11:29,397\nSo think about that as you think through,\nwhat a quantitive assessment would be.\n\n1474\n01:11:29,397 --> 01:11:33,037\nNow if we're bringing qualitative into\nthe mix here quickly, we could say okay,\n\n1475\n01:11:33,037 --> 01:11:36,657\nso $50,000 hard costs per year,\nit breaches,\n\n1476\n01:11:36,657 --> 01:11:40,588\nwe have a $5,000 mitigation or\n$20,000 or whatever, but\n\n1477\n01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:45,268\nthen we have to add in the soft cost\nof actually what that breach may be.\n\n1478\n01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:47,018\nWe may be accounting for the hard costs,\n\n1479\n01:11:47,018 --> 01:11:52,038\nthe dollar value and a person hours\nspent mitigating the breach and\n\n1480\n01:11:52,038 --> 01:11:55,929\nthings like that, but then we also, as we\nsaid, have taken some of the soft costs.\n\n1481\n01:11:55,929 --> 01:12:00,584\nWe may try to ascribe dollar values\nto them, but it may be hard to do so.\n\n1482\n01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:04,150\nAnd so we may want to weigh that as\na separate factor that could push us if we\n\n1483\n01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:08,302\nsay well, the damage to our reputation is\nsuch that if we don't mitigate this pretty\n\n1484\n01:12:08,302 --> 01:12:12,159\nquickly, it's gonna kill us even if we\ndon't want to spend the money Who may be\n\n1485\n01:12:12,159 --> 01:12:15,864\nforced to just because of the qualitative\nimpact of this risk assessment.\n\n1486\n01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:16,490\nSo be aware of that as well.\n\n1487\n01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:18,690\nLet's talk a little bit,\n\n1488\n01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:21,020\nnow hopefully you guys are little\nmore comfortable with this idea.\n\n1489\n01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:24,390\nLet's talk a bit about areas where you see\nquantitative risk assessment being done.\n\n1490\n01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:26,500\nOkay.\nSo it could be done in almost any area of\n\n1491\n01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,060\nthe business where we do a risk analysis.\n\n1492\n01:12:29,060 --> 01:12:32,380\nSo if we have systems, right, it's easy\nto do quantitative risk assessment\n\n1493\n01:12:32,380 --> 01:12:34,310\nof what the impact is on those systems.\n\n1494\n01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:36,670\nYou mentioned firewalls as a breach,\nthat's a good one.\n\n1495\n01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:40,770\nWe could look at quantitative assessment\nof training, of knowledge transfer.\n\n1496\n01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:43,730\nRight?\nSo, what is the value of training people\n\n1497\n01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:46,470\nin our organization to be up\nto date on certain things?\n\n1498\n01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:48,330\nAnd what is the negative\nif we don't train them?\n\n1499\n01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:50,250\nThat's something we can measure there.\n\n1500\n01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:53,600\nWe could measure the potentiality for\n\n1501\n01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,480\na vulnerability to run\na mock inside a network.\n\n1502\n01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,480\nSo what is the exploit or\n\n1503\n01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,390\nvulnerability and we can do\na quantitative assessment of that.\n\n1504\n01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:04,920\nSo lots of different places where we\nmay see this coming home to roost.\n\n1505\n01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,820\nAnd we want to just be thinking\nalong those lines as we look at some\n\n1506\n01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:08,420\nof this, right?\n\n1507\n01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:12,900\nSo we also can look at how we\nwill look at qualitative risk.\n\n1508\n01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,180\nWe talked about a clear measure\nof qualitative risk, excuse me,\n\n1509\n01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,260\nquantitative risk assessment and\nhow to do that.\n\n1510\n01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:20,040\nLet's look at qualitative risk.\n\n1511\n01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:23,330\nAnd so how we measure qualitative risk,\nhow we assess it, is not so\n\n1512\n01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:28,340\nmuch number and dollar values and things\nof that nature, but more of maybe a low,\n\n1513\n01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:32,330\nmedium high impact scenario\nwhere we talk about probability.\n\n1514\n01:13:32,330 --> 01:13:34,650\nTalk about impact,\nhow likely is it to happen?\n\n1515\n01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:36,440\nWhat would the impact be?\n\n1516\n01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,200\nAnd as a result,\nwhat are we looking at there?\n\n1517\n01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:41,770\nSo I know we have a graphic that\nwe went out and we grabbed for\n\n1518\n01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:42,860\neverybody to take a look at.\n\n1519\n01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:45,900\nA little chart there, there we go.\n\n1520\n01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:48,490\nSo, can we zoom it just a tad bit there?\n\n1521\n01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:49,630\nAll right. Good. Center that out.\n\n1522\n01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:53,320\nSo, you'll wanna can see there is\nprobability at the upper left hand side,\n\n1523\n01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,730\nrunning up the left side of our diagram.\n\n1524\n01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:57,920\nAlong the bottom there we see impact.\n\n1525\n01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:02,280\nAnd so this is a subset, a broader\nconversation about probability, impact and\n\n1526\n01:14:02,280 --> 01:14:03,130\nexposure.\n\n1527\n01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:07,380\nWe can use this matrix to drive that pi\nconversation that we have around risk\n\n1528\n01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:09,070\nassessment and business impact as well,\n\n1529\n01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:13,290\nbut we could also look at it just from a\npurely qualitative assessment perspective.\n\n1530\n01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:16,150\nWe're measuring using\na low-medium-high scale and\n\n1531\n01:14:16,150 --> 01:14:19,330\nso what we're thinking of\nIs consequences and impact.\n\n1532\n01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:22,986\nHere when we talk about probability and\nimpact, we can say something\n\n1533\n01:14:22,986 --> 01:14:26,843\nin the lower left hand quadrant is\nvery unlikely to happen, low impact.\n\n1534\n01:14:26,843 --> 01:14:28,445\nOops, sorry, getting a little bit twitchy.\n\n1535\n01:14:28,445 --> 01:14:31,243\nThere we go, okay.\n\n1536\n01:14:31,243 --> 01:14:34,480\nLower left versus lower right,\nso there we are right there.\n\n1537\n01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:39,560\nSo low impact, right, low probability,\nmeaning it's very unlikely it will happen.\n\n1538\n01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:43,390\nAnd if it does happen, it's very unlikely\nit's gonna cause us a lot of concern.\n\n1539\n01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:48,350\nThat could be something as mundane,\nas simple as maybe we lose power,\n\n1540\n01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,630\nbut because we lose power we have backup\nsystems, so as a result we're probably\n\n1541\n01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:53,529\nnot too concerned about- So\nthe impact isn't very large, yeah.\n\n1542\n01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:55,190\nA small fluctuation, not a big deal.\n\n1543\n01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:59,170\nBut as we move out into the middle of\nthe grid where we have medium impact,\n\n1544\n01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:00,770\nmedium probability.\n\n1545\n01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:04,477\nOr maybe even medium probability,\nmedium impact,\n\n1546\n01:15:04,477 --> 01:15:09,205\ngoing up towards high,\nsomewhere in that range, whatever it is.\n\n1547\n01:15:09,205 --> 01:15:12,981\nRight, and for a medium we're gonna say\nwell you might want to pay attention\n\n1548\n01:15:12,981 --> 01:15:17,052\nto that because now maybe it's question\nof not losing power, but losing power for\n\n1549\n01:15:17,052 --> 01:15:18,275\na long time.\n\n1550\n01:15:18,275 --> 01:15:19,827\nAnd do we lose power for\n\n1551\n01:15:19,827 --> 01:15:25,408\na short enough time that we still have\nenough back up battery power on our UPS's?\n\n1552\n01:15:25,408 --> 01:15:27,587\nDo we have enough fuel in our generator?\n\n1553\n01:15:27,587 --> 01:15:28,327\nThings like that.\n\n1554\n01:15:28,327 --> 01:15:32,637\nWhen we get into high impact,\nthis could be a disruptive weather event,\n\n1555\n01:15:32,637 --> 01:15:35,397\nthat may lead to power\nloss over several days.\n\n1556\n01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:38,077\nAnd as a result, that could\nnegatively impact their systems.\n\n1557\n01:15:38,077 --> 01:15:40,377\nAnd so,\nthis is more of the thing that we look at.\n\n1558\n01:15:40,377 --> 01:15:42,087\nWhere we look at a sliding scale, right?\n\n1559\n01:15:42,087 --> 01:15:44,400\nRight.\nAnd so this is qualitative typically.\n\n1560\n01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,590\nOr at least one way of\nlooking at qualitative,\n\n1561\n01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:49,570\nthink about it just maybe\na comparison there for you.\n\n1562\n01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:52,190\nBut we tend to talk about low,\nmedium, high in terms of impact and\n\n1563\n01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:53,500\nprobability in this regard.\n\n1564\n01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:56,600\nAll right so just be aware of that.\n\n1565\n01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:59,440\nAnd as we talk about qualitative and\nquantitative.\n\n1566\n01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:03,290\nWe then wanna go from the risk assessment\narea where we're thinking about,\n\n1567\n01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:05,670\nokay now I've identified risks,\nthis is what it is.\n\n1568\n01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:06,688\nWe're looking at how to manage it.\n\n1569\n01:16:06,688 --> 01:16:09,675\nWe don't wanna talk about some of\nthe things that we can implement,\n\n1570\n01:16:09,675 --> 01:16:13,990\nsome of the things that can be done to\nhelp us frame the discussion around risk,\n\n1571\n01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:18,600\nand also to manage what the implementation\nof the discussion of those things will be.\n\n1572\n01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:23,720\nAnd so we take a look at policies,\nstandards, baselines, guidelines, and\n\n1573\n01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:27,800\nalso procedures down there,\nas we have noted out for you.\n\n1574\n01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:32,470\nAnd so when we think about policies,\nstandards, baselines, guidelines,\n\n1575\n01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:36,010\nprocedures, we're thinking about\nthe various things that we as security\n\n1576\n01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:41,010\nprofessionals can help to implement in\nthe business, craft, articulate, put\n\n1577\n01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:46,140\ninto practice, and educate people around,\nthat will then allow us to deal with risk.\n\n1578\n01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,780\nBy documenting exactly what needs to\nbe done by everybody to address it,\n\n1579\n01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:51,130\nbring it out in the open.\n\n1580\n01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:54,340\nAnd hopefully avoid it at the end of\nthe day, if we're good at what we do.\n\n1581\n01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:55,820\nSo let's define each of these terms,\n\n1582\n01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:58,220\nwe do have some working\ndefinitions there for you.\n\n1583\n01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:01,520\nPolicies, overall general statement\nproduced by senior management.\n\n1584\n01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,690\nPolicies are high level\nstatements of intent.\n\n1585\n01:17:04,690 --> 01:17:08,810\nThey are going to be something that\nwill address an area, subject area,\n\n1586\n01:17:08,810 --> 01:17:12,440\nsomething like an internet\nusage policy perhaps,\n\n1587\n01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:16,560\nmaybe an email policy,\nmaybe a mobile device policy.\n\n1588\n01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,930\nSo these are categorical statements\nof behavior expectation.\n\n1589\n01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:25,280\nAnd categorical statements of rights and\nwrongs, do's and\n\n1590\n01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:30,566\ndont's at a high level that explain\nto individuals and users that consume\n\n1591\n01:17:30,566 --> 01:17:35,869\nthem what expectations for correct or\nproper usage and behavior will be.\n\n1592\n01:17:35,869 --> 01:17:39,219\nAnd they come from senior management\nin order to ensure that they carry\n\n1593\n01:17:39,219 --> 01:17:42,512\nthe appropriate weight,\nthat people know to pay attention to them,\n\n1594\n01:17:42,512 --> 01:17:45,749\nthey have the proper focus in\nthe business, people understand that\n\n1595\n01:17:45,749 --> 01:17:49,602\nthese things are going to be important and\npay attention to them in effect.\n\n1596\n01:17:49,602 --> 01:17:53,790\nAll right, so\nwhen we say senior management it would\n\n1597\n01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:58,700\ntypically mean a maybe a senior\nIT professional, could be CIO.\n\n1598\n01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,960\nChief Security Officer, CSO.\n\n1599\n01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,900\nSomebody like that if that's\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n1600\n01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:07,500\nStandards, our next item down,\nrefer to mandatory activities and rules.\n\n1601\n01:18:07,500 --> 01:18:11,735\nThese are typically going to come in,\nin the guise of legislation,\n\n1602\n01:18:11,735 --> 01:18:15,735\nregulatory compliance,\nthings of that nature, will be seen here.\n\n1603\n01:18:15,735 --> 01:18:17,265\nAnd so what we wanna understand and\n\n1604\n01:18:17,265 --> 01:18:21,515\nbe aware of, is that we're talking about\nthings that are typically mandated, right?\n\n1605\n01:18:21,515 --> 01:18:25,475\nThings that have to be done,\nbased on some sort of compliance regime.\n\n1606\n01:18:25,475 --> 01:18:28,430\nThat's what standards\ntypically represent for us.\n\n1607\n01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:31,490\nMore often than not come from a standards\nperspective, will typically come from\n\n1608\n01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:37,120\na governmental body, or some sort\nof oversight or regulatory agency.\n\n1609\n01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:42,788\nSo we can think of examples, for\ninstance, as being perhaps in the US,\n\n1610\n01:18:42,788 --> 01:18:49,824\nSarbanes-Oxley, perhaps HIPAA compliance\nwill be a good example of that.\n\n1611\n01:18:49,824 --> 01:18:54,690\nAnd these are typically standard\nbase regulatory compliance regimes\n\n1612\n01:18:54,690 --> 01:18:57,940\nthat we have to pay attention\nto in the broader context beyond\n\n1613\n01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:03,090\nthe boundary of the US there are other\nstandards that are equally important.\n\n1614\n01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:07,067\nThe basel accords, basel one,\nbasel two, for instance B-A-S-E-L,\n\n1615\n01:19:07,067 --> 01:19:12,620\nright, the Basel Accords, for financial\nservices, management, are very important.\n\n1616\n01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:17,480\nThe Wassenaar Agreement,\nwhich deals with trade and arms and\n\n1617\n01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:20,170\ninformation around arms trade and\nthings like that.\n\n1618\n01:19:20,170 --> 01:19:21,360\nYou don't have to know all of these,\n\n1619\n01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,530\nby the way, as a CISSP,\njust throwing some out to you.\n\n1620\n01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:28,770\nBut the Montreal Protocol,\nwhich was a standard that was put out and\n\n1621\n01:19:28,770 --> 01:19:33,150\nput together to control environmental\nissues associated with greenhouse gasses.\n\n1622\n01:19:33,150 --> 01:19:36,980\nMost countries have become partied\nto over the last several years.\n\n1623\n01:19:36,980 --> 01:19:40,290\nThese are all things that would be\nout there in the international realm\n\n1624\n01:19:40,290 --> 01:19:44,536\nas opposed to just the national realm in\na certain country, whatever that may be.\n\n1625\n01:19:44,536 --> 01:19:50,746\nBaselines are gonna be a way of creating\na standardized solution that we can use as\n\n1626\n01:19:50,746 --> 01:19:56,978\na template to measure against, to monitor\nand understand deviation from norm.\n\n1627\n01:19:56,978 --> 01:20:01,668\nSo we look at the standard behaviors\nshould be x, we see behavior x plus y,\n\n1628\n01:20:01,668 --> 01:20:04,922\ny is a deviation or\ndelta a difference of some kind so\n\n1629\n01:20:04,922 --> 01:20:10,147\nwhen we talk about baselines we often talk\nabout applying a baseline to computer Or\n\n1630\n01:20:10,147 --> 01:20:12,671\na system to understand how it is built.\n\n1631\n01:20:12,671 --> 01:20:14,860\nAnd as a result, then measure\nif things have been put into it.\n\n1632\n01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:18,390\nThings such as malware,\nwe will talk about malware at some point.\n\n1633\n01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:22,630\nHas somebody modified in some way what\nthat build looks likes in that particular\n\n1634\n01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:25,200\nmachine, and if so,\nwhat does that really mean, right.\n\n1635\n01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,140\nSo, we take a look at that.\n\n1636\n01:20:27,140 --> 01:20:30,880\nGuidelines are recommendations,\nthey are not mandatory.\n\n1637\n01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,150\nThey are going to be things that,\nif done, could add value, but\n\n1638\n01:20:34,150 --> 01:20:35,720\nare optional at the end of the day.\n\n1639\n01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,800\nSo we don't mandate that they be done, but\n\n1640\n01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:42,380\nwe often see them as being best practices\nthat would bring value, if followed.\n\n1641\n01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:45,359\nAnd I think guidelines has an e in it,\nif I'm not mistaken.\n\n1642\n01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:45,939\nDid I miss that?\n\n1643\n01:20:45,939 --> 01:20:47,205\n[CROSSTALK] I believe it does.\n\n1644\n01:20:47,205 --> 01:20:51,013\nAnd you're taking that advice from\nsomebody who can't spell his way out of\n\n1645\n01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:55,121\na paper bag, but I'm assuming given the\nway I remember guide looking that I think\n\n1646\n01:20:55,121 --> 01:20:56,713\nit has an e associated with it.\n\n1647\n01:20:56,713 --> 01:20:59,200\nThat was my\nEuro-Australian-American spelling.\n\n1648\n01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,800\nYes, it's called the guid-line\nin most parts of the world, but\n\n1649\n01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,550\nhere we call it a guideline.\n\n1650\n01:21:03,550 --> 01:21:07,979\nSo procedures will be\nstep-by-step activities that\n\n1651\n01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:11,260\nshould be performed in a certain order.\n\n1652\n01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:13,200\nVery important to think about that.\n\n1653\n01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,690\nI didn't bring my invisibility cloak so\n\n1654\n01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:19,280\nthe edge of my screen in screen frame\nis not cloaked in invisibility today.\n\n1655\n01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,350\nWe did not make any see\nthrough partition so\n\n1656\n01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:25,530\nyou can actually not see the text that\nis behind that part of the screen.\n\n1657\n01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:26,380\nIt's coming soon in an episode coming up.\n\n1658\n01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:28,566\nExactly, we'll have\nthe floating ghost box, right.\n\n1659\n01:21:28,566 --> 01:21:29,353\nYeah, there you go.\n\n1660\n01:21:29,353 --> 01:21:33,110\nSo we have step-by-step activities that\nneed to be performed in a certain order.\n\n1661\n01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:37,130\nThese typically are detailed step-by-step\ninstruction guides or manuals,\n\n1662\n01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:40,255\nwhatever they are,\nthat tell us how to do something, right.\n\n1663\n01:21:40,255 --> 01:21:43,083\nWanna go ahead and\nlearn how to do a desktop image, right?\n\n1664\n01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:45,100\nWe gotta have a procedure for that.\n\n1665\n01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,160\nYou know, how do we boot up?\n\n1666\n01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,730\nHow do we get the TFTP server?\n\n1667\n01:21:47,730 --> 01:21:49,570\nHow do we get the network boot,\nthe PXE boot?\n\n1668\n01:21:49,570 --> 01:21:52,860\nHow do we connect, what's\nthe password to log into the server?\n\n1669\n01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:53,980\nWhat image do we pull?\n\n1670\n01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:56,090\nAll that stuff will be in the procedure,\nright,\n\n1671\n01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:57,850\nwill be detailed out and documented.\n\n1672\n01:21:57,850 --> 01:22:02,500\nSo, when we look at policy standards,\nbaselines, guidelines and\n\n1673\n01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,210\nprocedures, five elements.\n\n1674\n01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:10,310\nWe're looking at what is at the output of\nrisk assessment, risk analysis process,\n\n1675\n01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:16,020\ncuz this is the working model that we use\nas security professionals, to go in and\n\n1676\n01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:21,580\nthen create opportunity to mitigate,\nright, to minimize the impact of risk.\n\n1677\n01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:25,650\nAnd so this is very important,\nbecause by standardizing, and by using\n\n1678\n01:22:25,650 --> 01:22:30,540\nthese policies, and these templates, and\nall these things, we create sameness.\n\n1679\n01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:33,650\nWe create repeatability,\nwe create expected outcomes.\n\n1680\n01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:34,300\nRight.\n\n1681\n01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:37,200\nAnd we create as a result\nof that the opportunity for\n\n1682\n01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:41,780\nthe business to be in a place where,\nas professionals, we can rely on the fact\n\n1683\n01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:44,250\nthat certain things will be happening for\ncertain reasons.\n\n1684\n01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,950\nWe try to eliminate the randomness of\nthe system, in other words, by doing this.\n\n1685\n01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:51,430\nBut the key to using any or\nall of these mechanisms,\n\n1686\n01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:54,950\nis to make sure that we are focused\non awareness and training, right.\n\n1687\n01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:58,710\nSo it's great to have policies, it's great\nto have standards and guidelines, but\n\n1688\n01:22:58,710 --> 01:23:02,270\nif you don't train everybody on what\nthey are and why they're valuable,\n\n1689\n01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:06,250\nthey're very limited at the end of\nthe day, in terms of their overall impact.\n\n1690\n01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:08,920\nWe just don't see a lot of value there,\nunfortunately.\n\n1691\n01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:13,090\nSo we need to make everybody\nin the organization aware\n\n1692\n01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:17,020\nof these things from top to bottom,\nmost senior people all the way down to\n\n1693\n01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:19,450\nmaybe the most entry level\npeople in our business.\n\n1694\n01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,400\nDoesn't really matter who they are and\nwhat they do.\n\n1695\n01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:26,310\nEverybody needs to have security awareness\ntraining, and awareness of our procedures,\n\n1696\n01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:28,120\nour guidelines, our standards.\n\n1697\n01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,085\nVery, very important\nat the end of the day.\n\n1698\n01:23:30,085 --> 01:23:30,770\nMm-hm.\n\n1699\n01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:34,194\nI always share a story at this point\ntypically, in my conversation with my\n\n1700\n01:23:34,194 --> 01:23:37,580\nstudents about this, so I'll share\nit with you guys because I like you.\n\n1701\n01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,400\nYou're nice people, right.\n\n1702\n01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,932\nSo let's talk about [CROSSTALK] we do,\nwe do.\n\n1703\n01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:45,590\nSo kind of a funny thing, so we're talking\nabout standard security, guidelines,\n\n1704\n01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:48,804\nbaselines, procedures,\npolicies, so I have a friend,\n\n1705\n01:23:48,804 --> 01:23:51,907\nI do actually have a couple of those,\nbelieve it or not.\n\n1706\n01:23:51,907 --> 01:23:56,319\nAnd so I have a friend who does a lot\nwork, similar to what I do, and\n\n1707\n01:23:56,319 --> 01:24:00,996\nworks overseas a lot as some of us\ndo in this industry, travel, etc.\n\n1708\n01:24:00,996 --> 01:24:06,430\nAnd so we took a gig doing some\ntraining for a company overseas.\n\n1709\n01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:11,090\nAnd winds up going over there,\ngets set up, is picked up at the airport,\n\n1710\n01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:15,865\ngoes to the site, this is at a company's\nsite, so at a plant location, right.\n\n1711\n01:24:15,865 --> 01:24:17,380\nMm-hm.\nSo he goes there,\n\n1712\n01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:19,990\ngets taken there after they\nchecked him in at the hotel.\n\n1713\n01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:22,580\nAnd goes into the classroom,\nis doing a set up for\n\n1714\n01:24:22,580 --> 01:24:26,580\na class he's gonna teach,\nwhatever it was, wasn't really important.\n\n1715\n01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:28,080\nHe's having a class of some kind.\n\n1716\n01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:30,470\nAnd so he's up in the second or\nthird floor in the back,\n\n1717\n01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:32,950\nwhere they have a training room,\nkinda doing his thing.\n\n1718\n01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:35,750\nAnd they introduce him around,\nso everybody knows who he is.\n\n1719\n01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:37,840\nAnd they say okay,\nyou know kind of here is the deal.\n\n1720\n01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:42,470\nYou're in this area, if you need to\ncome out or whatever, let us know and\n\n1721\n01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:45,400\nhere's kind of where the bathroom is and\nall this stuff, so\n\n1722\n01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,594\nit's good he's in there doing his thing.\n\n1723\n01:24:46,594 --> 01:24:47,960\nMm-hm.\n\n1724\n01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,150\nAnd so and\n\n1725\n01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:52,160\nI'll give you the key thing that really\nimportant to kind of this whole thing.\n\n1726\n01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:55,850\nSo he's in England, this is in\nEngland in Great Britain where he is.\n\n1727\n01:24:55,850 --> 01:24:59,880\nSo contextually, culturally, it becomes\nrelevant to the story in just a minute.\n\n1728\n01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,750\nAnd so he's in this classroom, doing\nthis thing, building his systems up and\n\n1729\n01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:06,070\ngetting ready for class.\n\n1730\n01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:09,330\nAnd there is some sort\nof commotion going on,\n\n1731\n01:25:09,330 --> 01:25:12,780\nthere's some noise in the background,\nnot really sure what it is.\n\n1732\n01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:15,220\nNot like an alarm going off or anything.\n\n1733\n01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:15,800\nRight.\n\n1734\n01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,160\nNot like he's obviously\naware there's a problem.\n\n1735\n01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:19,640\nRight.\nBut just there's just a lot of noise,\n\n1736\n01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:22,010\npeople yelling, screaming,\nall sorts of stuff.\n\n1737\n01:25:22,010 --> 01:25:23,220\nAnd then it kinda quiets down.\n\n1738\n01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:25,850\nSo he goes back to doing his thing,\nhe's not really thinking about it.\n\n1739\n01:25:25,850 --> 01:25:31,360\nAnd he realizes maybe 15,\n20 minutes later it's very quiet.\n\n1740\n01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,770\nLike, kinda scary movie,\nsomeone's gonna get killed quite, right?\n\n1741\n01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:36,270\nLike almost ominous music quiet.\n\n1742\n01:25:36,270 --> 01:25:38,380\nLike, why did the birds stop and\nthat kinda thing.\n\n1743\n01:25:38,380 --> 01:25:39,850\nYeah, right, there's like nothing.\n\n1744\n01:25:39,850 --> 01:25:41,680\nDo you hear anything, no,\nthat's the problem, right?\n\n1745\n01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:42,308\nThere's nothing.\n\n1746\n01:25:42,308 --> 01:25:45,750\nAnd so it gets very quiet, right,\nand so he pokes his head out,\n\n1747\n01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:46,880\ntrying to figure out what's going on.\n\n1748\n01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:50,260\nAnd then the office is like a ghost\ntown and this is not the end of the day,\n\n1749\n01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:51,570\nthis is like the middle of the day.\n\n1750\n01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:52,790\nWow.\nThere's nobody there.\n\n1751\n01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:55,690\nWhen I say nobody,\nI mean there's cube farm, right?\n\n1752\n01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:59,650\nBut there is nobody,\nthere is nothing, it's just him.\n\n1753\n01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:00,440\nAnd so he thinks, well,\n\n1754\n01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:04,920\nthis is kind of unusual because even\nif everybody decided to go out for\n\n1755\n01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:08,480\na smoke break all at once, there would\nstill be somebody here, that kinda thing.\n\n1756\n01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:09,360\nYeah, am I getting punked?\n\n1757\n01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,425\nYeah, exactly, right, where's the camera?\n\n1758\n01:26:11,425 --> 01:26:13,900\n[LAUGH] So there's nobody around, right.\n\n1759\n01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:19,014\nAnd so he's not sure what to do and so he\ngoes back into his little classroom there.\n\n1760\n01:26:19,014 --> 01:26:23,171\nMm-hm.\nAnd he hears some yelling, or screaming.\n\n1761\n01:26:23,171 --> 01:26:25,480\nHe's not quite sure what it is.\n\n1762\n01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:28,150\nAnd so he goes over to the window, because\nhe figures it's gotta be from outside,\n\n1763\n01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:29,285\ncuz there's no body in the office.\n\n1764\n01:26:29,285 --> 01:26:30,080\nUh-huh.\nAnd sure enough,\n\n1765\n01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,920\nhe sees that there are people outside.\n\n1766\n01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,115\nSo he opens the window, remember,\nhe's up on the third floor.\n\n1767\n01:26:34,115 --> 01:26:34,720\nUh-huh.\n\n1768\n01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:39,855\nHe opens the window and there's people\nkind of gesturing, and screaming.\n\n1769\n01:26:39,855 --> 01:26:40,380\nUh-huh.\n\n1770\n01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:43,250\nCan't quite hear what's going on, so\nhe sticks his head out the window a little\n\n1771\n01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:49,115\nbit and he hears they're screaming hey\nyou, whatever, he's not quite sure.\n\n1772\n01:26:49,115 --> 01:26:49,920\nUh-huh.\nBut he looks out,\n\n1773\n01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:54,830\nhe sees everybody, from the office is\noutside, and they're all yelling and\n\n1774\n01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:57,130\npointing, he thinks, oh my god,\nlike the building's on fire or something.\n\n1775\n01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:59,500\nHe's freaking out, he doesn't\nknow what the hell's going on, or\n\n1776\n01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,930\nlike there's a terrorist in the building,\nthere's a bomb, he doesn't know what, but\n\n1777\n01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:06,030\nif everybody is outside but him,\nclearly there's a problem, right?\n\n1778\n01:27:06,030 --> 01:27:08,750\nAnd they want him to come out,\nwhich is why they're yelling at him.\n\n1779\n01:27:08,750 --> 01:27:11,600\nSo he figures it out, but\nnow he doesn't how to down stairs,\n\n1780\n01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,690\nhe doesn't know what to do.\n\n1781\n01:27:12,690 --> 01:27:15,482\nSo it takes him a couple minutes to\nfinally figure it out, he goes outside.\n\n1782\n01:27:15,482 --> 01:27:19,920\nThe minute he walks out the front door of\nthis building, this plant whatever it was,\n\n1783\n01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:24,555\nsecond he walks outside, right,\nthe whole dynamic changes, right.\n\n1784\n01:27:24,555 --> 01:27:27,220\nEverybody's kind of standing outside\nin these areas in these groups, and\n\n1785\n01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:29,930\nwaiting on him, jestering,\nthey all look pissed off.\n\n1786\n01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:34,470\nSecond he comes out everybody kind\nof relaxes, everything changes, and\n\n1787\n01:27:34,470 --> 01:27:36,750\nall of a sudden they all\nbreak from formation and\n\n1788\n01:27:36,750 --> 01:27:38,710\nthey all go wandering\nback into the building.\n\n1789\n01:27:38,710 --> 01:27:40,550\nAnd he's standing there and\nhe's wondering what the,\n\n1790\n01:27:40,550 --> 01:27:42,770\nwhat the hell just happened,\nright, I don't know.\n\n1791\n01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:49,100\nSo, turns out, somebody finally comes\nover to him and says, you know hey,\n\n1792\n01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:54,450\nyou made us stay out here for\nlike 30 minutes or 45 minutes, what's up?\n\n1793\n01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:58,490\nDon't you know that we were having a drill\ntoday, and you were supposed to come out\n\n1794\n01:27:58,490 --> 01:28:01,990\nand marshal with everybody on the fields,\nso we could account for you.\n\n1795\n01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:02,579\nOh.\n\n1796\n01:28:02,579 --> 01:28:05,038\nAnd he said, no, I'm visiting here,\n\n1797\n01:28:05,038 --> 01:28:08,476\nI don't have any clue what\nthe hell you guys are doing.\n\n1798\n01:28:08,476 --> 01:28:12,260\n[LAUGH] And by the way, while you're\ndressing this strange color coat?\n\n1799\n01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:16,860\nBecause I'm like the guy the floor\nmartial coat on, the color for this team.\n\n1800\n01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:17,865\nI don't have a clue.\n\n1801\n01:28:17,865 --> 01:28:21,265\n[LAUGH] Nobody told me you're doing this.\n\n1802\n01:28:21,265 --> 01:28:22,435\nAnd so they're like,\n\n1803\n01:28:22,435 --> 01:28:26,225\nwell the rule says we can't go into the\nbuilding until everybody's accounted for.\n\n1804\n01:28:26,225 --> 01:28:29,255\nRight.\nAnd nobody thought to tell me.\n\n1805\n01:28:29,255 --> 01:28:30,975\nRight?\nMy friends stay in this and so\n\n1806\n01:28:30,975 --> 01:28:32,795\nhe turns this into a teachable moment for\neverybody.\n\n1807\n01:28:32,795 --> 01:28:33,445\nRight.\nBecause he said,\n\n1808\n01:28:33,445 --> 01:28:36,152\nlisten, this is all great but\nI'm here as a visitor.\n\n1809\n01:28:36,152 --> 01:28:37,882\nGod forbid something\nreally bad were to happen.\n\n1810\n01:28:37,882 --> 01:28:39,002\nRight.\nDoes your policy and\n\n1811\n01:28:39,002 --> 01:28:41,842\nyour procedure account for the fact when\nyou have a visitor in the buildings.\n\n1812\n01:28:41,842 --> 01:28:44,515\nSomebody's supposed to be aware for\nthem, [CROSSTALK] responsible for them,\n\n1813\n01:28:44,515 --> 01:28:45,453\nget them and educate them.\n\n1814\n01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:46,513\nYeah.\n\n1815\n01:28:46,513 --> 01:28:48,760\nWell, yeah, it turns out it did but\n\n1816\n01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:52,490\nit turns out that, unfortunately the guy\nwho dropped him off and sent him\n\n1817\n01:28:52,490 --> 01:28:57,410\nto where he was supposed to be forgot to\nnotify the floor warden that he was there.\n\n1818\n01:28:57,410 --> 01:28:59,030\nDid not follow proper procedure.\n\n1819\n01:28:59,030 --> 01:28:59,690\nRight.\nAnd so they\n\n1820\n01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:02,290\ndidn't know he was in the building and\nshould be accounted for.\n\n1821\n01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:03,965\nSo thankfully nothing happened.\n\n1822\n01:29:03,965 --> 01:29:04,555\nRight? Right. Lesson learned.\n\n1823\n01:29:04,555 --> 01:29:06,678\nAbsolutely.\nBut they fixed their policy.\n\n1824\n01:29:06,678 --> 01:29:09,180\nRight?\nHopefully it doesn't happen again.\n\n1825\n01:29:09,180 --> 01:29:11,215\nBut he said, I'm hanging out the window.\n\n1826\n01:29:11,215 --> 01:29:16,112\n[LAUGH] They're yelling at me, and I see\nlike 500 angry people staring up at me.\n\n1827\n01:29:16,112 --> 01:29:17,882\nAll right.\nAnd I'm thinking oh my God.\n\n1828\n01:29:17,882 --> 01:29:20,080\nRight?\n[LAUGH] What did I do wrong?\n\n1829\n01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:21,420\nHow did I piss these people off?\n\n1830\n01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:22,560\nWhat could I possibly have done?\n\n1831\n01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,822\nI've been here for like all of an hour.\n\n1832\n01:29:23,822 --> 01:29:25,689\n[LAUGH] And\nI've been by myself the whole time.\n\n1833\n01:29:25,689 --> 01:29:28,550\nRight?\n[LAUGH] And so this is what can happen\n\n1834\n01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:31,216\nif you don't have security awareness,\nif you don't have training.\n\n1835\n01:29:31,216 --> 01:29:33,584\nYeah.\nIf you don't disseminate information this\n\n1836\n01:29:33,584 --> 01:29:35,160\ncan be a big issue.\n\n1837\n01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:38,530\nThankfully not a life safety one,\nat this point, with this story.\n\n1838\n01:29:38,530 --> 01:29:41,180\nBut could have easily gone the other\nway if there had been fire or\n\n1839\n01:29:41,180 --> 01:29:42,540\nsomething, who knows what.\n\n1840\n01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:44,350\nHopefully it would have gotten out,\nbut you don't know.\n\n1841\n01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:44,850\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n1842\n01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:46,400\nYou just don't know.\n\n1843\n01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:47,030\nAbsolutely.\n\n1844\n01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:48,200\nAll right, so very good, very good.\n\n1845\n01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:51,590\nAll right, well, you got anything else\nyou want to add to our topic for today?\n\n1846\n01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:53,140\nNo, no.\nI think dealing with policies,\n\n1847\n01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:56,100\nguidelines, all the stuff we just\ndiscussed is a really good way to wrap up\n\n1848\n01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:57,560\nthe discussion about risk.\n\n1849\n01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:00,320\nHelp us understand the impact of risk,\nvery important there.\n\n1850\n01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,870\nAnd awareness overall.\n\n1851\n01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:04,540\nWe talked about that theme, we're gonna\ncome back to it in other areas and\n\n1852\n01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:06,550\nother bodies of knowledge\nas we discuss them.\n\n1853\n01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:10,510\nBut that idea, that common theme of\nconfidentiality, integrity, availability.\n\n1854\n01:30:10,510 --> 01:30:14,590\nAnd leading to awareness among our\npopulation and the role of the CISSP to\n\n1855\n01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:18,410\ndrive that awareness broadly and\ndeeply in the organization.\n\n1856\n01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:21,180\nIt's probably a great thing for\nus to summarize on, and wrap up.\n\n1857\n01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:21,702\nVery good, very good.\n\n1858\n01:30:21,702 --> 01:30:24,850\nAll right ladies and gentlemen that's\ngonna wrap it for this episode.\n\n1859\n01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:26,310\nI hope you guys enjoyed the show.\n\n1860\n01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:29,370\nRemember any time during the show if you\nguys have questions, something you want to\n\n1861\n01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:33,120\nask us, or suggest or what have you,\nthrow it in the live chatroom there.\n\n1862\n01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,940\nWe see that, it's in front of us.\n\n1863\n01:30:34,940 --> 01:30:38,150\nI love to hear from you,\nlove to respond to you during the show.\n\n1864\n01:30:38,150 --> 01:30:40,330\nIf you got some question,\nif you're watching this recorded or\n\n1865\n01:30:40,330 --> 01:30:44,020\nsomething like that, up at the top\nof every page is our Q&A section.\n\n1866\n01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:45,940\nAll you gotta do is click on that Q&A.\n\n1867\n01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,210\nYou can submit your questions there and\nwe will get back to you.\n\n1868\n01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:51,612\nWe wanna make sure that you have the\ninformation you need to be successful in\n\n1869\n01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:52,648\nyour certification.\n\n1870\n01:30:52,648 --> 01:30:56,380\nSo, again I hope you guys enjoyed it and\nwe will see you next time.\n\n1871\n01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:58,050\nSigning off, I'm Mike Rodrick.\n\n1872\n01:30:58,050 --> 01:30:58,840\nI'm Adam Gordon.\n\n1873\n01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,023\nSee you soon.\n\n1874\n01:31:00,023 --> 01:31:05,814\n[MUSIC]\n\n",

how to do this.\n\n5\n00:00:33,837 --> 00:00:36,909\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right welcome everybody to another\n\n6\n00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:38,046\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n7\n00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:40,254\nI'm Mike Roderick and\nwith me here today is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n8\n00:00:40,254 --> 00:00:41,830\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n9\n00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:46,120\n>> I'm good, I'm kind of feeling, you\nknow, a little formal and preppy today.\n\n10\n00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,003\n>> Oh yeah I know, I like the look, I\nthink that's very suave or something, yes.\n\n11\n00:00:50,003 --> 00:00:51,670\n>> Thought I'd go with\na slightly different look.\n\n12\n00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,755\n>> Very good, very good, well glad to\nhave everybody with us today, I hope.\n\n13\n00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,475\nHope you guys are ready for\nan exciting show.\n\n14\n00:00:56,475 --> 00:01:00,253\nWe're getting ready to dive into\nsoftware development security.\n\n15\n00:01:00,253 --> 00:01:01,461\n>> Software development security.\n\n16\n00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,875\n>> Yeah.\nSo we're gonna take a look at\n\n17\n00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:06,975\nsome of the things that we do as\nfar as either purchasing software,\n\n18\n00:01:06,975 --> 00:01:08,697\nor developing software, and some\n\n19\n00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:13,057\nof the different models we might follow to\nmake sure that we develop secure software.\n\n20\n00:01:13,057 --> 00:01:16,867\n>> Absolutely, absolutely, so what we're\ngonna talk about and we always start out\n\n21\n00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:20,177\nwhen we start out with one of the bodies\nof knowledge, the top of the domain.\n\n22\n00:01:20,177 --> 00:01:24,342\nAs we start talking in all of\nthe discussions we've been having around\n\n23\n00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:27,887\nCISSP really focusing on\nthe three pillars, right,\n\n24\n00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:31,670\nthe three main areas we focus\non around information security.\n\n25\n00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,030\nAlways wanna remind you of them,\n\n26\n00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,860\nmake sure they're kind of uppermost\nin our mind as we get started.\n\n27\n00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,830\nAnd so\nwe're talking about confidentiality here,\n\n28\n00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,350\nfocusing on how we're gonna\nbuild secure software.\n\n29\n00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,980\nSo not just systems because\nwe're gonna talk about systems.\n\n30\n00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,640\nWe have talked a lot about the building\ncomponents and parts of them, and\n\n31\n00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,650\naspects of them, architecture, etc.,\n\n32\n00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,110\nbut this section we're really\ngonna narrow our focus.\n\n33\n00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,640\nFocus on the development\nof the software and\n\n34\n00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,040\nthings such as the databases we use and\nthen we're gonna manage information.\n\n35\n00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,650\nWe're really focusing on confidentiality\nthere with regards to how we're gonna\n\n36\n00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:07,430\nsafeguard data within a piece of software,\nwithin a solution like a database.\n\n37\n00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,300\nAnd then we're also gonna\nfocus on integrity,\n\n38\n00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,700\nmaking sure the information is not\ngonna be manipulated in any way.\n\n39\n00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,050\nSo we'll talk about things such as the\nACID model around transactional integrity.\n\n40\n00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:21,540\nMake sure we understand the database,\nit should always be in a consistent state.\n\n41\n00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,780\nThe data in the database, in other words,\n\n42\n00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,250\nshould never be in a state\nthat's not consistent.\n\n43\n00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,360\nEither it's gonna be a known\nstate before we transact,\n\n44\n00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,140\nit's gonna be during the transaction,\nobviously, changing although there may be\n\n45\n00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,310\ncheckpoints along the way during each part\nof that transaction to ensure integrity.\n\n46\n00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,970\nAnd then at the end of that transaction\nwe have to either, again, achieve a known\n\n47\n00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:46,430\nstate, stable, secure, or we have to\nroll back that transaction in effect and\n\n48\n00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,050\ngo back to a prior known state to ensure\nthat the data always has integrity.\n\n49\n00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,750\nAnd then we're also gonna be\nthinking about availability, right?\n\n50\n00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,310\nWhat's going on with availability?\n\n51\n00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,990\nIs our data where it's supposed to be?\n\n52\n00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,900\nCan we get to it?\n\n53\n00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,160\nDo we have security mechanisms that\nallow us to maintain access control but\n\n54\n00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,070\nalso monitoring an optimization\nto ensure availability?\n\n55\n00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,620\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n56\n00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,270\nwe're gonna focus on these areas, right,\nmake sure we have a sense of them.\n\n57\n00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,330\nWe're gonna talk about some common\nsoftware development issues,\n\n58\n00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,400\nsoftware development life cycles,\nas well as system development life cycles.\n\n59\n00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,130\nCompare and contrast the two so we have\na better understanding of how they work.\n\n60\n00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,730\nSoftware security development approaches,\nwhat are the different mechanisms?\n\n61\n00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,040\n>> Right.\n>> Some of the methodologies,\n\n62\n00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,990\ncapability maturity model,\nWaterfall, Just in Time, RAD,\n\n63\n00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:32,012\nJAD, all these different solutions,\nAgile, they're fun to say.\n\n64\n00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:32,512\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n65\n00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,067\n>> So, have fun and\n\n66\n00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:35,032\nplay around with the JIT, Just in Time.\n>> Guess what guys,\n\n67\n00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:36,570\nhere comes some more acronyms for you.\n[LAUGH]\n\n68\n00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,980\n>> Comes a whole bunch more acronyms,\n\n69\n00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,962\na lot more vocabulary,\n\n70\n00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:42,230\nwe've got another long laundry list\nof vocabulary to go through, as well.\n\n71\n00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:42,754\nAbsolutely.\n\n72\n00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:46,190\nSo programming language types, you know,\nwhat's a first generation versus\n\n73\n00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,728\nwhat's a second generation, versus\na fifth generation programming language.\n\n74\n00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:51,330\nGonna talk about all that.\n\n75\n00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,274\nDatabase concept security issues,\n\n76\n00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,850\nso making sure we have the proper\nfocus on things like extreme views.\n\n77\n00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,780\nSo we filter out information if\nit's not supposed to be there.\n\n78\n00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,150\nExpert systems and\nartificial intelligence what we call AI.\n\n79\n00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,190\nSo how do we achieve those systems.\n\n80\n00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,540\nTalk about how to effectively\nbuild the matrix, if you will.\n\n81\n00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,170\n>> Right.\n\n82\n00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,370\n>> And then what are some\nmalware types and attacks?\n\n83\n00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,840\nWe'll wrap up our discussions talking\nabout some of the common malware.\n\n84\n00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,730\nSo we've talked about a lot of these\nthings in several other areas.\n\n85\n00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,360\nAs we've been working\nthrough the CISSP material,\n\n86\n00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,290\nsome will be coming later on as we\ncontinue our conversations as well.\n\n87\n00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,210\nBut in general now malware as a category\nencompasses all sorts of evil and\n\n88\n00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,300\nbad things that can invade our systems,\nbut we'll define that a little bit more.\n\n89\n00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,740\nWe'll talk about things like basically\nbots and we'll talk about worms and\n\n90\n00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,210\nviruses and\njust what all those categories are and\n\n91\n00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,120\nmake sure we have a sense of all that.\n\n92\n00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120\nSounds like a plan.\n\n93\n00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,680\n>> Absolutely.\n\n94\n00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,450\nWell hopefully a good one,\nwe'll see how that goes, obviously, right?\n\n95\n00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,228\nYou're only as good as\nyour last plan I suppose.\n\n96\n00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:48,070\n>> [LAUGH] That's right.\n\n97\n00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,570\n>> All right, so we do have a whole\nbunch of stuff we want to get to so\n\n98\n00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,170\nlet's get started with some of\nthe notes that we put together.\n\n99\n00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,440\nAnd when we talk about\nsoftware development security,\n\n100\n00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,310\nwe're gonna start up by talking about\na system development life cycle.\n\n101\n00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,470\nWe have two SDLCs,\ntwo development life cycles\n\n102\n00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,920\nin this section that we're\ngonna be speaking about.\n\n103\n00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,360\nBut the first one is the system\ndevelopment life cycle.\n\n104\n00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,730\nWe're gonna follow that up afterwards\nwith the software development life cycle.\n\n105\n00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,650\nBoth are simply referred to as SDLC's\nbecause they both refer to an aspect of,\n\n106\n00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,820\nor building a system around\nthis kind of structure, but\n\n107\n00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,330\none is focused on system architecture, the\nother is focused on software development.\n\n108\n00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,059\nSo, the idea here with an SDLC, a system\ndevelopment life cycle is going to be made\n\n109\n00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,360\nup of these following characteristics or\ncomponents or phases.\n\n110\n00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,430\nSo we start with initiation,\nyou can see it there, and\n\n111\n00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,805\nwe have a total of five by the away,\nfive phases, initiation,\n\n112\n00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:39,920\nacquisition/development, you can see it on\nthe screen there, we have implementation,\n\n113\n00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,520\nwe have operation/maintenance,\nand then we have disposal.\n\n114\n00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,290\nSo we're gonna quickly walk through\neach of these just to make sure we're\n\n115\n00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,380\ncomfortable with them.\n\n116\n00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,140\nIn initiation,\nlike any good development life cycle,\n\n117\n00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,500\nwe have a very well defined starting\npoint, got a bunch of stuff going on in\n\n118\n00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,080\nthe middle kind of stepping down, and\nwe have a very well defined end point.\n\n119\n00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,655\nSo with initiation in the beginning, we\nbasically need to have a sense of what's\n\n120\n00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:02,040\ngonna be happening, how are we\ngoing to define this new system?\n\n121\n00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,740\nWhat is gonna be the look and feel?\n\n122\n00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,490\nWhat are we looking to achieve?\n\n123\n00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,230\nUltimately, what is the goal\nthat we are looking to build and\n\n124\n00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,720\nhit as a marker of success,\nif we do this the right way?\n\n125\n00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720\nAnd so,\nwe will create the system definition,\n\n126\n00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,560\nhere, we address the questions.\n\n127\n00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,910\nWhat are we looking to do,\nwhat do we need?\n\n128\n00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,570\nAnd why do we want to do it,\nwhy are we going to do this?\n\n129\n00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,150\nSo, what do we want to accomplish,\nand basically, what equals success.\n\n130\n00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,550\nOr, success equals X,\nwe'll have a list, whatever that is.\n\n131\n00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,260\nThose are the questions we look to\naddress in the initiation phase.\n\n132\n00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,530\nWe should also be clear and very, very\nfocused on the fact here, preliminary risk\n\n133\n00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,360\nassessment, in other words the initial\nidea of looking at risk around this idea\n\n134\n00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,690\nof what we want to build, how we want\nto build it has to come in here.\n\n135\n00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,510\nAnd it's important to understand\nthat from the very beginning,\n\n136\n00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,040\nif we're not focused on risk, not focused\non understanding what could potentially go\n\n137\n00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,500\nright, and as a result, we have to then be\naware of what could potentially go wrong.\n\n138\n00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,850\nAnd if we define these two concepts, and\nunderstand success, but then understand\n\n139\n00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,175\nas a result of success, in effect\nwhat I think of as the antithesis or\n\n140\n00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:07,420\nanti-success, which is what I you\nknow classify as risk in my projects.\n\n141\n00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,540\nBecause anything that gets in the way\nof creating success is effectively\n\n142\n00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:15,910\na risk that we have to somehow be aware\nof, somehow at least understand, document.\n\n143\n00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,920\nWe may choose, and there are multiple\nways to deal with risk but\n\n144\n00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,320\nthere are four accepted ways.\n\n145\n00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,496\nFour ways that in project management and\n\n146\n00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:25,490\nin just about any methodology you\nthink of and hear about today.\n\n147\n00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,320\nYou will hear referred to, so\nlet's probably just take a minute and\n\n148\n00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,990\ngo through those really quickly, it's\nalways a good idea to be aware of them.\n\n149\n00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,606\n>> Right.\n>> In no particular order,\n\n150\n00:07:32,606 --> 00:07:35,540\nthey're not prioritized,\nthey're just all important.\n\n151\n00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,962\nBut as we talk about risk, we always wanna\nthink about how to address risk and so\n\n152\n00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:43,917\nwe could potentially decide that we\nare going to accept risk, right.\n\n153\n00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:45,956\nSo we can just agree\nthat the risk is there,\n\n154\n00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:49,637\nit's kinda the price of doing business or\nwhatever you would frame it as, and\n\n155\n00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:53,375\nwe kinda go on about our business knowing\nit's there, and we then take steps to\n\n156\n00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:57,144\nunderstand that if it does happen,\nit's something we already agreed about.\n\n157\n00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:57,760\nWe knew, right?\n\n158\n00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,889\n>> It's not gonna impact us enough\nto warrant Taking any other action.\n\n159\n00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:01,806\n>> We would hope not.\nRight?\n\n160\n00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:04,206\nI mean we obviously could\npotentially be right about that,\n\n161\n00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:06,560\nyou know incident may prove\nthat we were wrong about that.\n\n162\n00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,860\nThings could be worse, you never know.\n\n163\n00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,940\nYou know people who lived in New Orleans,\nand\n\n164\n00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:13,130\nyou know never want to make light of\nwhat happened with Hurricane Katrina but\n\n165\n00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,550\nyou know people that lived in New Orleans\nkind of implicitly accepted the idea that\n\n166\n00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,080\nin theory at some point,\nmaybe a levee could break.\n\n167\n00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,000\nBut I don't think anybody really\nunderstood the implications and\n\n168\n00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,254\ntruly understood what accepting that risk\nprobably was given the significant amount\n\n169\n00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:31,185\nthat was caused when\nthat actually occurred.\n\n170\n00:08:31,185 --> 00:08:33,755\nSo, I think, often times we except risk,\n\n171\n00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:39,615\nwithout realizing that maybe that\nrisk is a little bit more involved.\n\n172\n00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:40,535\n>> Right.\n>> Maybe there's a little\n\n173\n00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:41,407\nbit more to it than that.\n\n174\n00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:43,737\nSo, I always hedge when I\ntalk about accepting risk.\n\n175\n00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:46,987\nCause I think on the surface it's easier\nto say, oh yeah you know, there is always\n\n176\n00:08:46,987 --> 00:08:49,507\nthe likelihood that that'll happen but\nthat's never going to happen to me.\n\n177\n00:08:49,507 --> 00:08:50,271\n>> Right.\n<< Right,\n\n178\n00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:52,670\nI'm not the one who's\ngoing to have that issue,\n\n179\n00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,187\nbut when it does happen you know,\nusually you are thinking to yourself.\n\n180\n00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:57,212\nWhat was I thinking?!\n\n181\n00:08:57,212 --> 00:09:00,877\n[LAUGH] You know, how can I possibly have\nthought that would have been a good idea.\n\n182\n00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:02,940\nIf I'd only thought about it.\n\n183\n00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,650\nRight, so yeah, we definitely\ntalked about accepting risk, so\n\n184\n00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,740\naccepting risk,\nwe can decide to transfer risk.\n\n185\n00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,690\nClassic example of transference of\nrisk is buying insurance, in fact.\n\n186\n00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,380\n>> Insurance policies, yeah.\n\n187\n00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,420\n>> Give somebody else the liability\nof managing the risk on your behalf\n\n188\n00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,360\n>> Typically in exchange for\n\n189\n00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,470\nmoney more often than not because\nthere's always an offset there.\n\n190\n00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,450\nSo we can accept risk.\n\n191\n00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,650\nWe can transfer risk.\n\n192\n00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,350\nWe can avoid risk.\n\n193\n00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,970\nBasically run away from it or\n\n194\n00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,240\njust decide to engage in activities that\ndon't really bring risk to our front door.\n\n195\n00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,387\nWhatever those things may be.\n\n196\n00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:34,490\nAnd or\nwe can do what's called mitigating risk.\n\n197\n00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,920\nWe've talked about mitigating\nin some of our other shows.\n\n198\n00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,760\nIt's just basically a fancy term for\nminimizing risk.\n\n199\n00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,170\n>> Yeah, try to lessen the impact.\n\n200\n00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,920\n>> Yeah, lessen the impact,\nright, whatever that may be.\n\n201\n00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,960\nSo maybe we take some steps to\ndo some things that potentially\n\n202\n00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,580\n>> Help us to do that, right?\n\n203\n00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,630\nIn the case of things like, I always\nlike to use the example of hurricanes,\n\n204\n00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,410\nbecause we live in Florida,\n\n205\n00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,170\ngetting close to hurricane season\naround this time of the year, so\n\n206\n00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,000\nwhen you think about mitigating, you think\nabout things like stocking some water and\n\n207\n00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,740\nbatteries, canned food, you go ahead and\nbring in the yard furniture.\n\n208\n00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,950\nPlywood out there just in case you got\nto board up the windows [INAUDIBLE]\n\n209\n00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,860\n>> Yeah, right, all that kind of stuff.\n\n210\n00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,690\nYou go through if you have storm shutters,\nyou loosen the bolts and\n\n211\n00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,000\nyou know WD40 them every year.\n\n212\n00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,770\n>> Right, right.\n\n213\n00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,680\n>> Yeah, that kind of stuff.\n\n214\n00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,190\nYou just you know it's kind of the cycle,\nyou get ready.\n\n215\n00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,740\nYou know if you life up north\ngetting close to winter,\n\n216\n00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,570\nyou make sure that you have extra supplies\nlaid in, you typically make sure that you\n\n217\n00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,760\nhave some ballast in your trunk, right,\nso you put some heavy blocks or typically\n\n218\n00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,160\nthings like that in the trunk and in case\nthe car's on ice, it's fish tailing.\n\n219\n00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,450\nWell there's a lot of fun, right?\n\n220\n00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,320\n>> Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.\n\n221\n00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,940\n>> Kind of going like it's bogging,\n\n222\n00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,190\ngoing down the hill when you're\ndriving on ice like that.\n\n223\n00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:40,400\nSo that kind of stuff, where you want\nto mitigate, want to minimize risk.\n\n224\n00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,400\nWhen we're talking about the software,\nor excuse me, in this case the system,\n\n225\n00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,230\ndue up on life cycle, but\ngenerally any developing life cycle.\n\n226\n00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,810\nWe type that initiation the remember\nthat during the initiation phase,\n\n227\n00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,210\nit is crucial to engage\nin risk assessment.\n\n228\n00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:57,520\nStarting out, we will deal with risk\nassessment almost all the way through.\n\n229\n00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,740\nBut what's called a preliminary risk\nassessment is going to happen there and\n\n230\n00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,540\nas a result of that, we need to make\nsure we develop it, carry it out and\n\n231\n00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,220\nthen we're creating as we can see here\nthese descriptions of confidentiality,\n\n232\n00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,800\nintegrity and\n\n233\n00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,190\navailability, three pillars of information\nsecurity, built right in the beginning.\n\n234\n00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,280\nUnderstand and define them so that way, so\n\n235\n00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,200\nremember, we're focused on\nbuilding a system here.\n\n236\n00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,920\nAt that level now, we already start\nout knowing what those things are,\n\n237\n00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,560\nwe bake them in, in effect, from\nthe beginning, and there's no question,\n\n238\n00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,000\nno ambivalence whatsoever,\nabsolutely no way to get around it.\n\n239\n00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,770\nIf we don't do our job up front,\n\n240\n00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,680\nthen clearly our system's not going\nto be well defined, well built.\n\n241\n00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,910\nBut if we do it up front,\ndo it the right way,\n\n242\n00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,090\nwe're going have those things\nthere right from the beginning.\n\n243\n00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,730\nIt's going to work,\nit's going to be good, right?\n\n244\n00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,726\nSo then we have acquisition/development,\n\n245\n00:11:41,726 --> 00:11:45,602\nacquisition/development phase two\nin our development life cycle.\n\n246\n00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:48,490\nThis is where new systems will\neither be created or purchased.\n\n247\n00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,390\nYou may go out and buy off the shelf,\na lot of times there\n\n248\n00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,750\nare things out there that meet our\nrequirements, kind of do what we need.\n\n249\n00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,610\n>> Right.\n>> We may want to tweak them a little bit.\n\n250\n00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,550\nBut, it may be easier to buy than it\nis to build, it's typically cheaper.\n\n251\n00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,230\nAlthough in the long run, when we actually\ndo the cost-benefit analysis, it may or\n\n252\n00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,870\nmay not be.\n\n253\n00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,620\nIt's hard to say how we measure that.\n\n254\n00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,030\nThere's quantitative.\n\n255\n00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,600\nDollar and number fixed asset measurement.\n\n256\n00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,955\nThere's qualitative soft measures.\n\n257\n00:12:12,955 --> 00:12:17,685\nAround this kind of stuff, you know human\ncapital, you and I let's say our time,\n\n258\n00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:20,485\nwe can measure that with dollars and\nwe can put a value on that that's\n\n259\n00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:25,105\nquantitative, but\nthere's also the soft measure there.\n\n260\n00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:28,935\nHow much new skills do we have to acquire,\nwhat are those worth to the business,\n\n261\n00:12:28,935 --> 00:12:31,949\nwhat are we not doing as a result\nof them having to do this.\n\n262\n00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,110\nProductivity is definitely\nharder to measure,\n\n263\n00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:38,640\nthere's a quantitative function,\nit's usually a qualitative thing, so\n\n264\n00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,420\nwe have to be thinking about that and\nunderstand that.\n\n265\n00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,840\nActivities will typically\noccur here during this phase,\n\n266\n00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,580\nwe have requirements analysis,\n\n267\n00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,290\nwe're going to do an in depth study\nof what we really need to figure out.\n\n268\n00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,040\nHow we want to do, and\nwhat it is we want to do it, so\n\n269\n00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,700\nwe're going to ask people questions, hey,\nwhat do you think this system needs to do?\n\n270\n00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,940\nWhat are the features?\n\n271\n00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,820\nWhat are the functions we\nwant to build in there?\n\n272\n00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,030\nFormal risk assessment, so we did\ninformal, right, in the initiation phase,\n\n273\n00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,190\nwe're going to do formal here, where we're\ngoing to identify vulnerabilities and\n\n274\n00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,240\nthreats, and we're going to make sure we\nunderstand what they are, we're going to\n\n275\n00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,780\nascribe them to the different areas of\nthe system we have to deal with them in.\n\n276\n00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,630\nAnd then we're going to kind of build\non that initial risk assessment\n\n277\n00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,800\nto do a more thorough job.\n\n278\n00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,200\nSecurity function requirements analysis,\n\n279\n00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,970\nsecurity assurance requirements analysis,\nthese things have to happen here.\n\n280\n00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,820\nWe're going to figure out what\nthe protection levels are.\n\n281\n00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,100\nWhat kind of security has to be\nbuilt in and baked into the system.\n\n282\n00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,460\nWe have to identify all of\nthe different aspects for\n\n283\n00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,980\nhow the system is going to work.\n\n284\n00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,910\nAs a result of that ultimately,\n\n285\n00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,050\nfigure out what kind of security we're\nbuilding in it from the ground up.\n\n286\n00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,290\nDoes our system need a TPM,\na Trusted Platform Module?\n\n287\n00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,550\nWhat kind of security\nmonitor are we going to have?\n\n288\n00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,700\nOr, reference monitor for the kernel?\n\n289\n00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,421\nAre we going to have\na multi-layer security policy or\n\n290\n00:13:51,421 --> 00:13:53,330\nmulti-level security policy.\n\n291\n00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,710\nAll these things are starting\nto be fleshed out here.\n\n292\n00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,090\nWe may have third party\nevaluations that take place.\n\n293\n00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,690\nWe may review the level of service and\n\n294\n00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,190\nquality that certain vendors may be\nable to bring in, if we're purchasing.\n\n295\n00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,830\nSo this typically happens when we go\nout and we buy, cause when we go to buy\n\n296\n00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,910\nwe obviously have to deal with the vendor\nthat's selling this and understand\n\n297\n00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,470\nwhat level of service, what level of\ncommitment, what their architecture is.\n\n298\n00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,560\nSo in effect, we're doing the same thing,\nit's just that if we're buying,\n\n299\n00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,180\nwe're doing it through the vendor if it's\nus building it, we're doing it internally.\n\n300\n00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,010\nBut in fact, we want to get to the same\nplace regardless of how we get there.\n\n301\n00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,720\nThen a Security plan has to be developed.\n\n302\n00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,950\nWe have to document all\nthe security elements,\n\n303\n00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,712\nthe controls that are being built in.\n\n304\n00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:34,170\nGot to make sure we understand\nwhat's happening there so\n\n305\n00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,940\nthat we have a good sense of that.\n\n306\n00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,620\nObviously, we're going to be\nable to roll that documentation\n\n307\n00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,970\nforward into other areas.\n\n308\n00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,688\nAnd then Security testing and\nevaluation planning.\n\n309\n00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:44,920\nWe're going to go out and\noutline all the security controls and\n\n310\n00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,260\nevaluate them,\nreally walk through all the parts.\n\n311\n00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,490\nI almost think of it like building,\n\n312\n00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,990\nwe've talked about this in some of our\nother shows, building IKEA furniture.\n\n313\n00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,140\nSo what do you when you get an IKEA piece,\nat least what I do anyway, I open the box,\n\n314\n00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,800\nI curse once or twice or something and\nwhat the hell was I thinking,\n\n315\n00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,970\nlike I have nothing better to do today?\n\n316\n00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,420\n>> Open all the little bags open and\npour all the parts out on the table.\n\n317\n00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,640\nRight, pour it all out on the table,\nit's one big mess\n\n318\n00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,500\n>> Since then what do you do,\n\n319\n00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,170\nyou get out your instruction\nsheet because that's the key.\n\n320\n00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,175\nGod forbid you should lose\nthat instruction sheet,\n\n321\n00:15:13,175 --> 00:15:17,050\ncause then you basically have a pile\nof junk and you have nothing to do.\n\n322\n00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,280\nWell how do I possibly put this together,\nwhere does this go?\n\n323\n00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,715\nSo you get the instruction sheet out and\nyou basically matching,\n\n324\n00:15:21,715 --> 00:15:24,502\nyou put everything out, lay it out,\ncount it out, make sure you know it's\n\n325\n00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:27,006\nthere, and then [CROSSTALK]\n>> Screws that are this long, you get four\n\n326\n00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:29,640\nthat are this long [CROSSTALK]\n>> The picture never quite looks\n\n327\n00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,200\nlike what it's supposed to.\n\n328\n00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,620\n>> No.\n>> And so you get it all together, and\n\n329\n00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,040\nyou have it laid out, so\nyou have 25 piles on the floor.\n\n330\n00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,670\n>> Right.\n>> And now you have to start going and\n\n331\n00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,710\ngrabbing stuff from each area to build it.\n\n332\n00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:43,262\nBut, you know, the smart approach about\nthis, which is why they're so successful,\n\n333\n00:15:43,262 --> 00:15:46,134\nyou know it's the same idea with fast\nfood where you order by picture,\n\n334\n00:15:46,134 --> 00:15:48,685\norder by menu number because it\nmakes things easy for people.\n\n335\n00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:52,663\nI mean I joke about this all the time, and\nI just rail against it in my classes but\n\n336\n00:15:52,663 --> 00:15:56,279\nif you think about the logic of this I\nmean the reason why we do this kind of\n\n337\n00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,842\nstuff is that this is basically how people\nhave chosen to consume information.\n\n338\n00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:04,690\nYou know, the fact that people are more\ncomfortable looking at something,\n\n339\n00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,262\nhaving a sense, going,\nokay, yeah, I want that.\n\n340\n00:16:06,262 --> 00:16:09,350\nNumber two, is why this model works.\n\n341\n00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:12,100\nSo the idea with this really\nis that at the end of the day,\n\n342\n00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:15,440\nwe're talking about acquisition and\ndevelopment as a phase.\n\n343\n00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,040\nWe're gonna be going through and\nreally figuring out how to lay\n\n344\n00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,240\nout all those little parts and\nmake those piles of stuff.\n\n345\n00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,880\nAnd then, when we're done in this phase,\n\n346\n00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,550\nwe move into implementation, we're going\nto be able to build by actually going and\n\n347\n00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:31,420\ngrabbing off those piles as we need,\nfollowing our instruction set,\n\n348\n00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,180\nwhich is basically the documentation\nwe just laid out, security plan.\n\n349\n00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,750\nWe're going to then build all of\nthe component parts and put together\n\n350\n00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,730\nthe system, build a piece of furniture,\nmake it look like the picture on the box.\n\n351\n00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,240\nSo, that's whats going on here,\nand that's really why we do this.\n\n352\n00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,080\nSo then we have implementation.\n\n353\n00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,250\nWith implementation we have the new\nsystem being installed in production,\n\n354\n00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,490\nso effectively either we're buying and\nit's now being turned on.\n\n355\n00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,860\nOr we are going to build, and\n\n356\n00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,670\nwe're going to be able to\nbasically get it ready to go,\n\n357\n00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,180\nbuild it all up, so we're going to have a\nfunctioning solution here pretty quickly.\n\n358\n00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,610\nThe system is going to have\nall the baselines set up.\n\n359\n00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,140\nHow are we going to turn this thing on?\n\n360\n00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,180\nWhat does it look like when it starts up?\n\n361\n00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,530\nAll the updates have to be applied,\nif there's patches, firmware updates,\n\n362\n00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,860\nwhatever they may be.\n\n363\n00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,730\nSo we are going to do all that in this\nphase, kind of get it ready to go.\n\n364\n00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,960\nSo this is polishing it up,\nmaking it look all pretty.\n\n365\n00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,270\nRight?\nAnd then the operation and maintenance.\n\n366\n00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,860\nThe system is gonna actually going\nto be used, so its turned on now,\n\n367\n00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,280\nit's being used day to day.\n\n368\n00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,700\nWe're caring for it, we're making sure\nthat it's being maintained, hopefully,\n\n369\n00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,570\nproperly.\n\n370\n00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:30,600\nContinuous monitoring is taking place,\n\n371\n00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,940\nwe're gonna have some sort of\nconfiguration management and\n\n372\n00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,095\nchange control in place,\nas we've talked about there.\n\n373\n00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:39,240\nOngoing vulnerability assessments and\npen testing should be taking place.\n\n374\n00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,350\nAnd then in disposal, our last phase,\nwhat we are going to see there is that\n\n375\n00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,500\nwe're basically getting ready\nto end of life the system.\n\n376\n00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,190\nSo we're going to get ready to turn\nit off, take it out of production,\n\n377\n00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,225\nmost likely.\n\n378\n00:17:50,225 --> 00:17:52,850\nDisposal activities around making\nsure we get rid of everything\n\n379\n00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,980\nthat's in the system.\n\n380\n00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,310\nMaybe proprietary information,\nmaybe personally identifiable information.\n\n381\n00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,090\nWhatever it is,\nwe have to safe guard that information.\n\n382\n00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,880\nSo securely destroy that, move it out\nof the system, and turn the system off,\n\n383\n00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,340\nis what happens here with disposal,\nit's the end of the road for this system.\n\n384\n00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,000\nSo, this is our traditional\nsystem development life cycle,\n\n385\n00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,610\nsystem development life cycle.\n\n386\n00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,640\nWhen we talk about our software\ndevelopment life cycle in juxtaposition,\n\n387\n00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,630\nkind of comparing the two, the life cycle\nfor software development really deals with\n\n388\n00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,000\nas we say they are putting repeatable and\npredictable processes in place.\n\n389\n00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,400\nHelping us to ensure we meet\nour budgetary requirements,\n\n390\n00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,950\nmeet our functionality requirements.\n\n391\n00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,570\nWe often talk about this\nidea of measuring and\n\n392\n00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,110\nmanaging a project relation\nthrough variables.\n\n393\n00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,610\nRight, the old saying of get it good,\nfast, and\n\n394\n00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,650\ncheap, you only get two out of three.\n\n395\n00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,320\nRight?\n\n396\n00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,570\nSo, try going through\na drive through somewhere and\n\n397\n00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,290\npicking up some fast food later, and\ntell me how you manage good, fast, cheap.\n\n398\n00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,440\nBecause.\nYou got the fast and the cheap,\n\n399\n00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,460\nbut we know for a fact it ain't good.\n\n400\n00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,460\nSo, when you go through that\nthis is how we manage projects.\n\n401\n00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,840\nWe say we're basically going to be able to\nflex these three variables in some form,\n\n402\n00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,455\ncoordinate the flexing,\n\n403\n00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:05,445\nthe negotiation between them to figure\nout how we're going to hit our mark.\n\n404\n00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:07,085\nSo, if you want something that's good,\n\n405\n00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:10,755\nand you want something that's fast,\nit's not going to be cheap.\n\n406\n00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:13,545\nAnd if you want something that's fast and\ncheap, we already did that one, right?\n\n407\n00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:15,125\n>> Yeah.\n>> It's probably not going to be good.\n\n408\n00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:20,635\nAnd if it's going to be good and cheap,\nit's probably not going to be very fast.\n\n409\n00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:23,780\n>> Right.\n>> And so, as a result of that,\n\n410\n00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,100\nwe have to understand we can\nflex two of the three but\n\n411\n00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,210\none of those things get locked, in effect.\n\n412\n00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,050\nWe say, listen, you can have a little bit\nof wiggle room here, good and fast, but\n\n413\n00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,010\nif it's good and fast right,\nit's not going to be cheap.\n\n414\n00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,380\nWe're going to have to go in and\n\n415\n00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,580\nwe're going spend more money because you\nhave to throw a lot of resources at it.\n\n416\n00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,140\nFor us to build it quickly and\nget it right the first time.\n\n417\n00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,810\nSo this is how we manage through this,\nand when we do the life cycle of\n\n418\n00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,010\nsoftware development, we're talking\nabout functionality, cost, quality,\n\n419\n00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,040\nand delivery, and\nbasically the same concept.\n\n420\n00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,350\nFunctionality and\nquality are really about requirements.\n\n421\n00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:01,100\nCost is about money, right,\ntime, right, resources, and\n\n422\n00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,180\nthe delivery schedule is time, right,\nwe're really thinking about how quickly.\n\n423\n00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,386\nSo we have those three things.\n\n424\n00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:09,223\nSo let's talk quickly about\nour phases here, right.\n\n425\n00:20:09,223 --> 00:20:12,473\nSo when we're talking about our system\ndevelopment life cycle, remember,\n\n426\n00:20:12,473 --> 00:20:15,183\nwe have our five phases, right,\nso we've been through those.\n\n427\n00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:17,845\nWhen we talk about our software\ndevelopment life cycle,\n\n428\n00:20:17,845 --> 00:20:21,561\nwe still have our five, we still have\nfive phases, five different phases, but\n\n429\n00:20:21,561 --> 00:20:23,955\nthey are very similar,\nthey're kind of lined up.\n\n430\n00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:28,319\nSo we have requirements gathering,\nwe have design, we have development,\n\n431\n00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:33,092\nwe have testing and validation, lot of\nstuff there in testing and validation, and\n\n432\n00:20:33,092 --> 00:20:36,530\nthen down below we have\nrelease maintenance, right?\n\n433\n00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:40,120\nSo we have these five phases, and\nwe kind of see an alignment with them,\n\n434\n00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,020\nthey're not a 100%, but they are similar.\n\n435\n00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,670\nInitiation is very similar,\n\n436\n00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,080\nthe requirements gathering here,\nin that respect, if you think about this.\n\n437\n00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,780\nSo, what we do here in requirements\ngathering is we determine why we're going\n\n438\n00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:54,280\nto create the software, you know, what's\nthe software gonna do, who's it going to\n\n439\n00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,900\nbe created for, so you know, who's\nthe audience, you know, what's the party.\n\n440\n00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,490\nYes.\nExactly it.\n\n441\n00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,530\nThat's exactly what we are doing.\n\n442\n00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,660\nWe are setting up the scope for it.\n\n443\n00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,420\nSo it's very very important\nto be thinking about that.\n\n444\n00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,640\nAnd so, we are going through and\n\n445\n00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,390\nsetting up security requirements,\ndoing our risk assessment.\n\n446\n00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,130\nThere's our initial risk assessments\njust like in the initiation phase, and\n\n447\n00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,490\nthe system development life cycle\nwe have risk level acceptance.\n\n448\n00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,410\nWe're accepting risk after\nwe've identified it, initially.\n\n449\n00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:23,060\nSo, all that's taking place here.\n\n450\n00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,280\nWe then have design.\n\n451\n00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,060\nOur design phase, it's going to be very\nsimilar to acquisition and or development.\n\n452\n00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,520\nWhere we are in the system\ndevelopment life cycle,\n\n453\n00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,550\nkind of comparing those two as we go.\n\n454\n00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:36,635\nThe design phase deals with how\nthe software is going to be set up\n\n455\n00:21:36,635 --> 00:21:38,635\nto accomplish what it needs to do, right.\n\n456\n00:21:38,635 --> 00:21:40,845\nBasically we're going to look\nat the functional design and\n\n457\n00:21:40,845 --> 00:21:44,435\nfigure out how to build the thing that\nthe requirements tell us we need to build.\n\n458\n00:21:44,435 --> 00:21:46,625\nWe're going to do some\nattack surface analysis,\n\n459\n00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,042\nreally look to identify, streamline and\n\n460\n00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,642\nstrip down all the different things\nthat could go wrong in there.\n\n461\n00:21:51,642 --> 00:21:54,512\nSo if we're gonna build\na piece of software that\n\n462\n00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:58,452\nusers interact with directly, what kinda\nmenus, what kinda options do they have?\n\n463\n00:21:58,452 --> 00:21:59,772\nHow are we gonna update it?\n\n464\n00:21:59,772 --> 00:22:01,922\nWhat kinda system calls does it make?\n\n465\n00:22:01,922 --> 00:22:03,722\nWhat kinda DLLs will it use?\n\n466\n00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,302\nAre they digitally signed?\n\n467\n00:22:05,302 --> 00:22:07,772\nAll of these things have to be\ntaken into account and considered.\n\n468\n00:22:07,772 --> 00:22:08,912\nWe're gonna do some threat modeling.\n\n469\n00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,710\nWe're gonna look at systematic\napproaches to understand\n\n470\n00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,030\nhow threats can be realized in the system.\n\n471\n00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,580\nIf we allow the system to\n\n472\n00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:21,090\nmake calls directly into a piece of\nhardware could that then be manipulated?\n\n473\n00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:26,885\nAre we sending the information back and\nforth between the piece of software,\n\n474\n00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:30,645\nbetween the interface and maybe\na database, wherever we are storing it.\n\n475\n00:22:30,645 --> 00:22:32,915\nAre we using encrypted traffic to do that?\n\n476\n00:22:32,915 --> 00:22:35,105\nAre we using cryptographic\nmodules from you know,\n\n477\n00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,195\nwell known code bases to do that?\n\n478\n00:22:37,195 --> 00:22:39,045\nSo you know what kind of\nlibraries we're using to develop?\n\n479\n00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:40,865\nWhat kind of code we're using?\n\n480\n00:22:40,865 --> 00:22:43,085\nHave we run that code\nthrough a threat analyzer?\n\n481\n00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:45,795\nHave we looked at it to make sure it's\ndone with the best coding practices?\n\n482\n00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:48,710\nThese are the kind of things we'd be\nlooking at here in threat modeling.\n\n483\n00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,590\nThen in the development phase,\nthis is where we're gonna go in and\n\n484\n00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,500\nwe're going to program the software codes,\nwe're actually gonna start writing code.\n\n485\n00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,938\n[CROSSTALK] So we're gonna lay this out,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n486\n00:22:57,938 --> 00:23:01,241\nSo this is also kinda like the acquisition\ndevelopment phase of the system\n\n487\n00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:02,421\ndevelopment lifecycle.\n\n488\n00:23:02,421 --> 00:23:05,200\nIt's kinda going on,\nit's still part of that.\n\n489\n00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,550\nSo we're gonna go in, and we're\nbasically gonna build there, right, and\n\n490\n00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,290\nwe're gonna break things down into some\nvery specific defined deliverables.\n\n491\n00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:16,350\nAnd programmers can then take those little\nchunks and knock them off and create\n\n492\n00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,110\nthe functionality we need, so we have all\nthe deliverable requirements lining up.\n\n493\n00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:23,620\nSo we don't build the whole thing,\nwe build module components, in effect, and\n\n494\n00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,680\nstitch them together.\n\n495\n00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,770\n>> Milestones, woohoo.\n\n496\n00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,952\n>> Milestones exactly right.\n\n497\n00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:31,510\nSo then we have testing and validation,\nand with testing and validation,\n\n498\n00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,180\nwe're gonna be able to validate\nthe software to ensure the goals for\n\n499\n00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,700\nthe software solution that\nwe're trying to build are met.\n\n500\n00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,860\nSo we're gonna go through we have a, at\nthis point probably a proof of concept or\n\n501\n00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,500\nsomething like that, so\nas a result we're gonna go through and\n\n502\n00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,266\nstart testing to make sure that\nit's working the right way.\n\n503\n00:23:45,266 --> 00:23:50,019\nAnd then, [COUGH] excuse, then, it's\nimportant to keep in mind that we have to\n\n504\n00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:53,633\nmap security risks to basically\nthese test cases, right?\n\n505\n00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:57,153\nTo understand what's going on with them\nand look at the code and say, well,\n\n506\n00:23:57,153 --> 00:23:59,738\nnormally we do this kind of work,\nwe have this issue, so\n\n507\n00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,228\nhow does this map up to our code?\n\n508\n00:24:01,228 --> 00:24:03,473\nDo we see that this code\nwas written this way?\n\n509\n00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:05,667\nDo we use secure best practices for\ncoding?\n\n510\n00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:08,513\nDo we have vulnerabilities that\nare known and identified and\n\n511\n00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,210\nwe have to fix in this code\nbefore we put it out live?\n\n512\n00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,000\nAll that has to happen here.\n\n513\n00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,830\nSo we're in a very critical element here.\n\n514\n00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,640\nTesting has to be conducted in\nan environment that should mirror\n\n515\n00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,720\nwhat production looks like.\n\n516\n00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,900\nIn other words, the worst that you can\ndo is test this in a bubble and say,\n\n517\n00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,550\nwhile we're going to test it over here but\nit's not really going to be used that way,\n\n518\n00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,370\nbut when we put it in production,\nwe think that it will be okay.\n\n519\n00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,010\nThat's not what you want to hear.\n\n520\n00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,150\n>> Not going to give you very\naccurate results anyway.\n\n521\n00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,826\n>> Not going to be very good,\ndefinitely not.\n\n522\n00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:36,890\nSo we want to make sure we do that,\nwe're going to obviously keep testing\n\n523\n00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,580\nto identify any missed vulnerabilities\nthat we may not have picked up on.\n\n524\n00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,790\nAnd so\nthere are some common testing approaches.\n\n525\n00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,800\nWe've listed them out for you here, things\nlike unit testing which can be done,\n\n526\n00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,280\nintegration testing, acceptance testing,\nregression testing is there.\n\n527\n00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,730\nThese are all different kinds of testing\nsolutions, depending on the kind of\n\n528\n00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,680\nsoftware we are building and\nthe end result we are looking for.\n\n529\n00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,510\nWith unit testing we would basically go\nin and test the individual components and\n\n530\n00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:04,250\nwe validate things like logic,\nand boundary conditions,\n\n531\n00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,760\nwith integration testing we verify\nintegration by putting them all together.\n\n532\n00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,090\nSo, we put everything in a box and\nmake sure it all works.\n\n533\n00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:10,880\n>> That's what I try to tell them but,\n\n534\n00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880\nthat could change when you\nstart putting things together.\n\n535\n00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,600\nCorrect so you want to make sure\nthe connections, the interleaves,\n\n536\n00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,770\nthings like that are good.\n\n537\n00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,750\nAcceptance testing, this is where\nwe make sure that the code meets\n\n538\n00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,030\nall the customer requirements and\nthen regression testing.\n\n539\n00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,750\nWant to make sure we go back and if we got\na, maybe an extra vision of a piece of\n\n540\n00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,880\nsoftware, look at it in it's prior form to\nmake sure we haven't blown anything up,\n\n541\n00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,236\nwe're not going to break stuff\nas we build new functionality.\n\n542\n00:25:33,236 --> 00:25:35,790\nThis is often times when we\nsee problems with, you know,\n\n543\n00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,920\nsecurity patches that\nare put up by vendors.\n\n544\n00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,260\nThey forget to do the regression\ntesting or they don't do it fully.\n\n545\n00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,580\nAnd as a result, we then tend to run into\nissues because they break certain things.\n\n546\n00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,950\nSo then we also have this idea of fuzzing.\n\n547\n00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,630\nThis is a technique that's\nused where we go in and\n\n548\n00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,240\nwe discover flaws up we did\nhave a space issue there.\n\n549\n00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,470\nSo we do go in and discover flaws and\nvulnerabilities using fuzzing.\n\n550\n00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,170\nWe send random data into the system\nto try to trigger failures.\n\n551\n00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,780\n>> See what we can break.\n\n552\n00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,310\nIn effect so we'll look at a buffer and\nsay well the buffer\n\n553\n00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:03,900\n>> Should, in theory,\n\n554\n00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,545\nonly accept 25 characters.\n\n555\n00:26:05,545 --> 00:26:07,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We'll send blocks of 30 or 40 or 50 in,\n\n556\n00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:09,430\nand see what happens.\n\n557\n00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,610\nAnd if we find buffers\nthat are not structured,\n\n558\n00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,100\nnot boundary tested,\nwe start finding issues.\n\n559\n00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,710\n>> It's an easy trap to fall into too.\n\n560\n00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,510\nWhen you are the guys or\ngals that are writing that software,\n\n561\n00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,070\nyou know what those fields are expecting.\n\n562\n00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,800\nAnd so\nas you're going through your testing, or\n\n563\n00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,740\nat least I do when I'm writing this stuff.\n\n564\n00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:27,680\nYou're putting in data that the program\nexpects and if you don't go in there and\n\n565\n00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,270\nput data that it doesn't expect,\n\n566\n00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,690\nyou hand that off to an end user to\nuse and it's expecting a date and\n\n567\n00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,750\nthey put a name and all of a sudden,\nit's a simplistic example.\n\n568\n00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,330\nBut that's the kind of thing you\nmight not notice if you don't throw.\n\n569\n00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,000\nJunk at it,\nlike what you say with the buzzer.\n\n570\n00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:42,530\n>> Very true.\nSo\n\n571\n00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,460\nfuzzing becomes very important\nas a methodology and\n\n572\n00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,380\na way to find this stuff, right?\n\n573\n00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,770\nLook for the land mines or\nmaybe Easter eggs that may be hiding.\n\n574\n00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:54,524\nSo then we have dynamic analysis, that is\nthe evaluation of program in real time.\n\n575\n00:26:54,524 --> 00:26:56,290\n>> Meaning, when it's running,\nwhat does it look like?\n\n576\n00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,680\nWhy don't we take it out for a test drive.\n\n577\n00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,740\nTurn it on, see what's going on with it.\n\n578\n00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,820\nStatic analysis is a debugging\ntechnique that's carried out\n\n579\n00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,180\nwithout executing the program.\n\n580\n00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,100\nSo in effect, dynamic analysis,\nturn the program on.\n\n581\n00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,320\nStatic analysis, we look at the code\nwithout running the program so\n\n582\n00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,670\nwe can tell different things\nbased on what we're doing.\n\n583\n00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,220\nThere's different things or goals and\n\n584\n00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,446\nkind of tests that we design to achieve\ncertain things and see certain things.\n\n585\n00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:22,890\nSo we want to make sure by doing it\nstatically that we look at it basically\n\n586\n00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,470\nin effect before we compile the code\nwhereas when we do it dynamically,\n\n587\n00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,230\nwe look at the code running in\nreal time so we see it compiled.\n\n588\n00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,300\nThere's different vulnerabilities and\nweaknesses we'll find in each method.\n\n589\n00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,410\nAnd then the last phase here, release and\n\n590\n00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:37,480\nor Release Maintenance,\nthe idea of deploying the software out.\n\n591\n00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,900\nAnd then it's properly configured,\n\n592\n00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,110\npatch monitored,\nmaking sure in other words it goes live.\n\n593\n00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:45,713\nThis'll be the operational maintenance\nphase in the system development life\n\n594\n00:27:45,713 --> 00:27:48,180\ncycle, so this is where we're\ngoing to actually see that happen.\n\n595\n00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:53,530\nSo, when we're talking\nabout going through, and\n\n596\n00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:57,400\nwe're talking about comparing the two,\nthe system development life cycle,\n\n597\n00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,540\nthe software development life cycle.\n\n598\n00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,130\nWe're talking about two\ndifferent approaches,\n\n599\n00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,850\ntwo different ways to build things.\n\n600\n00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,870\nOne is building the complete\nsystem securely,\n\n601\n00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,300\none is building software to\nrun on that system securely.\n\n602\n00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,180\nBut both of these life cycles\nare going to be very important for us.\n\n603\n00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,980\nBecause with out understanding\nhow to do this in a properly\n\n604\n00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,130\nthought out well developed structured\ndocumented way that we test.\n\n605\n00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,250\nAnd we really have gauges and milestones\ncoming out of each of these phases.\n\n606\n00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,290\nWe're going to run into issues.\n\n607\n00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,410\nWe're going to forget things.\n\n608\n00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,548\nThings are not going to get done.\n\n609\n00:28:25,548 --> 00:28:27,960\nWe're going to make assumptions\nthat ultimately lead to risks of\n\n610\n00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,140\nvulnerabilities creeping into our systems.\n\n611\n00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,140\nSo, this beginning discussion about\nthese two development life cycles\n\n612\n00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,320\nreally helps us to start\nframing the conversation.\n\n613\n00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,230\nAround building secret software,\nbecause this is the methodology, right,\n\n614\n00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:42,380\nthe approach that we're going to take,\nwell developed,\n\n615\n00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,800\nwell thought out, documented steps,\nstop every place we go.\n\n616\n00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,150\nLook back,\nlet's make sure we see the output,\n\n617\n00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,610\nlet's make sure we know what it is.\n\n618\n00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,840\nLet's build on success.\n\n619\n00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,350\nIn other words, instead of just\nthrowing a bunch of stuff together and\n\n620\n00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,530\nhoping it all works.\n\n621\n00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,150\nProbably a good place for\nus to pause and take a break.\n\n622\n00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,930\n>> All right.\nSounds good.\n\n623\n00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:58,900\nWe'll pause and take a break.\n\n624\n00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,576\nLet you guys get up and\nstretch your legs real quick and\n\n625\n00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:03,015\nwe'll be back here in a few.\n\n626\n00:29:03,015 --> 00:29:06,312\n[MUSIC]\n\n627\n00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:10,910\n[SOUND] Hey, all right.\n\n628\n00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:15,460\nWelcome back everybody to our episode\non software development and security.\n\n629\n00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,120\nGetting to do some more terminology.\n\n630\n00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,450\nMy favorite part, I think.\n\n631\n00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,820\n[LAUGH]\n>> I thought being gluten-free\n\n632\n00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,668\nwas your favorite part.\n\n633\n00:29:22,668 --> 00:29:25,060\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah, gluten-free is a good thing.\n\n634\n00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,250\n>> All right, so we're going to talk\nsome more about some vocabulary.\n\n635\n00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,280\nSo we're going to continue\nour conversations here.\n\n636\n00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,380\nWe'll tell you about software\ndevelopment security.\n\n637\n00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,850\nWe have been talking about\ndifferent development approaches,\n\n638\n00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,510\ndifferent life cycles, and\nno good life cycle would be\n\n639\n00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,200\ncomplete without a whole bunch\nof vocabulary and terminology.\n\n640\n00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,810\n>> Absolutely.\n\n641\n00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,310\n>> To throw in there,\nget in the middle of it, back it up,\n\n642\n00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,480\nmake sure everything is\nsort of gummed up in there.\n\n643\n00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,780\n>> We are on our third shoe box\nof index cards, flash cards.\n\n644\n00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,140\n>> We've killed an entire forest of index\n>> The index bearing trees by now.\n\n645\n00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,310\nSo, statement of work.\n\n646\n00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,350\nLet's talk about a SOW.\n\n647\n00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:58,060\nSome of this terminology, especially this,\nwork breakdown structure,\n\n648\n00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,305\nthese two terms in particular,\ncome to us from project managers.\n\n649\n00:30:01,305 --> 00:30:03,930\nSo, if you're going to go become a PMP and\n\n650\n00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,150\nyou were studying the PM\nbody of knowledge, you\n\n651\n00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:11,680\nwould see these terms that are all over\nthe ways in which we do change management.\n\n652\n00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,290\nThey're all of the ways we\ndo project management but\n\n653\n00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,460\nthey're also appropriate here.\n\n654\n00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,700\nIt's a statement of work\nthat we call the SOW.\n\n655\n00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,320\nIt's really just going to be that,\nit's almost like a manifest.\n\n656\n00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,000\nIt tells us it lays out for\nus exactly what's suppose to happen.\n\n657\n00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,280\nDescribes the product and all the\nrequirements the customer is looking to\n\n658\n00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,170\nbasically get into or\nhave built into that product.\n\n659\n00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,710\nAnd so at the end of the day when\nwe compare the finished product to\n\n660\n00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,360\nthe statement of work the two should\nmatch at a high level, right?\n\n661\n00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,580\nWe should see you know one database and\nwe're supposed to be able to do these five\n\n662\n00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,050\nthings and sure enough we have\na database does these five things.\n\n663\n00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,970\nSo that's really what\nwe're talking about here.\n\n664\n00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,080\nSo obviously the more detail we have\nin the SOW the better off we are.\n\n665\n00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,710\nYou can see a detail oriented SOW helps\nto ensure requirements are properly\n\n666\n00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,700\nunderstood.\n\n667\n00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,360\nAssumptions are there and\n\n668\n00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,040\nyou know we don't leave those\nassumptions on the table.\n\n669\n00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,990\nWe ask the questions,\nwe understand the detail because we never.\n\n670\n00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,410\nIn general we always joke\nabout making assumptions,\n\n671\n00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:04,520\nbut when we're doing a build,\nwe never want to make an assumption.\n\n672\n00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,560\nWe always want to find\nout a definitive answer.\n\n673\n00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,810\n>> I'm sure they're going to include that,\nI shouldn't have to specify that, right?\n\n674\n00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:11,860\nWrong.\n>> That's when you get\n\n675\n00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,980\nthe\n>> Right.\n\n676\n00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,290\nYou get the bag of mystery meat as opposed\nto the sandwich that you were looking for.\n\n677\n00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,710\nAll right, so Work breakdown structure,\nwhat's called the WBS.\n\n678\n00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,740\nThe work breakdown structure is\nthe project management tool as we said..\n\n679\n00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,580\nBasically helps us.\n\n680\n00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,670\nIt's like our schedule,\nour master schedule.\n\n681\n00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:30,500\nHelps us to understand what resources are\ngoing to be involved ad how much work each\n\n682\n00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,180\nof them will do.\n\n683\n00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,580\nA resource typically in a project\nis to find us a person.\n\n684\n00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,840\n>> So, you often are going to be ascribed\nor assigned a certain amount of work based\n\n685\n00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,400\non the value you hold to the project,\nthe skills you bring to the table.\n\n686\n00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,110\nSo this tool,\n\n687\n00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,830\nthis work breakdown structure, helps\nus to understand how to ascribe work.\n\n688\n00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,900\nWork equals expense and\nultimately equals value.\n\n689\n00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,260\nSo then we want to be able to\nunderstand who's doing what and\n\n690\n00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,860\nas a result create an accountability and\na responsibility.\n\n691\n00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,190\nFor achieving those goals.\n\n692\n00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,264\nPrivacy Impact Rating\nwill be called a PIR.\n\n693\n00:31:59,264 --> 00:32:03,560\nIndicates sensitivity levels of\nthe data that will be processed or\n\n694\n00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,094\nmade accessible here so\n\n695\n00:32:05,094 --> 00:32:09,860\ndon't confuse the idea of the Privacy\nImpact Rating What we call the PIR.\n\n696\n00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,631\nThere's also another acronym in\nproject management called PIR which is\n\n697\n00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:18,083\nPost-Implementation Review, generically\noften referred to as lessons learned or\n\n698\n00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,050\na post-mortem.\n\n699\n00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,660\nJust keep in mind, remember an acronym\ncan potentially mean more than one thing.\n\n700\n00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,870\nWhich is why we tend to try to stay away\nfrom just using the acronym by itself,\n\n701\n00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:29,935\nas opposed to spelling out what\nthe acronym actually supposed to imply.\n\n702\n00:32:29,935 --> 00:32:34,750\nComputer-aided software engineering,\nwhat we call CASE, this is gonna be\n\n703\n00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,090\nspecifically software that allows us to,\nbasically, automate development.\n\n704\n00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,940\nSo these are programming coding\ntools that help us to automatically\n\n705\n00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,150\ncreate bits of code or\nstitch them together.\n\n706\n00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,240\nThings like debuggers,\n\n707\n00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,902\ncode analyzers, version-controlling\nall of that kind of stuff.\n\n708\n00:32:48,902 --> 00:32:52,320\nYou have SourceSafe,\nVisual SourceSafe's good example of this.\n\n709\n00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,360\nTeam Foundation Server on the Microsoft\nside, another good example of this.\n\n710\n00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,420\nRational Rose, if you're doing\nhigh-end heavy development work.\n\n711\n00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,240\nAll these different tools, any UML,\n\n712\n00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,810\nUniversal Modeling Language tools,\nbusiness analyst, or\n\n713\n00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,950\nbusiness analyst like tools, that\nwould be built to do this kinda stuff,\n\n714\n00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:12,825\nall fall into this category potentially\nof CASE, or CASE related tools.\n\n715\n00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:15,430\nComputer-aided software engineering and\ndesign.\n\n716\n00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,700\nWe could even see something like\nmaybe VIZIO, for instance, right?\n\n717\n00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,480\nFalling in here because VIZIO can be\nused to write basic code, lay it out and\n\n718\n00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,090\nalso create workflows, so it creates\nworkflows and become a SharePoint.\n\n719\n00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,260\nWe could see Visual Studio,\n\n720\n00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,080\nwhich has these kind of\ncapabilities built into it as well.\n\n721\n00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,680\nEven the tool we're using\nhere Notepad++ could\n\n722\n00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,610\npotential be considered a low-end\nentry-level form of case.\n\n723\n00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:42,140\nBecause it does allow us to be able\nto node out, write line numbers,\n\n724\n00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,330\nevery line of code as we write it,\nand there is some basic solution here.\n\n725\n00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:49,790\nWe can go in and we can actually mark\nup code, and do things like that.\n\n726\n00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:51,270\nIt is a very low entry-level tool,\n\n727\n00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,260\nbut it is one that could be\nconsidered an example here as well.\n\n728\n00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,920\nVerification, the idea of determining\nif a product accurately represents and\n\n729\n00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,450\nmeets specifications.\n\n730\n00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,920\nDid we build to spec,\nis what verification is all about.\n\n731\n00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,910\nAnd validation, determining if the product\nprovides the necessary solution for\n\n732\n00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,820\nan intended real world problem.\n\n733\n00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,950\nVerification tells us if we built or\nmet the customer specification.\n\n734\n00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,510\nCustomer requirement, right?\n\n735\n00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,810\nThen determining validation, determines\nwhether or not that is still appropriate.\n\n736\n00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,740\nEven if we actually did something\nthat addresses a real world,\n\n737\n00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,820\nor necessary, solution that actually is\nsomething that people, in effect will buy.\n\n738\n00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,230\nWe could build the perfect thing, right?\n\n739\n00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,930\nCustomer envisions it, we build it.\n\n740\n00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:34,250\nBut it may have absolutely no practical\napplication, use, or knowledge,\n\n741\n00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:34,792\nin the real world.\n\n742\n00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:37,125\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That happens somethings.\n\n743\n00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:40,673\nYou go off on these multi-year\nsystem projects, or\n\n744\n00:34:40,673 --> 00:34:43,675\nmulti your projects to\nbuild complex systems.\n\n745\n00:34:43,675 --> 00:34:47,965\nAnd you build it according to spec,\nin other words, functionally is there.\n\n746\n00:34:47,965 --> 00:34:50,835\nWe can do that, we can go through and\nsee that we verify it.\n\n747\n00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:54,365\nBut then when we go to validate it,\nbecause it's so long, that as a result\n\n748\n00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:58,695\nin effect, the system is now kinda\nmarginalized because this doesn't really\n\n749\n00:34:58,695 --> 00:35:02,250\nmeet those requirements that may have\nbeen intended when we started out.\n\n750\n00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,550\nSo the longer the project takes,\ntypically,\n\n751\n00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,560\nrule of thumb here, the less likely it is\nyou're gonna validate it on the back end.\n\n752\n00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,272\nBecause the longer it takes,\nthe more likely there's gonna be drift.\n\n753\n00:35:11,272 --> 00:35:14,745\nYou're gonna be moving away from what that\nwas intended to do in the first place.\n\n754\n00:35:14,745 --> 00:35:16,600\nThat can obviously cause some issues.\n\n755\n00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,470\nThat can definitely cause some\nproblems if that's the case.\n\n756\n00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,740\nWe do want to make sure we're aware of\nthat, and just be thinking about that.\n\n757\n00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,330\nNow, let's put this in context before we\nmove into software development models for\n\n758\n00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,150\njust a minute.\n\n759\n00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,868\nWe can stay right there.\n\n760\n00:35:28,868 --> 00:35:31,570\nWe just wanna make sure we're just\nthinking about what we've just talked\n\n761\n00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,970\nabout, lay out this whole general idea.\n\n762\n00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,870\nThe CISSP, this is what we're\nultimately talking about.\n\n763\n00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,940\nWhat is the role of the CISSP?\n\n764\n00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,890\nIf we remember, this is about\ninformation security management,\n\n765\n00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:46,020\nreally focussing on being that voice\nof best practice, voice of reason,\n\n766\n00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,650\nvoice of awareness inside the\norganization, bringing all those skills,\n\n767\n00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,210\nall that knowledge to the table,\nmaking sure people understand how to act\n\n768\n00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,700\nethically, how to act morally, how to\nhave security utmost in their mind at all\n\n769\n00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,830\ntimes, with a focus on confidentiality,\nfocus on integrity, focus on availability.\n\n770\n00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,340\nSo these things are all part of the mix.\n\n771\n00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,570\nWe put all of the stuff into\nthe blender and we pour it out and\n\n772\n00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:09,950\nout comes the CISSP, fully formed.\n\n773\n00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,870\nBut there are ten bodies of knowledge,\nten domain areas,\n\n774\n00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,150\nthat we have to be focused on.\n\n775\n00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,930\nSecure software development is one\nof them, but there are many others.\n\n776\n00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:21,700\nAnd so, understanding how to link these\nconcepts to some of our other shows that\n\n777\n00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,380\nwe've gone through, or will go through,\nas we round out the CISSP.\n\n778\n00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,470\nTo make sure that we understand how all\nthis information is brought together.\n\n779\n00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,980\nWhat is the role of cryptography,\nin relations to secure architecture and\n\n780\n00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,820\nsoftware development?\n\n781\n00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,770\nWhat is the role of risk assessment?\n\n782\n00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,350\nTalked a lot about risk,\nappears in almost every section.\n\n783\n00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,760\nWhat's the role of that risk assessment,\ninformation assurance, and governance\n\n784\n00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,080\ndiscussion that we have, around that\nbody of knowledge, around that domain?\n\n785\n00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,500\nWhat is the role of telecommunications and\n\n786\n00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,760\nnetworking discussions we\nhave in the OSI model?\n\n787\n00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,230\nHow does all that come in here?\n\n788\n00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:55,390\nAnd how does all of this go back there?\n\n789\n00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:59,450\nHow we link that is really about creating\nthis overarching thought process.\n\n790\n00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,470\nHow we manage,\n\n791\n00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,040\nnot just the information around being\nan information security professional, but\n\n792\n00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,790\nmanage actually being a professional in\nthis particular area, in this practice.\n\n793\n00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,810\nHow do I get good at security?\n\n794\n00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,690\nWhat does a CISSP do in this area?\n\n795\n00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,380\nRemember, the idea is you're\nprobably not gonna go out and\n\n796\n00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,500\nwrite a lot of secure code.\n\n797\n00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,090\nI mean unless you are developer,\nin other words, right?\n\n798\n00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:21,310\nBy training, by nature, this area,\n\n799\n00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,960\nthis domain,\nmay not have a lot of value for you.\n\n800\n00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,040\nYou may be that CISSP that never,\never writes a stitch of code.\n\n801\n00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,520\nAnd if that's the case, that's okay.\n\n802\n00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,080\nIt doesn't mean you have\nto become the code master.\n\n803\n00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,670\nYou don't have to become that app dev\nguru in order to be a good CISSP.\n\n804\n00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,340\nBut you have to know how to manage\npeople that do that for a living.\n\n805\n00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:44,510\nAnd so you have to understand\nthe architectural they refer to,\n\n806\n00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:47,740\nthe tools at a high-level they may use,\nand in general,\n\n807\n00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,930\nthe overarching thought processes of what\nit means to do software development.\n\n808\n00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:54,900\nSome of the language is why we spend\na great deal of time talking about\n\n809\n00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:58,420\nvocabulary with you, to help you better\nunderstand and define these terms.\n\n810\n00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,240\nAnd at the end of the day,\nit's about understanding the linkages.\n\n811\n00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,690\nThe high-level linkages that allow secure\nsoftware development to take place.\n\n812\n00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:07,110\nYou apply that knowledge,\n\n813\n00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:11,140\nroll it forward into your overall\nthought process about securely managing.\n\n814\n00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,580\nThat is what a CISSP does specifically\naround this kind of data.\n\n815\n00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,190\nI just want to throw that out there\nbecause a lot of us may write code for\n\n816\n00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,820\na living, and that's great if you do.\n\n817\n00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:23,250\nI started out my career many, many years\nago learning how to write code and\n\n818\n00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,510\nthat's what I did early on.\n\n819\n00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,360\nI'm not an active application\ndeveloper anymore.\n\n820\n00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,490\nI don't do it often enough to\nreally do it professionally.\n\n821\n00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,230\nI dabble with it on occasion.\n\n822\n00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,690\nI happen to like it, but\n\n823\n00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,340\nit's not something I would ever tell\na customer I would take money for.\n\n824\n00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,880\n>> That's right. [LAUGH] >> Because I\ndon't do it that good anymore.\n\n825\n00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,850\nBut I do it well enough and\nhave done it well enough for many years,\n\n826\n00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:44,210\nfrom a security perspective, to be able to\nunderstand how to read someone's code and\n\n827\n00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,290\nsee what's going on in there\nif I have to look at it.\n\n828\n00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:50,200\nIf I'm forensically examining a piece\nof malware, I can deconstruct it and\n\n829\n00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,530\ntell you what's going on\nin there at a high-level.\n\n830\n00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,090\nAnd I may run into a bunch of\nstuff I've never seen before, but\n\n831\n00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:58,730\nthat's when I go get one of the people\nthat's an expert that I will rely on.\n\n832\n00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:02,820\nOne of my peers that does this for\na living, to tell me what I don't know.\n\n833\n00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,140\nBecause I know, for a fact,\n\n834\n00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,690\nthat there's stuff in there\nI've just never seen before.\n\n835\n00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,870\nSo knowing what you don't know,\n\n836\n00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,280\nwhich can often times be very\ndifficult to figure out.\n\n837\n00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,000\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But if you know\n\n838\n00:39:12,000

00:39:16,820\nyou in this section.\n\n841\n00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,550\nLet's talk about some\nof these methodologies,\n\n842\n00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:21,160\nsome of these software\ndeveloping models that we have.\n\n843\n00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,990\nWe have quite a few of them.\n\n844\n00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,730\nWe started with some of the very\nbasic ones, what's called Build and\n\n845\n00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,930\nFix, and things like Waterfall and Vshape.\n\n846\n00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,490\nAnd then we'll move down to things like\nprototyping and some of the others that we\n\n847\n00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:33,450\nhave there, incrementals,\nspiral, things of that nature.\n\n848\n00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,530\nSo, Build and Fix, pretty straightforward.\n\n849\n00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,310\nWe kind of do this intuitively,\n\n850\n00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,490\nall the time without necessarily\nreally building software.\n\n851\n00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,140\nWe just, we do this with everything we do.\n\n852\n00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,570\nThis is the Ikea Furniture model, not.\n\n853\n00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,780\nYou build something, if it breaks, you\ngo ahead and fix it, that kind of thing.\n\n854\n00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,450\nWe take place, basically development\ntakes place, immediately.\n\n855\n00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,130\nReally little to no planning involved.\n\n856\n00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,650\nSomebody says, yeah,\nI wanna build a bookcase today.\n\n857\n00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:57,843\nYou go buy the first bookcase you find,\ndump it out on the floor, and\n\n858\n00:39:57,843 --> 00:39:59,258\nyou basically just build it.\n\n859\n00:39:59,258 --> 00:40:01,371\nAnd it's gonna hopefully have all\nthe parts there and works, right?\n\n860\n00:40:01,371 --> 00:40:03,460\nAnd if you attempt,\nyou don't build it the right way.\n\n861\n00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,557\nI always hate those things.\n\n862\n00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:05,975\nI always wind up putting one piece on.\n\n863\n00:40:05,975 --> 00:40:07,085\nBackwards.\n>> Right, yes.\n\n864\n00:40:07,085 --> 00:40:10,752\n>> And then I gotta take the whole thing\napart and put it all back together again.\n\n865\n00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,411\nAnd so, yeah, I'm just, I'm that guy that,\n\n866\n00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,140\nI will pay you if you wanna\ncome build furniture.\n\n867\n00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,170\nI will pay you.\n\n868\n00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,650\nI am very happy to admit in public.\n\n869\n00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,820\nI have no trouble with this.\n\n870\n00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,880\nI'm secure in my furniture-building\nskills, the lack thereof, I should say.\n\n871\n00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,030\nAnd I'm one of those guys that's just\nis willing to admit freely, I am just,\n\n872\n00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:28,770\nI'm not that guy.\n\n873\n00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:29,692\n>> It's worth it, right?\n\n874\n00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:32,735\n>> I will gladly pay you to\ncome take that pain away, so\n\n875\n00:40:32,735 --> 00:40:34,915\nI can do something I actually enjoy.\n\n876\n00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:37,660\nLike whatever it may be, it has\nnothing to do with building furniture.\n\n877\n00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,512\nSo making sure we understand that we're\ngonna iterating through this immediately.\n\n878\n00:40:41,512 --> 00:40:45,475\nWe're basically just rushing in, building\nsomething, not a lot of prior planning,\n\n879\n00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:48,803\nlittle to no planning, underscore\nlittle to no, almost immediately.\n\n880\n00:40:48,803 --> 00:40:51,445\nAnd as a result,\nproblems are dealt with in real time.\n\n881\n00:40:51,445 --> 00:40:52,575\nSomething goes wrong.\n\n882\n00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,595\n>> You won't have problems most likely.\n\n883\n00:40:54,595 --> 00:40:55,330\n>> Often, not always but\n\n884\n00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,050\nwe're not implying that you're gonna\nrandomly put a bunch of stuff together.\n\n885\n00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,730\nThere is some thought to this, but\nwhat I want to be clear about is,\n\n886\n00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:05,350\nthis is not a five month development\nplanning cycle to go build.\n\n887\n00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:08,144\nWe're gonna sit down for a day or\ntwo, sketch out some stuff and\n\n888\n00:41:08,144 --> 00:41:09,420\nwe're gonna go build that.\n\n889\n00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,470\n>> I've used that when I've done some\nquick little VBA projects in Excel or\n\n890\n00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,750\nsomething like that.\n\n891\n00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,239\nA sales team needs\na spreadsheet to do something.\n\n892\n00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,402\nYou can whip something out,\ngive it to them, they can start using it.\n\n893\n00:41:18,402 --> 00:41:20,793\nThey're gonna call you up and say, hey\nlook, we kind of need you to do this, or\n\n894\n00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:21,794\nthis didn't work quite right.\n\n895\n00:41:21,794 --> 00:41:22,604\nI can go in there and\n\n896\n00:41:22,604 --> 00:41:25,430\nfix it real quick, but-\n>> You're gonna spend a lot of time\n\n897\n00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,445\niterating through features, and so\n\n898\n00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:31,280\nwe often refer to this in backroom\ndiscussions and off to the side.\n\n899\n00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,710\nWe've talked about it,\nthis is the cocktail napkin, right?\n\n900\n00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:38,100\nThis is kind of the at the bar sketch that\nwe're then going to turn into something.\n\n901\n00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,370\nWe do it on the back of\na cocktail napkin over drinks,\n\n902\n00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,805\nthat's typically what build and fix is.\n\n903\n00:41:41,805 --> 00:41:44,198\nSo which is usually then,\nwe're gonna release it obviously,\n\n904\n00:41:44,198 --> 00:41:46,726\nand as Mike pointed out,\nyou're gonna get those phone calls about\n\n905\n00:41:46,726 --> 00:41:49,080\ncontinuing to iterate and\nfigure in the build.\n\n906\n00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,860\nSo, Waterfall model,\na little bit of a different approach here.\n\n907\n00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,340\nWe call this linear-sequential life-cycle.\n\n908\n00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,800\nIn English, that means we're gonna\nbasically do something that's gonna take\n\n909\n00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,300\na straight line.\n\n910\n00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,532\nWe're gonna kinda follow a path,\nso we're gonna go this way.\n\n911\n00:42:00,532 --> 00:42:03,850\nWe're gonna fall down through a phase,\nwe're going to kind of have an endpoint\n\n912\n00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:07,240\nthere, and then we're gonna have another\nphase where we're gonna do some more.\n\n913\n00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,890\nAnd we're kind of, well,\nyou can't see because I'm off screen,\n\n914\n00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,858\nlook, look at me over here, wow, right?\n\n915\n00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:14,220\nWhat we're gonna see is thank you, wide\nshot's always nice, so we can do this.\n\n916\n00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,560\nRemember, I'm a tiny person in a tiny box,\nso I don't have a lot of room to wiggle.\n\n917\n00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,370\nSo what we're gonna do is, with waterfall,\nwe're gonna kind of do this.\n\n918\n00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,760\nCome down to a very well demarcated point.\n\n919\n00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,070\nWe can think of this as like a plateau.\n\n920\n00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,300\nThis is end of the flow.\n\n921\n00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,450\nIt's the end of the cycle.\n\n922\n00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,590\nWe get here, we're okay, so\nthis is good, we push something out.\n\n923\n00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:32,320\nNow if we want to do another cycle,\nnow we have another plateau and\n\n924\n00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,340\nanother waterfall.\n\n925\n00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,290\nI think of the Indiana Jones movies.\n\n926\n00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,030\nI think it was the last one they did,\nthe Crystal Skull.\n\n927\n00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:43,060\nIndiana Jones and the Crystal Skull,\nwhere he's in the jungle in Brazil,\n\n928\n00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,490\nor wherever he is in the rainforest,\nand they're trying to go back and\n\n929\n00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,605\nfigure out how to put\nthe crystal skull back.\n\n930\n00:42:47,605 --> 00:42:54,770\nIn the City of Gold, and so he finds\nkinda the path and the, what is it?\n\n931\n00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:59,210\nOxley, Professor Oxley, the crazy guy\nwho goes nuts trying to find the skull.\n\n932\n00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,680\nHe's telling him how to find it.\n\n933\n00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,880\nAt one point to get in the water,\nand they're going down the river.\n\n934\n00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,250\nThey got away form the Russians.\n\n935\n00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,550\nThey're looking at the waterfall and\nhe's like, yeah, it falls three times.\n\n936\n00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,260\nAnd they look over the edge and\nyou've got this,\n\n937\n00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,200\nthe waterfall steps down all\nthe way to the bottom of the river.\n\n938\n00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,120\nIt's the same concept.\n\n939\n00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,180\nThat's what waterfall is.\n\n940\n00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,520\nYou're falling off the cliff, hitting\na plateau, and then you get ready for\n\n941\n00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,720\na next iteration and effect.\n\n942\n00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,640\nThat's what we're doing.\n\n943\n00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,060\nSo all these phases,\nthis fall to a plateau is a phase.\n\n944\n00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,430\nAll these phases are gonna have to\nbe completed in their entirety.\n\n945\n00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:34,440\nIn other words, this arc to come down to\na plateau to release something is a phase,\n\n946\n00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,090\nfinish that before we do anything else\nis what waterfall effective says.\n\n947\n00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,940\nAnd then obviously, if we have more\nphases, you go through more phases.\n\n948\n00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,490\nBut each phase is self-contained,\nin effect.\n\n949\n00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,618\nAll requirements are gathered initially.\n\n950\n00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:47,392\nAnd there's no formal way\nto really integrate change,\n\n951\n00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:50,825\nbecause we just build what we specced\nout initially, in that phase.\n\n952\n00:43:50,825 --> 00:43:54,016\nIf we have to make changes to go through\nanother phase, do something else,\n\n953\n00:43:54,016 --> 00:43:55,800\nin order to do that in another iteration.\n\n954\n00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,116\nVshape, the what's called Vshape model,\nor just V,\n\n955\n00:43:59,116 --> 00:44:03,511\nVmodel, the following steps that we\nkinda go through here are laid out,\n\n956\n00:44:03,511 --> 00:44:07,040\ninstead of in a waterfall,\nthey're laid out in a V.\n\n957\n00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,930\nYou can almost imagine that a waterfall,\nkind of iterates, right?\n\n958\n00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:13,095\nGoes down, or not iterates but,\nkind of flows down.\n\n959\n00:44:13,095 --> 00:44:16,370\nWhereas a V is literally,\nit's gonna be something like this.\n\n960\n00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:18,420\nWe're gonna start from\na well defined point and\n\n961\n00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,770\nimplementation at the bottom here,\nand we're gonna branch out like this.\n\n962\n00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:25,880\nWe're gonna go up, and in affect, let me\ncenter myself, we're gonna branch here and\n\n963\n00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,390\nwe're going to go up this way.\n\n964\n00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:29,290\nAnd so as a result,\nwe're gonna arc out and\n\n965\n00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:33,020\nwe're gonna see the V created by\nfeathering out and up our phases.\n\n966\n00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,420\nAnd that's effectively what\na Vshape model is gonna look like.\n\n967\n00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,670\nWe emphasize verification and\nvalidation of the product at each phase.\n\n968\n00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:43,240\nAs we complete each phase,\nwe verify and validate.\n\n969\n00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,240\nRemember our vocabulary discussion\nfrom a couple minutes ago about that?\n\n970\n00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,900\nI would provide a formal method for\ndevelopment testing and and\n\n971\n00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,360\nplanning, as well as coding, to make\nsure everything is done at each phase.\n\n972\n00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:56,520\nSo really, little self-contained modules,\nor unit functions, are done.\n\n973\n00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,230\nWe verify and validate them,\nwe validate the code, and\n\n974\n00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,970\nthen each phase must be completed\nbefore the next one begins.\n\n975\n00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:04,190\nThe same concept as waterfall.\n\n976\n00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:07,190\nWell demarcated phase,\nfinish it before we go on, but\n\n977\n00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:11,000\nwe're spending a lot more time\nkinda just validating as we go.\n\n978\n00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,980\nTwo models very similar,\nthey're often very similar to each other.\n\n979\n00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:16,150\nNot used interchangeably but\nare very similar.\n\n980\n00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:19,170\nAchieve basically the same\nresults at the end of the day.\n\n981\n00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:19,860\nPrototyping.\n\n982\n00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:23,230\nPrototyping is where\nwe're gonna go ahead and\n\n983\n00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:26,502\nbuild something to basically\nexplore functionality.\n\n984\n00:45:26,502 --> 00:45:29,830\nYou have some people call this\nbuilding a proof of concept.\n\n985\n00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:32,060\nSome people call it beta testing.\n\n986\n00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,030\nJust generically, they throw these terms\naround and kinda just label things.\n\n987\n00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:38,320\nThe idea is you're gonna build a sample\nof something to check it out to see if it\n\n988\n00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,390\nworks, and then make improvements on it,\nkeep coming back and iterating.\n\n989\n00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:45,510\nAnd as a result, when you finally get\nto the point where you think it's good,\n\n990\n00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,130\nthen ultimately we can go and\nactually build from that.\n\n991\n00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:52,290\nWe talked about this thing called rapid\nprototyping there, as you can see,\n\n992\n00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:56,230\nwhich is an approach that allows us to\nquickly iterate through samples, and\n\n993\n00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,550\nvalidate them, and then go and\nbuild as a result of that.\n\n994\n00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,660\nAnd with that in mind,\nwe then can kind of iterate,\n\n995\n00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:05,510\nwe can phase through\nthe prototyping quickly.\n\n996\n00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:07,160\nHey, Mike, what do you think about this?\n\n997\n00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,710\nYeah, this is good, but you know I'd\nlike it to do this, this, and this.\n\n998\n00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,485\nAnd there's a business analyst sitting\nwith you, they make some notes,\n\n999\n00:46:12,485 --> 00:46:15,115\nquickly go back and\neither you code it or you build it.\n\n1000\n00:46:15,115 --> 00:46:16,395\nYou come back a day later.\n\n1001\n00:46:16,395 --> 00:46:17,405\nWhat about this?\n\n1002\n00:46:17,405 --> 00:46:20,155\nAnd so this is that rapid\nprototyping that we talk about.\n\n1003\n00:46:20,155 --> 00:46:23,715\nIt's used a lot in very\nquick-turn developmental cycles.\n\n1004\n00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:26,575\nYou weigh different methodologies and\ndepending on what you're doing,\n\n1005\n00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:31,015\nyou may be doing rapid prototyping with\nthings like maybe an agile sprint, or\n\n1006\n00:46:31,015 --> 00:46:34,305\na scrum, where you're going through\ntrying to build something very quickly.\n\n1007\n00:46:34,305 --> 00:46:36,535\nThere's some rapid prototyping\nthat may go on there as well.\n\n1008\n00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,750\nSo then we have incremental models.\n\n1009\n00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:40,760\nThe incremental models,\n\n1010\n00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,910\nthe spiral model, RAD what is called\nRapid Application Development.\n\n1011\n00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:45,800\nAgile I just mentioned\nis down there as well.\n\n1012\n00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,430\nAgile is typically seen these\ndays being Agile Scrum.\n\n1013\n00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,620\nCMMI, Capability Maturity\nModel Integration.\n\n1014\n00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:56,100\nThere's actually CMM,\nCapability Maturity Model, and then CMMI.\n\n1015\n00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:58,100\nI didn't put CMM in there.\n\n1016\n00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,730\nCMMI is the more thorough version of CMM,\n\n1017\n00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:04,790\nwhere we integrate all the phases as\noppose to just doing them on their own.\n\n1018\n00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:08,040\nSo incremental model, each incremental\nphase results in deliverable,\n\n1019\n00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,960\nthat's effectively an operational product.\n\n1020\n00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,990\nThis means working versions\nare produced every iteration.\n\n1021\n00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:16,260\nWe simply build, put something out,\nit may not be the fully\n\n1022\n00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,270\nfinished product that we want, but\nit's gonna have functionality.\n\n1023\n00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:23,510\nWe're gonna put out another incremental\nphase and have more functionality.\n\n1024\n00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:27,450\nThis is just basically building functional\nelements every time we release something,\n\n1025\n00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,940\nbut leaving room for improvement.\n\n1026\n00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,620\nThat's what an Incremental Model is.\n\n1027\n00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,440\nSpiral Model, we use what's\nknown as an iterative approach.\n\n1028\n00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:34,860\nIterative is cyclical.\n\n1029\n00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,452\nWe're gonna iterate,\nwe're gonna cycle through,\n\n1030\n00:47:37,452 --> 00:47:40,630\nto do software development in\nplaces emphasis on risk analysis.\n\n1031\n00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,921\nImportant to understand\nwe focus on risk here.\n\n1032\n00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:47,474\nWe have four phases that make this up,\nplanning,\n\n1033\n00:47:47,474 --> 00:47:53,967\nrisk analysis, development and\ntest, and evaluation.\n\n1034\n00:47:53,967 --> 00:47:57,519\nI'm seeing green.\n\n1035\n00:47:57,519 --> 00:47:58,643\n>> I know.\n\n1036\n00:47:58,643 --> 00:47:59,174\nIt was selecting all of them there.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1037\n00:47:59,174 --> 00:48:01,014\n>> Beginning to think that the matrix was\n\n1038\n00:48:01,014 --> 00:48:02,919\ncoming alive and the text was talking.\n\n1039\n00:48:02,919 --> 00:48:06,471\n>> [LAUGH] [CROSSTALK]\n>> So we have planning.\n\n1040\n00:48:06,471 --> 00:48:10,128\nWe have risk analysis, development and\ntest, and then, evaluation.\n\n1041\n00:48:10,128 --> 00:48:13,650\nThese are the four phases that\ngo on inside the spiral model.\n\n1042\n00:48:13,650 --> 00:48:15,870\nIf you want to just make\nsure you're aware of those.\n\n1043\n00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:16,970\nPoint those out.\n\n1044\n00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:18,645\nMike did a good job of\nhighlighting them for us.\n\n1045\n00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,025\nThank you very much.\n\n1046\n00:48:20,025 --> 00:48:24,595\nAnd then rapid application development,\nwhat we call RAD, this relies\n\n1047\n00:48:24,595 --> 00:48:28,065\non the use of rapid prototyping instead\nof a lot of up front planning, so we do\n\n1048\n00:48:28,065 --> 00:48:31,722\na lot of rapid prototyping up front, build\nstuff, hey, what do you think about this?\n\n1049\n00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:34,322\nI'd prefer it be pink,\nhey it's pink now what do you think.\n\n1050\n00:48:34,322 --> 00:48:36,082\nNow I want it to be able to walk and talk.\n\n1051\n00:48:36,082 --> 00:48:39,102\nSo, we keep coming back to the customer\nwith more stuff and over time,\n\n1052\n00:48:39,102 --> 00:48:41,522\nas we do that, we narrow down the focus.\n\n1053\n00:48:41,522 --> 00:48:43,282\nIf we had planned it all up front,\nsat down and\n\n1054\n00:48:43,282 --> 00:48:46,712\ntalked to you for two days we probably\nwould have spent as much time but\n\n1055\n00:48:46,712 --> 00:48:49,372\ndone it in a different way because we\nwould have asked a lot of questions,\n\n1056\n00:48:49,372 --> 00:48:52,242\nrefine that design on paper\nbefore we built stuff.\n\n1057\n00:48:52,242 --> 00:48:53,622\n>> Right, yeah.\n>> It's just another approach,\n\n1058\n00:48:53,622 --> 00:48:54,900\nthat's all it is.\n\n1059\n00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,140\nAgile, the agile model.\n\n1060\n00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:00,870\nThis focuses on incremental and\niterative development methods.\n\n1061\n00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:05,080\nWe kind of have, when we do an agile model\nsolution, we don't really prototype much,\n\n1062\n00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,320\nrepresent a full product.\n\n1063\n00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,830\nWe break the product down\ninto individual features.\n\n1064\n00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:09,980\nAnd then we build those features.\n\n1065\n00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,900\nThat's where we talked\nabout doing those quick,\n\n1066\n00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,620\nincremental pushes where\nwe're pushing stuff out.\n\n1067\n00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,050\nWe may show you a quick proof of concept.\n\n1068\n00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:19,910\nWe do what are called storyboards,\nso we'll actually sketch stuff\n\n1069\n00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:23,790\nout to talk about features, but\nwe may not do a lot of prototyping.\n\n1070\n00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:26,170\nThere are a lot of different\nways to implement agile.\n\n1071\n00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:28,950\nSome models may call for\nprototyping, others may not.\n\n1072\n00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:31,740\nBut generically more often than not\nwe don't tend to see a lot of that\n\n1073\n00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,035\ntaking place.\n\n1074\n00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:36,550\nThen we have CMMI,\nCapability Maturity Model Integration.\n\n1075\n00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:38,930\nExcuse me.\n\n1076\n00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,760\nSo CMMI is going to allow\nus to be able to go in and\n\n1077\n00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,778\ndo what from the outside looks like ad-hoc\nor chaotic development work initially.\n\n1078\n00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:49,860\nSo it's gonna be basically\nkind of running around, and so\n\n1079\n00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:53,020\nthis idea is you know we break\ndevelopment into phases and\n\n1080\n00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,610\nwe try to get better at it, and\nwe try to mature our system over time.\n\n1081\n00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:02,260\nAnd so the initial development process,\nwhen we start out really without something\n\n1082\n00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:06,390\nthat is applied as a model, like CMMI,\nmost companies start out in this initial\n\n1083\n00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,940\nphase where things are very random and\nchaotic.\n\n1084\n00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:12,150\nThey're unpredictable,\nthere's not a lot of consistency involved,\n\n1085\n00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:16,530\nwe don't really have a methodology and\na formality or\n\n1086\n00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:19,730\na formal way of going through development.\n\n1087\n00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:23,230\nWe don't use a framework, or at least\nwe don't use one consistently, and so\n\n1088\n00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:26,480\nwe say in CMMI,\nwe're at the initial stage.\n\n1089\n00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,660\nAnd we build from there to try to\nget better by going from initial\n\n1090\n00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,950\nto ultimately optimized.\n\n1091\n00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:32,710\nWe have these phases we move through.\n\n1092\n00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,690\nIf we start out at initial,\nit's very random.\n\n1093\n00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:39,610\nWhen we get to repeatable, we start\nlaying down some structure that's formal.\n\n1094\n00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:42,260\nWe start with putting in\nthings like change control.\n\n1095\n00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,700\nQA, Quality Assurance is in place.\n\n1096\n00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,010\nThings are not going to get pushed\nout till somebody looks at them.\n\n1097\n00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:52,150\nTypically signs off on them, we can\nrepeat our processes consistently, so\n\n1098\n00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:54,570\nwe document them, and roll them forward.\n\n1099\n00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:57,880\nWe do not have a formal\nprocess model defined yet, but\n\n1100\n00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,720\nwe have the beginning structure\nof a framework that allows for\n\n1101\n00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,440\nconsistency and repeatability, and so\nwe call this phase the repeatable phase.\n\n1102\n00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,980\nThen we move into a defined area.\n\n1103\n00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,650\nSo if we move from repeatable to defined,\nwhat we're doing is creating definition.\n\n1104\n00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:14,110\nSo formal procedures are in place there,\nand\n\n1105\n00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:17,010\nwe define what the processes\nwill be to carry out a project.\n\n1106\n00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:18,630\nSo probably have a methodology.\n\n1107\n00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:22,260\nWe may establish something like a PMO,\nproject management office.\n\n1108\n00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:26,850\nWe may bring in something like ADKAR or\none of the project management frameworks\n\n1109\n00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:29,200\nthat allows us to\nformalize how we do that.\n\n1110\n00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,180\nSo the ADKAR's just one of those\nframeworks that we can use.\n\n1111\n00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:36,060\nThe organization basically now has a way\nto do quantitative process improvements.\n\n1112\n00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:40,180\nWe can metricize, measure, what's\ngoing on and improved based on that.\n\n1113\n00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,695\nWe move through defined into manage,\nthe company now has all these formal\n\n1114\n00:51:43,695 --> 00:51:48,205\nprocesses in place to collect and\nqualify, look at this quantitative data.\n\n1115\n00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:52,425\nAnd all the metrics are now being fed into\na continuous service improvement program,\n\n1116\n00:51:52,425 --> 00:51:53,955\nwhat we call CIP or CSIP.\n\n1117\n00:51:53,955 --> 00:51:57,792\nAnd as a result we're iterating through\nchanges, we're managing, we're seeing that\n\n1118\n00:51:57,792 --> 00:52:02,432\nif we do this, we get this result, but if\nwe improve over here, that result goes up.\n\n1119\n00:52:02,432 --> 00:52:06,752\nAnd so we're starting to make impactful\nchanges based on data that's measurable\n\n1120\n00:52:06,752 --> 00:52:08,890\nand that we can actually\nsee improvement around.\n\n1121\n00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:13,960\nAnd then the final phase in CMMI,\nwe move into what's known as optimizing.\n\n1122\n00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,950\nOptimizing is where we budget and\n\n1123\n00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:19,960\nintegrate budgeting into all of our plans\nfor continuous process improvement.\n\n1124\n00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,665\nSo, we dedicate resources, as we've said,\n\n1125\n00:52:22,665 --> 00:52:24,785\nwe've probably set up\na PMO somewhere else.\n\n1126\n00:52:24,785 --> 00:52:26,665\nWe have people that are focused\non doing nothing but\n\n1127\n00:52:26,665 --> 00:52:30,545\nprocess improvement, we allocate money and\nresources to it, and that's what they do,\n\n1128\n00:52:30,545 --> 00:52:32,995\nthey go through and\nthey optimize the business.\n\n1129\n00:52:32,995 --> 00:52:35,375\nSo this is the life cycle of CMMI.\n\n1130\n00:52:35,375 --> 00:52:40,435\nIt is basically a grading solution,\na ranking system for\n\n1131\n00:52:40,435 --> 00:52:44,450\nthe maturity of your development\nprocesses within the business, and so\n\n1132\n00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:47,350\nthe more mature you are,\nthe further up the model you go.\n\n1133\n00:52:47,350 --> 00:52:50,097\nComes to us from\nCarnegie Mellon University created this.\n\n1134\n00:52:50,097 --> 00:52:52,670\nCarnegie Mellon School of Business\ncame up with this years ago.\n\n1135\n00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,550\nIt's their model,\nthey own it, they manage it.\n\n1136\n00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:58,415\nIt's very well known in the industry,\na lot of people use it, and it's very well\n\n1137\n00:52:58,415 --> 00:53:01,185\nthought of because it really helps\nthe business to focus in on and\n\n1138\n00:53:01,185 --> 00:53:03,735\nunderstand how to get better\nat what they do over time.\n\n1139\n00:53:03,735 --> 00:53:05,195\n>> Currently, and\nwhat they can do to, yeah.\n\n1140\n00:53:05,195 --> 00:53:05,735\n>> Exactly.\n\n1141\n00:53:05,735 --> 00:53:08,437\nSo there's also solutions like this.\n\n1142\n00:53:08,437 --> 00:53:13,000\nNot CMMI, specifically, but things like\ngreen belt, yellow belts, the six sigma.\n\n1143\n00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,710\nRight?\nThat whole idea of six sigma is also very\n\n1144\n00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:16,710\npopular.\n\n1145\n00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:21,230\nCame out of some of the work that was done\nearly on with some big corporations that\n\n1146\n00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,890\nproduced this thought process\naround quality management.\n\n1147\n00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:26,710\nAnd so now everybody goes down and\ngets six sigma certified.\n\n1148\n00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:29,510\nYou can become a white belt,\na yellow belt, a green belt, a brown belt,\n\n1149\n00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:32,090\na black belt, ultimately,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1150\n00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,280\nSo there are these kinds of\nthought processes in CMMI,\n\n1151\n00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,410\nas it's kind of in that camp,\nif you want to think of it that way.\n\n1152\n00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:42,950\nAll right, so now we have this,\njust again, some additional thoughts.\n\n1153\n00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:44,970\nSome additional things to consider here.\n\n1154\n00:53:46,310 --> 00:53:47,270\nWe have this idea of.\n\n1155\n00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:49,160\nNow that we've talked\nabout different models.\n\n1156\n00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,900\nWe've talked about how to\ntheoretically build secure software.\n\n1157\n00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,690\nWe've maybe gone out and built one.\n\n1158\n00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:56,290\nWe've created an SDLC,\na Software Development Life Cycle.\n\n1159\n00:53:56,290 --> 00:54:00,300\nYou may use one of these methodologies we\njust talked about to crank something out.\n\n1160\n00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,464\nSo, we've produced software, so\nnow what are we gonna do to safe guard it?\n\n1161\n00:54:03,464 --> 00:54:04,490\nRight?\nWhere are we gonna put it,\n\n1162\n00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:06,040\nwhat are we gonna do?\n\n1163\n00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,080\nSo the idea here is software escrow.\n\n1164\n00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:10,220\nSoftware escrow becomes very important and\n\n1165\n00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:14,680\nso, the idea here with software escrow,\nis going through and storing source code.\n\n1166\n00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,010\nRight?\nReally going through and\n\n1167\n00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:19,220\nthinking about at the end of the day,\nwhat we wanna do.\n\n1168\n00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:23,450\nTo be able to take this software,\nthe source code that we've created, and\n\n1169\n00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:24,610\ngive it to somebody safely.\n\n1170\n00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:29,190\nIf we take, let's say if we represent\nthis as our code in effect,\n\n1171\n00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:31,970\nthis is our software, our program.\n\n1172\n00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,550\nI can say to you, look, you can buy it.\n\n1173\n00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:36,940\nIf you buy it, Mike,\nI'm going to give it to you.\n\n1174\n00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,410\nBut if I then need to produce\nmultiple copies of it,\n\n1175\n00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:40,680\nI basically gave you the only copy.\n\n1176\n00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,790\n>> Right.\n>> I want to have a safe pristine copy\n\n1177\n00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:45,670\nput somewhere, safeguard it,\nstore it securely.\n\n1178\n00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:48,585\nSo I may say to Mike, Mike, you're\ngoing to be my software escrow agent.\n\n1179\n00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:49,959\n>> Right.\n>> And what I'm going to do is I'm going\n\n1180\n00:54:49,959 --> 00:54:52,225\nto create a copy of the source code and\nall the documentation and\n\n1181\n00:54:52,225 --> 00:54:53,362\neverything that goes with it.\n\n1182\n00:54:53,362 --> 00:54:55,975\nI'm going to lock it down and\nI'm going to give it to you, and\n\n1183\n00:54:55,975 --> 00:54:58,400\nI'm going to ask you to hold it for\nme in effect, right?\n\n1184\n00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,662\nAnd so that way,\nnow you have a copy of that code.\n\n1185\n00:55:01,662 --> 00:55:02,250\n>> Right.\n>> And so,\n\n1186\n00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:05,790\nif my investors say well we want\nthe code for instance right?\n\n1187\n00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:09,930\nAnd you know you're bankrupt, meaning me,\nlike my company's gone bankrupt, and\n\n1188\n00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:13,290\nthey want the code, they can go to Mike\nwho's effectively a trusted third party.\n\n1189\n00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:15,460\nAnd they can get the code\nfrom Mike because the code,\n\n1190\n00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:19,200\nthe intellectual property of\nthe company is usually the software.\n\n1191\n00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,590\nRight.\n>> And so the software's worth a lot of\n\n1192\n00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:23,570\nmoney, and so\nwhat would often happen back in the 80s.\n\n1193\n00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,700\nI want my code back, right?\n\n1194\n00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:26,652\nSo what would often happen in the 80s and\n\n1195\n00:55:26,652 --> 00:55:30,960\nthe 90s would be that during the Internet\nbubble a lot of these startups,\n\n1196\n00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,570\na lot of these Internet startups said,\nyou know, we'd get a whole lot of venture\n\n1197\n00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:36,900\ncapital, would get millions\nof dollars from investors.\n\n1198\n00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:38,990\nThey would go off and\nwrite a bunch of code.\n\n1199\n00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:40,820\nThey would go broke pretty quickly.\n\n1200\n00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:43,430\nAnd then the investors got no money.\n\n1201\n00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:44,450\nAnd they got no code,\n\n1202\n00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:47,470\nbecause the people that wrote the code\njust disappeared with the code.\n\n1203\n00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:51,580\nAnd as a result, everybody just basically\nwas gone, there's nothing left.\n\n1204\n00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:55,965\nShow up in an office, it was like an empty\noffice space and there was nothing there.\n\n1205\n00:55:55,965 --> 00:55:59,958\nAnd so as a result, they starting building\ninto the requirements around doing this\n\n1206\n00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:03,151\nkind of work and writing these These\ncode projects that we had to use\n\n1207\n00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:07,257\nsoftware escrow, to effect, we safely park\nthe code with an impartial third party,\n\n1208\n00:56:07,257 --> 00:56:09,853\nto be able to get it back if\nsomething were to go wrong.\n\n1209\n00:56:09,853 --> 00:56:11,190\n>> Right.\n>> If you think about what happens\n\n1210\n00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:12,480\ntoday with a lot of offshoring,\n\n1211\n00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,470\nwhere a lot of this code work\nmay be done in another country.\n\n1212\n00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:18,300\nIn the US, for instance,\nwe write a lot of code here, but\n\n1213\n00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,010\nwe also send a lot of that work overseas,\nwhether it's to India or\n\n1214\n00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:25,170\nwherever it may go, somewhere in Asia,\nit doesn't really matter where.\n\n1215\n00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:28,420\nPoint is if it's being sent out then\nwe want to be able to effectively,\n\n1216\n00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,580\nif we're spending money from here and\npeople over there,\n\n1217\n00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:35,170\nhalf a world away are writing the code, we\nwanna have some sort of way of getting to\n\n1218\n00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:38,070\nit because we don't want them\ndisappearing with the code and the money.\n\n1219\n00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:40,170\nSo if we park the code somewhere, right?\n\n1220\n00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,660\nAs they write it with check in points, you\ndon't pay until a certain amount of code\n\n1221\n00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,880\nhas been escrowed, then we pay,\nand we get some more code.\n\n1222\n00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,940\nThat kind of thing.\n\n1223\n00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,680\nSo this way we can always get\na hold of it if we need it.\n\n1224\n00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,352\nSo this is what software escrow is.\n\n1225\n00:56:50,352 --> 00:56:51,680\n>> Very good.\n>> All right,\n\n1226\n00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:53,110\nit's probably a good\nplace to take a break.\n\n1227\n00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,671\n>> Yeah, I say the same thing, so\nwhy don't we step away for a little bit,\n\n1228\n00:56:55,671 --> 00:56:57,636\ngive you guys a chance to get up and\nstretch your legs and\n\n1229\n00:56:57,636 --> 00:56:58,853\nwe'll see you back here in a few.\n\n1230\n00:56:58,853 --> 00:57:01,551\n[SOUND]\n\n1231\n00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:06,947\nAll right.\n\n1232\n00:57:06,947 --> 00:57:08,695\nWelcome back, ladies and gentlemen to.\n\n1233\n00:57:08,695 --> 00:57:10,240\n[LAUGH]\n>> That's why he messes with us.\n\n1234\n00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,760\nThat's the whole thing.\n\n1235\n00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,842\n>> Yeah. All right. >> I'm chopped off\nat the end of that last one there,\n\n1236\n00:57:14,842 --> 00:57:16,720\nbut yeah, let's get back into it.\n\n1237\n00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:19,590\nWe'll do our programming languages and\nconcepts next.\n\n1238\n00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:20,140\n>> All right.\nSo,\n\n1239\n00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,220\nthis is actually one of the more\ninteresting parts of this discussion.\n\n1240\n00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:26,130\nI happen to like this particular part\nof our run through the material.\n\n1241\n00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:29,010\nWhen we talk with people\nabout programming,\n\n1242\n00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:30,450\none of the things they often\nwanna hear about is, oh,\n\n1243\n00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:33,630\nI hear about all this cool stuff, and what\nare these languages I keep hearing about?\n\n1244\n00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:34,410\nRight?\n\n1245\n00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,330\nWhat does that mean?\n\n1246\n00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:36,615\nIt's the same thing as my phone.\n\n1247\n00:57:36,615 --> 00:57:40,125\nIf I have a 4G phone does that\nmean I'm using a 4G language,\n\n1248\n00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:41,225\nwith that kind of thing.\n\n1249\n00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:42,795\nSo, a little bit of a difference,\n\n1250\n00:57:42,795 --> 00:57:45,205\nwe use generations to signify\na lot of different things.\n\n1251\n00:57:45,205 --> 00:57:47,469\nWe talk about them with firewalls,\nfor instance, right?\n\n1252\n00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:49,587\nWe have multi generations with firewalls.\n\n1253\n00:57:49,587 --> 00:57:52,077\nWe talked about them here\nwith programming languages.\n\n1254\n00:57:52,077 --> 00:57:53,777\nSo we ought to have\na sense what this means.\n\n1255\n00:57:53,777 --> 00:57:56,147\nBasically it's just a way of\ngrading functionality and\n\n1256\n00:57:56,147 --> 00:57:59,987\nkind of historically looking at what\nthese programming languages were and\n\n1257\n00:57:59,987 --> 00:58:02,067\nnow kind of what they are as a result.\n\n1258\n00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:06,543\nAnd so we start out with one gen, or 1G or\nfirst gen languages, first generation\n\n1259\n00:58:06,543 --> 00:58:10,203\nprogramming language is what we\nwould refer to as machine language.\n\n1260\n00:58:10,203 --> 00:58:13,833\nAnd so, it's in a format basically, that\nthe computer processors understand and\n\n1261\n00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:15,063\nwork with directly.\n\n1262\n00:58:15,063 --> 00:58:16,610\nWe don't really get in the way of it.\n\n1263\n00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,720\nHuman beings don't\nunderstand machine language.\n\n1264\n00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,880\nWe can look at it, but\nit doesn't really make any sense to us.\n\n1265\n00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,590\nIt is truly like looking at the Matrix,\nif you've ever seen machine language,\n\n1266\n00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:31,060\nif you haven't, get up right now, go find\nyourself a machine language interpreter,\n\n1267\n00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:33,570\nand go take a look at\nsome machine language.\n\n1268\n00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:37,210\nSo it's really nothing that we directly\ninteract with, it is all around us,\n\n1269\n00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,540\nit's running in all of our computers.\n\n1270\n00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,630\nIt is certainly something\nas it's most base,\n\n1271\n00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:44,990\nit's running in every operating system\nin terms of touching the hardware but\n\n1272\n00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:47,790\nit's nothing that we see directly,\ncuz it runs inside the kernel and\n\n1273\n00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:50,830\nwe really have no way of interacting with\nit in any meaningful way directly in\n\n1274\n00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:54,800\nthe CPU, but it is forming the foundation\nand basis of all the stuff we do.\n\n1275\n00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,110\nThen are 2G or our second gen programing\nlanguages, this is in assembly language,\n\n1276\n00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,700\nit's what we would see here.\n\n1277\n00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:04,320\nIt's considered what we call a low level\nprogramming language as I point out.\n\n1278\n00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,340\nAnd it is the representation of\nthe machine level instructions.\n\n1279\n00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:11,455\nSo it kind of represents upward level for\nmachine language for us.\n\n1280\n00:59:11,455 --> 00:59:12,525\nWhat's going on there?\n\n1281\n00:59:12,525 --> 00:59:14,945\nIt is as we say, they're one step above.\n\n1282\n00:59:14,945 --> 00:59:17,325\nWe use symbols,\nwhich are called mnemonics.\n\n1283\n00:59:17,325 --> 00:59:19,245\nI think I was Johnny Pneumonic, wasn't I?\n\n1284\n00:59:19,245 --> 00:59:21,055\n>> Yeah.\n>> I was Johnny Mnemonic.\n\n1285\n00:59:21,055 --> 00:59:25,005\nAnd so it uses symbols called\nmnemonics and it's spelled correctly.\n\n1286\n00:59:25,005 --> 00:59:25,515\n>> It is.\n\n1287\n00:59:25,515 --> 00:59:26,952\nGood job.\n>> I just thought I'd point that out.\n\n1288\n00:59:26,952 --> 00:59:27,617\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1289\n00:59:27,617 --> 00:59:32,073\nto represent all the binary codes that\nare there, programs that are written in\n\n1290\n00:59:32,073 --> 00:59:35,330\nassembly language are also\ngonna be hardware specific.\n\n1291\n00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:37,200\nThis is important for you to know.\n\n1292\n00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:40,440\nThe idea here is that we write this for\na specific platform.\n\n1293\n00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,200\nSo in other words, programs that\nare assembled versus third generation,\n\n1294\n00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,400\nfourth generation that will\nultimately be compiled,\n\n1295\n00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:51,810\nand therefore need to be interpreted,\nprograms that are second level or second\n\n1296\n00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:55,110\ngen that are assembled, are assembled for\na specific hardware platform.\n\n1297\n00:59:55,110 --> 01:00:00,280\nSo we would have programs assembled for\nan Intel chip set,\n\n1298\n01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:04,620\nas opposed to a SPARC chip set, or\nas opposed to a other type of chip set, or\n\n1299\n01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:07,820\nwhatever it may be,\nbecause it's hardware specific.\n\n1300\n01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,930\nAnd so, this is important because we have\nto have multiple versions of the language.\n\n1301\n01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:12,450\nWe build them.\n\n1302\n01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:16,880\nWe assemble them for that platform, and\nthat's effectively what we would see.\n\n1303\n01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,685\nThird gen, if we maybe,\nyeah, no we're good.\n\n1304\n01:00:18,685 --> 01:00:19,580\nI think it's right on the edge here.\n\n1305\n01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,561\nThird gen or 3G programming language, and\n\n1306\n01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:23,930\nthis is what's known as\na high level language.\n\n1307\n01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:27,100\nWe use what I would refer to as abstract\nstatements, so we're abstracting.\n\n1308\n01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:30,170\nWe're hiding what goes on underneath,\nwe're building complexity and\n\n1309\n01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:33,890\nfunctionality in with every level of\nlanguage we go up the stack here.\n\n1310\n01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:37,465\nFrom first gen which is just raw machine\nlanguage interacting directly there,\n\n1311\n01:00:37,465 --> 01:00:40,927\nno real worry about who see's it and\nwhat it does, all the way up to fifth gen,\n\n1312\n01:00:40,927 --> 01:00:44,213\nultimately, which are languages\nwhich effectively are English like.\n\n1313\n01:00:44,213 --> 01:00:47,940\nSo something like XML,\nwhich is written in English like syntax.\n\n1314\n01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:51,490\nWhere we can interact directly,\nsee what goes on, but we extract away\n\n1315\n01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:55,246\nall of that information that normally\nwe would need to see, is gonna happen.\n\n1316\n01:00:55,246 --> 01:00:59,307\nSo at a third gen, or 3G programming\nlanguage high level, we are going\n\n1317\n01:00:59,307 --> 01:01:04,184\nto extract naturalized man made assembly\nlanguage instructions into this high level\n\n1318\n01:01:04,184 --> 01:01:08,942\nstatement, so we begin to get stuff that's\nEnglish so we can kinda interact with.\n\n1319\n01:01:08,942 --> 01:01:11,930\nWe begin to see things like if,\nthan L statements.\n\n1320\n01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:16,210\nIf this variable then this else,\nmeaning other do that, and\n\n1321\n01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:19,050\nthis is kind of programming language\nthat said if you write any code or\n\n1322\n01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,650\nif you're exposed to code writing,\nyou're gonna be familiar with.\n\n1323\n01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:25,498\nYou're gonna start being able to\ninteract with programming languages\n\n1324\n01:01:25,498 --> 01:01:27,300\nat a high level or third gen area.\n\n1325\n01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:30,940\nYou're probably going to do most\nof that interaction typically,\n\n1326\n01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:34,870\nin your fourth gen to fifth gen areas,\nmore so fifth gen today, but\n\n1327\n01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:37,890\nthe idea is that you can use a variety\nof these areas to be able to write with.\n\n1328\n01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:40,880\nSo, high level languages\nare processor independent.\n\n1329\n01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,800\nDoesn't matter, right?\n\n1330\n01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,130\nSo, whether it's Intel,\n\n1331\n01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:47,910\nAMD, Spark, etcetera, they'll run on\nany of those processors independently.\n\n1332\n01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:49,680\nMeaning it doesn't matter,\nthey don't have to be assembled,\n\n1333\n01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,420\nthey'll run across all of them equally.\n\n1334\n01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:55,050\nCode written in a high level language can\nbe converted over to machine language for\n\n1335\n01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:58,860\ndifferent process or architectures,\nso it is ported, in effect, we use,\n\n1336\n01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:01,680\nas I mentioned a minute ago,\nwe called compilers and interpreters.\n\n1337\n01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:04,780\nSo these are code elements that will\neffectively switch the code into\n\n1338\n01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:08,870\nthe appropriate function, form,\nsyntax, etcetera, to make it run on\n\n1339\n01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:13,280\nSpark versus AMD versus Intel, but\nit's all done using these other tools.\n\n1340\n01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,680\nYou don't use it directly\nthrough the code.\n\n1341\n01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,200\nFourth gen programming languages,\nwhat we call very high level languages.\n\n1342\n01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:23,460\nNot just high, for\neffect, very high, right.\n\n1343\n01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:24,510\nHow high?\n\n1344\n01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,104\nVery high.\n\n1345\n01:02:25,104 --> 01:02:27,058\n>> That's my head dude.\n\n1346\n01:02:27,058 --> 01:02:29,477\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Let's not do that, all right,\n\n1347\n01:02:29,477 --> 01:02:34,069\nso, very high level languages, they focus\non highly abstract algorithms here,\n\n1348\n01:02:34,069 --> 01:02:37,770\nthey allow effectively for\nstraight forward implementations.\n\n1349\n01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:40,588\nMeaning very high level languages\nare usually implemented for\n\n1350\n01:02:40,588 --> 01:02:43,884\ncertain kinds of environments,\nyou may write them or deal with them, for\n\n1351\n01:02:43,884 --> 01:02:45,851\ninstance dealing with maybe a web service,\n\n1352\n01:02:45,851 --> 01:02:48,954\nyou may use a very high level language\nto write code for a web service.\n\n1353\n01:02:48,954 --> 01:02:51,780\nIt's a well defined environment what\nwe're writing for, and they are,\n\n1354\n01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:53,660\na very high level, you know,\na very high level.\n\n1355\n01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:57,620\nThey're abstracting away, and\nas a result they're fairly easy to write,\n\n1356\n01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:02,080\nfairly easy to interact with, so\nyou know, HTML, for instance, right,\n\n1357\n01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:05,670\ncould be considered a very high\nlevel language, fifth gen language,\n\n1358\n01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:08,800\nnatural languages have the ultimate\ntarget here of eliminating the need for\n\n1359\n01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,290\nany programing expertise at all.\n\n1360\n01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:13,810\nHTML, you can write but you got to know\na little bit, you got to know the syntax,\n\n1361\n01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:14,810\nyou got to learn the syntax.\n\n1362\n01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:16,100\n>> You got to learn your tags and\nall that, yep yep.\n\n1363\n01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,839\n>> So considered very high level,\nright, but\n\n1364\n01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,538\nyou got to have a little\nbit of background.\n\n1365\n01:03:19,538 --> 01:03:24,046\nSomething like XML, you can argue\npotentially it's maybe very high level,\n\n1366\n01:03:24,046 --> 01:03:28,413\nmaybe a fourth gen, but there's enough\nin there that you could say it's so\n\n1367\n01:03:28,413 --> 01:03:31,418\nEnglish like that it's\npretty close to fifth gen.\n\n1368\n01:03:31,418 --> 01:03:34,160\nBut it kind of is probably is kinda\nlike a fourth and a half gen, right,\n\n1369\n01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,790\ncuz it's kind of between the two.\n\n1370\n01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:39,812\nThe struggle with fifth gen language is,\nit's been very hard to for us to come up\n\n1371\n01:03:39,812 --> 01:03:44,016\nwith languages that really fall into this\ncategory because it's very hard for us to\n\n1372\n01:03:44,016 --> 01:03:48,350\nfigure out how to abstract away all the\nprogramming expertise and still use them.\n\n1373\n01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:49,458\n>> Right.\n>> So we point out here,\n\n1374\n01:03:49,458 --> 01:03:53,751\nthat these are basically gonna be things\nlike artificially intelligent languages.\n\n1375\n01:03:53,751 --> 01:03:56,808\nSo where we're looking at the languages\nthat are used to create AI.\n\n1376\n01:03:56,808 --> 01:03:57,544\nFor instance,\n\n1377\n01:03:57,544 --> 01:04:01,733\nthe programmatic syntax that's used with\nthe information management that's used for\n\n1378\n01:04:01,733 --> 01:04:04,800\nAI systems, we're typically\nlooking at fifth gen languages.\n\n1379\n01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:06,090\nThat's really what we see there.\n\n1380\n01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:09,090\nSo, to give you a sense of that,\nbut you definitely want to\n\n1381\n01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:11,932\nmake sure you understand the different\ngenerations of programming languages.\n\n1382\n01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:14,112\nWant to make sure you have a sense\nof what happens with each.\n\n1383\n01:04:14,112 --> 01:04:17,899\nWe're building complexity as we go,\ngetting further away from just that raw\n\n1384\n01:04:17,899 --> 01:04:21,970\ncode running in the hardware, right at\nthe guts, at the heart of the machine.\n\n1385\n01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:25,380\nWe're putting all this pretty stuff on\ntop of it, to make it more amenable,\n\n1386\n01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:27,240\nmore easily approachable for humans.\n\n1387\n01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,250\nBut as a result, we're abstracting away,\n\n1388\n01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:33,610\nwe're hiding a lot of that raw\nfunctionality, that raw power underneath\n\n1389\n01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:35,760\nthat we just don't really\nunderstand how to manage directly.\n\n1390\n01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,660\nAnd that's effectively what we're doing.\n\n1391\n01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:41,230\nSo we have some tools down there,\nvocabulary items.\n\n1392\n01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:44,310\nWe have things like assemblers,\ncompilers, and interpreters.\n\n1393\n01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:45,750\nSo let's talk about some of these.\n\n1394\n01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:48,430\nAssemblers are tools that convert\nassembly language as we said,\n\n1395\n01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:49,540\nsource code into machine code.\n\n1396\n01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:52,800\nWe just talked about that up top where\nwe have assemblers and compilers.\n\n1397\n01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:57,610\nCompilers also, they convert high-level\nlanguage statements into machine language\n\n1398\n01:04:57,610 --> 01:05:01,315\nformat for a specific process or\nso, things like, .exe, .dll,\n\n1399\n01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:05,100\nare gonna be equivalent of,\nthese are what these compilers are.\n\n1400\n01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:05,660\n>> Right.\n\n1401\n01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:06,570\n>> So, interpreters,\n\n1402\n01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:10,670\ntools that effectively convert code into\ninterpreted languages, or written and\n\n1403\n01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:14,610\ninterpreted languages, I should say, to\nthe machine level format for processing.\n\n1404\n01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:17,840\nSo, just different ways of moving\nlanguages between levels, in effect.\n\n1405\n01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,110\nIt's what assemblers,\ncompilers, and interpreters do.\n\n1406\n01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:24,120\nThe garbage collector function is going\nto be this function that identifies\n\n1407\n01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,890\nblocks of memory that were allocated out,\nbut now are no longer being used, and\n\n1408\n01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,250\neffectively frees them up.\n\n1409\n01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:32,080\nSo it goes through and in effectively\njust clean up, kind of behind us,\n\n1410\n01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,510\nremoving the garbage, quote-unquote.\n\n1411\n01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:37,310\nObject Oriented Programming,\nwhat we call OOP.\n\n1412\n01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:38,322\nIt's fun to say, say it with me, Mike.\n\n1413\n01:05:38,322 --> 01:05:39,940\n>> OOPs.\n>> OOps, right, OOPs, so-\n\n1414\n01:05:39,940 --> 01:05:40,566\n>> No S, no S.\n\n1415\n01:05:40,566 --> 01:05:41,233\n>> No S.\n\n1416\n01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:43,772\nOOP, right, so\nObject Oriented Programming.\n\n1417\n01:05:43,772 --> 01:05:46,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then we have SOOP.\n\n1418\n01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:47,982\n>> SOOP.\n>> Secure Object Oriented Programming.\n\n1419\n01:05:47,982 --> 01:05:49,319\n>> Yes, getting better.\n\n1420\n01:05:49,319 --> 01:05:50,675\n>> No soup for you.\n\n1421\n01:05:50,675 --> 01:05:51,810\n>> [LAUGH] No soup for you.\n\n1422\n01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:52,430\nSoup Nazi.\n\n1423\n01:05:52,430 --> 01:05:53,500\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n1424\n01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,774\nSo we have OOP, right,\nworking with classes and objects.\n\n1425\n01:05:56,774 --> 01:05:58,645\nSo this idea of\nObject Oriented Programming is kind\n\n1426\n01:05:58,645 --> 01:05:59,564\nof interesting as well.\n\n1427\n01:05:59,564 --> 01:06:03,770\nThis is what we tend to see,\nthis is the generic model we often use.\n\n1428\n01:06:03,770 --> 01:06:07,030\nSo, for instance, anything having to\ndo with a directory service is gonna\n\n1429\n01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:10,450\nbe an object oriented solution,\nso this idea of objects.\n\n1430\n01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:14,850\nRight, objects, as we talked about, are\ngoing to be in our object subject model.\n\n1431\n01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:17,500\nWe talked about objects being data,\nsubjects being users.\n\n1432\n01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,944\nBut here a little but different,\nwe work with classes and objects.\n\n1433\n01:06:19,944 --> 01:06:22,110\nAnd so classes-\n>> Classes and attributes and, yes.\n\n1434\n01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:25,721\n>> And attributes, right, so properties,\nattributes, values, all that stuff, and\n\n1435\n01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:26,426\nobjects right?\n\n1436\n01:06:26,426 --> 01:06:31,050\nSo this idea is that we're basically\ngonna carve up the functionality and\n\n1437\n01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:36,210\nthe hierarchy of how to build something\ninto a class and then into an object.\n\n1438\n01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:39,200\nAnd so we may look at a piece\nof furniture, or a water bottle,\n\n1439\n01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,350\ndoesn't really matter, anything.\n\n1440\n01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:43,890\nWhatever it is, and then we can ascribe\nthat piece of furniture to a class.\n\n1441\n01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:48,890\nWe can say well, it is lawn furniture,\nor it is bedroom furniture, or\n\n1442\n01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:49,900\nit's dining room furniture.\n\n1443\n01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,890\nAnd within a class we have subcategories.\n\n1444\n01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:53,790\nWe can say, it may be a chair.\n\n1445\n01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,180\nIt may be a table.\n\n1446\n01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:59,240\nIt may be a, I don't know what's\nanother kind of furniture?\n\n1447\n01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:01,187\n>> I don't know, a chaise or something.\n>> Could be a rug.\n\n1448\n01:07:01,187 --> 01:07:02,640\n>> Yeah.\n>> Is a rug furniture?\n\n1449\n01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,604\nI don't know.\n>> Sorta kind of.\n\n1450\n01:07:03,604 --> 01:07:05,134\n>> Could be a love seat, could be a sofa-\n>> Yeah,\n\n1451\n01:07:05,134 --> 01:07:05,925\ncould be a chaise lounge or something.\n\n1452\n01:07:05,925 --> 01:07:06,580\n>> Could be an ottoman.\n\n1453\n01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:07,440\n>> There you go, yep.\n\n1454\n01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,680\n>> All those different things.\n\n1455\n01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,800\nCould be a book case,\ncould be a dresser, whatever it is.\n\n1456\n01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:13,160\nSo we have all these different\nsubcategories, right,\n\n1457\n01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:13,840\nwe kind of build down.\n\n1458\n01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:16,420\nAnd then ultimately as we do that, right,\n\n1459\n01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:18,660\nwe ultimately then get down\nto the specific object.\n\n1460\n01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:22,325\nSo the object may be\nthe six-drawer dresser drawer,\n\n1461\n01:07:22,325 --> 01:07:27,293\nin the class called bedroom furniture,\nor in the class called storage,\n\n1462\n01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:30,562\ninside of the class\ncalled bedroom furniture.\n\n1463\n01:07:30,562 --> 01:07:32,025\nCuz you can have multiple\nways of doing this.\n\n1464\n01:07:32,025 --> 01:07:36,012\nSo the idea here is that we basically\ngo through, and the functionality of\n\n1465\n01:07:36,012 --> 01:07:39,440\nprocedure an object is going to\ncarry out is called the method.\n\n1466\n01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:41,220\nAnd so we describe the method.\n\n1467\n01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:44,960\nMethod may be storage in this case that\nwe're talking about a set of drawers.\n\n1468\n01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,260\nAnd then by defining that and\ndefining the classes and\n\n1469\n01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:51,590\nthe objects, we're allowed then\nto basically mix match here, and\n\n1470\n01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:55,252\ntake an object from classes and\ninstantiate it with a method.\n\n1471\n01:07:55,252 --> 01:07:56,170\nAscribe a method to it,\n\n1472\n01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:58,040\nand then ultimately have it go out and\ndo something.\n\n1473\n01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,740\n>> I always loved that about it, giving\nyou that reusability in your code and\n\n1474\n01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:04,605\nnot having to rewrite the same\nthing over and over again.\n\n1475\n01:08:04,605 --> 01:08:05,190\n>> Yeah, modularity right, very good.\n\n1476\n01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:06,161\n>> Very modular, yes.\n\n1477\n01:08:06,161 --> 01:08:08,648\n>> Yeah, object orient's very good for\nthat because we can keep pulling,\n\n1478\n01:08:08,648 --> 01:08:10,901\nonce we well define-\n>> Once you define that class, yeah.\n\n1479\n01:08:10,901 --> 01:08:12,530\n>> Those libraries and\nthe classes and the objects,\n\n1480\n01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:14,991\nwe can simply pull them off the shelf and\nreuse them over and over and again.\n\n1481\n01:08:14,991 --> 01:08:15,744\n>> Exactly.\n>> So it is,\n\n1482\n01:08:15,744 --> 01:08:18,077\nin that respect it's\nactually very good because,\n\n1483\n01:08:18,077 --> 01:08:22,070\nit speeds up the delivery of code,\nthe delivery of content very, very much.\n\n1484\n01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:23,520\nSo data hiding happens here.\n\n1485\n01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,380\nThis idea of data hiding,\nalso something to call out here.\n\n1486\n01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:28,460\nIt's provided by what\nwe call encapsulation.\n\n1487\n01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:30,960\nThink about the concept of\nencapsulating something.\n\n1488\n01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,980\nWe're taking something,\nand we're hiding it.\n\n1489\n01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:36,230\nWe're encapsulating it, we're kind of\nputting it inside of something else.\n\n1490\n01:08:36,230 --> 01:08:39,610\nAnd as a result of doing that, so\nI'm encapsulating my fist here.\n\n1491\n01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:40,840\nIt's encapsulated, I can't see it.\n\n1492\n01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:43,815\nIt's being shielded by my\nhand over the top of it.\n\n1493\n01:08:43,815 --> 01:08:46,320\nSo this idea is we can hide data inside\nof something if it's encapsulated.\n\n1494\n01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:47,917\n>> Right.\n>> And so as a result of that,\n\n1495\n01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:51,341\nthe private data of the object that\nwe instantiate, what we would think\n\n1496\n01:08:51,341 --> 01:08:54,815\nof as the metadata in many cases,\nright, the data about the data.\n\n1497\n01:08:54,815 --> 01:08:57,950\nSo the descriptive data, the stuff we\nmay not want to show other people.\n\n1498\n01:08:57,950 --> 01:09:00,265\nIt's considered private and\nit's kept from outside access.\n\n1499\n01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:02,830\nWe can encapsulate it,\nand as a result hide it.\n\n1500\n01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:04,180\nNo object should be allowed to or\n\n1501\n01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:07,980\nhave the need to access another\nobject's internal data or process.\n\n1502\n01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:12,010\nMeaning we should always be able to\nkeep that data safe and secure, and\n\n1503\n01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:13,290\ninstantiate it in such a way,\n\n1504\n01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:17,330\nand hide it through encapsulation, that\nother objects are not able to get to it.\n\n1505\n01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:19,490\nIf we say effectively it's private,\n\n1506\n01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,600\nthe data's private, then there's really\nno reason to show it to anybody.\n\n1507\n01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,570\nAnd as a result, what we're trying\nto do is build systems that\n\n1508\n01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:29,330\nhave this at their heart,\nfrom an architectural perspective.\n\n1509\n01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:31,550\nSo we understand that this\nis the way we do it, and\n\n1510\n01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:34,210\nas a result we should really\nbe focused on the fact\n\n1511\n01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:37,570\nthat that is what should be the outcome,\nshould not expose that data.\n\n1512\n01:09:37,570 --> 01:09:39,940\nSo when people ask you to see\nyour private data, just say no.\n\n1513\n01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:41,225\n>> Say no.\n>> Just say no.\n\n1514\n01:09:41,225 --> 01:09:44,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sorry, I'm OOP, I can't do that.\n\n1515\n01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,240\nAll right, abstraction.\n\n1516\n01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,755\nAbstraction.\nLet's talk about abstraction.\n\n1517\n01:09:46,755 --> 01:09:48,740\nThis idea of suppressing\nany unnecessary detail,\n\n1518\n01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:52,350\nso really just the important\ninformation is examined and reviewed.\n\n1519\n01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:54,880\nSo we abstract,\nwe hide the stuff that's not relevant.\n\n1520\n01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,080\nWe show you the stuff that is.\n\n1521\n01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,575\nDon't pay attention to what\nI have in my hand, right?\n\n1522\n01:09:58,575 --> 01:10:00,693\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what abstraction is.\n\n1523\n01:10:00,693 --> 01:10:02,115\nAll right, polymorphism.\n\n1524\n01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,390\nPolymorphism, I love polymorphism.\n\n1525\n01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:06,400\nSo you're going to help me\ndo a little demonstration.\n\n1526\n01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:07,410\n>> All right.\n>> All right?\n\n1527\n01:10:07,410 --> 01:10:09,390\nSo we have not rehearsed this before,\nhave we?\n\n1528\n01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:11,620\n>> No we haven't, so now we [CROSSTALK]\n>> It's totally live, no safety net.\n\n1529\n01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,670\nMike has no idea what's\nabout to happen here, right?\n\n1530\n01:10:13,670 --> 01:10:15,160\nSo this idea of polymorphism.\n\n1531\n01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,150\nJust let's put the notes back\non the screen for half a second.\n\n1532\n01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:19,252\nLet's make sure everybody\nunderstands what we're about to do.\n\n1533\n01:10:19,252 --> 01:10:21,290\nAnd then we'll go and\nwe'll do the demonstration here.\n\n1534\n01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:25,330\nSo polymorphism, two objects can\nbasically get the same input but\n\n1535\n01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:27,370\nhave different outputs, right?\n\n1536\n01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:29,310\nAll right, so\nlet's go back to the demonstration.\n\n1537\n01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:34,830\nSo this idea of two objects can have the\nsame input, but deliver different output.\n\n1538\n01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:39,160\nSo lets say, same object,\ntwo different inputs.\n\n1539\n01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:43,970\nSo lets say that, or\ntwo different objects rather.\n\n1540\n01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:45,370\n>> So you and I are different objects.\n\n1541\n01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:46,880\n>> Right, so\nlet's say you're gonna be a cat.\n\n1542\n01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,390\n>> All right.\n>> And I'm gonna be a dog.\n\n1543\n01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:49,703\nDo you like being the cat?\n>> I can deal with that, yeah.\n\n1544\n01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:51,528\n>> Are you a cat person?\n\n1545\n01:10:51,528 --> 01:10:52,195\nCuz I'm not a cat person.\n\n1546\n01:10:52,195 --> 01:10:53,858\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, he's got the cat on there,\n\n1547\n01:10:53,858 --> 01:10:55,012\nthat's why I said cat.\n\n1548\n01:10:55,012 --> 01:10:56,621\nAll right, so, you're gonna be the cat.\n\n1549\n01:10:56,621 --> 01:10:58,771\nYou know what, actually you have to hold\nthe cat, you have to hold the cat up.\n\n1550\n01:10:58,771 --> 01:10:59,732\n>> I have to hold the cat up?\n\n1551\n01:10:59,732 --> 01:11:01,062\nAll right.\n>> Yeah, if we're going to be the cat,\n\n1552\n01:11:01,062 --> 01:11:01,777\nyou're going to be the cat.\n\n1553\n01:11:01,777 --> 01:11:02,647\n>> I don't know if you guys\ncan see that out there.\n\n1554\n01:11:02,647 --> 01:11:03,769\nIt's on the glass.\n>> Yeah, you really can't see, but\n\n1555\n01:11:03,769 --> 01:11:04,407\nhe has a cat right on there.\n\n1556\n01:11:04,407 --> 01:11:05,621\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, you're gonna be a cat,\n\n1557\n01:11:05,621 --> 01:11:06,410\nI'm gonna be a dog.\n\n1558\n01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:07,532\nNow we're both animals, right?\n\n1559\n01:11:07,532 --> 01:11:08,117\n>> Right, mm-hm.\n>> So\n\n1560\n01:11:08,117 --> 01:11:10,270\nwhen you give a command to an animal,\nright.\n\n1561\n01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:10,950\nSpeak.\n\n1562\n01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:13,120\nSo let's say we say, no, I get this right.\n\n1563\n01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:13,693\nYou have to-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1564\n01:11:13,693 --> 01:11:14,454\n>> Bear with me here.\n\n1565\n01:11:14,454 --> 01:11:15,170\nOkay, I get the fact,\n\n1566\n01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:19,570\nbefore everybody starts chiming in, you\ncan't talk to a cat, they're antisocial.\n\n1567\n01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:21,630\nAnd even if you could,\nthey don't speak anyway.\n\n1568\n01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:22,650\nI get that.\n\n1569\n01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:23,235\nJust, you know, work with us here.\n\n1570\n01:11:23,235 --> 01:11:24,920\n>> Right, play along here.\n\n1571\n01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:25,478\nPlay along.\n\n1572\n01:11:25,478 --> 01:11:26,074\n>> It's magic, trust me, it works.\n\n1573\n01:11:26,074 --> 01:11:26,609\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n1574\n01:11:26,609 --> 01:11:28,617\n[LAUGH]\n>> Just close your eyes, tranquil voice,\n\n1575\n01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,189\ngo to the happy place, it's all gonna-\n>> Ohmmmmm.\n\n1576\n01:11:31,189 --> 01:11:32,018\n>> It's all gonna work.\n\n1577\n01:11:32,018 --> 01:11:33,243\nAll right so, right, exactly.\n\n1578\n01:11:33,243 --> 01:11:37,290\nAll right, so you're a cat,\nI'm a dog, so two animals, right?\n\n1579\n01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:39,780\nBoth get issued the command to speak,\nright?\n\n1580\n01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:42,520\nSo, what does the cat do\nif you say speak to a cat?\n\n1581\n01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:44,540\nTypically, a cat will walk\naway from you with disdain-\n\n1582\n01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:45,288\n>> Walk out, I was gonna say [LAUGH]\n\n1583\n01:11:45,288 --> 01:11:45,853\n>> And not do anything.\n\n1584\n01:11:45,853 --> 01:11:47,613\n>> Not do anything.\n>> So, but what will a cat normally do?\n\n1585\n01:11:47,613 --> 01:11:48,560\nShould?\n\n1586\n01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:49,430\n>> Should meow.\n\n1587\n01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:50,360\n>> Should meow, right.\n\n1588\n01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:53,520\nAnd what would a dog normally\ndo if you say speak?\n\n1589\n01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,130\n>> Should bark.\n\n1590\n01:11:54,130 --> 01:11:54,756\n>> Should bark.\n\n1591\n01:11:54,756 --> 01:11:56,093\nPolymorphism, right?\n\n1592\n01:11:56,093 --> 01:11:57,599\nSo this idea-\n>> Same idea, two objects.\n\n1593\n01:11:57,599 --> 01:11:59,840\n>> Of same command,\ntwo different outputs, right.\n\n1594\n01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,639\n>> Nice.\n\n1595\n01:12:00,639 --> 01:12:02,088\nMeow, bark.\n\n1596\n01:12:02,088 --> 01:12:03,506\nRight?\n\n1597\n01:12:03,506 --> 01:12:06,840\nAnd by the way, the cat will run,\nbecause the dog will chase the cat.\n\n1598\n01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,920\n>> The dogs barking, and\nthe cats clawing at your leg.\n\n1599\n01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,560\n>> Dogs running down the road.\n\n1600\n01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,230\nBut the idea is with Polymorphism, right.\n\n1601\n01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:12,910\nIt's very important.\n\n1602\n01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:16,000\nIs we think about this, we're basically\ngoing to be thinking about this idea of\n\n1603\n01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,310\ntwo objects getting the same input.\n\n1604\n01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:21,660\nSo think of not a cat and a dog, it's\njust a very easy way to understand it.\n\n1605\n01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:25,260\nBut think about two objects that\nhave been defined through OOB and\n\n1606\n01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:28,480\ngetting the same input,\nexecute this command.\n\n1607\n01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:31,700\nDifferent output is what were talking\nabout when we talk about Polymorphism.\n\n1608\n01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:34,140\nSo that's going to be\nimportant to think about.\n\n1609\n01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:35,280\nAll right, so make sure you know that.\n\n1610\n01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,376\nPolymorphism, pretty important one.\n\n1611\n01:12:36,376 --> 01:12:37,339\n>> I don't think I'll ever forget that.\n[CROSSTALK]\n\n1612\n01:12:37,339 --> 01:12:38,560\n>> No, you'll never forget that.\n\n1613\n01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,840\nYou were wonderful by the way.\n\n1614\n01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,130\nJust awesome job,\nbest cat I've ever worked with.\n\n1615\n01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:42,820\nYou were awesome.\n\n1616\n01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,367\nSee, I'm going to get you\nto be a cat person yet.\n\n1617\n01:12:44,367 --> 01:12:45,993\n>> [LAUGH] Not likely.\n\n1618\n01:12:45,993 --> 01:12:48,070\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Not likely, all right,\n\n1619\n01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:51,200\nso let's continue on our discussion here.\n\n1620\n01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:54,550\nSo Data modeling, Data modeling,\nlet's talk about Data modeling.\n\n1621\n01:12:54,550 --> 01:12:56,930\nSo the idea of being able to go\nthrough and look at data, right?\n\n1622\n01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,650\nWe have to come up with\na way to envision it.\n\n1623\n01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:00,930\nSee what's going on with it,\nturn it around, understand it.\n\n1624\n01:13:00,930 --> 01:13:02,840\nSo this is the idea of data modeling.\n\n1625\n01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,790\nHow do we independently\nunderstand what's in there.\n\n1626\n01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:07,990\nAnd make sure the data is going\nto be analyzed properly and\n\n1627\n01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:09,070\nthat it supports the business.\n\n1628\n01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:10,830\nThat's what data modeling's about.\n\n1629\n01:13:10,830 --> 01:13:14,330\nCohesion, Cohesion is a measurement that\nindicates how many different types of\n\n1630\n01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:16,540\ntasks a module needs to carry out.\n\n1631\n01:13:16,540 --> 01:13:20,400\nRemember we're talking about this idea of\nall these things that go into the modules,\n\n1632\n01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,630\nare just the building blocks,\n\n1633\n01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:23,880\nthe components that go into these\nmodels we're talking about.\n\n1634\n01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,430\nSo, Coupling is a measurement that\nindicates how much interaction\n\n1635\n01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,640\none module requires for\ncarrying out its tasks.\n\n1636\n01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,570\nCoupling is like connection,\nhow much interaction.\n\n1637\n01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:33,230\n>> Right.\n>> How many connections do we need\n\n1638\n01:13:33,230 --> 01:13:34,590\nto couple something.\n\n1639\n01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:35,760\nData structure,\n\n1640\n01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,480\nrepresentation of the logical\nrelationship between elements of data.\n\n1641\n01:13:39,830 --> 01:13:41,300\nWe can map out the data structure.\n\n1642\n01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:43,240\nIt's kind of showing us\nalmost like a data map.\n\n1643\n01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:44,030\nWhat it is.\n\n1644\n01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:47,770\nDistributed Computing Environment,\nDCE is an acronym.\n\n1645\n01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:49,990\nThis is the first framework and\ndevelopment toolkit for\n\n1646\n01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:53,780\ndeveloping client server applications,\nto allow for distributed computing.\n\n1647\n01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:54,960\nThat's just what we call it.\n\n1648\n01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,720\nSo it's kind of underlying the modern\nwindows architecture that we\n\n1649\n01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,990\nthink of today.\n\n1650\n01:13:58,990 --> 01:14:03,290\nA CORBA, which is\nCommon Object Request Broker Architecture.\n\n1651\n01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:03,940\n>> Not COBRA.\n\n1652\n01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,780\nRight, not to be confused with COBRA,\nright?\n\n1653\n01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,180\nCORBA, I actually made that mistake once.\n\n1654\n01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:09,960\nI was talking all about.\n\n1655\n01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,930\nI'm like COBRA, COBRA.\n\n1656\n01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:12,670\nI kept referring to it as COBRA.\n\n1657\n01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:14,430\nAnd they're like, no no no.\n\n1658\n01:14:14,430 --> 01:14:15,010\nI said, okay.\n\n1659\n01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:16,050\nRight?\n\n1660\n01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:21,550\nSo it was right around the time I think I\nhad switched out to the insurance company.\n\n1661\n01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:22,930\nThis was something we had.\n\n1662\n01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:23,570\n>> Oh right, right.\n\n1663\n01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:25,300\nYeah.\n>> We had to do that for like a month.\n\n1664\n01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,560\nYeah.\n>> We will charge you.\n\n1665\n01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:27,300\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1666\n01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:29,610\nSo, let's go back here.\n\n1667\n01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:32,960\nSo CORBA, object oriented.\n\n1668\n01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:33,835\nYeah, there we go.\n\n1669\n01:14:33,835 --> 01:14:35,900\nObject-oriented, open object oriented.\n\n1670\n01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,900\nYes, space object from there.\n\n1671\n01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,445\nObject oriented, all one word right.\n\n1672\n01:14:40,445 --> 01:14:43,180\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Object oriented standards architecture\n\n1673\n01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:46,230\nis an open standard and\nit basically's just going to allow\n\n1674\n01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:49,320\ndifferent people to write to the standard\nand use it as an open source standard.\n\n1675\n01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:53,120\nSo it allows us to be able to effectively\nget up and running on different computer\n\n1676\n01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,140\nsystems because it's not tied\nto any one particular model.\n\n1677\n01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:59,090\nObject request broker,\nwhat we call an ORB, this is\n\n1678\n01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:01,930\ngoing to manage all the communication\nbetween the various components\n\n1679\n01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:04,730\nenabling them to interact within\nthese distributed environments.\n\n1680\n01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:06,510\nThat's what this does.\n\n1681\n01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:08,160\nCOM, Component Object Model.\n\n1682\n01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:11,970\nThe idea of COM,\nthis is a Microsoft specific thing,\n\n1683\n01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:13,510\nwe called that out there for you here.\n\n1684\n01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:15,580\nMicrosoft developed the COM model.\n\n1685\n01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:17,350\nIt is kind of at the heart\nof what they do.\n\n1686\n01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:20,380\nAnd this allows inter process\ncommunication to take place\n\n1687\n01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:23,630\nbetween different things that are going on\nso we can write in different programming\n\n1688\n01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:27,460\nlanguages in effect, and swap information\nback and forth between Visual Basic,\n\n1689\n01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:31,320\nand C#, and ASP, things like that.\n\n1690\n01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,620\nActive Server Pages.\n\n1691\n01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:35,150\nObject linking and embedding,\nwhat's known as OLE.\n\n1692\n01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:37,570\nYou probably have some exposure\nto this at some point.\n\n1693\n01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:40,040\nIf you ever converted a,\ntaken a spreadsheet and\n\n1694\n01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,200\nembedded it in a Word document,\nyou've done object linking and embedding.\n\n1695\n01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:45,450\nOr in a Powerpoint, we've all done that,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1696\n01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:49,030\nSo that's what object linking and\nembedding is we use the COM model to\n\n1697\n01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:52,980\nbe able to embed objects inside of other\nobjects, in effect that's what it is.\n\n1698\n01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:55,170\nA Java Platform Enterprise Edition,\n\n1699\n01:15:55,170 --> 01:16:00,750\nwhat's known as J2EE this is going to be\nlike enterprise port for java programming.\n\n1700\n01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:04,650\nIt allows a modular programmatic\napproach to be able to use java code.\n\n1701\n01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:06,410\nIt is platform independent.\n\n1702\n01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:08,260\nSo could run it anywhere.\n\n1703\n01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:10,670\nOne of the nice things about\nJava is it runs everywhere.\n\n1704\n01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:11,360\n>> It does.\n\n1705\n01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:14,730\n>> As auricle is very fond of reminding\nus and is not shy about telling us.\n\n1706\n01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:17,047\n>> They do [CROSSTALK] just\nabout every other day.\n\n1707\n01:16:17,047 --> 01:16:21,954\n>> All right, so we have Service-oriented\narchitecture SOA, what we call SOA,\n\n1708\n01:16:21,954 --> 01:16:24,882\nin SOA and then we'll build on that and\nus S O A P,\n\n1709\n01:16:24,882 --> 01:16:28,750\nSimple Object Access Protocol,\ncalled SOAP in a minute.\n\n1710\n01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:32,440\nBut, SOA is just a standardized\naccess solution that\n\n1711\n01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,660\nlets us basically get all these\ndifferent services in to applications.\n\n1712\n01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:38,170\nSo this is a framework that we\nare basically going to be able to use to\n\n1713\n01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:39,110\ndo this.\n\n1714\n01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:42,160\nWe have self contained,\nloosely coupled information.\n\n1715\n01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:45,210\nWe bring it together, and then as\na result of that we are able to basically\n\n1716\n01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:48,590\nbring in a lot of these different\nservices, and have them independently\n\n1717\n01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:51,300\nInteract with each other so\nthey can kind of coexist if you will.\n\n1718\n01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:57,620\nSimple Object Access Protocol we call\nSOAP, this is an XML-based protocol\n\n1719\n01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:00,720\nthat is going to be used in web\nservices so we see it a lot.\n\n1720\n01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:03,620\nIt's not very popular but\nyou see a lot of it out there.\n\n1721\n01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:06,240\nYou often hear it referred to\njust generically a lot of people\n\n1722\n01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:09,240\njust talk about XML in web services,\nthey may not go to the trouble of defining\n\n1723\n01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:13,030\nwhether it's SOAP or not, but\nwe do see a fair amount of it out there.\n\n1724\n01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:16,630\nThis idea of a mashup is where we're going\nto combine a bunch of functionality from\n\n1725\n01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:20,470\ndifferent areas, we're bringing it all\ntogether, so it kind of creates something\n\n1726\n01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:24,280\nnew out of different component parts that\nprobably has not been created before.\n\n1727\n01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:27,770\nMashups were all the rage several years\nback, with web services just coming on\n\n1728\n01:17:27,770 --> 01:17:31,930\nthe scene, people were doing all sorts of\ncrazy stuff, taking a bit of this, and\n\n1729\n01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:34,670\na bit of that, putting it together,\nand now you've got something new.\n\n1730\n01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:37,580\nIt's not as popular today,\n\n1731\n01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:40,710\nyou don't as much about mashups today\nas we use to but having said that,\n\n1732\n01:17:40,710 --> 01:17:44,550\nit's still an important concept for\nus to at least be aware of, right?\n\n1733\n01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:47,180\nSoftware as a Service, we can call SaaS.\n\n1734\n01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:51,140\nThat should be two lower case A's by\nthe way, that was my mistake I think, for\n\n1735\n01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:53,610\nsome reason, I just did not catch that.\n\n1736\n01:17:53,610 --> 01:17:54,110\nThere we go.\n\n1737\n01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:57,860\nSo the idea of SaaS,\nSoftware as a Service,\n\n1738\n01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,430\nis going to be this idea\nof renting software.\n\n1739\n01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:04,100\nIn fact, right what we're doing is pay as\nyou go, and if somebody has a software,\n\n1740\n01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:06,030\nif we want to use it, but\nwe don't want to buy it,\n\n1741\n01:18:06,030 --> 01:18:08,570\nwe just effectively want to lease it,\nso we can do that.\n\n1742\n01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:10,600\nThink of Office 365.\n\n1743\n01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,090\nThink of Google, right?\n\n1744\n01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,580\nYou know, Google Apps.\n\n1745\n01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,450\nYou know, the Amazon platform.\n\n1746\n01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:16,910\nYou know, Amazon Cloud.\n\n1747\n01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:19,120\nAll these provide software\nas a service module.\n\n1748\n01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,510\nSo, that's what we do is typically\ndeliver through Cloud computing.\n\n1749\n01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:27,980\nAnd so having said the magic words,\nlet's define the marketing term yet again.\n\n1750\n01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:29,230\nWhat is the cloud, right?\n\n1751\n01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:30,240\nJoin me on this journey.\n\n1752\n01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,710\n>> It's brand new,\nI have never seen it before.\n\n1753\n01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:33,580\n>> Sit back and\nover the next five minutes we will\n\n1754\n01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:34,430\nexplain to you\n>> [LAUGHING]\n\n1755\n01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:35,525\n>> It's like a Disney ride.\n\n1756\n01:18:35,525 --> 01:18:37,350\n>> [LAUGHS]\n>> It's almost like you are in the,\n\n1757\n01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:38,050\nwhat's the golf ball,\n\n1758\n01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:41,590\nwhat do they call that now,\nit's the Captain EO, you know in Epcot.\n\n1759\n01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:42,740\nOh yeah yeah yeah yeah.\n\n1760\n01:18:42,740 --> 01:18:44,740\nI don't know.\nIs it just Space Mountain?\n\n1761\n01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:45,770\n>> No. No no no. It's not Space Mountain.\n\n1762\n01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:47,820\nThe one that used to be\nthe Michael Jackson ride.\n\n1763\n01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:48,820\nAt Epcot, the big golf ball.\n\n1764\n01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:50,610\nRight?\nAt least that's the formal way we\n\n1765\n01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:51,530\nrefer it, the golf ball.\n\n1766\n01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:54,640\nBut for those of you who've never\nbeen to Disney World in Orlando,\n\n1767\n01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,230\nthey do have this ride at Epcot.\n\n1768\n01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:02,400\nBig huge spherical thing that looks like\na golf ball sitting right in the entrance\n\n1769\n01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:06,690\nof Epcot, and it used to be years ago\nit was the Michael Jackson had done,\n\n1770\n01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:08,710\nthe narration for\nit was called Captain EO.\n\n1771\n01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:11,540\nSo that kind of eco-friendly thing,\n\n1772\n01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:14,260\nnow it's some sort of journey\nback in history or something?\n\n1773\n01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:15,090\n>> Yeah, I think so.\n\n1774\n01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:19,140\n>> History of time and Angela, There's\nan Angela Landsbery does the narration, or\n\n1775\n01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:22,070\nVanessa Redgrave, one of them does\nthe narration for it, so yeah, yeah.\n\n1776\n01:19:22,070 --> 01:19:24,897\nBut yeah, you go there, you're kind\nof tired, you kind of hang out for\n\n1777\n01:19:24,897 --> 01:19:27,268\nlike ten minutes, and\nthey talk to you and you fall asleep.\n\n1778\n01:19:27,268 --> 01:19:28,508\n>> You fall asleep, exactly.\n\n1779\n01:19:28,508 --> 01:19:29,605\n>> That and the Hall of Presidents, right?\n\n1780\n01:19:29,605 --> 01:19:30,438\n>> Yeah.\n\n1781\n01:19:30,438 --> 01:19:32,090\n[LAUGH]\n>> Carousel of progress.\n\n1782\n01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:34,870\nAs a parent you've got to map out those\nplaces where you've got to stop and\n\n1783\n01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,970\nrest for a little bit, that's their break.\n\n1784\n01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:38,030\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1785\n01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:39,030\nSo Cloud computing.\n\n1786\n01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:43,445\nThe idea is basically putting services up\ninto some sort of model whether it's going\n\n1787\n01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:46,800\nto be a private cloud so\nwe run a cloud for internal consumption or\n\n1788\n01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,927\ninternal users that aren't\nexposed to the outside world.\n\n1789\n01:19:49,927 --> 01:19:53,597\n>> We used to call this an intranet,\nso Cloud 2.0 is like Intranet 2.0 is\n\n1790\n01:19:53,597 --> 01:19:57,502\nlike the cloud for private cloud, but it\nis all going to be hosted on virtualized\n\n1791\n01:19:57,502 --> 01:20:01,059\nenvironments typically and\navailable over the wire, typically over or\n\n1792\n01:20:01,059 --> 01:20:05,175\nthrough some sort of remote access, that's\ntypically what we see with the cloud.\n\n1793\n01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:08,391\nWe may have a public cloud, where we\nare allowing people to come in and\n\n1794\n01:20:08,391 --> 01:20:11,062\naccess services over the Internet or\nthe World Wide Web.\n\n1795\n01:20:11,062 --> 01:20:15,401\nThink of something like Amazon, think of\nGoogle, Office 365, those are all public\n\n1796\n01:20:15,401 --> 01:20:19,170\nclouds, or at least they're available\nthrough a public cloud interface.\n\n1797\n01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:21,254\nAnd then we have a hybrid cloud,\nwhere we can have public and\n\n1798\n01:20:21,254 --> 01:20:22,670\nprivate parts mixed together.\n\n1799\n01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:24,520\nWe used to, again, have models for this.\n\n1800\n01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,980\nInternet, intranet, extranet, etc.,\nand so we would have these models,\n\n1801\n01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:30,310\nthese are just kinda\nthe updated version of this.\n\n1802\n01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:35,200\nSo we have mobile code, this idea that\ncode can be transmitted across a network,\n\n1803\n01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:38,042\nexecuted by a system somewhere\nelse on the other side.\n\n1804\n01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,100\nSo malware, for instance,\n\n1805\n01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:42,790\na good example of mobile code,\nwe'll talk more about that later on.\n\n1806\n01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:44,060\nWe have Java applets.\n\n1807\n01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:49,540\nJava applets are small components,\nlittle functional pieces of software,\n\n1808\n01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:53,220\nthey're self-contained, typically, that\ncan provide various functional elements or\n\n1809\n01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:55,005\nfunctional items that can be executed.\n\n1810\n01:20:55,005 --> 01:20:57,705\nWe run them typically inside of what's\nknown as a Java Virtual Machine.\n\n1811\n01:20:57,705 --> 01:21:01,995\nSo we'll create a virtual sandbox where\nthe applets execute what Java is so\n\n1812\n01:21:01,995 --> 01:21:03,245\nubiquitous it runs everywhere.\n\n1813\n01:21:03,245 --> 01:21:05,835\nBut it's also seen as\nbeing relatively secure.\n\n1814\n01:21:05,835 --> 01:21:07,770\nIt is platform independent.\n\n1815\n01:21:07,770 --> 01:21:10,800\nAnd we can usually use those Java\napplets across multiple browsers.\n\n1816\n01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,650\nSo that way they fit into almost anything.\n\n1817\n01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,530\nSandbox.\n\n1818\n01:21:15,530 --> 01:21:19,715\nSandbox, this idea of basically a virtual\nenvironment that allows us to kind of\n\n1819\n01:21:19,715 --> 01:21:22,720\nexamine things, put it under a microscope\nand see what's going on in there.\n\n1820\n01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:24,650\nIsolate it from everything around it.\n\n1821\n01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:29,660\nAnd as a result of that, be able to use\nthis idea for application development, for\n\n1822\n01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:32,800\nmaybe some regression testing,\nmaybe looking at malware,\n\n1823\n01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,100\nwhere we want to examine it but\nnot allow it out in the wild.\n\n1824\n01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:38,410\nAnd any of this stuff can be used or\nhave use cases built around\n\n1825\n01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:42,150\nthis idea of a sandbox, and so\nit is a very useful concept.\n\n1826\n01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:46,120\nIt's become a lot more prevalent\ntoday the last three, four years,\n\n1827\n01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:48,700\nwith the advent of virtualization and\nvirtualization technologies-\n\n1828\n01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:49,770\n>> Made it a lot easier to do.\n\n1829\n01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:50,820\nA lot easier to do right.\n\n1830\n01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:54,466\nSo when you can see Sandbox is really\ntaking off is when virtualization down in\n\n1831\n01:21:54,466 --> 01:21:57,810\nthe desktop really becomes realistic for\nthe average consumer.\n\n1832\n01:21:57,810 --> 01:22:02,740\nAnd so when we had virtual PC and\nWindows XP, for instance, and\n\n1833\n01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:05,991\nwhen we had things like Virtual Box,\nkind of the open source Oracle,\n\n1834\n01:22:05,991 --> 01:22:10,320\nSun Java Oracle version of\nVirtual PC that runs on anything.\n\n1835\n01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,715\nYou have VMware Workstation.\n\n1836\n01:22:11,715 --> 01:22:13,940\nThese products all kind\nof became ubiquitous, and\n\n1837\n01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:18,380\neverybody was able to use them, we start\nto see this idea of sandboxing taking off.\n\n1838\n01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:21,330\nSo, it's not like it was\nfive years ago to the day.\n\n1839\n01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:25,360\nI mean, you had sandboxes, people were\nbuilding sandboxes for a long time.\n\n1840\n01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,561\nBut they were,\nphysical is a lot harder to do.\n\n1841\n01:22:28,561 --> 01:22:29,770\nThey were very limited.\n\n1842\n01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:31,470\nYou couldn't really get access to them.\n\n1843\n01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:34,560\nNow with virtualization,\nportability comes in.\n\n1844\n01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:36,910\nYou can take the sandbox with you\nanywhere you go so literally,\n\n1845\n01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:41,790\nyou can carry it with you on your laptop,\nI run them on my Windows 8 tablet, for\n\n1846\n01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:46,320\ninstance, cuz I run client-side Hyper-V,\nso I can run sandboxed\n\n1847\n01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,580\nenvironments right there on my tablet and\nwork with them in real time.\n\n1848\n01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:52,790\nSo even if I'm traveling on a plane or\nsomething and I gotta do some work for\n\n1849\n01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:56,370\na client or maybe just look at something,\nI can spin something up and\n\n1850\n01:22:56,370 --> 01:22:59,350\nI can have a full LAN infrastructure.\n\n1851\n01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:00,330\nI got everything there.\n\n1852\n01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:03,410\nI got mail servers,\ndirectory servers, database servers,\n\n1853\n01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:06,330\nall that stuff all virtualized so I can\njust simply bring it up in real-time.\n\n1854\n01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:07,480\nSo it is kind of cool right?\n\n1855\n01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:08,550\nIt's also fun at parties.\n\n1856\n01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:09,230\n>> Yes.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1857\n01:23:09,230 --> 01:23:10,730\n>> You're like the life of the party.\n\n1858\n01:23:10,730 --> 01:23:11,700\nLook!\n\n1859\n01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:13,874\n>> Look,\nI've got an exchange server on my tablet.\n\n1860\n01:23:13,874 --> 01:23:14,768\n>> How awesome is that?\n\n1861\n01:23:14,768 --> 01:23:16,710\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Those are the kind of parties you\n\n1862\n01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:18,180\ndon't want to go to, by the way.\n\n1863\n01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:20,660\nIn case you were wondering, right?\n\n1864\n01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:21,290\nStay away.\n\n1865\n01:23:21,290 --> 01:23:23,820\nStay far, far away.\n\n1866\n01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:24,790\nAll right, so ActiveX.\n\n1867\n01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:26,500\nActiveX is a Microsoft again.\n\n1868\n01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,978\nCOM is Microsoft-specific.\n\n1869\n01:23:27,978 --> 01:23:30,470\nActiveX, Microsoft-specific technology,\nas well.\n\n1870\n01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:32,990\nActiveX was kind of Microsoft's\nanswer to Java applets.\n\n1871\n01:23:32,990 --> 01:23:35,950\nIt was really their attempt to come up\nwith a model that would give them that\n\n1872\n01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:39,060\nsame functionality but on their platform.\n\n1873\n01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:42,590\nAnd so although it is certainly used and\nused all the time on their platform,\n\n1874\n01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:45,350\na lot of security issues\npotentially associated with it, but\n\n1875\n01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:47,360\nit is limited to-\n>> Microsoft?\n\n1876\n01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:50,290\n>> Yeah, for the most part.\n\n1877\n01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:53,170\nI mean, most people really don't,\nalthough we talk about the fact that it\n\n1878\n01:23:53,170 --> 01:23:56,550\nis reusable, and\nis programming language independent.\n\n1879\n01:23:56,550 --> 01:23:58,060\nIt is not platform independent.\n\n1880\n01:23:58,060 --> 01:24:00,170\nSo you're not seeing it\nrun on other platforms.\n\n1881\n01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:01,755\nIt is unique to Microsoft.\n\n1882\n01:24:01,755 --> 01:24:05,435\nBut it creates reusable functional\nelements that could be basically ported to\n\n1883\n01:24:05,435 --> 01:24:09,520\nother Microsoft software elements, so you\ncan bring ActiveX in in different places.\n\n1884\n01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,456\nAnd then Authenticode,\nthis idea of code signing,\n\n1885\n01:24:12,456 --> 01:24:15,660\nwhich basically allows us to\ndigitally sign software and\n\n1886\n01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:19,612\nvalidate that it has authenticity and\nintegrity associated with it.\n\n1887\n01:24:19,612 --> 01:24:22,040\nIt's a guarantee the code has not\nbeen altered, in other words.\n\n1888\n01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:26,151\nAgain, Microsoft-specific,Authenticode\nis Microsoft's implementation for\n\n1889\n01:24:26,151 --> 01:24:27,250\ncode signing.\n\n1890\n01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:30,802\nSo ActiveX, Authenticode and\nCOM are Microsoft-specific or\n\n1891\n01:24:30,802 --> 01:24:32,950\nMicrosoft-related technologies.\n\n1892\n01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:34,550\nThey created these.\n\n1893\n01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:37,130\nUnlike all the other things that\npeople claim they created but didn't.\n\n1894\n01:24:37,130 --> 01:24:39,150\nThey did not create the Internet.\n\n1895\n01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:40,800\nThat was Al Gore, in case you missed that.\n\n1896\n01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:41,610\n>> That was Al, exactly.\n\n1897\n01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,040\n>> They did not create DNS.\n\n1898\n01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,920\nThey did not create DHCP.\n\n1899\n01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:48,660\nRight, in case you were wondering, they\ndidn't create LDAP, they just used it and\n\n1900\n01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:51,320\nbranded it in relation\nto Active Directory.\n\n1901\n01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,400\nDidn't create Kerberos,\neven though they use it.\n\n1902\n01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:56,270\n>> Just well-known implementations of the-\n>> Just the fact that they're very\n\n1903\n01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:58,550\ngood at marketing so\nas a result people think of that.\n\n1904\n01:24:58,550 --> 01:25:00,480\nThey didn't create databases, by the way.\n\n1905\n01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:05,048\nMicrosoft SQL, right, is just built\non the concept of using the SQL,\n\n1906\n01:25:05,048 --> 01:25:08,853\nthe structured query language\nto market their database.\n\n1907\n01:25:08,853 --> 01:25:11,603\nBut it is not that they created\ndatabases in and of themselves.\n\n1908\n01:25:11,603 --> 01:25:13,103\n>> [CROSSTALK] naming convention for\ntheir database software.\n\n1909\n01:25:13,103 --> 01:25:14,150\n>> They're just good marketers.\n\n1910\n01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,490\nThem and Madonna, right?\n\n1911\n01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:19,270\nThem and Madonna,\nmarketing machines that they are.\n\n1912\n01:25:19,270 --> 01:25:22,950\nAll right, so we've probably come to\nanother really good point to take a break.\n\n1913\n01:25:22,950 --> 01:25:26,210\n>> Yeah, I think so, so we'll go ahead and\nwrap things up for this episode,\n\n1914\n01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:28,462\nI hope you guys

ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,240\nAnd our Part Two of our\nSoftware Development Security Episode, and\n\n5\n00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,240\nI'm Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n6\n00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,270\nHow are you doing, Adam?\n\n7\n00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,310\n>> I'm doing good, I'm doing awesome.\n\n8\n00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,220\n>> Awesome now.\nWe had to go get some caffeine there,\n\n9\n00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,560\nand I think we're all squared away.\n\n10\n00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,470\n>> A triple shot will cure what ails you.\n\n11\n00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:53,990\n>> That's it.\n\n12\n00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,540\nSo we're gonna dive back into some\nsoftware development security.\n\n13\n00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,450\n>> All right.\n\n14\n00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,200\nOle, ole.\n\n15\n00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,970\n>> Ole, ole.\n>> So, let's talk a little bit more about\n\n16\n00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,630\nsoftware development, and\nsoftware security related to development.\n\n17\n00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,170\nWe've been speaking about, in our last\nshow, in all the episodes that we had gone\n\n18\n00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,750\nthrough and talking to you about\nkind of setting up the frameworks.\n\n19\n00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,740\nWhat are they,\nwhat are the building blocks?\n\n20\n00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,990\nHow do we think about security,\n\n21\n00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,570\nwhat are those components, what's a system\ndevelopment life cycle look like?\n\n22\n00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,334\nWhat does a software development life\ncycle look like, and compared and\n\n23\n00:01:26,334 --> 00:01:27,510\ncontrasted the two a little bit.\n\n24\n00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,562\nNow what we want to do is we want to spend\nsome time talking about some of the very\n\n25\n00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:31,599\nspecific threats.\n\n26\n00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,335\n[COUGH] Excuse me as I do my Kermit\nthe Frog imitation there for a second.\n\n27\n00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:37,375\nHalf Beaker, half Kermit the Frog.\n\n28\n00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,325\nWhat are some of the specific\nthreats that we wanna see, or\n\n29\n00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:41,935\nthat we wanna address and be aware of?\n\n30\n00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,745\nSpecifically, in this case,\nin web environments.\n\n31\n00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:45,015\n>> Right.\n>> So, how are we gonna start thinking\n\n32\n00:01:45,015 --> 00:01:50,245\nabout different areas of our network, or\ndifferent areas where we may run software\n\n33\n00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:54,165\nand the environmental threats of things\nwe're gonna have to address as CISSPs.\n\n34\n00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:59,460\nAwareness of and ability to interact\nwith and ultimately somehow mitigate or\n\n35\n00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,598\nsomehow contain the things\nwe wanna address.\n\n36\n00:02:01,598 --> 00:02:04,050\nSo, when we think about web services and\nthreats for\n\n37\n00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,960\nwebs, specifically, we have kind of\na list that we go through in our mind.\n\n38\n00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,710\nThere's six things we wanna think about.\n\n39\n00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,660\nThings like information gathering.\n\n40\n00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,570\nWanna think about\nadministrative interfaces.\n\n41\n00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,020\nSo we'll talk about these areas and\nsome of the things that go on there.\n\n42\n00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,830\nI wanna talk about authentication and\naccess control.\n\n43\n00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,630\nI wanna talk about input validation.\n\n44\n00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,550\nGot some examples of that.\n\n45\n00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,360\nWe'll talk about some of those things.\n\n46\n00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,390\nParameter validations and\nsession management.\n\n47\n00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,640\nThese are ares that we wanna delve\ninto and make sure we're focused on.\n\n48\n00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,300\nSo information gathering.\n\n49\n00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,630\nRegardless of methodology, we're talking\nabout whether it is a penetration test,\n\n50\n00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,890\nsocial engineering attack.\n\n51\n00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,780\nPerhaps we're just\ngenerically looking to hack.\n\n52\n00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,910\nWe've either talked about\nsome of these already and\n\n53\n00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,070\ndetailed out some of the steps involved.\n\n54\n00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,090\nWe will have a thought process around\nthem as we continue our conversations.\n\n55\n00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,500\nThe idea is that we always start\nout by looking around, right?\n\n56\n00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,870\nWe wanna get some information,\ngather what information is there.\n\n57\n00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,390\nFigure out what's going on and\n\n58\n00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:01,440\nunderstand as a result what we can see and\nmore importantly what's not there, right?\n\n59\n00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:01,990\n>> Right.\nWhat's missing.\n\n60\n00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,930\n>> So we know what is and\nis not available.\n\n61\n00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,520\nYou know they say,\n\n62\n00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,900\nthe hardest part about doing something\nis knowing what you don't know.\n\n63\n00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,480\n>> Right.\n>> And so you figure out what's there,\n\n64\n00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,360\nyou kind of by extension can\ninfer what's not there, and\n\n65\n00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,740\nas an attacker we can then begin to\nunderstand how to build a picture of\n\n66\n00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,820\nthe strengths and\nthe weaknesses in the system.\n\n67\n00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,650\nBecause if we see for\n\n68\n00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,670\ninstance a lot of protocols that indicate\nthings like web services running,\n\n69\n00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,460\nwe're gonna probably have a different\nset of attacks in our mind.\n\n70\n00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,530\nDifferent set of tools we're gonna use,\ndifferent set of vulnerabilities\n\n71\n00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,790\nwe may want to look for\nthen if we are not seeing web services.\n\n72\n00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,160\nBecause web services indicate\nthings like server side includes,\n\n73\n00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,040\nas we talk about here,\ncross site scripting.\n\n74\n00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,890\nThings like that may be possible, but\n\n75\n00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,920\nnot seeing web services indicates\nthose are just not gonna be realistic.\n\n76\n00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,250\nWe're not gonna be able to\ntake advantage of that.\n\n77\n00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,220\nSo, information gathering,\nusually our first step in the attack or\n\n78\n00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,320\nmethodology here.\n\n79\n00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,320\nWe're going to go out and\nfind information, try to figure out and\n\n80\n00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,960\npaint a general, broad stroke picture\nof what the system looks like.\n\n81\n00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,799\nWhen we're thinking about information\ngathering, you know, the other\n\n82\n00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,513\nthing we want to be thinking about is\nhow are we going to engage in that.\n\n83\n00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:06,819\nWhat are we going to do,\nwhat are the mechanisms?\n\n84\n00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,566\nAnd so I mentioned with web services,\n\n85\n00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:11,295\nwe may look at things like server\nside includes, we may look\n\n86\n00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:14,966\nat things like client-side validation\nto understand what's going on there.\n\n87\n00:04:14,966 --> 00:04:19,456\nSo, server side includes what we\ncall SSIs are really gonna be this\n\n88\n00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:24,790\nidea of being able to go in and if we\nfind web services and interact with it.\n\n89\n00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,730\nAnd the server site scripting\nlanguages that are used for\n\n90\n00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:32,290\nweb based communications are gonna allow\nus, as you can see here, include or\n\n91\n00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,420\nallow us to include the contents of one or\nmore files into a webpage.\n\n92\n00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,590\nWe gather it up and\nwe include it from the server.\n\n93\n00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,505\nWe kind of spool it up.\n\n94\n00:04:38,505 --> 00:04:40,235\nUpload it to the web page send it out.\n\n95\n00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:41,085\nAnd so as a result,\n\n96\n00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:44,945\nweb developers can reuse this content by\ninserting it over and over and over again.\n\n97\n00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:45,795\nSo that's a good thing.\n\n98\n00:04:45,795 --> 00:04:47,175\n>> Absolutely.\nThey don't have to rewrite it for\n\n99\n00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:48,435\nevery single page or anything like that.\n\n100\n00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:50,815\n>> But the bad thing is, you know,\nlike anything else right?\n\n101\n00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,390\nif we kick that can down the road,\nso server side includes can be good\n\n102\n00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,290\nif we are including good content,\nwell-structured, well thought out\n\n103\n00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,390\nobviously appropriate for the content\nthat we're trying to communicate.\n\n104\n00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:03,510\nThe most importantly\nsecurely architechted.\n\n105\n00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,800\nWhat if incorporate bad architecture,\nbad content that is not securely written.\n\n106\n00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,266\nBad code, write bad content [CROSSTALK].\n\n107\n00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:13,596\nSo the idea of garbage in,\n\n108\n00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:17,163\ngarbage out is what we're talking\nabout because if we incorporate and\n\n109\n00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:21,750\npropagate through SSI bad architecture,\nbad elements that are not set up properly.\n\n110\n00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,510\nWe're spreading that everywhere.\n\n111\n00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:28,930\nThe likelihood of tripping across\na badly architected element, an unsafe\n\n112\n00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,460\npiece of code, an unsecure solution,\nin one page, in one area of the website.\n\n113\n00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,550\nIt's possible, don't get me wrong but\nit's small, right?\n\n114\n00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,530\nWe're talking about finding literally\nthe proverbial needle in a haystack.\n\n115\n00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,740\nBut if we sprinkle that liberally and\nfertilize the ground\n\n116\n00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,912\nwith that bad stuff across\nthe entire website everywhere we go.\n\n117\n00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:52,490\nSo if it's very, very easily found\nbecause we trip across it on every page,\n\n118\n00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,260\nwe look at it, we see it everywhere.\n\n119\n00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,180\nIt's much more likely that hackers are\ngonna find it and take advantage of it.\n\n120\n00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,480\nSo this is the down side\nto this kind of a solution,\n\n121\n00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,450\nbecause the problem is that if we're\npropagating bad code, we unfortunately\n\n122\n00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,800\nas a result, are gonna have a lot of\nopportunity for us to fight fires.\n\n123\n00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,590\nA lot of things are gonna go wrong.\n\n124\n00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,470\nSo, when we think about server side\ninputs, or server side includes,\n\n125\n00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,760\nlet's talk about the client's side,\nand the client side validation.\n\n126\n00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,380\nSo input validation should\nbe done with the client\n\n127\n00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,160\nbefore anything is sent\nback to the server.\n\n128\n00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,020\nSo, in other words, if the client is\nconsuming some sort of web service, or\n\n129\n00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,400\nproviding some sort of data.\n\n130\n00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,029\nIt could be either or because we consume a\nservice but provide input for the service,\n\n131\n00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:33,350\nwe have to do validation to ensure that\nthe information that we are getting and\n\n132\n00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,671\nthe stuff that we are processing\nis going to be valid.\n\n133\n00:06:35,671 --> 00:06:38,465\nWe're not malforming data,\nnothing bad is going on.\n\n134\n00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:43,368\nAnd so, there are some different ways that\nwe can do client-side validation input\n\n135\n00:06:43,368 --> 00:06:46,381\nvalidation as one, path or\ndirectory traversal,\n\n136\n00:06:46,381 --> 00:06:50,161\nthis is an attack that can be\ncarried out if we're not careful and\n\n137\n00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:54,290\nwe're not thinking about the way\ninput validation is done.\n\n138\n00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,250\nSo with a path or directory traversal\nattack, it's sometimes referred to,\n\n139\n00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,480\nas you can see, the dot dot slash attack.\n\n140\n00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,610\nBecause basically what we do\nis we insert the characters.\n\n141\n00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,360\nThe dots the periods there that I put\nin the quotes and the back slash or\n\n142\n00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,950\nthe forward slash for the directory.\n\n143\n00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:14,210\nInto a URL in order to effectively use\nthe web browser like a file explorer and\n\n144\n00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,160\nwalk through, navigate through,\nthat file structure.\n\n145\n00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,550\nBecause if you think about\nwhat a web server is,\n\n146\n00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,330\nat the end of the day it is nothing\nmore than a filing cabinet that has to\n\n147\n00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,140\nbasically just has a web enabled\ninterface on the front end.\n\n148\n00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,670\n>> And I know they get a scripts\nfolder that has scripts enabled on it.\n\n149\n00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,010\nSo if I can try to get traversed into that\none, that's always a good place to get to.\n\n150\n00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,480\n>> Sure, cuz you could find potentially a\nlot of tools that can open up all sorts of\n\n151\n00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,740\ncans of worms for you there.\n\n152\n00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,110\nBut also a lot of information.\n\n153\n00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,570\nBut we could traverse not\njust into the scripts folder.\n\n154\n00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,230\nThat's a very good place to start.\n\n155\n00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,340\nBut from there we wanna obviously break\nout go in all sorts of other places.\n\n156\n00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,810\nSo you know, maybe look at webroot.\n\n157\n00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,460\nSo www.root.\nWe wanna get in and\n\n158\n00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:53,270\nlook at some of the sub-directories where\nall of our directory files are stored.\n\n159\n00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,375\nAll the content is being rendered there.\n\n160\n00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,750\nIt's being produced there in other words,\nbrought together.\n\n161\n00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,083\nIt's not actually stored there.\n\n162\n00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,792\nRemember we're probably storing\nthat stuff somewhere else.\n\n163\n00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:01,292\n>> In virtual.\n\n164\n00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:05,013\n>> But we're calling it But the idea\nis if we could reverse the pathways and\n\n165\n00:08:05,013 --> 00:08:08,400\nfigure out what the virtual\ndirectory structure looks like.\n\n166\n00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,010\nWe could find the redirect to\nsee where that data is stored.\n\n167\n00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,080\nWe can also manipulate the code that's\nactually living in the virtual directory's\n\n168\n00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,690\nto actually render the pages.\n\n169\n00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,170\nSo may be able to insert\nour own attack code.\n\n170\n00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,040\nInto the web pages.\n\n171\n00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,320\nWe hear about these things\nlike iFrame attacks.\n\n172\n00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,660\nWhere a frame opens but\n\n173\n00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,730\nit's totally invisible to you because\nit opens a zero by zero frame.\n\n174\n00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,840\nSo in effect it's running in\nthe background of the page but\n\n175\n00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,210\nyou don't see it and so we can then insert\nthings like applets, active x controls all\n\n176\n00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:36,850\nsorts of stuff because once we have a\nlittle window of functionality open we can\n\n177\n00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,230\ndo just about anything in there and so\nwe can effectively manipulate the entire\n\n178\n00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,450\nstructure of the web server during\nan attack like this if we're not careful.\n\n179\n00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,950\nSo this is obviously going to be very,\nvery problematic.\n\n180\n00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,390\nUnicode encoding, our next attack or\nour next vector there.\n\n181\n00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,820\nWe can use unicode which effectively is\ngoing to allow us to do the trajectory.\n\n182\n00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,760\nThe directory traversal just like we were\ntalking about a minute ago where we're\n\n183\n00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,190\nthinking of this other kind of attack,\nwhere we can walk through the path, but\n\n184\n00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,090\nwe can do it without having to add\nin the forward slashes, right.\n\n185\n00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,610\nSo in other words,\nwe can do the same thing, but\n\n186\n00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,560\nwe use the Unicode representation for\nthat character.\n\n187\n00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,920\nSo you'll see I put in three\nrepresentations there percent C1,\n\n188\n00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,330\npercent 1C, percent C0, percent 9V and\npercent C0, percent AF.\n\n189\n00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,240\nThese are the Unicode character\nequivalents of the forward slash for\n\n190\n00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,490\nthe directory path.\n\n191\n00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,830\nSo, as a result,\nwe don't have to do the dot,\n\n192\n00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,870\ndot slash attack we could\nsimply do Unicode encoding.\n\n193\n00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,540\nSo, in the URL we stick in\nthe Unicode character sting\n\n194\n00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,310\nbecause what has happened\nis we've got smart.\n\n195\n00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,270\nWe realize that the dot dot\nslash attacks are happening.\n\n196\n00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,872\nSo now we have smart filters inside\nof web browsers that look at this and\n\n197\n00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:47,320\ngo, \"Well../something,\nsomething, somethingxpx.net or\n\n198\n00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,670\n.aspx well specs whatever.\n\n199\n00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,060\nKnow that's not a proper string right?\n\n200\n00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,060\nYou know Url shouldn't have that in there\nso smart filter will basically drop that\n\n201\n00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,530\nand not allow that to effectively\nbe parsed by the web browser.\n\n202\n00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:05,220\nBut, the Unicode and coding system is\nnot easily filtered out the same way,\n\n203\n00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,500\nbecause these Unicode characters, are\nactually legitimate and should be there.\n\n204\n00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,040\n>> Absolutely yeah.\n>> But\n\n205\n00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,140\nthey should only be\nthere in certain cases.\n\n206\n00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,730\n>> Typically,\n>> So,\n\n207\n00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,721\n>> It's going to allow to interpret those\n\n208\n00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:14,319\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> It's going to interpret those prob,\n\n209\n00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:15,330\nmore often than acronyms.\n\n210\n00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,190\nCorrectly because we're going to see,\nthe browser is going to see them\n\n211\n00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,140\nas being legitimate as opposed to dot,\ndot directory, which is typically not.\n\n212\n00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,455\nAnd then,\nthere's also URL encoding that percent,\n\n213\n00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:29,000\n20% there equals a space because what\nwe often find in web browsers is.\n\n214\n00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,530\nNot often, we find it,\nit's just a hard coated rule but,\n\n215\n00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,100\nwe often see it if we look for it, is\nprobably the better way of putting that is\n\n216\n00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,020\nspaces and URLs are not rendered as\nspaces because the character set.\n\n217\n00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,880\nFor a space is not a space.\n\n218\n00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,233\nIt is represented as the characters %20%.\n\n219\n00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:48,575\nAnd so as a result of that, what we see\nis when you put spaces in URL's, right?\n\n220\n00:10:48,575 --> 00:10:51,260\nThedogisblue.com.\n\n221\n00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,450\nIf there's spaces,\nyou'll the%20%dog%20% all the way across.\n\n222\n00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,170\nYou see this when we save files on.\n\n223\n00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,880\nEnterprise content management systems are\nweb enabled like SharePoint or Websense.\n\n224\n00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,800\nOr not Websense, WebSphere.\n\n225\n00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,700\n>> Right.\n\n226\n00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,270\n>> So if we use either SharePoint or\nWebSphere and\n\n227\n00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:14,350\nwe put a file up into a library or\nwe name a library with spaces.\n\n228\n00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,350\nWe're going to see the spaces\n>> Up in that URL.\n\n229\n00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,320\n>> in the filename.\n\n230\n00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,320\nSo what we often do as a trick is,\nyou name the library with no spaces.\n\n231\n00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,900\nThen you go back and fix it after the fact\nbecause then the descriptive tag will have\n\n232\n00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,290\nthe spaces but the URL will not.\n\n233\n00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:26,910\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n234\n00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,520\n>> So\nthere's all these ways to manipulate this.\n\n235\n00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,160\nWe can have all these things we do and\nso we often use\n\n236\n00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,830\nunderscores instead of spaces because\nunderscores are rendered as underscores.\n\n237\n00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,850\nDashes are rendered as dashes.\n\n238\n00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,000\nThey represent to us a break of space,\nbut to the system and\n\n239\n00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,920\nunit coding and how we set it up, they\ndon't go to these alternate characters.\n\n240\n00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,330\nSo lots of ways to trick the system into\ndoing this, but at the end of the day,\n\n241\n00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,830\nthese attacks, a knowledge of ways\nthese are rendered can lead to attacks.\n\n242\n00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,210\nAre very important to be aware of because\nwhat can happen is if you're not paying\n\n243\n00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,682\nattention to this, if the URL's are not\ndesigned to take this into account you're\n\n244\n00:11:59,682 --> 00:12:04,610\ngoing to get all sorts of random stuff\ninserted there to try to take this on and\n\n245\n00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,130\nbreak the system in effect, return\ncontent that we're not supposed to see.\n\n246\n00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,210\nSo it is like a buffer\noverflow in effect almost but\n\n247\n00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,590\nit's a web based buffer\noverflow against these systems.\n\n248\n00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,110\nSo it's very important\nto be aware of that.\n\n249\n00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:14,900\nAll right.\n\n250\n00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,999\nSo we have all of these.\n\n251\n00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,150\nWe also have this idea I mention a minute\nof two ago of XSS or cross site scripting.\n\n252\n00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,972\nAnother way we could attack a system.\n\n253\n00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:27,140\nWere basically go in and where we find\nvulnerability on websites that allow\n\n254\n00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,030\nattackers to do what I just described.\n\n255\n00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,340\nInject this malicious\ncode into the web app.\n\n256\n00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,780\n>> Right.\n>> And so there's three different\n\n257\n00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,820\nways we see XSS\nvulnerabilities taking place.\n\n258\n00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,720\nWe have none persistent\nXSS vulnerabilities\n\n259\n00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,690\nare what are referred to as\nreflective vulnerabilities.\n\n260\n00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,056\nThese are occur when\nan attacker tricks the victim.\n\n261\n00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:48,840\nTricks the end user into processing this\nURL that has the script step up in it so\n\n262\n00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,290\nhe can steal the information.\n\n263\n00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:52,890\nThe cookies, the session ID's,\nwhatever it is.\n\n264\n00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,350\nAnd the idea there is that\nif we could exploit this,\n\n265\n00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,300\nwe basically can go ahead and\n\n266\n00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,160\nget around allot of the output validation\nthat's taking place on these sites.\n\n267\n00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,310\nBecause now we have the exact content,\n\n268\n00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,150\nthe exact validation metric\nthat the site is suspecting.\n\n269\n00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,080\nSo when the site says\nhey Mike who are you?\n\n270\n00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,050\nAnd you show up with your cookie,\n\n271\n00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,820\nI'm effectively now Mike\nbecause the site doesn't know.\n\n272\n00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,750\nSo I'm masquerading in real time.\n\n273\n00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,120\nBut we're doing this through an accesses\nacross type scripting attack.\n\n274\n00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,920\nSo this idea of non persistent\naccesses vulnerabilities or\n\n275\n00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,920\nwhat we call reflected vulnerabilities.\n\n276\n00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,850\nSpeaks to this.\n\n277\n00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,260\nPersistent XSS vulnerabilities,\ndown there.\n\n278\n00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:29,680\nThe idea here.\n\n279\n00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,140\nThis is also referred to sometimes as\na stored or second order vulnerability.\n\n280\n00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,040\nThese are targeted at websites\nthat allow users to input data.\n\n281\n00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,550\nWhich is stored off,\nas we said, in a database.\n\n282\n00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,890\nVirtual directory\nredirects there typically.\n\n283\n00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,780\nAnd so, as a result of that,\nanywhere it is, guest books,\n\n284\n00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,930\nforms, a whole bunch of\nplaces we could put this.\n\n285\n00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,010\nWe basically post text in there that has\nmalicious script of some kind and, in\n\n286\n00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,400\nother words, when somebody goes and views\nit later, effectively the script executes.\n\n287\n00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,800\nAnd as a result bad things happen, right?\n\n288\n00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,030\nBad things happen to good\npeople as we say, right?\n\n289\n00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,720\nAlthough if they're\ngoing into these places,\n\n290\n00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,770\nobviously not implying that anything would\nbe wrong with going to see a website.\n\n291\n00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,970\nBut the idea would be generically,\nyou may not be aware of this.\n\n292\n00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:11,270\nThe downside of these things are we talk\nabout well, if you're just educated.\n\n293\n00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,790\nI mean, I harp on that all\nthe time in discussions in CISSP.\n\n294\n00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,580\nIf there's awareness.\n\n295\n00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,160\nIf we just do a good job\neducating our end users.\n\n296\n00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,400\nPeople will know.\n\n297\n00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,550\nThe reality of this kind of\nattack is people don't know.\n\n298\n00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,190\nEven if you look at the website and\nyou go look at a post.\n\n299\n00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,710\nYou go look at some sort of a blog entry,\nyou do something.\n\n300\n00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,150\nYou're reading a post,\nyou respond to it, whatever it is.\n\n301\n00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,980\nUnless you're a trained developer and\nyou understand what you're\n\n302\n00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,220\nlooking at when you're looking\nat when you see this raw code.\n\n303\n00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,730\nIt may not mean anything to you.\n\n304\n00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,150\nYou just may be looking right at it,\nbut not see it.\n\n305\n00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,350\nAnd as a result of that,\nthat really can be problematic,\n\n306\n00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,280\nso awareness is important, but\nsometimes awareness is not enough.\n\n307\n00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,229\nThat is the downside,\nawareness may not be enough.\n\n308\n00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,290\nAnd then we have the third kind of XSS\nvulnerability or attack which we'll refer\n\n309\n00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,140\nto as DOM, so we have COM and we have DOM,\nright, the OM brothers, COM and DOM right.\n\n310\n00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,880\n>> The OM brothers, nice.\n\n311\n00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,260\n>> So we have component object\nmodel from Microsoft and\n\n312\n00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,070\nwe now have the document object model.\n\n313\n00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:06,230\nThis one is not from Microsoft,\nspecifically, let's just be clear,\n\n314\n00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,260\nit's just the way we talk about this.\n\n315\n00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,140\nBut the idea's here, another document\nobject model, or another XSS vulnerability\n\n316\n00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:16,620\nhas basically refered to,\nnormally as local cross site scripting.\n\n317\n00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,560\nWe call this local because\nit happens right there.\n\n318\n00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,660\nThis is the way we represent a layout.\n\n319\n00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,430\nHTML and XHTML within the browser.\n\n320\n00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,960\nThis Document Object Model,\nthat's what DOM represents.\n\n321\n00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,830\nBut, the idea here is that\nthe document components.\n\n322\n00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,540\nI mentioned this earlier.\n\n323\n00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,320\nWe might see an iFrame exploit where\nwe have just a small frame opened up.\n\n324\n00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,960\nWe have then code running in their\nelements running in there that\n\n325\n00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,290\nare effectively poisoned and\nsomebody touches them and book their done.\n\n326\n00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,920\nSo the way we do this is we manipulate\nthe layout of the HTML the underlying XLMO\n\n327\n00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,470\ncode and we manipulate the forms and\nthe features on the page.\n\n328\n00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,250\nAnd so we use the DOM environment to\nmodify the client side JavaScript, and\n\n329\n00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,250\nas a result we execute alternate script.\n\n330\n00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,933\nIn fact we swap in the attack script for\n\n331\n00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:56,042\nwhatever the script would\nhave been normally.\n\n332\n00:15:56,042 --> 00:16:00,146\nSo when they go click in a field to put in\ninformation, or they click on a button or\n\n333\n00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:03,544\nsome kind, you know have these\nFunctional buttons like submit.\n\n334\n00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:07,309\nSo maybe the way this often happens is\nthey have you fill out a fake survey,\n\n335\n00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:10,405\nyou go to hit submit,\nthe submit button is the land mine, and\n\n336\n00:16:10,405 --> 00:16:12,320\nit triggers the attack code.\n\n337\n00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,581\nSo, you don't realize it because you\nhit submit and nothing happens, and\n\n338\n00:16:15,581 --> 00:16:16,269\nwhat do you do?\n\n339\n00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:17,276\nClick submit, submit, submit, submit.\n\n340\n00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:17,929\n>> Hit it three more times.\n\n341\n00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:20,400\n>> Right, I want my free t-shirt,\nwhat's going on, and\n\n342\n00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,360\nyou've now basically just infected\nyour machine and blown it up.\n\n343\n00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,790\nIt’s very insidious right?\n\n344\n00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,790\nVery insidious.\n>> Absolutely.\n\n345\n00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,300\n>> We could potentially see a lot\nof difficulty happening here.\n\n346\n00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,100\nWe call this the bait and switch sometimes\nwhere we're giving you one thing, so\n\n347\n00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,710\nwe're giving you the idea of\ngetting a free t-shirt or\n\n348\n00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,250\nwhatever, and then we hit you with\nthe attack code when you go to submit it.\n\n349\n00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,140\nSo you got to be really careful.\n\n350\n00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,190\n>> We’re giving you something all right,\nyeah.\n\n351\n00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,030\n>> Oh yeah we're giving you something\nall right absolutely correct.\n\n352\n00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,872\nWe are.\nAll right, so\n\n353\n00:16:41,872 --> 00:16:44,110\nsome additional things to consider here.\n\n354\n00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,110\nWe have parameter validation,\nweb proxy, replay attack.\n\n355\n00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,230\nJust some other areas, some other\nkinds of attacks we wanna be aware of.\n\n356\n00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,130\nThis idea of parameter validation,\nit's just like boundary checking, right?\n\n357\n00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,210\n>> Yes.\n>> We wanna understand what's going on,\n\n358\n00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,560\nthe values being received have to\nbe validated within the parameters.\n\n359\n00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,950\nThe limits of whatever that\nparticular input mechanism is.\n\n360\n00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,980\nBefore we allow the server\nto process them.\n\n361\n00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,620\nSo, if we said hey, we have a text box.\n\n362\n00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,070\nWe're supposed to get free-form text,\nalphanumeric input, and\n\n363\n00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:12,840\nmaybe no special characters.\n\n364\n00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,610\nAnd as a result of that, it should be\nno more than 25 characters in length.\n\n365\n00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,950\nThen parameter validation\nwould be to check that stream,\n\n366\n00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,190\nmake sure it's not longer\nthan 25 characters.\n\n367\n00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,920\nIt is only alpha and numeric input.\n\n368\n00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,540\nNo special characters allowed.\n\n369\n00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,170\nAnd if we get any of that\nrandomness in there in effectively\n\n370\n00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,300\nthrow out that parameter.\n\n371\n00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,520\nWe throw it out because it's gonna garbage\nup the processing on the back end.\n\n372\n00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,450\nSo it could be one of those dot dot\ndash attacks that's taking place.\n\n373\n00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,220\nThat kind of thing.\n\n374\n00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,985\nYou know that stuff would not be there.\n\n375\n00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:42,580\nUnicode translation of the slash for\nthe dot dot slash\n\n376\n00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,440\nwould also be thrown out because no\nspecial characters would be allowed.\n\n377\n00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,890\nSo that kind of thing would block,\n\n378\n00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,330\nparameter validation, would block those\nkind of traversal attacks, as an example.\n\n379\n00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,360\nWeb proxies are really just the idea\nof being able to use software,\n\n380\n00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,780\ntypically, to be able to go out and\neffectively go and resolve for somebody.\n\n381\n00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,510\nSo the first time somebody asks for\na webpage, go find it for\n\n382\n00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,040\nthem, bring it back.\n\n383\n00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,210\nCache that resolution locally in the\ndevice or in the software, so the next 20,\n\n384\n00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,760\n30, 40, 100 times somebody comes and\nasks for it, we speed up.\n\n385\n00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,260\nWe're able to give it\nto them much quicker.\n\n386\n00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,690\nA lot of these can go out and\ncache, the web proxies go out and\n\n387\n00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,200\nhit the cache, and upload or\nrefresh it every so often.\n\n388\n00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,160\nSo what'll happen is,\nthey have this list of maybe 20,\n\n389\n00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,360\n30 sites that are constantly being used.\n\n390\n00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,930\nThey'll go out and every 20 minutes\ngo out and hit the site and\n\n391\n00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,320\npull down the latest content.\n\n392\n00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,310\nCache literally the entire site or the\nfirst level of the site in the device, and\n\n393\n00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:35,340\nserve it up directly internally on\nthe LAN to people that want it.\n\n394\n00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,220\nSo it's much, much quicker than\ngoing out and rendering it.\n\n395\n00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,790\nAnd [COUGH] replay attack, this is where\nbasically somebody will capture traffic,\n\n396\n00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,680\nthe attacker will capture traffic.\n\n397\n00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,170\nSo typically we will have a man in the\nmiddle attacked that's paired with this.\n\n398\n00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,490\nSo a man in the middle attack,\n\n399\n00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:53,480\nwe begin by basically inserting\nourselves into the stream, and so\n\n400\n00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,420\nas a result we're able to get everything\nthat's going on, we're monitoring that.\n\n401\n00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,520\nWe'll record all that so\nthat part's the passive attack.\n\n402\n00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,910\nWe'll then use that and\nreplay it back into the session.\n\n403\n00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,520\nAs a result of trying to do that,\nwe're hoping to masquerade effectively as\n\n404\n00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,910\nan authenticated user and take over that\nsession and or somehow modify it after\n\n405\n00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,500\nthe session has been done by spinning it\nback up again, effectively starting it up.\n\n406\n00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,180\nYou know, I mentioned that Google for\ninstance, and\n\n407\n00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,660\nwe're not picking on Google by saying\nthis by the way, but you know for\n\n408\n00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,210\ninstance Gmail may be susceptible to this\nbecause if you don't log out of your\n\n409\n00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,240\nsystem and log out of Gmail in the right\nway it caches your credentials,\n\n410\n00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,540\ncaches the session.\n\n411\n00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:31,920\nAnd you can effectively open\nthe web browser back up and\n\n412\n00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,670\nbring Gmail back up if it\nwasn't closed properly.\n\n413\n00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,530\n>> As long as your already logged in.\n\n414\n00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,700\n>> As long, but\nwe want to be clear, right.\n\n415\n00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,860\nYou gotta stay logged on in the system,\nstay logged in as the user,\n\n416\n00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,060\nnot have exited that session\nproperly by closing it out.\n\n417\n00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,330\nYou know not just close the window and\n\n418\n00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,510\nleave the session, but\neffectively log out.\n\n419\n00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,150\nIf you don't log out then you can\neffectively log back into Gmail.\n\n420\n00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:53,180\nSo if you walked up to my machine,\nand brought back up a web browser and\n\n421\n00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,540\nhit the Gmail link from Google's homepage,\n\n422\n00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,630\nit would load my session if I\nhad not done that properly.\n\n423\n00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,620\nThat's not quite the same thing as\na replay attack, I wanna be clear.\n\n424\n00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,510\nBut, the conceptual idea is the same.\n\n425\n00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:10,170\nThe idea that we can use that credential\nto effectively re-access that session,\n\n426\n00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,290\nspin it up, continue it.\n\n427\n00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,900\nEven though we're not that user\nis what a replay talks all about.\n\n428\n00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,790\nAnd so Gmail does suffer from this,\nyou can do this,\n\n429\n00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,228\nI demonstrate this when I do this all the\ntime when I do security demonstrations.\n\n430\n00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:25,190\nNow again, wanna be clear,\nnot picking on Google saying it's good or\n\n431\n00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,410\nbad, just pointing out that it does\nhappen to be even and to be fair.\n\n432\n00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,460\nIf you log out the way you're supposed\nto and you follow instructions this\n\n433\n00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,156\ndoes not happen, and it only happens for a\nperiod of time, by the way, on this page.\n\n434\n00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:38,760\nBecause of the session, it does.\n\n435\n00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,910\nSo you can bring it back up, but the idea\nis because of the cookies that are stored,\n\n436\n00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,230\nand because of that fact that you're\nstill logged in as that user.\n\n437\n00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,480\nYou haven't changed\nthe parameters of that session,\n\n438\n00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,450\nit will effectively allow you back in\nwithout asking you to authenticate.\n\n439\n00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,940\nSo this can be a replay attack.\n\n440\n00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,240\n>> Yeah, and it's a good thing, right?\n\n441\n00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,966\nI mean if by browser accidentally closed\nor something like that it allows me to get\n\n442\n00:20:55,966 --> 00:20:57,136\nback in instead of-\n>> No, you're just being lazy.\n\n443\n00:20:57,136 --> 00:21:02,580\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just being lazy, it's not a good thing.\n\n444\n00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,370\nJust being lazy is what it is.\n\n445\n00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,400\nIt's a bad thing, right.\n\n446\n00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,230\nWe know what happens when we are lazy,\nbad things happen.\n\n447\n00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,480\n>> Bad things happen.\n\n448\n00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,470\n>> So that's the key there,\nI want to make sure we are aware of that.\n\n449\n00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,020\nAll right, so\nwe've talked about some of the attacks,\n\n450\n00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:17,020\nlet's talk about some databases,\ndatabase management software.\n\n451\n00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,874\nNo good security design solution,\n\n452\n00:21:18,874 --> 00:21:22,336\nno good solution that talks about\nsecurely designing software and\n\n453\n00:21:22,336 --> 00:21:26,253\ndeveloping it would be really complete\nwithout talking about databases.\n\n454\n00:21:26,253 --> 00:21:28,624\nBecause we can do a whole bunch\nof stuff on the front end, but\n\n455\n00:21:28,624 --> 00:21:31,330\nif we don't have secure solutions\non the back end to store our data,\n\n456\n00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,869\nit's going to be a pretty short trip.\n\n457\n00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:34,280\nWe're not going to have\na lot of stuff to do there.\n\n458\n00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,100\n>> These days almost all websites,\nfor example,\n\n459\n00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,325\nare data driven, they need some\nkind of place to store that data.\n\n460\n00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:42,220\n>> Absolutely, no absolutely, because if\nyou think about what we do on websites,\n\n461\n00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,050\nit's really all about typically gathering\ninformation, transacting something.\n\n462\n00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,840\nAs a result, we need a place,\nas you rightly pointed out,\n\n463\n00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,680\nto store all that data.\n\n464\n00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,430\nIt's very important.\n\n465\n00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,880\nSo, databases, let's start by\ntalking about what they are.\n\n466\n00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,050\nLet's maybe define them.\n\n467\n00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,040\nThen we'll move through and have a bunch\nof vocabulary on some of the things that\n\n468\n00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,170\nhappen, and how databases work.\n\n469\n00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,240\nWhat the characteristics are,\nthings like that.\n\n470\n00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,130\nSo a database is basically,\nat the end of the day,\n\n471\n00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,900\nif we just strip it all\ndown to its bare essence,\n\n472\n00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,570\nit's a collection of data stored\nin some sort of meaningful way.\n\n473\n00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,170\nSome sort of logic to it.\n\n474\n00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,650\nIn tables, typically,\nalthough we have relational database,\n\n475\n00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,970\ndifferent ways of looking at that.\n\n476\n00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,870\nIt could be in tables,\nit could be in warehouses, in cubes,\n\n477\n00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,840\nin all sorts of forms.\n\n478\n00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:20,340\nSo it could be tabular data,\nit could be multidimensional data,\n\n479\n00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,370\ndifferent ways of looking at it.\n\n480\n00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,370\nBut at the end of the day it's stored\nin some sort of meaningful way.\n\n481\n00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:27,160\nWe create some sort of map that helps\nus to understand and interact with it.\n\n482\n00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,920\nAnd then as a result we can then access,\nview it, modify it as needed.\n\n483\n00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:36,030\nThis is the working operational starting\ndefinition of what a database is.\n\n484\n00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,440\nSo any type of database,\n\n485\n00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,410\nregardless of what it is, if it has\nmultidimensional data, if there's tabular,\n\n486\n00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,600\nif it's just three items in\na little spreadsheet, nothing big.\n\n487\n00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,910\nWhatever it is It should have\nthe following characteristics.\n\n488\n00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,300\nSo I listed out a bunch here, we just\nwant to make sure we thing about them and\n\n489\n00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,790\nyou know we're kind of aware of\nthem when we notate through them.\n\n490\n00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,558\nSo it should centralize,\n[COUGH] excuse me.\n\n491\n00:22:55,558 --> 00:22:58,120\nIt should centralize all of our data so\n\n492\n00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,370\nit's not held in different\nplaces across the network.\n\n493\n00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,780\nShould not be distributed, or\nrather, should be centralized.\n\n494\n00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,130\nThat should be one place.\n\n495\n00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,150\nMakes it easier to work on,\nmakes it easier to secure,\n\n496\n00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,710\nmakes it easier to transact against\nbecause we can speed up transaction.\n\n497\n00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:14,300\nMakes it easier to back it up, to maintain\nit, to monitor it, to optimize it,\n\n498\n00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,120\nall those things.\n\n499\n00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,660\nIt's obviously very important to\nget all the data in one place.\n\n500\n00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,740\nThat's not to say we shouldn't\nhave copies of it in other places.\n\n501\n00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,500\nBut our working main copy should\nbe in one place altogether so\n\n502\n00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,080\nwe can manage it accordingly.\n\n503\n00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,650\nIt allows for\n\n504\n00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,900\neasier backup procedures obviously,\nprovides transaction persistence.\n\n505\n00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,630\nWe talked about this idea in\none of our earlier discussions\n\n506\n00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,630\nabout the idea that data should\nalways be in the known state.\n\n507\n00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,330\nSo it should go from a known state,\n\n508\n00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:40,050\ntransact through the transaction to\nanother known state and if it's not in\n\n509\n00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,160\nthat known state at the end of\nthe transaction we have to roll it back.\n\n510\n00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,020\nIt can never be in an inconsistent or\nunknown state is what we say.\n\n511\n00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,793\nIt allows for more consistency since all\ndata is held and maintained centrally.\n\n512\n00:23:51,793 --> 00:23:54,959\n>> Should provide for recovery and\nfault tolerance mechanisms, allows for\n\n513\n00:23:54,959 --> 00:23:57,860\nthe sharing of data with\nmultiple users very important.\n\n514\n00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,000\nDatabases do, in other words.\n\n515\n00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,810\nThese are the characteristics\nof databases.\n\n516\n00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:04,645\nAnd it should provide security control\nthat implements things like integrity\n\n517\n00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:07,910\nchecking, access control,\nconfidentiality, availability.\n\n518\n00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,680\nAll these things are part of\nthe structure, the design, and\n\n519\n00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,470\nthe architecture of\na well-formed database.\n\n520\n00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,960\nSo transaction persistence,\nwhat do we mean by that?\n\n521\n00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,840\nI just mentioned this the idea that\ndata should always be in a known state.\n\n522\n00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,230\nShould go from one known state to another.\n\n523\n00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,593\nAnd would carry out transactions,\ntransactions that are durable and\n\n524\n00:24:23,593 --> 00:24:25,520\nreliable, the language we use.\n\n525\n00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,290\nMeaning that at the end of the day\nthe state of the database and\n\n526\n00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:31,920\nthe security in it should\nnever be compromised.\n\n527\n00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,030\nThe integrity always needs to be ensured\nand be there regardless of what we do.\n\n528\n00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,990\nSo the database transaction\nis not durable, and\n\n529\n00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,890\nit is not reliable, we must roll it back.\n\n530\n00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,170\n>> Roll it back.\n>> Because it cannot exist,\n\n531\n00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,460\nbecause the data's in an unknown state and\n\n532\n00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,570\nas a result the data\ncan lead to corruption,\n\n533\n00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:49,210\nor there can be corruption in the data as\na result of it being in an unknown state.\n\n534\n00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,040\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n535\n00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,680\nAnd so let's talk about some\nof the ideas behind databases.\n\n536\n00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,400\nWe have these different database models.\n\n537\n00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,460\nThere are several of them.\n\n538\n00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,420\nPretty important for\nus to be aware of them here.\n\n539\n00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,760\nAs you could see,\nwe have relational databases.\n\n540\n00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:07,045\nWe have hierarchical databases, we have\nnetwork databases, object-oriented and\n\n541\n00:25:07,045 --> 00:25:08,250\nobject-relational.\n\n542\n00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,520\nSo I wanna just quickly give you\na working idea of what each of these are.\n\n543\n00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,503\nRelational databases are gonna\nuse what are known as attributes.\n\n544\n00:25:14,503 --> 00:25:15,830\nAttributes are columns.\n\n545\n00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:20,450\nSo think of a spreadsheet,\nyour column, A, B C, across the top.\n\n546\n00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,260\nColumnar data, as we call it,\nare attributes.\n\n547\n00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,030\nAnd tuples.\n\n548\n00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,610\nTuples are rows.\n\n549\n00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,650\nSo think of the x y axis.\n\n550\n00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,970\nThe column, right, and the row.\n\n551\n00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,288\nThe tuple is the row, the column is the\nattribute in these relational databases.\n\n552\n00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:37,460\nThey use tuples and\nattributes or columns and\n\n553\n00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,560\nrows, to contain or organize information.\n\n554\n00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,090\nAnd we see this as being a tabular data\nmodel relation of databases are tabular,\n\n555\n00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,740\nthey present data in table format,\nthat's what we do.\n\n556\n00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,290\nSo when we use Access,\nit is a relational database.\n\n557\n00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,810\nIf we use Excel on the front end to\nmanage data, and create pivot tables and\n\n558\n00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,500\nthings like that,\nwe are using tabular data models.\n\n559\n00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,290\n>> Right.\n>> Tabular, tabular, listen to me,\n\n560\n00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,350\ntabular data\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n561\n00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,790\n>> We're using table based\n\n562\n00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,590\ndata in a relational format.\n\n563\n00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,690\nTo be able to create pivot tables.\n\n564\n00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:06,550\nThat's another example at just the\noperational end, what we're talking about.\n\n565\n00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,440\nHierarchical databases.\n\n566\n00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,460\nThese combine records and fields related\nin some sort of logical tree structure.\n\n567\n00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,720\nThe structure in which between\nthe data elements are.\n\n568\n00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,420\nWe kinda have a little.\n\n569\n00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,900\n>> Yeah. [CROSSTALK] >> That's okay,\nthat just a.\n\n570\n00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,180\nYou'll clean that up, not a big deal.\n\n571\n00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,450\nIt's just a matter of formatting.\n\n572\n00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,830\nBut basically it's different from\na relational database because we're not\n\n573\n00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,395\nputting it into a table form.\n\n574\n00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:26,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Instead,\n\n575\n00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:28,460\nwhet we're doing is we're\nactually creating a hierarchy.\n\n576\n00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,645\nWhere we have child, parent relationship.\n\n577\n00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:34,230\nSo, this data element has some elements\nbelow it that are gonna be related.\n\n578\n00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,050\nWe could have many children,\none children, or no children.\n\n579\n00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,910\nSo this object could stand by itself.\n\n580\n00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,030\nThis object may have\nmultiple children below.\n\n581\n00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,220\nThis one may only have one.\n\n582\n00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,960\nThat's a different way of looking at it.\n\n583\n00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,660\nAnd so\nthis is what we often see in Ldap models.\n\n584\n00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:49,000\nSo for\ninstance the Active Directory in Windows.\n\n585\n00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,680\nBut more generically any Ldap\nx500 standard based Ldap.\n\n586\n00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:57,210\nDirectory NEL.database is gonna\nbe hierarchical in nature.\n\n587\n00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,380\nIt's probably the most common example of\nwhat a hierarchical database will be.\n\n588\n00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,740\nWe have networking, our network,\nI'm sorry, network databases, right?\n\n589\n00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,440\nWhere we have basically all the elements,\n\n590\n00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,290\neach data element having multiple\nparent and child records.\n\n591\n00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,540\nWe're not talking about network\nin the traditional sense where we\n\n592\n00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,310\nare connecting remotely.\n\n593\n00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,850\nWe're talking about a network almost\nlike a mesh where we're creating\n\n594\n00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,180\nan extended family.\n\n595\n00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,300\nThink of it that way,\nlike a social network,\n\n596\n00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,920\nmaybe that's a good way\nof thinking about it.\n\n597\n00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,710\nIt's the Facebook of databases or\nVine now.\n\n598\n00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,630\nIsn't Vine all the rage?\n\n599\n00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,410\nWe're not doing Facebook anymore?\n\n600\n00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,450\nAll the kids are doing Vine now,\nso it's Vine, right?\n\n601\n00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,630\nOr Twitter.\n\n602\n00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:33,100\n>> Twitter is definitely popular now.\n\n603\n00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,230\n>> Twitter your life away.\n\n604\n00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,010\nEverything you ever wanted to\nknow in 140 characters or less.\n\n605\n00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,180\nIf I could figure out how to speak,\nlike Twitter speak, and\n\n606\n00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,610\nstill deliver all this material and\nteach and everything.\n\n607\n00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,580\nI probably could start a cult and\nhave followers worldwide or\n\n608\n00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,200\nsomething like that.\n\n609\n00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,250\n>> I would join in.\n\n610\n00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:48,895\n>> Think about that.\n\n611\n00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:52,982\nBecause you could just tweet all that\ninformation in 140 character bursts.\n\n612\n00:27:52,982 --> 00:27:53,616\nRight?\n\n613\n00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:56,382\n[COUGH] It's a scary world we live in,\nI'll tell you.\n\n614\n00:27:56,382 --> 00:27:57,300\nSo network.\n\n615\n00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,300\nThe network idea or the network database's\nstructure is like creating this\n\n616\n00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,200\nextended mesh or extended web.\n\n617\n00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,670\nEach element has multiple parent and\nchild records associated with it.\n\n618\n00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,815\nWe have redundant network like structures.\n\n619\n00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:10,475\nSo this is very much like a mesh.\n\n620\n00:28:10,475 --> 00:28:12,225\nIt is overlapping or\n\n621\n00:28:12,225 --> 00:28:16,895\ncreating redundancy by creating\nthese multiple connection points.\n\n622\n00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:20,447\nObject oriented databases\nhandle a variety of data types.\n\n623\n00:28:20,447 --> 00:28:25,102\nSo, databases that are storing,\nbulk storing data in multiple formats or\n\n624\n00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:26,422\nobject oriented.\n\n625\n00:28:26,422 --> 00:28:29,182\nSo when you have images,\naudio, documents, video.\n\n626\n00:28:29,182 --> 00:28:31,032\nSo think of perhaps, for instance iTunes.\n\n627\n00:28:31,032 --> 00:28:35,352\nRight, good example of an object oriented\napplication that uses a back end object\n\n628\n00:28:35,352 --> 00:28:36,482\noriented database.\n\n629\n00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:41,842\nBecause we're storing,\nwe're cataloging video, audio, pictures.\n\n630\n00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:44,470\nWe got all that data sitting\nthere in one form or another.\n\n631\n00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,770\nThis is object oriented.\n\n632\n00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,540\nAnd then we have our last one there.\n\n633\n00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,990\n>> Object relational.\n\n634\n00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,720\n>> Object relational, object relational\nis gonna be a relational database so\n\n635\n00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,540\nlike we were talking about up top,\ntabular and\n\n636\n00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,770\nmodel, right a relational database with\na software front end, front end is dash,\n\n637\n00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,120\nfront end [INAUDIBLE] I think it's like\na dash, front fash end or something.\n\n638\n00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,550\nI think that's probably how we present,\nyeah something like that for\n\n639\n00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,410\nnow looks better.\n\n640\n00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,000\nSo a software based front end that\nis written in an object oriented\n\n641\n00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,160\nprogramming language.\n\n642\n00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,010\nSo, we basically take the idea\nof the relational database,\n\n643\n00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,880\ncombine it with an object oriented\nsolution, have the best of both worlds.\n\n644\n00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,000\nSo, we have the nice front\nend that's object oriented,\n\n645\n00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,520\nwith the tabular relational\ndata model on the back.\n\n646\n00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:26,320\nSo these are gonna be all\nof the different kinds, or\n\n647\n00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,580\nmodels, of databases that we see up there.\n\n648\n00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,430\nThere are these five ones that\nwe really have to be aware of,\n\n649\n00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,680\nand really be thinking about.\n\n650\n00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,830\nAnd if we have a good sense of these,\nsome good understanding of\n\n651\n00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,130\nthe defining characteristics of them,\nwe can look around our world and\n\n652\n00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,860\nsee lots of examples of the different\nkinds of databases that we interact with.\n\n653\n00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,020\nWe talked about for instance\nrelational databases being typically\n\n654\n00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,200\nones we see every day with access,\nmaybe with things like pivot charts and\n\n655\n00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,820\npivot tables in Excel,\nthe traditional way of looking at that.\n\n656\n00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:57,130\nSequel databases are tabular, so they're\ngonna be typically, at least basic ones,\n\n657\n00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,250\nare gonna be relational.\n\n658\n00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,780\nWe may have multidimensional databases,\nwhere we have cubes and things like that,\n\n659\n00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:03,570\nthat are gonna be a different type.\n\n660\n00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,990\nBut in general we see a lot of these.\n\n661\n00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,530\nSee the interaction with them as we go.\n\n662\n00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,110\n>> Very good.\n\n663\n00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,600\n>> That's probably a good place for\nus to take a break.\n\n664\n00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,272\n>> We're gonna go ahead and take a break,\nwe're gonna grab some lunch so\n\n665\n00:30:13,272 --> 00:30:16,140\nyou guys enjoy and we'll see you\nback here in just a little bit.\n\n666\n00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,416\n>> See you in a few.\n\n667\n00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:24,537\n[SOUND].\n\n668\n00:30:24,537 --> 00:30:25,200\nAll right.\n\n669\n00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,070\nWelcome back everybody to our software\ndevelopment security episode.\n\n670\n00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,020\nWe are getting ready to do some more\nfantastic terminology I think to lead us\n\n671\n00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:38,100\ninto some other areas of databases and\nkind of things so let's check it out.\n\n672\n00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,170\n>> All right, very cool so\nlet's continue talking.\n\n673\n00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:42,380\nWe got some additional vocabulary.\n\n674\n00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,900\nAs Mike was saying that\nwe wanna go through here.\n\n675\n00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,940\nWe've been talking about databases.\n\n676\n00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,670\nTalking about how we manage them.\n\n677\n00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,970\nDifferent kinds of databases we may have.\n\n678\n00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:50,870\nHow all that's gonna work.\n\n679\n00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,250\nSome of the component parts.\n\n680\n00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,690\nBuilding blocks, if you will.\n\n681\n00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,260\nThe ability to making up a database.\n\n682\n00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,780\nWe've got this idea of a record, a record\nis just the collection of related data\n\n683\n00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:04,110\nitems that go in other words effectively,\nit is the individual entry of all that\n\n684\n00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,150\ninformation we put in is\nconsidered a record and\n\n685\n00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,345\nwe have multiple records inside\nthe database that make up the table.\n\n686\n00:31:09,345 --> 00:31:11,515\nA file is a collection of\nrecords of the same type.\n\n687\n00:31:11,515 --> 00:31:14,445\nSo when we have a whole bunch of records\nrelating the same type are gonna\n\n688\n00:31:14,445 --> 00:31:15,115\nbe called a file.\n\n689\n00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,735\nWe have a database itself.\n\n690\n00:31:18,735 --> 00:31:19,695\nWe talked about this.\n\n691\n00:31:19,695 --> 00:31:22,050\nCross-reference collection of data.\n\n692\n00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,620\nWe can go through and cross-reference\nthe rows and the columns, so\n\n693\n00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,620\nwe can understand what's in there.\n\n694\n00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:31,390\nAnd we can somehow interact with it,\nmaybe ask questions, do things like that.\n\n695\n00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,970\nA DBMS is short for\ndatabase management system.\n\n696\n00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,190\nSo a database management system\nmanages and controls the database.\n\n697\n00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,000\nThe DBMS is typically the front\nend that users interact with,\n\n698\n00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,075\ngoing to get the data that's in tabular.\n\n699\n00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:44,050\nI keep saying tabular.\n\n700\n00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:44,790\n>> Tabular.\nI like that.\n\n701\n00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,750\n>> I'm going to invent a new word.\n\n702\n00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:51,750\nTabular, table-like,\nand/or multidimensional formats.\n\n703\n00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,875\nSo the DBMS is the front end that actually\nmanages and controls the database.\n\n704\n00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:59,362\nRemember when we talk about interacting\nwith cross-referencing of data,\n\n705\n00:31:59,362 --> 00:32:02,800\nwe talk about tuples and attributes\nlike primary keys, things like that.\n\n706\n00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,490\nSo the tuple there,\na row within a two-dimensional database.\n\n707\n00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,974\nAn attribute, a column as we said\nwithin the two-dimensional database.\n\n708\n00:32:09,974 --> 00:32:12,530\nThe two-dimension is gonna\nbe simply column and row.\n\n709\n00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,550\nSo when we think of traditional table,\nwhen we think about multi dimensional,\n\n710\n00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:20,870\nI've mentioned several times multi\ndimensional databases, or data sets.\n\n711\n00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,675\nThey are going to be in cubes and\n\n712\n00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:25,874\nthey are going to have more\nthan just columns and rows.\n\n713\n00:32:25,874 --> 00:32:27,500\nThey are going to have a lot\nof different dimensions.\n\n714\n00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,209\nWe will define them, set them up,\nmanage them differently.\n\n715\n00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:34,503\nThis is going to be the kinda thing\nthat we think about when we think about\n\n716\n00:32:34,503 --> 00:32:39,170\ntraditional either BI, generically\nbusiness intelligence related data.\n\n717\n00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,350\nBut more specifically big data\nthat we often hear about today\n\n718\n00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:46,409\nis the idea of typically multi dimensional\ndata sets where they're very large,\n\n719\n00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:50,790\nthey live in data warehouses and\nas a result of that, we're gonna have to\n\n720\n00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:53,700\nhave special tools and special\nsolutions in order to manipulate and\n\n721\n00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:56,070\nwork with them\n>> However having said that,\n\n722\n00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,210\nsecurity's still the same.\n\n723\n00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,890\nNo matter how big you get, no matter\nwhat kind of system we have, the basic\n\n724\n00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,760\nconstructs, basic concepts of security\nreally don't change all that much.\n\n725\n00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,540\n>> Confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability.\n\n726\n00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,000\n>> Well we need that, certainly that.\n\n727\n00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,368\nBut we need access control.\n\n728\n00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:12,676\nIt's not going to change no\nmatter how big our dataset is,\n\n729\n00:33:12,676 --> 00:33:14,939\nwhether it's multi-dimensional or\ntwo dimensional,\n\n730\n00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:16,788\nwe still need access\ncontrol on the front end.\n\n731\n00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:21,123\nAnd the DBMS has to be set up in such a\nway to authenticate users, allow ones that\n\n732\n00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:25,064\nbelong there in, keep the ones that\ndon't belong outB We have to have,\n\n733\n00:33:25,064 --> 00:33:29,796\nwhether we apply the data security through\na specific security solution that is built\n\n734\n00:33:29,796 --> 00:33:34,230\nright into the database or re-linked\nto a directory service of some kind.\n\n735\n00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:37,830\nAnd applies security there through\nsome sort of just generic log on or\n\n736\n00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,927\nperhaps a biometric solution or some sort\nof multi, either two or multi factor\n\n737\n00:33:41,927 --> 00:33:46,335\nauthentication process, that comes to us\nthrough some sort of external provider,\n\n738\n00:33:46,335 --> 00:33:48,784\nand then it's applied\nagainst the database.\n\n739\n00:33:48,784 --> 00:33:52,692\nAt the end of the day the DBMS brokers,\nthat conversation helps us to do that,\n\n740\n00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:54,436\nwe still need those basics, and so\n\n741\n00:33:54,436 --> 00:33:58,915\nif we don't have that security built in,\nno matter how good we are at other stuff.\n\n742\n00:33:58,915 --> 00:34:02,410\nIf we don't do the basics up front,\nthen unfortunately our database or\n\n743\n00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:06,620\nstructure of the data within it is, while\nvery valuable, is gonna be unprotected.\n\n744\n00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:08,320\nAnd that can be a problem, obviously.\n\n745\n00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,600\nSo we have a primary key.\n\n746\n00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,630\nIt's a very important concept\nwhen we talk about data.\n\n747\n00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:15,580\nThe primary key is gonna be the columns\nthat make up each row that are unique.\n\n748\n00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,510\nOr each unique row.\n\n749\n00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:20,400\nAnd every row of a table\nmust include a primary key.\n\n750\n00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,705\nSo we have to make sure we have\nprimary keys or unique data,\n\n751\n00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:26,320\nthe individual information that's\nascribed to it as the primary key.\n\n752\n00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,490\nSo view, this is gonna be,\n\n753\n00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,274\nwe've talked about views in\nrelation to Constrained interfaces.\n\n754\n00:34:30,274 --> 00:34:33,260\nA menu could be seen as\nan constrained interface.\n\n755\n00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,840\nA database view can be a constrained\ninterface where we are showing only\n\n756\n00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,740\ncertain parts of the database or\nfiltering it out and\n\n757\n00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,060\nthen allowing stuff to be seen and\nnot allowing other stuff to be seen.\n\n758\n00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,050\nThis is what we call a view.\n\n759\n00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,450\nI would keep subjects from viewing objects\nor subjects from viewing data in effect.\n\n760\n00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,370\nForeign key is gonna be an attribute\nof one table related to the primary key\n\n761\n00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,420\nof another table.\n\n762\n00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:58,030\nSo the primary key in one table is gonna\nbe there to give us a unique identifier.\n\n763\n00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,350\nWhen we link an attribute from\nanother table to that primary key,\n\n764\n00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,495\nit is now a foreign key so\nthat's what we're talking about there.\n\n765\n00:35:04,495 --> 00:35:06,828\nA cell is just an intersection\nof a row and a column.\n\n766\n00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:11,415\nYou'll think of an Excel spreadsheet and\nthink of A1, that is a cell.\n\n767\n00:35:11,415 --> 00:35:13,485\nIt's an intersection of a row and\na column.\n\n768\n00:35:13,485 --> 00:35:15,180\nIt's very, very straight forward.\n\n769\n00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,880\nThe schema is going to define\nthe structure of the database.\n\n770\n00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,740\nThe schema, I often describe\nthe schema when people ask about it,\n\n771\n00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,060\nwe talk about it as being\neffectively like the blue prints.\n\n772\n00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,180\nIt's the architectural diagram or\nthe design document that tells us\n\n773\n00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,800\nhow the database is structured and\nevery database will have a schema,\n\n774\n00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,940\nhas to have one in order to lay it out for\nus to understand what it is.\n\n775\n00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,760\nAnd we think about and we talk about for\n\n776\n00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,150\ninstance the active directory\nin Windows specifically.\n\n777\n00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,020\nWe talk about the AD schema.\n\n778\n00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,400\n>> The blueprints for all the things\nyou can make in active directory.\n\n779\n00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,770\n>> The objects,\nall the object definitions there.\n\n780\n00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:49,130\nWe see that, that's part of the active\ndirectory, the ntds.dit file,\n\n781\n00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:54,910\nwhich is the actual active directory file,\nthe database file if you will.\n\n782\n00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,320\nThe directory information tree,\nwhat the .dit extension stands for.\n\n783\n00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,710\nAnd that schema that lays that out is the\nblueprint effect with how the object map\n\n784\n00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:08,220\nworks inside of the, in this case,\nMicrosoft based Ldap active directory.\n\n785\n00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,290\nData dictionary goes with the schema.\n\n786\n00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,010\nCentral repository of data elements and\ntheir true relationships.\n\n787\n00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:16,340\nThis is where we define all the elements,\nall the different parts of the data, and\n\n788\n00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,508\nhow they're structured and set up.\n\n789\n00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,400\nThe schema and\n\n790\n00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,500\nthe data dictionary together help us\nto understand how to manage our data.\n\n791\n00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,740\nRoll back is where we basically can go\nin and undo what we have just done,\n\n792\n00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,620\nwhatever that may be.\n\n793\n00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,190\nWe talked about this idea and\n\n794\n00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,050\nwe have talked about in some of our prior\ndiscussions of data having to exist,\n\n795\n00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:38,344\nbe in a consistently understood\ndocumented and defined state.\n\n796\n00:36:38,344 --> 00:36:41,250\nSo if data is in some kind of\na standardized state where it's good,\n\n797\n00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:44,570\nwe know the status of it we do\nsome sort of operation on it.\n\n798\n00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,320\nTo transform, we do a ETL and\nextract transformer load, or\n\n799\n00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,110\nbasically bring external\ndata in from another system.\n\n800\n00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,850\nWe're trying to then bring it in,\nscrub it if you will,\n\n801\n00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:58,125\ncreate it in such form that we\ncan import it into our database.\n\n802\n00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,610\nWell we do that if we are not\nable to stabilize that data,\n\n803\n00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:04,420\nput it into a known form when\nthe operations are finished.\n\n804\n00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,580\nWe have to revert back, we have to\nroll back somehow for some reason,\n\n805\n00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,794\nhowever that's occurred.\n\n806\n00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:13,258\nThat data's in an unstandardized or\nsome sort of fluctuating state,\n\n807\n00:37:13,258 --> 00:37:16,050\nwe consider it to be data\nthat's most likely errored.\n\n808\n00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,200\nSo there's something wrong with it.\n\n809\n00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,280\nSo rollback allows us to effectively\npull back those changes,\n\n810\n00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,940\nput the data back to a prior known good\nstate and keep the data consistent.\n\n811\n00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,800\nSo we go back to what we call\nthe previous commit or checkpoint and\n\n812\n00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,800\nwe go back to that.\n\n813\n00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,531\nThis is by the way why when we talk about\nthings like electronic journaling as\n\n814\n00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:34,853\na full tolerance mechanism where we\ncan back up and send this off site\n\n815\n00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:38,371\nto effectively create the opportunity\nto restore if we have a problem.\n\n816\n00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:41,647\nWe could do electronic journaling where\nwe effectively grab the journals,\n\n817\n00:37:41,647 --> 00:37:44,819\nthe transactional logs and the journals\nof the database, back them up and\n\n818\n00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:45,706\nsend them off site.\n\n819\n00:37:45,706 --> 00:37:49,947\nWe don't necessarily need the data because\nwhat [CROSSTALK] we can do is have\n\n820\n00:37:49,947 --> 00:37:51,710\na starting point for the data.\n\n821\n00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:55,244\nWe can do like a full backup and then\nfrom that point we take the journals and\n\n822\n00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:59,126\nwhat we can do is effectively play them\nbackwards and in effect unwind the movie.\n\n823\n00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:01,130\nWatch it backwards and we can go back and\n\n824\n00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,323\nforth to a point in time by simply playing\nthose transactions back into the initial\n\n825\n00:38:05,323 --> 00:38:09,570\nstarting data set from that point till the\npoint we get to where we had a problem.\n\n826\n00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,290\nAnd that effectively restores all\nthe data to a consistent state.\n\n827\n00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,940\nSo that's why we can use things\nlike electronic journaling\n\n828\n00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,950\nin order to be able to create failover,\nor not failover, excuse me,\n\n829\n00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:22,208\nbackup and fail safe scenarios, where\nwe can actually have the data secured.\n\n830\n00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,969\nSo two-phase commits.\n\n831\n00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:28,800\nThe two phase commit concept, simply\na mechanism that is another control,\n\n832\n00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,790\nas we talk about different\nkinds of controls in databases.\n\n833\n00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:34,390\nWe ensure the integrity of\nthe data held within the database\n\n834\n00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,500\nby using a two phase commit.\n\n835\n00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,620\nBecause we won't commit the data into the\ndatabase, write it in that unknown state,\n\n836\n00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,520\nunless we do an integrity check on\nit first to make sure it's good.\n\n837\n00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,860\nSo we check the integrity,\nthe validity of the data,\n\n838\n00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,785\nwe then do a second process where we\nactually commit the data to the database.\n\n839\n00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:53,080\nHence the concept of the two phase commit\nas opposed to the two phase commit,\n\n840\n00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,550\nwhere we do do two phases or\nthe two phase commit.\n\n841\n00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,820\nWe do a two phase commit.\n\n842\n00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,740\nI wonder why sometimes,\nshame some of you thinking,\n\n843\n00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,680\nwhy do I have to hold up two fingers when\nI said two and they're going to know two?\n\n844\n00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,570\n>> Right.\n>> So, but you know you just have to.\n\n845\n00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:07,460\nSometimes you get out ahead\nof yourself and there you go.\n\n846\n00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,179\nSo two phase commit.\n\n847\n00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:10,730\nCell suppression.\n\n848\n00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:14,430\nThe idea here that we use, this idea, to\nbasically effect we hide certain kinds of\n\n849\n00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,590\ndata, certain cells are going to\nhave sensitive information in them.\n\n850\n00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:19,400\nWe suppress them and don't show them.\n\n851\n00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,250\nSo go back to that idea\nof that spreadsheet, A1,\n\n852\n00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:26,960\nA2, A3, that kind of thing so\nwe may say that one column\n\n853\n00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,250\nof the data is going to have\nsensitive information in it.\n\n854\n00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,420\nSo it may suppress that.\n\n855\n00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,440\nIt's almost like hiding that column.\n\n856\n00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,210\nWe move the spreadsheet over in such\na way that we hide column A or column B.\n\n857\n00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,520\nAnd we don't allow it to be seen.\n\n858\n00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,150\nThis is another view concept.\n\n859\n00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:45,123\nWe could suppress the view by\n[CROSSTALK] constrained interfaces.\n\n860\n00:39:45,123 --> 00:39:46,633\n>> Might need to work with that data, but\n\n861\n00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:49,701\nthere might be certain columns that\nthey're not authorized, pay rates, or\n\n862\n00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:52,553\nSocial Security Number [CROSSTALK]\n>> So we allow the data to exist, but\n\n863\n00:39:52,553 --> 00:39:56,232\nwe just simply block it from being seen by\ncertain people based on authentication,\n\n864\n00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:56,876\nabsolutely.\n\n865\n00:39:56,876 --> 00:39:57,791\nYou've done this before.\n\n866\n00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:02,125\n>> Once or twice [LAUGH]\n>> Noise and Perturbation.\n\n867\n00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:05,708\nThe idea here of techniques that\nbasically, insert bogus information.\n\n868\n00:40:05,708 --> 00:40:09,580\nSo we're effectively going in and\nwe're adding randomness.\n\n869\n00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,350\nJust generated data that goes in to our\nsystem in the hopes of misdirecting\n\n870\n00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:18,215\nthe attacker or confusing them so that\nthey may pick up the false data over here\n\n871\n00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,675\nand think that it's really\nthe right data and take that and\n\n872\n00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:22,255\nnot bother the real data set.\n\n873\n00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:25,245\nWe tend to have our real data, and\nthen we structure fake data around it and\n\n874\n00:40:25,245 --> 00:40:26,345\nintermingle with it.\n\n875\n00:40:26,345 --> 00:40:29,210\nWe then, have formulas and ways of to\nfiltering we know okay this column is\n\n876\n00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:31,250\nreally garbage, take it out right?\n\n877\n00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,520\nBut as a result of that we know\nbecause we architected it, but\n\n878\n00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:38,230\nsomebody steals the data set or steals\nthe database or interacts with it but\n\n879\n00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:41,370\nin an unauthorized way\nmay not realize that so\n\n880\n00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:47,050\nthey may be looking for Sales Data and it\nmay say a bunch of stuff that's not real.\n\n881\n00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,580\nWe know that, you know obviously we are\ngoing to the one that is not marked out\n\n882\n00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,440\nbut still has that indication.\n\n883\n00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,810\nThat's how we do this idea of Noise or\nPerturbation.\n\n884\n00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:57,296\nIt's just almost like the term we used\nearlier, we talked about fuzzing.\n\n885\n00:40:57,296 --> 00:41:00,690\nIf we're going to do the testing\nby throwing random noise,\n\n886\n00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,930\nrandom data into the system to test and\nsee where the weaknesses are.\n\n887\n00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,270\nIt's almost like fuzzing, but\n\n888\n00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:08,344\nit's fuzzing not with the idea of\nchecking the integrity to test it or\n\n889\n00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:11,840\nrather fuzzing to actually create\nobfuscation, hiding the real data.\n\n890\n00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,840\nData warehousing, this idea,\nas we talked about,\n\n891\n00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,730\nmultidimensional data sets tend to\nbe involved in data warehouses.\n\n892\n00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:24,025\nWe've combined with data from different\ndata sources together into these large,\n\n893\n00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:27,630\nmulti-purpose databases that can do\na variety of things, very, very big.\n\n894\n00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,520\nThey're used with BI, typically\nBusiness Intelligence solutions and\n\n895\n00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,000\ncertainly big data is all\nabout data warehousing.\n\n896\n00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,280\nSometimes hear about data marts and\nthings like that but\n\n897\n00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,430\nbasically a data mart is just\na smaller version of a data warehouse.\n\n898\n00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,100\nAnd then Data Mining,\nthe process of masquerading, excuse me.\n\n899\n00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,220\nMasquerading, listen to me.\n\n900\n00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,680\nMassaging the data to\nbe able to take it out.\n\n901\n00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,498\nWe don't want to masquerade.\n\n902\n00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:48,370\nWe want to go ahead and\nmassage the data held in the warehouse.\n\n903\n00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:51,910\nIn other words, in effect, we manipulate\nit so we can show certain things.\n\n904\n00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,300\nData Mining may go in and\nlook at from an analytics perspective.\n\n905\n00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,380\nMaybe looking at trending,\nthere may be data there.\n\n906\n00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,010\nThey want to see what\nthe trend was over time.\n\n907\n00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,960\nHow many people over so\nmany months did this or that.\n\n908\n00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,000\nThere may be obvious trends, there may\nbe trends that are not so obvious.\n\n909\n00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,260\nAnd so Data Mining is really the art\nas well as the science of looking for\n\n910\n00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,920\nthe meaning within all those disparate\npieces of data that float around in\n\n911\n00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,110\nthe system today.\n\n912\n00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,300\nVery, very big money,\n>> Right, right.\n\n913\n00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,270\n>> A lot of opportunity there.\n\n914\n00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,539\n>> Absolutely.\nVery, very big.\n\n915\n00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:21,640\nData Programming or\nDatabase Programming Interfaces.\n\n916\n00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,830\nHow do we actually program databases?\n\n917\n00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:26,980\nWhat do we work with them on the front\nend, how do we interact with them?\n\n918\n00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:29,480\nYou'll see here we have\nseveral we have to go through.\n\n919\n00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,550\nWe have I think five, four or five.\n\n920\n00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:34,690\nWe have Open Database Connectivity,\nwhat's known as ODBC.\n\n921\n00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,430\nWe have data definition language.\n\n922\n00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,280\nWe don't have to scroll down,\nwe'll just kind of get there.\n\n923\n00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,950\nBut the idea of\nthe Open Database Connectivity, and\n\n924\n00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:44,530\nthen we're going to have the DDL,\nthe database definition language,\n\n925\n00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:48,640\ndata manipulation language,\nsome of the stuff comes down below.\n\n926\n00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,680\nBut we have ODBC.\n\n927\n00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,690\nWe have Object Linking and\nEmbedding Databases, so OLE DB.\n\n928\n00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,910\nRight?\nWe have ActiveX Database Objects or\n\n929\n00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,850\nActiveX Data Objects, ADO.\n\n930\n00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:00,000\nAnd Java Database Connectivity, JDBC.\n\n931\n00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,585\nSo we have these four distinct\nDatabase programming interface.\n\n932\n00:43:03,585 --> 00:43:04,745\nSo, ODBC.\n\n933\n00:43:04,745 --> 00:43:05,565\nWe often hear about ODBC,\n\n934\n00:43:05,565 --> 00:43:08,615\nthis is kind of the thing that'll\nconnect anything to anything.\n\n935\n00:43:08,615 --> 00:43:11,695\nIt's an API, which is just\nan advanced programmatic interface.\n\n936\n00:43:11,695 --> 00:43:15,835\nIt's basically an open hook that let's\nyou connect in and pull data out.\n\n937\n00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:19,225\nSo when we want to pull data\nin from one system to another\n\n938\n00:43:19,225 --> 00:43:22,145\nwe will typically use and\nODBC connection to do that.\n\n939\n00:43:22,145 --> 00:43:24,830\nObject linking and embedding Database.\n\n940\n00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,870\nSo an OLEDB is basically an object\nlinking and embedding data source.\n\n941\n00:43:28,870 --> 00:43:30,900\nIt separates data into\nthe various components.\n\n942\n00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,530\nAnd as a result of that we're able to link\nto those components and bring them in and\n\n943\n00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,150\nmanipulate them.\n\n944\n00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,790\nSo as a result, no matter how data\nis Format and where it is located,\n\n945\n00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,810\nwe effectively can manipulate and\nuse that data.\n\n946\n00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,881\nKind of strip away all of\nthat stuff that's unique and\n\n947\n00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:45,917\nas a result can just create\ndata that's available.\n\n948\n00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:49,573\nActive X data objects, anytime you\nsee anything that says active X\n\n949\n00:43:49,573 --> 00:43:53,489\nobviously going to be Microsoft centric\n[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH] Run quickly,\n\n950\n00:43:53,489 --> 00:43:55,530\ndon't look back, and don't stop.\n\n951\n00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:58,920\nSo, active X data objects\nare going to be Microsoft centric.\n\n952\n00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,706\nSo, APO is a Microsoft data object model\nspecifically designed to work with\n\n953\n00:44:03,706 --> 00:44:06,470\nactive X components in their systems.\n\n954\n00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:10,510\nSo, it is Microsoft centric, but\nit's an API that allows you basically\n\n955\n00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:14,040\nto access the back-end database\nsystems that are using or\n\n956\n00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,460\nbe used to store data for\nthese web-based solutions.\n\n957\n00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,690\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n958\n00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,760\nAnd then java database connectivity,\nsomeone's JDBC.\n\n959\n00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,800\nThis allows basically anything that's\ngoing to allow or use java to be\n\n960\n00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,120\nable to communicate with the database,\nso it is going to be able to bridge or\n\n961\n00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,800\nuse the connectivity coming out of\nthe java applets to consume data.\n\n962\n00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,430\nMaybe through a ODBC connection\nto pull data from somewhere else,\n\n963\n00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:39,570\nbut basically you combine that with\nwhere you want your data to be, and\n\n964\n00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:42,430\nhow you want to consume it, and\nyou've got yourself a solution that\n\n965\n00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,550\nwill run across Java pretty much,\nand pull data in.\n\n966\n00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:50,369\nSo we have data definition language, what\nyou think of as a DDL not a DLL not a.\n\n967\n00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:52,490\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Dynamically linked library file, but\n\n968\n00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:56,190\na DDL defines the structure and scheme\nof the database so this is basically\n\n969\n00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,820\nthe architectural reference for\nhow the database is designed.\n\n970\n00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,590\n>> Labels and things like that.\n\n971\n00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:01,120\n>> All that.\n>> Your create statements.\n\n972\n00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,352\n>> Exactly yes exactly that.\n\n973\n00:45:02,352 --> 00:45:03,617\n>> 100% accurate correct.\n\n974\n00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,961\n>> I'm going to actually just\nlet's just switch spots.\n\n975\n00:45:05,961 --> 00:45:06,850\n>> [LAUGH] No, No,\nNo I'm going to follow you.\n\n976\n00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:07,860\n>> I'm going to have\nyou come over here and\n\n977\n00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,120\nlet's see you talk about some of that and\n\n978\n00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,610\nI'm just I'm going to drive for\na little bit.\n\n979\n00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,260\nBecause I haven't got\nthe chance to do that yet.\n\n980\n00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,590\n>> That's true that's true.\n\n981\n00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:16,480\nWe haven't seen you type\nlive on the internet yet.\n\n982\n00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,140\n>> No you haven't right.\n\n983\n00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,250\nFor all you know I pay\nsomebody to do my notes for\n\n984\n00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:22,700\nme right so they come out perfect so\nI can rib you about your typing skills.\n\n985\n00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,870\nRight, so data definition and\nthen data manipulation language,\n\n986\n00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:29,740\nDML, is where all the commands\nare going to be used to actually set up\n\n987\n00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,830\nthings like view ad, modify,\nas you can see sort delete.\n\n988\n00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:36,190\nA query language, just generic QL.\n\n989\n00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:37,260\nS in front of it.\n\n990\n00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,270\nOne we all know about, have heard about.\n\n991\n00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:40,480\nStructured Query Language.\n\n992\n00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,250\nBut, there are many kinds\nof query languages.\n\n993\n00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:43,590\nStructured is just one.\n\n994\n00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:44,860\nThere's Unstructured.\n\n995\n00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,710\nThere's a lot of different kinds\nof querying but basically,\n\n996\n00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,040\nthe idea of make your request.\n\n997\n00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,250\nAsking a question.\n\n998\n00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,760\nAnd the language we do\nthat in is basic query.\n\n999\n00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,670\nA data dictionary, we talked about this\nalready, but it's the connection...the\n\n1000\n00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,810\ncollection, rather, centralized with\nall the elements, definitions, and\n\n1001\n00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:02,740\nall the things going to be making up\nthe database, whatever those may be.\n\n1002\n00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:03,250\nAll right.\n\n1003\n00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,740\nSo then we want to talk about\nthe idea of integrity a little bit,\n\n1004\n00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,560\ndifferent integrity types.\n\n1005\n00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,590\nAnd so this idea of integrity,\nvery important.\n\n1006\n00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:12,470\nRight information is not\nmanipulated in any way but\n\n1007\n00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:16,630\nrather instead what we think about\nis this idea of being able to ensure\n\n1008\n00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,680\nthat data has not been\ntransformed in any way.\n\n1009\n00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,870\n>> Right.\n>> Or if it has been transformed,\n\n1010\n00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:20,710\nwe know about it.\n\n1011\n00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:23,470\nAnd more importantly we keep\na record of it, we document it, but\n\n1012\n00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:27,620\nit only happens with our approval, with\nour knowledge, within the constraints, or\n\n1013\n00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,620\nthe confines of whatever kind\nof system we're setting up.\n\n1014\n00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:34,690\nSo database software that performs\nthree main types of integrity services,\n\n1015\n00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:37,840\nwe want think about integrity from\nthree perspectives, in other words.\n\n1016\n00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:43,130\nThis idea of symantec integrity\nreverential integrity and\n\n1017\n00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:46,850\nentity integrity so let's go through and\njust take a look real quick at these.\n\n1018\n00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:50,770\nSemantic integrity mechanisms, as you\ncan see we're going to really focus on\n\n1019\n00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:54,115\nthe structural and the semantic rules,\nthe interactive rules that are being\n\n1020\n00:46:54,115 --> 00:46:56,793\nenforce all the structural\nelements have integrity.\n\n1021\n00:46:56,793 --> 00:47:00,565\nWe don't misalign tables, we don’t link\na primary key to something that cant link\n\n1022\n00:47:00,565 --> 00:47:03,275\nto, we don't have a foreign key\nnot linking to a primary key.\n\n1023\n00:47:03,275 --> 00:47:04,875\nThese are all going to\nbe that kind of stuff.\n\n1024\n00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:07,480\nAs well as referential integrity.\n\n1025\n00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,340\nForeign key's really more of\na referential integrity item.\n\n1026\n00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:11,780\nIt's not really a semantic item.\n\n1027\n00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,700\nBut more of the structure of the database,\n\n1028\n00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,028\nyou have the rules around to\nmake sure to set up properly.\n\n1029\n00:47:16,028 --> 00:47:19,760\nThey're going to be there, so\ndata types, logical values, uniqueness,\n\n1030\n00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,890\nthings of that nature.\n\n1031\n00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:23,420\nAre really going to be more of\nthe semantic integrity items.\n\n1032\n00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,130\nThe database referential integrity item is\nthe foreign key item that I was talking\n\n1033\n00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:30,130\nabout in referencing primary keys, but\nbasically the idea of making sure your\n\n1034\n00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:34,560\nreferences are set up correctly so no\nforeign key, unless it links to a primary\n\n1035\n00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,330\nkey that kind of thing if it doesn't\nthen we have no referential integrity.\n\n1036\n00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:41,040\nAs a result it can actually\ncreate problems in the dataset.\n\n1037\n00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,780\nAnd then entity integrity guarantees that\nthe tuples- remember tuples are going to\n\n1038\n00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:48,480\nbe our rows- are going to be uniquely\nidentified by primary key values.\n\n1039\n00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,420\nSo when we have entity integrity,\nwe're making sure that we have that.\n\n1040\n00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,560\nIf we don't have a tuple or\nrow that are uniquely identified or\n\n1041\n00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,515\nhas a primary key value associated with\nit, we're going to have a problem.\n\n1042\n00:47:58,515 --> 00:48:00,250\nBecause again, there's no integrity there.\n\n1043\n00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:04,865\nLooking at it from these different\nperspectives, allows us to understand\n\n1044\n00:48:04,865 --> 00:48:09,125\nhow to create integrity,\nensure integrity is there, maintain it.\n\n1045\n00:48:09,125 --> 00:48:14,239\nI remember this idea that integrity is\nmaking sure the data is not going to be\n\n1046\n00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:19,500\nmodified in an incorrect or in an\nundocumented way whatever that may mean.\n\n1047\n00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,650\nPolyinstantiation not\nlike polymorphism right?\n\n1048\n00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,550\nSpeak, speak.\n\n1049\n00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:27,860\n>> Poly [LAUGH].\n>> So not like polymorphism.\n\n1050\n00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:28,780\nPolyinstantiation.\n\n1051\n00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,190\nThis enables a table that\ncontains multiple tuples.\n\n1052\n00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:31,710\nYou like that example, didn't you?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1053\n00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:32,545\n>> That was pretty cool.\n\n1054\n00:48:32,545 --> 00:48:33,416\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1055\n00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:37,550\n[COUGH] if you missed that particular\ndiscussion definitely gotta go back.\n\n1056\n00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,850\nWatch our discussion around polymorphism.\n\n1057\n00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,678\n>> Absolutely.\n>> You get to see Mike play his\n\n1058\n00:48:41,678

polymorphism.\n\n1061\n00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,620\nVery very good.\n\n1062\n00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,520\n>> It's worth a gander right.\n\n1063\n00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,791\n>> It's actually up for\nan award later this year.\n\n1064\n00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:54,010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Going to be the golden.\n\n1065\n00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,210\nThe golden catnip award.\n\n1066\n00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,710\n>> There we go.\n>> All right, so polyinstantiation.\n\n1067\n00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,110\nRight?\nThis enables a table that contains\n\n1068\n00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:02,090\nmultiple tuples, remember rows,\nwith the same primary keys.\n\n1069\n00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:04,210\nWith the each instance\ndistinguished by a security level.\n\n1070\n00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:08,410\nThe ideas that we could have multiple\nitems of data that are in a table.\n\n1071\n00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:12,610\nand based on security level we will\nshow you or distinguish what you see and\n\n1072\n00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:14,162\nwhat you don't see based on that.\n\n1073\n00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:17,170\nSo polyinstantiation is effectively\n\n1074\n00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:21,150\nexposing data to different security\nlevels from within the same table.\n\n1075\n00:49:22,195 --> 00:49:27,646\nAnd so if we had maybe a table of maybe,\nand you were actually saying this earlier,\n\n1076\n00:49:27,646 --> 00:49:30,085\nwhere maybe we have a table that\nwill have certain information.\n\n1077\n00:49:30,085 --> 00:49:32,205\nSo imagine being a manager for\ninstance, right?\n\n1078\n00:49:32,205 --> 00:49:36,000\nHaving a team of people that you're\nresponsible for And you may be doing,\n\n1079\n00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,900\nyou as the manager may be able to see all\naspects of the information on the team,\n\n1080\n00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:44,460\nand so you may be able to see first name,\nlast name, home address,\n\n1081\n00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:49,804\ncontact info, and then things like\nmaybe salary and seniority level,\n\n1082\n00:49:49,804 --> 00:49:54,970\nand whether or not this person\nis in line for a promotion.\n\n1083\n00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,360\nWhatever those things may be.\n\n1084\n00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,110\nBut then somebody else using\nthe data set who is not a manager or\n\n1085\n00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:03,200\nnot a manager of that team, they could be\na manager but a manager of another team\n\n1086\n00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,380\nwould not be able to see certain data\nbecause it'll be hidden effectively\n\n1087\n00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:10,160\nfiltered by the database itself Itself\nthe DBMS because of polyinstantiation.\n\n1088\n00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,700\nCuz you don't have security to see certain\nrows they are effectively locked out.\n\n1089\n00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:14,360\nYou won't see them.\n\n1090\n00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,850\nSo just something to consider there and\nto think about.\n\n1091\n00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:22,450\nAnd then when we think about\npolyinstantiation also think about this\n\n1092\n00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:27,240\nidea of, can we have a single\ndatabases that services lots and\n\n1093\n00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,870\nlots of different customers?\n\n1094\n00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:31,500\nAnd if so, and we do obviously,\nthen you'll again\n\n1095\n00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,840\ncome back to this idea of really how do\nwe build in security from the ground up.\n\n1096\n00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,452\nRight, so if we're not really focused on\nthis idea of access control, this idea of\n\n1097\n00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:42,570\npolyinstantiation as a framework, and\nthen really creating security around it.\n\n1098\n00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:45,470\nWe're going to have issues because as\nsoon as we go to start seeing that data.\n\n1099\n00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:48,414\nWhat's going to happen is, it's going to\nbe exposed, and unfortunately we're going\n\n1100\n00:50:48,414 --> 00:50:51,023\nto see everything, when when in fact\nwe're not supposed to see everything.\n\n1101\n00:50:51,023 --> 00:50:52,807\nIt's also going to be definitely\nan issue to consider.\n\n1102\n00:50:52,807 --> 00:50:53,490\nAll right, very good.\n\n1103\n00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:57,460\nAnd then we have this idea of online\ntransaction processing, this idea of OLTP,\n\n1104\n00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,730\nwe often refer to it this way,\nwhen databases are clustered.\n\n1105\n00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,720\nSo, if we have them linked together on the\nback end providing fault tolerance, this\n\n1106\n00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,505\nidea of never going offline and always\nbeing available for higher performance\n\n1107\n00:51:07,505 --> 00:51:11,480\nthen we see OLTP, online transaction\nprocessing, taking place.\n\n1108\n00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,290\nMain goal there, ensure that\ntransactions happen properly or\n\n1109\n00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,560\nthat they don't happen at all.\n\n1110\n00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,220\nIn other words, we either again,\ndata in a known state, data at rest,\n\n1111\n00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,440\ndata in transition, data at rest.\n\n1112\n00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,340\nData in transition is not,\n\n1113\n00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:26,370\nobviously going to be in a known state\nevery second because we're acting on it.\n\n1114\n00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:29,500\nBut the end result of those actions\nis it goes back to a known state.\n\n1115\n00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,458\nAnd so if we can't get it back to\na known state, we have to roll back.\n\n1116\n00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:34,945\nSpeaking of rollback.\n\n1117\n00:51:34,945 --> 00:51:37,110\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna have to come back right\n\n1118\n00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:38,620\nafter this short break.\n\n1119\n00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:42,590\nBut once we do take a small break and come\nback, what we're gonna be talking about\n\n1120\n00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:45,800\nnext is this idea of okay, so\nwe have to rollback the data.\n\n1121\n00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:46,960\nSo what does that actually mean?\n\n1122\n00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,270\nAnd what is this whole known state\nthing that I keep talking about?\n\n1123\n00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:51,180\nAnd how does that all work?\n\n1124\n00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,940\nWe're taught this idea of the ACID test.\n\n1125\n00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,900\nAnd, just generically,\nwhat we really measure that known state\n\n1126\n00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:58,980\nagainst in databases is the idea\nof what we call a comisicity.\n\n1127\n00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,740\nAnd so we have this idea of the ACID\ntest that helps us to understand that.\n\n1128\n00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,390\nAnd really understand how we know data is\nin a known state, transact it through,\n\n1129\n00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:06,480\nthen bring it back to another state.\n\n1130\n00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,140\n>> Very good.\nVery good.\n\n1131\n00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:09,238\nAll right.\nWell, stay tuned and we'll be right back.\n\n1132\n00:52:09,238 --> 00:52:16,321\n[SOUND].\n\n1133\n00:52:16,321 --> 00:52:18,538\n[INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH] All right.\n\n1134\n00:52:18,538 --> 00:52:20,585\nWelcome back everybody to our part,\n\n1135\n00:52:20,585 --> 00:52:24,754\nI think we're still in part two of our\nsoftware development and security.\n\n1136\n00:52:24,754 --> 00:52:26,455\n>> Let's be international.\n\n1137\n00:52:26,455 --> 00:52:27,075\nPart deux.\n\n1138\n00:52:27,075 --> 00:52:27,745\n>> Part deux.\n\n1139\n00:52:27,745 --> 00:52:29,445\nExactly.\nWe've been talking about databases and\n\n1140\n00:52:29,445 --> 00:52:30,945\nsome of the things we can do with those.\n\n1141\n00:52:30,945 --> 00:52:33,285\nAnd now we're gonna take a look\nat some more techniques, or\n\n1142\n00:52:33,285 --> 00:52:37,717\nsome methodologies I guess,\nto ensure that we have that consistency.\n\n1143\n00:52:37,717 --> 00:52:39,097\nOr as you've been saying a few times,\n\n1144\n00:52:39,097 --> 00:52:41,337\nmaking sure we have that state,\nthat known state.\n\n1145\n00:52:41,337 --> 00:52:41,987\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1146\n00:52:41,987 --> 00:52:43,197\nSo we're gonna actually look at how.\n\n1147\n00:52:43,197 --> 00:52:45,947\nThere's this model,\nthis concept that we use to refer to this,\n\n1148\n00:52:45,947 --> 00:52:47,930\nespecially what we were\njust talking about.\n\n1149\n00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:51,210\nWhich was the OLTP the online\ntransactional processing, we're going to\n\n1150\n00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:54,420\ntake a look at the ACID test we're\ngoing to talk about what this means.\n\n1151\n00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:59,520\nACID the acronym for the four items\nthat make up the concept of the test,\n\n1152\n00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,450\nAtomicity, Consistency,\nhad a little time check going on.\n\n1153\n00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:05,410\n>> Yep yep.\n>> Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and\n\n1154\n00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:06,050\ndurability.\n\n1155\n00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:10,370\nSo we wanna break down the acid test of\nthese components, talk about they are.\n\n1156\n00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:12,570\nReally kind of bring them back together so\n\n1157\n00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:15,070\nwe understand the conceptual\nidea of the model.\n\n1158\n00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:18,350\nAnd this is what's applied to data\ncomes through an OLTP process\n\n1159\n00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:20,750\nto ensure it goes from a known state\nthrough to another known state.\n\n1160\n00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,460\nAnd if it is not,\nat the end of the process, gonna be there,\n\n1161\n00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,600\nwe have to roll it back out.\n\n1162\n00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,120\nSo atomicity dividing transactions\ninto units of work and\n\n1163\n00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,870\nensuring all modifications take effect or\nnone so either we commit or\n\n1164\n00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:33,760\ndon't commit the changes.\n\n1165\n00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,795\nSo if we don't commit\nthem we roll them back.\n\n1166\n00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:36,495\nThat's the idea of atomicity.\n\n1167\n00:53:36,495 --> 00:53:39,245\nThis idea of data being in\na known state at all times,\n\n1168\n00:53:39,245 --> 00:53:40,655\nthat I've been speaking about.\n\n1169\n00:53:40,655 --> 00:53:42,295\nThe A in the acid test.\n\n1170\n00:53:42,295 --> 00:53:45,725\nConsistency, transactions must\nfollow the integrity policy.\n\n1171\n00:53:45,725 --> 00:53:48,645\nThat is in place for that database,\nwhatever it is, to ensure all\n\n1172\n00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:52,085\ndata is consistent regardless of\nwhere it lives in the database.\n\n1173\n00:53:52,085 --> 00:53:53,585\nAlways have to be in a consistent state.\n\n1174\n00:53:53,585 --> 00:53:55,371\nIt revolves around the idea\nof consistency and\n\n1175\n00:53:55,371 --> 00:53:57,217\njust knowing the state of\nthe data at all times.\n\n1176\n00:53:57,217 --> 00:54:01,355\nIntegrity is really the watch word for\nthis so when we talk about availability,\n\n1177\n00:54:01,355 --> 00:54:05,248\nwe talk about integrity, we talk\nabout confidentiality of information,\n\n1178\n00:54:05,248 --> 00:54:08,238\ninformation security management,\nthe three pillars.\n\n1179\n00:54:08,238 --> 00:54:11,868\nIntegrity is really what we're focused\non here with the known state of the data\n\n1180\n00:54:11,868 --> 00:54:13,260\nbecause the data changes.\n\n1181\n00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:16,250\nIt's modified, any way, shape, or\nform, and we don't know about it, and\n\n1182\n00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,080\nit's not consistent,\nthere is no integrity.\n\n1183\n00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:18,900\nWe have zero integrity.\n\n1184\n00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:23,850\nIsolation, transactions execute\nwithin an isolated bubble.\n\n1185\n00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:27,020\nIn other words, remember, during\nisolation data's in an unknown state,\n\n1186\n00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:30,060\nit's being transacted upon,\nwe don't know what's happening with it.\n\n1187\n00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:34,400\nIf we allow that to be able to be seen,\ninteracted with, and effectively touch and\n\n1188\n00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:37,945\nexpose itself to all the other areas\nof the database, we're gonna wind up\n\n1189\n00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:41,155\nwith inconsistent data, that is going\nto constantly have to be rolled back.\n\n1190\n00:54:41,155 --> 00:54:44,365\nSo, it's almost like we form this\nlittle bubble, this safety zone,\n\n1191\n00:54:44,365 --> 00:54:49,085\nthis virtualized sandbox\naround the isolation, or,\n\n1192\n00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:52,365\nexcuse me, the isolation around\nthe transaction of the data.\n\n1193\n00:54:52,365 --> 00:54:56,665\nAnd when the data goes in, it transacts,\nit's transformed into unknown states.\n\n1194\n00:54:56,665 --> 00:55:00,360\nComes out the back end if it's done the\nright way, in another known state, stable.\n\n1195\n00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,380\nAnd as a result of that,\nwhile it's in flux, we keep it isolated.\n\n1196\n00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,620\nAnd this is what the idea of the I in the\nacid model of the isolation is all about.\n\n1197\n00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,100\nSpecifically take note of\nthe fact that we've said this but\n\n1198\n00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:11,950\nlet me be unequivocal and clear,\n\n1199\n00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:15,860\nresults modifications are not available\nuntil the transaction is completed.\n\n1200\n00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,330\nSo if the transaction does not complete\nsuccessfully, we don't see the output,\n\n1201\n00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:20,340\nin fact we roll it back.\n\n1202\n00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,180\nWhich is what we're talking about here.\n\n1203\n00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,300\nAnd then the D.\n\n1204\n00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,700\nExcuse me, d for durability.\n\n1205\n00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,670\nOnce transaction, or transactions,\nhave been verified and are accurate\n\n1206\n00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:34,430\nacross all systems they are committed into\nthe database and cannot be rolled back.\n\n1207\n00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:37,480\nSo in other words we go from one\nknown state to another known state.\n\n1208\n00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,870\nOnce we commit the data, we no longer\nhave a roll back option for that.\n\n1209\n00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,470\nWe can back out of transactions\nthrough other mechanisms.\n\n1210\n00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:46,050\n>> Right.\n>> Manually go in and manipulate the data\n\n1211\n00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:50,050\nthrough another set of transactions that\neffectively then have to go through this\n\n1212\n00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:53,850\nACID model again, to create a known state,\nor from a known state to a known state.\n\n1213\n00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:58,840\nBut the option to roll back that\ntransaction has now disappeared.\n\n1214\n00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,590\nSo this is the acid model.\n\n1215\n00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,815\nVery very important when we talk about\nthe life cycle of data management and\n\n1216\n00:56:03,815 --> 00:56:04,333\ndatabase.\n\n1217\n00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:07,474\nIt underlies, forms the way in which we\nthink about integrity and if we don't\n\n1218\n00:56:07,474 --> 00:56:10,807\nreally have an understanding of the ACID\nmodel, the ACID test We're going to have\n\n1219\n00:56:10,807 --> 00:56:13,982\na problem because we'll have no way of\nunderstanding how to manage our data.\n\n1220\n00:56:13,982 --> 00:56:16,417\nAll right so, definitely something for\nyou to be aware of,\n\n1221\n00:56:16,417 --> 00:56:19,000\nyou are thinking about\nbecoming a CISSP hopefully.\n\n1222\n00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,360\nIf you are, which is great news,\nwe're excited to hear that.\n\n1223\n00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:25,205\nWe're always excited to welcome new\nsecurity professionals into our\n\n1224\n00:56:25,205 --> 00:56:27,675\ninformation security community worldwide.\n\n1225\n00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:32,315\nCISSP being at the top, pinnacle, of that\ninformation security management community.\n\n1226\n00:56:32,315 --> 00:56:34,575\nWanna make sure you\nare prepared properly for that.\n\n1227\n00:56:34,575 --> 00:56:38,135\nAnd one of the things to take away from\nthis discussion and this section around\n\n1228\n00:56:38,135 --> 00:56:42,099\nsecure architectures of data systems, and\nhow we build basically secure data sets.\n\n1229\n00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:44,983\nAnd we're looking at software development\nsecurity, and what we do there.\n\n1230\n00:56:44,983 --> 00:56:47,857\nIt's this idea of the ACID test and\nthis idea if consistency, and\n\n1231\n00:56:47,857 --> 00:56:50,400\nthe ability to understand\nconsistency across data.\n\n1232\n00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,010\nIt's very, very important as a underlying\nfundamental architecture element\n\n1233\n00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,300\nof secure design.\n\n1234\n00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,930\nAll right, so now that we've done that,\nlet's talk about some different things.\n\n1235\n00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:00,080\nJust again, some odds and ends,\n\n1236\n00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,930\nsome vocabulary there before\nwe get to malware types.\n\n1237\n00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:04,208\nMike's very excited about this.\n\n1238\n00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:04,952\n>> Woo-hoo!\n>> Loves malware.\n\n1239\n00:57:04,952 --> 00:57:07,267\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [COUGH] So expert systems.\n\n1240\n00:57:07,267 --> 00:57:08,800\nWhat are expert systems?\n\n1241\n00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,620\nWe often refer to these as AI,\n\n1242\n00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,420\nArtificial Intelligence Systems to\nbasically bring AI to the floor.\n\n1243\n00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:17,490\nYo, AI,\nArtificial Intelligence takes many guises.\n\n1244\n00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:23,180\nWe joke about things like the Matrix, the\nSkynet, and all these movie references and\n\n1245\n00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:26,730\nstuff and that's certainly one form,\none vision potentially of AI.\n\n1246\n00:57:26,730 --> 00:57:28,440\nBut AI can take a lot of other forms.\n\n1247\n00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:31,140\nToday they're a little bit more tangible,\na little bit more real world,\n\n1248\n00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,820\na little bit real, compared to some\nof those made up movie things.\n\n1249\n00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,890\n>> Right.\n>> Looking at robots, for instance,\n\n1250\n00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:40,570\non assembly lines today, that are doing\na lot of this very high skilled,\n\n1251\n00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:42,045\nhigh end work.\n\n1252\n00:57:42,045 --> 00:57:44,660\nWhile they're not incredibly complex and\n\n1253\n00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:49,395\nartificially intelligent beyond what\nwe would think, which is very basic.\n\n1254\n00:57:49,395 --> 00:57:51,115\nInput the instruction, go here,\n\n1255\n00:57:51,115 --> 00:57:55,220\ndo this, map out the data plane,\nfollow the data grid, and do this.\n\n1256\n00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,350\nThey are artificially intelligent\nat some level, right?\n\n1257\n00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:01,830\nSo as a result we see AI in robotics and\nwe see it all over the place today.\n\n1258\n00:58:01,830 --> 00:58:02,535\n>> IBM's Watson.\n\n1259\n00:58:02,535 --> 00:58:03,330\nIBM's Watson.\n\n1260\n00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:03,942\n>> IBM's Watson, right.\n\n1261\n00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:04,890\nIBM's Watson, right absolutely.\n\n1262\n00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:07,580\n>> Yeah it would be really impressive\nto watch him play Jeopardy.\n\n1263\n00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,060\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1264\n00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,560\nSo also quantum computing,\n\n1265\n00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:14,660\nwe think about the idea of using quantum\ncomputing in AI, and seeing the bridging.\n\n1266\n00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,830\nAnd then kind of the blurring\nof these lines at the very,\n\n1267\n00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:21,950\nvery edge of the technology plane today,\nstanding there, kind of looking down and\n\n1268\n00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:23,250\nseeing what's below.\n\n1269\n00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:26,310\nThere's a lot of really\ninteresting stuff going on.\n\n1270\n00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:29,690\nWe're still probably years away\nfrom being able to get a sentient,\n\n1271\n00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:34,320\nfully functioning AI system online along\nthe lines of something like the Matrix or\n\n1272\n00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,290\nSkynet, without all the obviously end of\nworld, Armageddon stuff that goes with it.\n\n1273\n00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,076\n>> Right [LAUGH].\n>> [COUGH] We don't want that, right?\n\n1274\n00:58:41,076 --> 00:58:42,411\n>> Hopefully we can prevent that.\n\n1275\n00:58:42,411 --> 00:58:44,712\n>> But, just see the looks of shock and\nhorror and\n\n1276\n00:58:44,712 --> 00:58:47,198\nhorror on the people's\nfaces that are watching.\n\n1277\n00:58:47,198 --> 00:58:48,230\n>> Did you say a couple\nyears holy [LAUGH].\n\n1278\n00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:51,540\n>> So, no Nostradamus kind of stuff here,\nwe're not talking about that.\n\n1279\n00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:55,520\nWhat I'm just implying is we're just\nmoving towards sentient systems.\n\n1280\n00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,260\nThey are going to be much more\nartificially intelligent, and\n\n1281\n00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:59,490\ninteractive than they are today.\n\n1282\n00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:01,400\nI think it's still several years out but,\n\n1283\n00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,530\nthis idea of an expert system is\nreally this idea of being able to\n\n1284\n00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:08,220\nbring in this idea of AI and make\na system that is aware, and interactive.\n\n1285\n00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,215\nSo, that's just what we're\ntalking about there.\n\n1286\n00:59:10,215 --> 00:59:14,580\nAnd inference engine, [COUGH] a computer\nprogram that tries to derive answers from\n\n1287\n00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:15,620\nwhat's called a knowledge base.\n\n1288\n00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,330\nSo it is the brain, if you will,\nof the expert system.\n\n1289\n00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:21,810\nSo if you think about being\nable to ask a system questions.\n\n1290\n00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:22,670\nYou mentioned Watson,\n\n1291\n00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:26,480\nWatson's a really good example of this,\nIBM's super computer.\n\n1292\n00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,960\nSo you mentioned the fact\nthat they were playing it or\n\n1293\n00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,365\nhad played it in a series\nof Jeopardy competitions.\n\n1294\n00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:36,010\nIt actually won some,\ndidn't win all but it won.\n\n1295\n00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,340\n>> Right.\n>> Ultimately.\n\n1296\n00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,520\nSo this idea of the inference engine,\nit's the idea of being able to go\n\n1297\n00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,206\nthrough a precompiled set of data and\nthen use that, the knowledge base, to\n\n1298\n00:59:44,206 --> 00:59:48,200\nbe able to drive answers, given interfaces\nand interactions with other people.\n\n1299\n00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,860\nSo we are basically forming new\nconclusions from the existing knowledge.\n\n1300\n00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,690\nIn effect we put them\ntogether in different ways.\n\n1301\n00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:57,060\nSo lots of different ways that\nyou could see this happening.\n\n1302\n00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,540\nWe see this with some of the heuristic\nbased solutions, with a host and\n\n1303\n01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:05,780\nintrusion prevention systems where they're\ngonna basically learn from examining and\n\n1304\n01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:09,170\nanalyzing the data patterns\nthat come through our network.\n\n1305\n01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:12,720\nAnd as a result of looking at traffic they\ncan put together new ideas of what is and\n\n1306\n01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,540\npotentially maybe is not\ngonna be acceptable behavior.\n\n1307\n01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:17,495\nSo you think of that.\n\n1308\n01:00:17,495 --> 01:00:18,920\nRule-based programming,\n\n1309\n01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,640\nthis idea of being able to\nbasically develop an expert system.\n\n1310\n01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,390\nWe create that if then logic\nthat we're talking about.\n\n1311\n01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:27,240\nAnd so we write those rules and\nspecify set of actions.\n\n1312\n01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,370\nAnd this is what we do,\nif this happens then we do this, and\n\n1313\n01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:32,450\nthere's like two million\nlines of this stuff.\n\n1314\n01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:36,350\nAnd we basically build up the complex\nbehavioral models as a result of that.\n\n1315\n01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:40,680\nAnd then artificial neural network, so\nthey call ANNs, as in the name Ann,\n\n1316\n01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,250\nthe formal name A-N-N.\n\n1317\n01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:45,490\nA mathematical or computational model\nbased on neural structures of the brain.\n\n1318\n01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:47,380\nIn other words we\nare laying out literally,\n\n1319\n01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,790\neffectively an artificial brain.\n\n1320\n01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:51,930\nWe're laying out the neural map,\nthe neural pathways, and mapping that out.\n\n1321\n01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:56,670\nAnd this is what an artificially\nderived neural network may look like.\n\n1322\n01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:59,500\nKind of again on the working,\nbeginning stages of some of this.\n\n1323\n01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:00,020\n>> Yeah, I'm with you.\n\n1324\n01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:00,840\n>> Yeah, we do, we do.\n\n1325\n01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:04,030\nI saw the episode a few nights ago.\n\n1326\n01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:07,310\nAs you know, being invited to come down\nand do some of the TV shows with you guys,\n\n1327\n01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:10,720\nso I'm here and I'm in town for a couple\nof weeks doing this with you guys.\n\n1328\n01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,360\nNot a lot to do in the evening so\nI just watch a little TV and\n\n1329\n01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:15,395\nI saw the old Star Trek.\n\n1330\n01:01:15,395 --> 01:01:16,162\nOh yeah, which one?\n\n1331\n01:01:16,162 --> 01:01:19,490\nI was watching Me TV, the Me TV channel\nwhere they have all of the old stuff.\n\n1332\n01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:22,910\nSo, it was one of the original\nones with William Shatner, and\n\n1333\n01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:26,690\nwith Lenard Nimoy, and it's the one\nwhere Lenard Nimoy's character Spock,\n\n1334\n01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:29,455\nyou have to explain to the people\nbecause they don't know who Spock is.\n\n1335\n01:01:29,455 --> 01:01:34,152\nSo Spock's character gets taken and\nthis woman gets in the Enterprise,\n\n1336\n01:01:34,152 --> 01:01:37,925\nbeams up, takes Spock,\nkidnaps him takes his brain out,\n\n1337\n01:01:37,925 --> 01:01:41,089\nputs it into the computer\nthat runs their world.\n\n1338\n01:01:41,089 --> 01:01:45,304\nAnd then they got Spock walking around\nlike this basically this cardboard android\n\n1339\n01:01:45,304 --> 01:01:47,884\nwith the little headgear\non he's got like a cool.\n\n1340\n01:01:47,884 --> 01:01:49,387\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> [LAUGH] Remote control.\n\n1341\n01:01:49,387 --> 01:01:49,980\n>> Remote control.\n\n1342\n01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:55,450\nSo you got Doctor Bones right, the doctor\nwalking around with the little joysticks.\n\n1343\n01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:56,490\n>> We've got to find his brain yeah.\n\n1344\n01:01:56,490 --> 01:01:58,487\n>> Yeah we've got to find\nhis brain walking aroundA.\n\n1345\n01:01:58,487 --> 01:02:01,590\nnd so it's really funny [LAUGH] because I\nwas watching this thing and I was thinking\n\n1346\n01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:04,720\nabout you know like that's the perfect\nexample for what we're going to be talking\n\n1347\n01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,875\nabout this the whole idea of artificially\nneural networks, or artificial\n\n1348\n01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:10,400\nintelligence in general, because\nyou've got this live mind that's now.\n\n1349\n01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,280\nNow in this computer.\n\n1350\n01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,120\n>> Plugged into the network.\n\n1351\n01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,960\n>> Kind of plug them together and they did\none of those in the newer Star Trek as\n\n1352\n01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:21,280\nwell where they did the the new new\none with Patrick what's his name.\n\n1353\n01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,820\n>> Patrick Stewart, yeah.\n\n1354\n01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:26,880\n>> Where they had the character\nthat is the skittish kind of guy.\n\n1355\n01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,670\nI forget his name.\n\n1356\n01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:33,280\nAnd they had him in this alien\npower took over his brain and\n\n1357\n01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:36,004\nhe built this whole big computer\nchair thing, it was in the holodeck.\n\n1358\n01:02:36,004 --> 01:02:36,720\nRemember this thing?\n\n1359\n01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,310\nAnd so he's in there,\nhe's controlling the whole ship and\n\n1360\n01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:44,470\ntakes the ship into the vortex or\nwhatever to get to this alien world so\n\n1361\n01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:47,640\nthat they can interact and they can\nobviously now meet this new culture.\n\n1362\n01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,090\nSo I forget his name.\n\n1363\n01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,240\nHe's Geordi Laforge's buddy.\n\n1364\n01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:51,756\n>> Yes exactly.\n\n1365\n01:02:51,756 --> 01:02:53,318\n>> I remember he was very unsocial.\n\n1366\n01:02:53,318 --> 01:02:54,800\n>> Right, right.\n\n1367\n01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,160\nKind of super nervous skittish one.\n\n1368\n01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,060\n>> And then he became the super brain and\ncame out of his shell.\n\n1369\n01:02:59,060 --> 01:02:59,600\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n1370\n01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,040\nSo it's kind of the same concept, right?\n\n1371\n01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,210\nSame concept.\n\n1372\n01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,637\nAlright so now that we're done\ndoing the little sci-fi walk back.\n\n1373\n01:03:04,637 --> 01:03:07,490\n>> [LAUGH] A little Star Wars trivia,\nI mean Star Trek trivia.\n\n1374\n01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:08,080\n>> Yep.\nYep.\n\n1375\n01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,650\nAlright so that's kind of an example now,\nevery one of those things.\n\n1376\n01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:14,750\nSo Malware types, let's talk about\nmalware types and what they are and\n\n1377\n01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:18,100\nmore importantly just define some\nof the different types that exist.\n\n1378\n01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,340\nGo through it again kind of\na vocabulary list here for\n\n1379\n01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:23,350\nyou, and make sure that your\ncomfortable with all this.\n\n1380\n01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:26,330\nSo when we talked about malware, what we\nare really talking about at the end of\n\n1381\n01:03:26,330 --> 01:03:31,050\nthe day is different kinds of code, right,\nthat has been written, typically but\n\n1382\n01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:34,270\na hacker of some kine, or\na bad actor that's up to no good [LAUGH]\n\n1383\n01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:37,080\nthat's going to be used in some sort,\nthat's what we called them, bad actors.\n\n1384\n01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:37,975\n>> Bad actors, nice.\n\n1385\n01:03:37,975 --> 01:03:38,660\n[LAUGH]\n>> We could come\n\n1386\n01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,540\nup with a laundry list of\nnames that go on that list,\n\n1387\n01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:45,246\nright that's what we are talking about\n>> But generically, without naming names,\n\n1388\n01:03:45,246 --> 01:03:48,420\na bad actor, and\nthis is somebody who's up to know good.\n\n1389\n01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:51,903\nTypically we refer to those people, more\noften than not generically as a class or\n\n1390\n01:03:51,903 --> 01:03:53,320\ncategories, hackers.\n\n1391\n01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,816\nAnd so those hackers are gonna be\nwriting this code, this exploit code,\n\n1392\n01:03:56,816 --> 01:03:57,572\nthis malware.\n\n1393\n01:03:57,572 --> 01:04:00,458\nIt's going to effectively then be able\nto come in and do a variety of things.\n\n1394\n01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:04,646\nAnd so it's not just, oh we have malware,\nit's welcome to malware is us and\n\n1395\n01:04:04,646 --> 01:04:07,275\nwhat kind of malware are you looking for\ntoday.\n\n1396\n01:04:07,275 --> 01:04:10,639\nBecause you know we have so many different\nkinds today that we really have to go\n\n1397\n01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:12,160\nthrough and define what they are.\n\n1398\n01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,631\nAnd so we have a virus,\nviruses are pretty standard but\n\n1399\n01:04:14,631 --> 01:04:16,189\nimportant to know what they are and\n\n1400\n01:04:16,189 --> 01:04:20,058\nmore importantly what they're not, when we\ncompare viruses for instance to a worm,\n\n1401\n01:04:20,058 --> 01:04:24,060\nwe have different approaches different\nthings that will or will not happen.\n\n1402\n01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:27,000\nAnd so a virus is typically\na small little bit of code, right,\n\n1403\n01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,392\nit affects the host application.\n\n1404\n01:04:28,392 --> 01:04:32,410\nIt is programming code,\nthe difference is that viruses,\n\n1405\n01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:36,050\njust like in the real world,a\nvirus is going to infect the host,\n\n1406\n01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:39,800\nand then it replicates and\nspreads from one system to another.\n\n1407\n01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,530\nSo if I infect you with the virus,\nand you're walking around,\n\n1408\n01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:45,820\nyou may then actually go ahead and\ntransmit it to somebody else.\n\n1409\n01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:49,040\nBut I have to infect you in order for\nyou to infect somebody else.\n\n1410\n01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:52,370\nSo we need some transmission\nhelp in effect, with a virus.\n\n1411\n01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:55,350\nViruses have to infect hosts, and\nthen hosts have to then spread\n\n1412\n01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:58,980\nthe virus around in some way,\nwhereas worms are gonna self replicate.\n\n1413\n01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:02,710\nWe don't need to infect anything, we're\njust gonna propagate and whatever system\n\n1414\n01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:06,245\nwe touch we're gonna keep going and so\nit's a lot of different approach there.\n\n1415\n01:05:06,245 --> 01:05:09,543\nSo that's a virus generic,\nanother different category of viruses.\n\n1416\n01:05:09,543 --> 01:05:11,370\nWe have macroviruses.\n\n1417\n01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:13,910\nThese are ones that are written in some\nsort of macro language, and they're\n\n1418\n01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:18,170\ngonna provide the ability to be able to\nspread when somebody executes the macro.\n\n1419\n01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:22,480\nLike the I Love You virus, Melissa,\nthese were macroviruses back in the day.\n\n1420\n01:05:23,825 --> 01:05:25,185\nCompression viruses.\n\n1421\n01:05:25,185 --> 01:05:26,715\nThis appends itself to an executable,\n\n1422\n01:05:26,715 --> 01:05:29,615\nand compresses are in the executable\nwhen it's compressed.\n\n1423\n01:05:29,615 --> 01:05:32,465\nAnd then when you effectively\nexecute the executable,\n\n1424\n01:05:32,465 --> 01:05:35,215\nthe compression virus pops up and\nthen does whatever it's supposed to do.\n\n1425\n01:05:35,215 --> 01:05:35,905\n>> Surprise.\n\n1426\n01:05:35,905 --> 01:05:36,655\n>> Surprise, right?\n\n1427\n01:05:36,655 --> 01:05:41,700\nSo when you download that unicorn screen\nsaver or something off the internet,\n\n1428\n01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:44,210\nthis is when you get one of those,\nor if someone is giving you,\n\n1429\n01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:46,640\nif they're mailing you zip files for\ninstance, things like that,\n\n1430\n01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,490\nyou open that up and there is typically\nall this random garbage in there, right?\n\n1431\n01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:52,000\n>> Check out this free game of Tetris,\nyou are gonna love it!\n\n1432\n01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:52,970\n>> That kind of stuff, exactly.\n\n1433\n01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:56,400\nThat's, by the way also, how stuff is\ncoming out of the app stores today.\n\n1434\n01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,610\n>> Right.\n>> A lot of these\n\n1435\n01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:01,050\nAPKs that are infecting on the Android\nplatform are infecting people or\n\n1436\n01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:02,640\ncoming through compression viruses.\n\n1437\n01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,590\nOr a modern derivative of that,\ncuz they're basically in the store,\n\n1438\n01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:06,600\ninside the code.\n\n1439\n01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,090\nYou go download code,\nblow it up on your system and install it.\n\n1440\n01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:13,620\nAnd as a result of uncompressing the code,\nopening up the APK,\n\n1441\n01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:17,470\nwhich is basically the loader file, you\neffectively then are launching the virus.\n\n1442\n01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,000\nSo that's what's happening.\n\n1443\n01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,350\nStealth viruses, they basically, these\nviruses are gonna make modifications and\n\n1444\n01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:26,410\nhide modification,\ngonna try to hide themselves.\n\n1445\n01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:27,540\nSo it'll be stealth, right?\n\n1446\n01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:30,040\nAnd so the virus tries to\ntrick the antivirus software\n\n1447\n01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:33,270\nby in effect getting between it and\nthe program that's running.\n\n1448\n01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:37,200\nSo the antivirus and the system and\nintercepts the calls and tries to hide.\n\n1449\n01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,723\nSo it's kind of interesting because it\nburrows deep inside of the system and\n\n1450\n01:06:41,723 --> 01:06:44,700\ntries to in effect intercept,\nman in the middle.\n\n1451\n01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:49,002\nRight, and redirect through some sort\nof replay and redirection attack.\n\n1452\n01:06:49,002 --> 01:06:53,710\nIt's gonna redirect those intercept calls\naround trying to get the anti virus engine\n\n1453\n01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,990\nto pick up on the fact that it's a virus\nand it's gonna provide false information.\n\n1454\n01:06:56,990 --> 01:07:00,960\nOh I'm not a virus, pay no attention to\nthe man over here behind the curtain.\n\n1455\n01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,230\nI'm perfectly fine, my file type's okay.\n\n1456\n01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:04,100\n>> Absolutely.\n>> You don't want to pay attention to me.\n\n1457\n01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:06,920\n>> Your antivirus software is running,\nand it's reporting back and so\n\n1458\n01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:07,940\nyou think everything is okay.\n\n1459\n01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:10,560\n>> So does the system until-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1460\n01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,130\n>> Goes out and becomes a mad dog\nserial killer late at night and\n\n1461\n01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,380\ntakes down machines.\n\n1462\n01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:17,190\nRight, so polymorphic virus,\n\n1463\n01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:21,960\nthis is going to be a virus that copies\nitself but creates copes that are varied.\n\n1464\n01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,220\nSo it's gonna constantly be morphing.\n\n1465\n01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:25,580\nNo parts will remain identical.\n\n1466\n01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,940\nIt's gonna just reinvent\nitself on the fly.\n\n1467\n01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:30,600\nIncredibly difficult to\ndetect this with modern\n\n1468\n01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,890\nvirus software that uses signatures.\n\n1469\n01:07:32,890 -->

01:07:37,520\n>> That's more than impressive.\n\n1472\n01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,720\nThat is badass, okay?\n\n1473\n01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:39,460\n>> Right?\nThe fact that this\n\n1474\n01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:40,870\ncode can modify itself,\n>> Yeah.\n\n1475\n01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:42,200\n>> And still function?\n\n1476\n01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,260\n>> Not just modify itself and\nfunction, but\n\n1477\n01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:48,038\nit modifies itself in such a way,\nthat it looks nothing like the original.\n\n1478\n01:07:48,038 --> 01:07:50,130\n>> Yes, that [INAUDIBLE] brilliant.\n\n1479\n01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:52,540\n>> A bunch of kids with no hobbies, right?\n\n1480\n01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:53,120\n>> Right.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1481\n01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,780\n>> And a lot of time on their hands.\n\n1482\n01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:55,280\nRight?\n>> Exactly.\n\n1483\n01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,620\n>> We could just get them like all\n\n1484\n01:07:56,620 -->

share going there that hive mind.\n\n1494\n01:08:13,945 --> 01:08:15,875\nRight?\nImagine what we could accomplish.\n\n1495\n01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:19,905\nFuel economy, renewable batteries,\nthe list is almost endless, right?\n\n1496\n01:08:19,905 --> 01:08:21,995\nAll right, so multipart virus here.\n\n1497\n01:08:21,995 --> 01:08:25,285\nMultipart virus or\nwhat's called a multipartite virus.\n\n1498\n01:08:25,285 --> 01:08:26,825\nSeveral different\ncomponents that make it up.\n\n1499\n01:08:26,825 --> 01:08:28,560\nThey're distributed around the system.\n\n1500\n01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:31,450\nWe basically infect and\nspread in multiple different ways.\n\n1501\n01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:33,460\nAgain, the virus is almost\nlike it's chopped up,\n\n1502\n01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,460\ndifferent pieces exist\nin different places.\n\n1503\n01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:36,960\nAlmost think of the wonder twins,\n\n1504\n01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,270\nremember the Justice League of America,\nwonder twin powers activate.\n\n1505\n01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:41,090\n>> Activate form of.\n\n1506\n01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:44,850\n>> Pail of water, shape of-\n>> He always picked the best

and\nyou know Gleek would come along and\n\n1509\n01:08:51,083 --> 01:08:53,090\ntoss them into the water or\nwhatever it was.\n\n1510\n01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:57,850\nYou always have to have your sideshow,\nyou need your Gleek, that's what you need.\n\n1511\n01:08:57,850 --> 01:09:00,740\nSo you have this kind of stuff, but\nI often think of something like that where\n\n1512\n01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:03,480\nall the parts kind of come together\nbefore anything can happen, but\n\n1513\n01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,350\nonce it does look out,\nbecause now we've got a big problem.\n\n1514\n01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,160\nAnd again, think about it.\n\n1515\n01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:11,810\nHow do you go and find a virus if\nthe signature is, it's looking for\n\n1516\n01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:15,910\nthe entire virus, and the virus is there,\nbut it's there in three or four parts.\n\n1517\n01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:17,650\nThe signature isn't looking for the parts.\n\n1518\n01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:18,870\nIt's looking for the whole thing.\n\n1519\n01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:22,230\nSo until the whole thing comes together,\nwe don't know we've got a virus, and\n\n1520\n01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:25,490\nwhen it does come together\nit's already infecting, so\n\n1521\n01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:27,780\nas a result it's kind of hard\nat that point to deal with it.\n\n1522\n01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:30,144\nSo again this is almost like\na fragmentation attack [CROSSTALK]\n\n1523\n01:09:30,144 --> 01:09:30,966\nbreaking things up.\n\n1524\n01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:32,685\n>> Of course you were.\n\n1525\n01:09:32,685 --> 01:09:36,500\n[LAUGH] Riding on my coat tales here are\nMatt [INAUDIBLE] I think you were thinking\n\n1526\n01:09:36,500 -->

01:09:46,110\nAgain, this idea almost like\na virus that stealths itself.\n\n1532\n01:09:46,110 --> 01:09:49,590\nIt's gonna hide, but it's gonna do so\nby modifying its own code so\n\n1533\n01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:51,620\nit doesn't quite match that signature.\n\n1534\n01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:54,160\nIt is something similar, self-garbling.\n\n1535\n01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:59,250\nSomething similar to either a polymorphic\nvirus where it's kind of morphing and\n\n1536\n01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:02,200\nchanging, something similar to that.\n\n1537\n01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,360\nNot quite as intense,\nit doesn't transform itself totally so\n\n1538\n01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,850\nthat nothing looks the same but\nit garbles enough.\n\n1539\n01:10:07,850 -->

like a chain letter,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1565\n01:10:57,946 --> 01:10:58,787\n>> Thank you, mom.\n\n1566\n01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:01,030\n>> Exactly.\n>> She always forwards those on.\n\n1567\n01:11:01,030 --> 01:11:02,120\n>> So that's what that is.\n\n1568\n01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:03,160\nIt's not really a virus.\n\n1569\n01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,920\nWe just classify it that way.\n\n1570\n01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:06,940\nYou wanna just be aware about that,\nthink about that.\n\n1571\n01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:08,240\nWe've got bots down there.\n\n1572\n01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:12,190\nBots are going to be machines that have\neffectively been taken over by some sort\n\n1573\n01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:13,660\nof remote-access trojan or\n\n1574\n01:11:13,660 --> 01:11:17,420\npiece of malware that\neffectively zombies the machine.\n\n1575\n01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,020\nThese days,\nwe refer to it as being zombie.\n\n1576\n01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,830\nWe used to call it bot back in the day.\n\n1577\n01:11:20,830 --> 01:11:23,560\nBefore real world TV got a hold of it,\nright?\n\n1578\n01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:26,480\nDecided to make zombies all\nthe rage in the last couple years.\n\n1579\n01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,290\nAnd so as a result, what we see is just\na machine that's been taken over and\n\n1580\n01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:34,290\ncan be remotely controlled by what's\ncalled a command and control server.\n\n1581\n01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:37,390\nAnd so we go from having a single\nbot to what are called bot armies,\n\n1582\n01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:40,930\nwhere basically thousands of these\nmachines are aggregated together\n\n1583\n01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:44,290\nwith command and control\ninfrastructure to go out and attack\n\n1584\n01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:48,010\neither through distributed denial of\nservice or some other mechanism machines.\n\n1585\n01:11:48,010 --> 01:11:49,730\nThese are effectively for sale.\n\n1586\n01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:53,043\nYou go out on the black market,\non the internet, [CROSSTALK]\n\n1587\n01:11:53,043 --> 01:11:54,555\n>> Rent some time on a bot net.\n\n1588\n01:11:54,555 --> 01:11:57,594\n>> Absolutely, some of these sites\nlike Silk Road which was taken down\n\n1589\n01:11:57,594 --> 01:12:00,796\na while back around the whole Bitcoin\nthing were obviously doing things\n\n1590\n01:12:00,796 --> 01:12:04,051\nlike selling drugs and selling weapons and\nall sorts of stuff there, but\n\n1591\n01:12:04,051 --> 01:12:05,833\naside from all that illicit activity.\n\n1592\n01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:08,460\nOne of the things you could do is\nyou effectively could rent botnets.\n\n1593\n01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,713\nYou could get access to\nthese security solutions, or\n\n1594\n01:12:10,713 --> 01:12:13,580\nthese anti-security solutions I\nguess you could think of them as.\n\n1595\n01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:16,940\nAnd in the black market, especially\nin places like Eastern Europe and\n\n1596\n01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:19,910\nplaces like that where a lot of this\ncommand and control structure lives.\n\n1597\n01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:22,890\nToday, you can go out for\na few bucks, literally.\n\n1598\n01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:25,724\nIn some cases 50, 100 UFs,\nnot a lot of money.\n\n1599\n01:12:25,724 --> 01:12:28,620\nYou could rent a botnet, and\nyou could have several thousand bots.\n\n1600\n01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:31,079\nYou get what's called a bot herder,\nthis is the guy or\n\n1601\n01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:33,270\ngirl who basically controls those bots.\n\n1602\n01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:36,670\nAnd you just contact them through\nthe black market, underground.\n\n1603\n01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:38,181\nAnd you say, hey, this is what I need.\n\n1604\n01:12:38,181 --> 01:12:40,130\nI need this many machines\ncapable of doing this.\n\n1605\n01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:41,150\nI want them for this long.\n\n1606\n01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:43,390\nI need them to be able to go over here and\ndo this.\n\n1607\n01:12:43,390 --> 01:12:45,880\nAnd geographically, they figure out\nkinda where these things are and\n\n1608\n01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:46,700\nwhat they can give you.\n\n1609\n01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:48,830\nAnd you get a message that\nsays kinda here you go.\n\n1610\n01:12:48,830 --> 01:12:50,920\nYou get a little web interface,\nyou log in.\n\n1611\n01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,740\nCommand and\ncontrol infrastructure is just all there.\n\n1612\n01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:53,460\nIt's all remote today.\n\n1613\n01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:55,224\nIt's all cloud-based.\n\n1614\n01:12:55,224 --> 01:12:57,724\nAt least, wink, wink,\nthat's what I've been told anyway.\n\n1615\n01:12:57,724 --> 01:12:58,556\nRight?\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1616\n01:12:58,556 --> 01:12:59,807\nYes.\n>> And supposedly,\n\n1617\n01:12:59,807 --> 01:13:03,306\nwe wanna put that disclaimer in there,\nit's all command based today or\n\n1618\n01:13:03,306 --> 01:13:05,410\nrather it's all cloud-based today.\n\n1619\n01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:07,186\nAnd so as a result, you just basically,\n\n1620\n01:13:07,186 --> 01:13:09,235\nyou get this surreptitious\nemail in the mail.\n\n1621\n01:13:09,235 --> 01:13:13,047\nAnd they'll go here, hit this link, log\nin, you got 12 hours or whatever you want,\n\n1622\n01:13:13,047 --> 01:13:16,441\nyou take this thing, it's like an ion can,\nand you move it, you fire it, and\n\n1623\n01:13:16,441 --> 01:13:17,880\nyou take down a network.\n\n1624\n01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,770\nAnd that's, again, couple hundred dollars.\n\n1625\n01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:22,390\nIt's really, really straightforward,\nor so I've been told.\n\n1626\n01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:23,510\n>> Exactly.\n\n1627\n01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:25,618\n>> Worms, unlike viruses,\nwe talked about this.\n\n1628\n01:13:25,618 --> 01:13:28,890\nThey're different from viruses, they can\nreproduce on their own without a host.\n\n1629\n01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:30,710\nSo, they're effectively self-contained.\n\n1630\n01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:33,020\nPlease make sure you know that\ndistinction, that difference.\n\n1631\n01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:34,670\nNot just know all\nthe different virus types,\n\n1632\n01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:37,120\nbut know the main difference\nbetween a worm and a virus.\n\n1633\n01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:37,690\nVery important.\n\n1634\n01:13:37,690 --> 01:13:41,473\nViruses need the host to replicate\nthrough in order to spread, worms do not.\n\n1635\n01:13:41,473 --> 01:13:43,265\nIt's actually point them and go.\n\n1636\n01:13:43,265 --> 01:13:46,171\nAnd that's obviously why they get out\nof control really quickly here, and\n\n1637\n01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:49,140\nwe're not paying attention so\nwe're gonna have a problem.\n\n1638\n01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:52,920\nLogic bomb, this is something that's\ngonna execute at a certain point in time,\n\n1639\n01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,810\ncertain date or something like that.\n\n1640\n01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:58,690\nThe famous ones like Michelangelo,\nwould happen on Michelangelo's birthday.\n\n1641\n01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:02,380\nApril Fools Day,\nthere's all this stuff that happens then.\n\n1642\n01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:03,280\nThat kind of thing.\n\n1643\n01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:08,300\nSo, they're basically pieces of\nmalware that have a date or a time or\n\n1644\n01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:12,310\nsome sort of event that triggers them,\nwhatever that is.\n\n1645\n01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:14,595\n>> The day my name does\nnot show up on payroll.\n\n1646\n01:14:14,595 --> 01:14:16,265\n[SOUND] That's when mine goes.\n\n1647\n01:14:16,265 --> 01:14:19,460\n[LAUGH]\n>> Good to know.\n\n1648\n01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:22,044\nMake sure everybody just gets\na chance to play that back and\n\n1649\n01:14:22,044 --> 01:14:23,848\nlisten to that before we finish up here.\n\n1650\n01:14:23,848 --> 01:14:24,950\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That day may be today.\n\n1651\n01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:26,170\n>> Yeah, right.\n>> When you say it like that.\n\n1652\n01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:28,015\nYou always wanna be careful\nabout that kinda stuff, right?\n\n1653\n01:14:28,015 --> 01:14:30,413\nSo, the idea here is and\nMike makes a joke about it, and\n\n1654\n01:14:30,413 --> 01:14:32,723\nobviously it's clear that we're joking,\nright?\n\n1655\n01:14:32,723 --> 01:14:33,515\nYou we're joking weren't you?\n\n1656\n01:14:33,515 --> 01:14:34,348\n>> I was joking, Tim.\n\n1657\n01:14:34,348 --> 01:14:34,890\nIt's all good.\n\n1658\n01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:36,147\n>> You always want to make sure.\n\n1659\n01:14:36,147 --> 01:14:39,596\nWe joke about this kind of stuff, but\nthere have been cases, all kidding aside,\n\n1660\n01:14:39,596 --> 01:14:41,780\nwhere this kind of thing\nis exactly what happens.\n\n1661\n01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:42,756\nIt is a logic bomb.\n\n1662\n01:14:42,756 --> 01:14:45,100\nSomebody says,\nI think there's going to be an issue.\n\n1663\n01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:46,260\nI'm skating on thin ice or whatever.\n\n1664\n01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:47,170\nThey get the sense.\n\n1665\n01:14:47,170 --> 01:14:48,730\nThey do write a piece of code.\n\n1666\n01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:52,570\nPut it in there where effectively it says,\nbasically check payroll and\n\n1667\n01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:55,580\nevery two weeks and if my name\nis not on there execute this and\n\n1668\n01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,050\nwipe the hard drives or whatever it is.\n\n1669\n01:14:57,050 --> 01:14:59,050\nAnd so\nthat's not far fetched by any means.\n\n1670\n01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:02,706\nThat is actually some of the stuff\nwe find when we talk about this.\n\n1671\n01:15:02,706 --> 01:15:05,740\nAll right, rootkits, rootkits are gonna be\nmalicious tools loaded onto a compromised\n\n1672\n01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:08,370\nsystem, typically through some\nsort of stealthy technique.\n\n1673\n01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:11,558\nSo, a lot of times a remote access\ntrojan is gonna open up a system and\n\n1674\n01:15:11,558 --> 01:15:13,560\nthen allow rootkits to\nbe installed to do that.\n\n1675\n01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,510\n>> Right.\n>> So, we have rootkits that are gonna\n\n1676\n01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:16,821\n>> We often refer to systems that\n\n1677\n01:15:16,821 --> 01:15:19,820\nhave been installed, that has\nrootkit installed as being rooted.\n\n1678\n01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:23,140\nSo, when a system has been rooted,\nit is because it has a rootkit in it.\n\n1679\n01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:27,120\nAnd it gives us then typically\naccess to it to manage it.\n\n1680\n01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,130\nA trojan horse, it's a program that\nis disguised as something else.\n\n1681\n01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:32,300\nSo, like we've talked about,\nyou will download, for\n\n1682\n01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:35,970\ninstance, a piece of software,\nit does what it says it does but\n\n1683\n01:15:35,970 --> 01:15:39,040\nthere's also a lot of unadvertised\nstuff that we don't know about.\n\n1684\n01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:41,181\nIt does other stuff, that's trojan horse.\n\n1685\n01:15:41,181 --> 01:15:43,685\nA remote access trojan,\nI mentioned just a minute ago,\n\n1686\n01:15:43,685 --> 01:15:46,615\nit's often how we deliver rootkits\ninto systems, will be RATs or\n\n1687\n01:15:46,615 --> 01:15:50,048\nrootkits will open up access by installing\na RAT, kind of can go either way.\n\n1688\n01:15:50,048 --> 01:15:53,987\nA malicious program's running, basically\nallowing us to get in behind the scenes\n\n1689\n01:15:53,987 --> 01:15:56,640\nwhenever we want will be a RAT or\na remote access Trojan.\n\n1690\n01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:57,267\nYeah, we're done.\n\n1691\n01:15:57,267 --> 01:16:02,127\nAnd then immunizer is gonna be this\nidea that we attach code to the file or\n\n1692\n01:16:02,127 --> 01:16:03,180\napplication.\n\n1693\n01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:05,200\nIt attaches code to file or application.\n\n1694\n01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:09,870\nThis is actually incredibly cool cuz\nwhat an immunizer does is effectively,\n\n1695\n01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,690\nthis is from the defense perspective.\n\n1696\n01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:15,270\nSo, this is not let me stealth the virus.\n\n1697\n01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:16,890\nThis is let me stealth the system.\n\n1698\n01:16:16,890 --> 01:16:19,785\nSo, this is kind of cool because what\nwe've done now is and said, okay, well,\n\n1699\n01:16:19,785 --> 01:16:21,015\ntake a page from the hacker book.\n\n1700\n01:16:21,015 --> 01:16:23,542\nHackers are gonna change\nthe structure of the virus,\n\n1701\n01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:25,634\nmake it look like something when it's not.\n\n1702\n01:16:25,634 --> 01:16:28,360\nSo, the virus vendors are saying,\nwell, why don't we use that as well?\n\n1703\n01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,650\nWhy don't we pretend to infect the system?\n\n1704\n01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:33,545\nMake it look like the virus\nhas already been there.\n\n1705\n01:16:33,545 --> 01:16:37,235\nViruses then not gonna infect because\nit says well, I can't swap out for\n\n1706\n01:16:37,235 --> 01:16:39,855\nthat DLL cuz DLL's already\nbeen swapped out for.\n\n1707\n01:16:39,855 --> 01:16:42,985\nSo, I'm basically done,\nmy work here is done, and they leave.\n\n1708\n01:16:42,985 --> 01:16:47,015\nSo, it's just like inoculating the system\nby giving you a little bit of that live\n\n1709\n01:16:47,015 --> 01:16:50,185\nvirus, is what we do in the real world\nto make it look like it's been infected,\n\n1710\n01:16:50,185 --> 01:16:51,635\nthis is what an immunizer does.\n\n1711\n01:16:51,635 --> 01:16:52,615\nIt's actually kind of cool.\n\n1712\n01:16:52,615 --> 01:16:53,485\n>> It is.\n>> It's a concept.\n\n1713\n01:16:53,485 --> 01:16:54,932\n>> Right.\n\n1714\n01:16:54,932 --> 01:16:58,749\nAnd then behavior blocking, allowing\nsuspicious code to execute within the OS,\n\n1715\n01:16:58,749 --> 01:17:00,860\nbut we kinda watch it and\nsee what it does.\n\n1716\n01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:03,670\nThis is almost like creating\na miniature honey pot.\n\n1717\n01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:04,170\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n1718\n01:17:04,170 --> 01:17:05,981\n>> Within the system in a virtualized\n\n1719\n01:17:05,981 --> 01:17:08,605\nsandbox allowing it to\nexecute inside crucible,\n\n1720\n01:17:08,605 --> 01:17:12,137\nseeing what's going on, examining it.\nAnd then we can learn from it so\n\n1721\n01:17:12,137 --> 01:17:15,574\nnow we say okay when these does happen,\nnow we know we have to watch for this,\n\n1722\n01:17:15,574 --> 01:17:16,519\nthis and this\n>> So\n\n1723\n01:17:16,519 --> 01:17:17,940\nthis is what's called behavior blocking.\n\n1724\n01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:20,955\nA lot of the artificial intelligence\nsystems, the ones that are using\n\n1725\n01:17:20,955 --> 01:17:23,860\nheuristics, are doing this kind of stuff\nwhere they're effectively going in and\n\n1726\n01:17:23,860 --> 01:17:25,620\ntrying to use this kind of approach.\n\n1727\n01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:27,598\n>> Very good.\n>> So, some interesting stuff there.\n\n1728\n01:17:27,598 --> 01:17:28,640\n>> All right, well, thank you.\n\n1729\n01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,140\n>> I am unfortunately out\nof things to talk about.\n\n1730\n01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:32,765\n>> Out of things to talk about.\n\n1731\n01:17:32,765 --> 01:17:33,265\n>> I am.\n\n1732\n01:17:33,265 --> 01:17:34,765\n>> No way, come on.\n\n1733\n01:17:34,765 --> 01:17:36,229\nI mean I could talk about other things.\n\n1734\n01:17:36,229 --> 01:17:37,520\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n>> Maybe I should.\n\n1735\n01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,860\nLet me step back and try that again.\n\n1736\n01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,302\nSo I'm not out of things to talk about,\n\n1737\n01:17:40,302 --> 01:17:43,016\nI'm out of things to talk about that\ncontextually would make sense in this\n\n1738\n01:17:43,016 -->

welcome, everybody,\nto another episode of ITProTV.\n\n5\n00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:40,790\nMy name is Mike Rodrick, and\nwith me today is our very good friend,\n\n6\n00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,270\nspecial guest, Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,150\nHow you doing today, Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:45,020\n>> Good, good, how's everybody doing?\n\n9\n00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,220\n>> Hopefully they're doing well.\n\n10\n00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,370\nI know I am.\n>> Hopefully, hopefully.\n\n11\n00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,480\n>> It's another beautiful day in paradise.\n\n12\n00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,110\n>> It is, it is blue shirt day.\n\n13\n00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,280\n>> It is blue shirt day.\n\n14\n00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,120\nI got the memo, thanks for\nsending that out.\n\n15\n00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,800\nToday we are getting\nback into our CISSP track\n\n16\n00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,250\nin our episode today is gonna be going\nover encryption and cryptography.\n\n17\n00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:05,590\nSo exciting stuff here.\n\n18\n00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,320\nSo, we'll start off just kinda doing\nsome basic terminology, getting that\n\n19\n00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,040\nfoundational knowledge that we need to be\nable to cover the more advanced topics and\n\n20\n00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,050\nthen we are gonna go in and\nlook at some of the algorithms.\n\n21\n00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,322\nAnd may take a little bit to look at how\nthey work and where we might use them and\n\n22\n00:01:18,322 --> 00:01:21,771\nsome things we gotta know for the exam,\nwhat type they are and things like that.\n\n23\n00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:23,710\n>> Cool, so I can go sit down for\na little bit.\n\n24\n00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,030\nYou got that covered, right?\n\n25\n00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,450\n>> You know,\nI think it's just the opposite.\n\n26\n00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,203\nI'm gonna kick back and\ntake some notes for you and\n\n27\n00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:29,546\nmake sure you guys have what you need.\n\n28\n00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:31,390\n>> All right.\n>> And we're gonna let Adam go through\n\n29\n00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:31,940\nall of this.\n\n30\n00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,910\nWe'll do a blue team shirt effort\nhere to bring that all on, so\n\n31\n00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,160\nwhat we're gonna do and\nMike set it up for us perfectly.\n\n32\n00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,150\nWe're gonna start out\nwith some vocabulary.\n\n33\n00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:44,329\nThere's gonna be some, some things we want\nto go through and just make sure that we\n\n34\n00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:48,569\nhave laid out, probably good way to frame\nthis or put this out there would be again,\n\n35\n00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:51,687\nflash card material rights and\ndefinitions of some things.\n\n36\n00:01:51,687 --> 00:01:55,320\nThings that we're just gonna have to brute\nforce through, no pun intended there.\n\n37\n00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,020\nBrute force through and really understand\ndefinitions and replacement of.\n\n38\n00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,750\nAnd then along the way, we'll get into\nsome of the more in-depth material,\n\n39\n00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,540\nstart talking about the algorithms.\n\n40\n00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,050\n>> And how they work, and\nthings of that nature.\n\n41\n00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,890\nSo sit back, relax, and get ready for\n\n42\n00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,360\n30 minutes episode of everything you\never wanted to know about cryptography\n\n43\n00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,600\nvocabulary, but were afraid to ask,\nvery, very important.\n\n44\n00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,450\nAll right, so\nlet's talk about some vocabulary words.\n\n45\n00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,300\nSo we have some things\nwe already put up there.\n\n46\n00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,580\nWe're gonna add a couple\nalong the way as we go.\n\n47\n00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,978\nJust want to throw in a couple of things,\nbut let's start with, actually,\n\n48\n00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:28,798\nlet's add a couple of things at the top.\n\n49\n00:02:28,798 --> 00:02:33,919\nSo just a couple examples of some older\ncryptographic methods which I just\n\n50\n00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:39,455\nwant to capture probably the very first\nplace we see cryptography showing up and\n\n51\n00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:44,329\nmaking its appearance will be in an old\ncipher solution that was used in\n\n52\n00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:49,510\nthe Hebrew cryptographic method,\ncalled Atbash, A-T-B-A-S-H.\n\n53\n00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,340\nSo first recognized,\nor first recorded, ATB.\n\n54\n00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:57,758\nA-S-H, ATBASH.\n\n55\n00:02:57,758 --> 00:03:04,080\nSo the first kinda typical recorded\nsolution we see would be known as Atbash.\n\n56\n00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,780\nWe tend to think about hieroglyphics\nin Egypt as being certainly a form of\n\n57\n00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,890\nencryption.\n\n58\n00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,240\nYou know, they were using pictographs\nin order to represent information.\n\n59\n00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,660\nIf you didn't understand\nwhat the picture was,\n\n60\n00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:17,060\nobviously it didn't make\na lot of sense to you.\n\n61\n00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,590\nRight, that kind of thing, so that would\nhave been another example early on.\n\n62\n00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,370\nBut any of these ways in which\nwe represent information through\n\n63\n00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,820\nsome sort of system that would\nrequire us to be able to have a key,\n\n64\n00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,270\nin effect, to understand how to read it\ncould be considered some form of this.\n\n65\n00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,220\nSo Egyptian hieroglyphics,\nhieroglyphics would have been\n\n66\n00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,590\nprobably another good example,\nright, the picture language.\n\n67\n00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,350\nBut we really think of Atbash as being\nkinda the first that we see recorded,\n\n68\n00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,450\nwritten down, widely disseminated,\nnot carved into a wall somewhere and\n\n69\n00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,040\nkinda stuck up there so that you\ncould see it if you were there, but\n\n70\n00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,710\nit's really hard to then figure out.\n\n71\n00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,875\nRight because if you weren't in front\nof it you didn't have a picture,\n\n72\n00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:52,440\nwe didn't reproduce it.\n\n73\n00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,230\nSo it's a little bit more difficult.\n\n74\n00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,960\nSo we point to at that as actually\nbeing that historical reference point,\n\n75\n00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,350\nwe also talk about ideas\nof substitution ciphers.\n\n76\n00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,140\nI believe we do defer to this and\nhave this refer to this,\n\n77\n00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,860\nrather, somewhere down below on our list,\nbut a substitution cipher\n\n78\n00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,230\nis gonna be this idea of basically taking\nsomething and substituting meaning for it.\n\n79\n00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,140\nSo, you could think of the hieroglyphics\nas being a representation of this,\n\n80\n00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,490\nwhere a picture substituted for\nwords, right?\n\n81\n00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,850\nSo that kind of idea is\nwhat we would think of, but\n\n82\n00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,470\nwe really start seeing substitution\nciphers coming out and\n\n83\n00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,830\nreally becoming prevalent,\nbeing recorded, being disseminated.\n\n84\n00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,720\nPeople being using them being aware of\nthem as we think about applying them\n\n85\n00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,350\nto alphabets.\n\n86\n00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,490\nNot so much as pictures on a wall but\nreally, written alphabets that\n\n87\n00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,720\nwere used and widely disseminated,\nso we talk about monoalphabetic and\n\n88\n00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,510\npolyalphabetic substitution ciphers as\nbeing two types of substitution ciphers.\n\n89\n00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,600\nThe monoalphabetic cipher, the one that\nis going to use a single alphabet,\n\n90\n00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,560\nwhereas a polyalphabetic\nsubstitution cipher,\n\n91\n00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,060\nwe'll simply use multiple alphabets,\nright?\n\n92\n00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,010\nSo we may combine two or three together\nin order to then create the matrix that\n\n93\n00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,610\nwould affect what would be used\nto drive the substitution.\n\n94\n00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,860\nSo these are early examples.\n\n95\n00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,960\nThese are just some\nearly examples of this.\n\n96\n00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,900\nI know we also have a Scytale,\nwhat's a Scytale cipher,\n\n97\n00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,890\nthat we probably just wanna throw\nup there as an example, also.\n\n98\n00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,878\nA Scytale cipher,\nkinda interesting concept, right?\n\n99\n00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:17,290\nThe Scytale cipher would be when\nyou basically would wrap, and\n\n100\n00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,070\nwe have it down there with the Caesar\ncipher and the Vigenere and all those.\n\n101\n00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,700\nSo just an example of the way\nin which this is done,\n\n102\n00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,270\nyou would take some sort of a strip,\nat that point it was papyrus, right?\n\n103\n00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,170\nEarly writing was done on papyrus paper.\n\n104\n00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:34,571\nSo you'd write out the code on the papyrus\nscript, you would then take it and you\n\n105\n00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:38,905\nwould be able to wrap it around some sort\nof staff, you know, a length of pole or\n\n106\n00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:42,740\nsomething, and would write out\nthe cipher wrapped around the pole.\n\n107\n00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,430\nSo it effectively be written in\ncyclical form or cylindrical form.\n\n108\n00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,600\nSo, you imagine a cylinder of some kind,\nmaybe a spear or some sort of a staff,\n\n109\n00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,320\na walking staff, right?\n\n110\n00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,530\n>> And that staff diameter could change,\nright?\n\n111\n00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,750\nIf you didn't have the right\ndiameter on that staff.\n\n112\n00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,320\n>> Exactly, exactly.\n\n113\n00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,360\n>> The letters aren't gonna line up.\n\n114\n00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,664\n>> And you can see there,\nif it was an octagonal shape or\n\n115\n00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:04,540\nif it's a cylinder versus a longer or\nshorter one, right.\n\n116\n00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,590\nAnd so this idea that, exactly that,\n\n117\n00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,980\nwrapping it based on the dimensions\nwhen you wrapped it the right way,\n\n118\n00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,590\nknew where to start to wrap it, left\nto right, right to left kind of thing.\n\n119\n00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,680\n>> It would then basically create\nthe message by wrapping it and\n\n120\n00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,530\nlining up, in effect, the letters.\n\n121\n00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,640\nRight?\nBut then if you\n\n122\n00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,730\ndidn't have the right staff or for\nwhatever reason weren't wrapping\n\n123\n00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,650\nthis around the right shape of staff, the\nmessage would be just garbled gibberish.\n\n124\n00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,330\nAnd so\nwhat would be done is this was created,\n\n125\n00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,610\nthe staff was broken, right so that it\ncould not be used on the sending end and\n\n126\n00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,670\nthen the person that took the message\ndid not carry the staff, so\n\n127\n00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,170\nit had no way of understanding\nhow to decode it.\n\n128\n00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,210\nExactly so it got taken as a messenger and\nthey saw this, they would figure out\n\n129\n00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,380\nthey had to wrap it around and obviously\nand at that point that would be a problem.\n\n130\n00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,630\nSo did not have the staff and no way\nof knowing that the person on the other\n\n131\n00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,330\nend they were sending it to had a staff,\na mirror image if you will, right?\n\n132\n00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,110\n>> Right.\n>> And as a result,\n\n133\n00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,290\ncould then reproduce\nthe message on the other side.\n\n134\n00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,300\nSo if the messenger was intercepted,\nthey would have no way of basically\n\n135\n00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,680\ngiving out the information about\nhow to read the message, right?\n\n136\n00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,360\n>> That's pretty clever.\n\n137\n00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,286\n>> Unless they wrapped it around\nthe person's arm or something.\n\n138\n00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:08,010\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In which case,\n\n139\n00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,050\nyou know, that would be a problem to see\nthe guy walking down the road, but he has\n\n140\n00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:14,210\nthe message, and we know okay we'll just\nlay his arm out there and wrap it around\n\n141\n00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,520\nthat it would be potentially something\nthat obviously could be discovered.\n\n142\n00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,770\nSo this is how we did a scytale cipher.\n\n143\n00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,850\nCaesar ciphers also were used,\nnamed after Julius Caesar.\n\n144\n00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:28,210\nI believe you're also a distant\nrelative of his, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n145\n00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,120\n>> Yeah, yeah!\n>> You were a Caesar salad cipher today,\n\n146\n00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,630\nwere you not, right?\n\n147\n00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,200\n>> That's right.\n\n148\n00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,730\n>> So, Caesar ciphers, right,\n\n149\n00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,070\nwere going to be samples of\nmonoalphabetic substitutions.\n\n150\n00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,350\nWe said monoalphabetic up above\nwere single alphabetic ciphers.\n\n151\n00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,120\nAnd so\nCaesar cipher is an example of that.\n\n152\n00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,550\nWe may wanna throw that up top there.\n\n153\n00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,400\n>> Let's move this.\n\n154\n00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400\n>> And just put that up there.\n\n155\n00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,445\nAnd in addition to Caesar ciphers, we have\na modern day version of Caesar cipher,\n\n156\n00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:52,050\nby the way.\n\n157\n00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,993\nSo, Caesar cipher would be an example of,\nyeah, right, and\n\n158\n00:07:56,993 --> 00:08:00,130\nthen something called Rot, ROT 13,\n\n159\n00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,710\nRot 13 is a modern day example basically,\nor ROT!#.\n\n160\n00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,205\n>> I was encrypting the algorithm-\n>> You were encrypting it for us, exactly.\n\n161\n00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:11,380\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, it is a modern day version of\n\n162\n00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,070\nthe Caesar cipher.\n\n163\n00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,470\nIt is using an encryption process that\n\n164\n00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:20,560\nshifts 13 spaces instead of three,\nhence the term Raw 13.\n\n165\n00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,550\n>> I was thinking like\nthe Captain Crunch decoder rings.\n\n166\n00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,870\nOr the Cracker Jack's toys,\nthey basically do.\n\n167\n00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,850\n>> Yeah something similar like that.\n\n168\n00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,760\nSo big fan of the secret decoder toys?\n\n169\n00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,250\n>> Oh, absolutely,\nwhen I was a kid, absolutely.\n\n170\n00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,200\nAnd I think some of the advantage,\nthese algorithms seem relatively simple.\n\n171\n00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,100\nYou know, it's like okay we're\njust rotating 13 letters.\n\n172\n00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,850\nBut, when most of the population\ncouldn't read in the first place,\n\n173\n00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,910\nthe alphabet substitution\nactually worked pretty well.\n\n174\n00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,540\n>> You could have just held up\nthe message, not in an encoded format, and\n\n175\n00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,210\nsaid hey, what do I have in my hand?\n\n176\n00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,260\nAnd they would have looked at you and\ngone huh?\n\n177\n00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,290\nI don't know.\n>> Exactly.\n\n178\n00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,590\n>> Is it Sam's supposed to go to work now?\n\n179\n00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,630\nI don't know.\nHappy Birthday?\n\n180\n00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,810\nI'm not sure what it is.\n\n181\n00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,350\nRight.\nSo\n\n182\n00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,960\nif you can't read obviously\nthat's a whole different story.\n\n183\n00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,550\nRight?\n\n184\n00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,100\nSecurity through obscurity as\nopposed to hiding in plain sight.\n\n185\n00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,710\n>> Yeah.\n>> Yes.\n\n186\n00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,060\n>> But Caesar ciphers may just\nwant to make a quick note,\n\n187\n00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,160\nwe actually substitute it by three\ncharacters, or three alphabet letters,\n\n188\n00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,520\nthree alphabet places with Caesar ciphers.\n\n189\n00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,950\nWhereas with ROT13, we rotate it by 13.\n\n190\n00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,540\nSo just want to make\nsure were aware of that.\n\n191\n00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,920\nRotated three characters and\n\n192\n00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,300\nROT13 was a 13 character\nrotation through the alphabet.\n\n193\n00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,620\nBoth mono-alphabetic by the way.\n\n194\n00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,780\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n195\n00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,870\nClose enough all right.\n\n196\n00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,166\nAnd then poly-alphabetic obviously\nis right we're rotating multiple,\n\n197\n00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,735\nwe're using multiple alphabets so\n\n198\n00:09:32,735 --> 00:09:35,780\nit's obviously going to be more\na lot more dramatic in that respect.\n\n199\n00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,481\nAnd so an example of\na polyalphabetic cypher would be,\n\n200\n00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:42,864\nif you wanna write down\nmultiple alphabets used.\n\n201\n00:09:42,864 --> 00:09:43,664\nOkay, great.\n\n202\n00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:49,432\nWould be a Vignere V-I-G-N-E-R-E,\nas in Blaise de Vignere,\n\n203\n00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:54,401\nthe name of the gentleman who\ncreated the Vignere cypher.\n\n204\n00:09:54,401 --> 00:10:00,570\nSo this is a polyalphabetic substitution\ncypher, famous for creating this.\n\n205\n00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,430\nCreated for Henry III.\n\n206\n00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,450\nHe creates it for Henry III.\n\n207\n00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,210\nIt's used there and it was basically\nthe same idea as the Caesar cipher, but\n\n208\n00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,030\nhe brought multiple alphabets to the table\nand said well, let's improve on this.\n\n209\n00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,410\nSo brings in a bunch of alphabets.\n\n210\n00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,450\nBrings them all together.\n\n211\n00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:19,500\nCreates this massive pool of letters and\nways in which to combine things, and\n\n212\n00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,160\nthen creates this polyalphabetic\nsubstitution cipher.\n\n213\n00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,760\nSo you would see these as basically\nsquares, something like what Mike's gonna\n\n214\n00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,270\nshow you right now, which had all\nthe alphabet information in it.\n\n215\n00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,390\nAnd so, as a result, you then would\nhave to figure out the XY coordinate,\n\n216\n00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,470\ntrack through, in other words,\nto figure out what you were looking for.\n\n217\n00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,380\nAnd so you could see something like\nthis would be a matrix that was used,\n\n218\n00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,230\nto be able to create a Vigenère cypher,\nso, you can see that there.\n\n219\n00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,280\nKind of interesting stuff,\nwhen you think about it.\n\n220\n00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,720\n>> It is.\n\n221\n00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,570\n>> Very, very cool to go back and kind of\nsee how all of these things happened and\n\n222\n00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,650\nwhere they came from.\n\n223\n00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,832\nThe Vignerère cipher is a good\nexample of a polyalphabetic cipher.\n\n224\n00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:56,780\nAll right, so, know that we've\nkind of laid out just the basics.\n\n225\n00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,920\nLet's go through, and let's talk\nabout some of these definitions.\n\n226\n00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,230\nLet's go through, and\nlet's lay out a bunch of these terms and\n\n227\n00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,120\ndefine what they are, make sure\nthat we are comfortable with them.\n\n228\n00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,980\nSo, I think we're starting\nwith algorithm up there.\n\n229\n00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,020\nSo an algorithm is basically\na set of mathematical rules.\n\n230\n00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,300\nYou can almost think of this\nlike a miniature language.\n\n231\n00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,129\nIt's a set of mathematical\nrules that are used to\n\n232\n00:11:21,129 --> 00:11:24,513\ncreate the encryption function\nwithin crypto-system.\n\n233\n00:11:28,053 --> 00:11:32,520\nSo a set of mathematical rules used to\ncreate the encryption function within\n\n234\n00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,580\na cryptosystem.\n\n235\n00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,650\nWe're going to define cryptosystem\ndown there in just a minute.\n\n236\n00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,780\nCryptosystem will be\nexactly that- all one word.\n\n237\n00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,720\nRight.\n\n238\n00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,440\nVery good.\n\n239\n00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,450\nSo, then cipher, let's just going,\ncipher's just another name for\n\n240\n00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,180\nan alogrithm.\n\n241\n00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,290\nThat's just a term we use in\ncryptography to refer to algorithms.\n\n242\n00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,300\nSo it's just basically an alias for\nan algorithm.\n\n243\n00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,520\nCrytography.\n\n244\n00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,140\nCryptography, next term down.\n\n245\n00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,740\nCrytography is the science\nof secret writing.\n\n246\n00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,950\nSo, the science of actually engaging in.\n\n247\n00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,250\nEncrypting data is called cryptography,\nthe science of secret writing.\n\n248\n00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,220\nA cryptosystem,\ncryptosystem we just used that up above.\n\n249\n00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,756\nHardware and/or software implementation,\n\n250\n00:12:11,756 --> 00:12:16,809\nhardware and/or software\nimplementation of cryptography.\n\n251\n00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,960\nSo, the entire system that\nis used to basically,\n\n252\n00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,190\nimplement the cryptology\nthat we are using, or\n\n253\n00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,600\nrather are looking to create, to skew\ninformation, that is the crypto system.\n\n254\n00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,145\nSo, it could be the keys that are used,\nsoftware or hardware generated.\n\n255\n00:12:34,145 --> 00:12:38,175\nCould be the physical infrastructure\nas well as the logical infrastructure.\n\n256\n00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:41,435\nIt's used to create the encryption and\napply it to the data.\n\n257\n00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:43,865\nAll of that's part of the cryptive system.\n\n258\n00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:45,365\nSo I just wanna make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n259\n00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,955\nSo, the protocol's, the algorithm's,\nthe keys, the software.\n\n260\n00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:50,845\nI think you have a running\nlist of some stuff there.\n\n261\n00:12:50,845 --> 00:12:52,630\nAll of that stuff is\ngonna be part of that.\n\n262\n00:12:54,452 --> 00:12:57,260\nProtocols, keys,\nphysical infrastructure, etc.\n\n263\n00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,000\nDid we lose,\nI was going to say look like we lost.\n\n264\n00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,300\nWe just had analysis there.\n\n265\n00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,080\nWe lost the crypto part,\nwe lost the crypto part.\n\n266\n00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,810\nRight, so\n\n267\n00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:12,130\ncryptanalysis is going to be the practice\nof uncovering flaws within a cryptosystem.\n\n268\n00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,250\nSo the examination of cryptosystems,\nlooking for\n\n269\n00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,100\nweaknesses, is what cryptanalysis is.\n\n270\n00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,500\nIt is basically the practice\nof trying to break\n\n271\n00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,350\ncryptosystems by finding flaws in them.\n\n272\n00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,590\nSo, I think we need a Y there somewhere.\n\n273\n00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,760\nThere we go, cryptosystems, very good.\n\n274\n00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,920\nCryptology, the study of cryptography,\nand cryptanalysis,\n\n275\n00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,000\nor cryptanalysis and\ncryptography put together is cryptology.\n\n276\n00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,210\nStudy of cryptography, and cryptanalysis.\n\n277\n00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:47,520\nOne of my students once asked me is\ncryptology, the old joke about it,\n\n278\n00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,360\nis the study of Egyptian crypts.\n\n279\n00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,440\nSo no, it is not.\n\n280\n00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,960\nIt's the study of cryptography.\n\n281\n00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,750\nAnd cryptanalysis all put to rights.\n\n282\n00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,940\nI wanna change majors, right?\n\n283\n00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,090\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n284\n00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,550\n>> So, just be aware of that.\n\n285\n00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,610\nEnciphering, to encipher something\nmeans to apply cryptography to it.\n\n286\n00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,460\nSo we're gonna obfuscate,\nwe're gonna hide data through enciphering.\n\n287\n00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,990\nWhat we formally call that is\nthe practice of taking plain text and\n\n288\n00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,420\nconverting it to cipher text just to use\nthe language of the cryptographic system.\n\n289\n00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,030\nPlain text to cipher\ntext will be enciphering,\n\n290\n00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,730\nwhereas deciphering will\nbe the exact opposite.\n\n291\n00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,765\nWe are going to apply cryptography to\nthe data, but do so in order unencipher.\n\n292\n00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:35,050\nSo as a result, we will take cipher\ntext and convert t back to plain text.\n\n293\n00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,530\nSo cipher to text to plain text.\n\n294\n00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,210\nThe exact opposite way is what\ndeciphering will give us.\n\n295\n00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,558\nThey key, as in Gozar the Gozarian,\nthe key master.\n\n296\n00:14:47,558 --> 00:14:49,087\n>> The Key Master.\n\n297\n00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,552\n>> Reference from Ghost Busters [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n298\n00:14:50,552 --> 00:14:52,424\nwe always got to work on that\nGhost Buster reference somewhere.\n\n299\n00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,290\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Can't do cryptography without\n\n300\n00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,440\ntalking about the whole idea\nof Ghostbusters, right?\n\n301\n00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:05,560\nSo key, the key is gonna be a sequence\nof bits, that are going to be used,\n\n302\n00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,000\nin order to be able to basically\ncreate the instructions necessary.\n\n303\n00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,050\nRight?\nSo they're used as instructions to create\n\n304\n00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,990\nthe instructions necessary to actually\ncontrol the cryptographic function.\n\n305\n00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:24,050\nSo the key is, in effect, what applies\nthe cryptography to the data or\n\n306\n00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,810\na cryptographic function to the data.\n\n307\n00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:31,120\nThey are applied or\nthey are used through an algorithm.\n\n308\n00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,710\nSo control the cryptographic\nfunction through the algorithm,\n\n309\n00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,590\nthrough an algorithm.\n\n310\n00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,210\nIf you wanna be precise, an algorithm.\n\n311\n00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,050\nAnd we will define that.\n\n312\n00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:39,550\n>> Always.\n>> There we go.\n\n313\n00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,550\nAlways very important.\n\n314\n00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:41,450\n>> Always wanna be precise.\n\n315\n00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,970\n>> You know, there was a rumor, they were\ntalking about right after Harold Ramis\n\n316\n00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,480\ndied, in the last few months,\nthat they were talking\n\n317\n00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,120\nabout the fact that there was discussion\nabout maybe shooting a Ghostbusters 3.\n\n318\n00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,990\n>> Oh really?\n>> But because he had passed away,\n\n319\n00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,390\nnow they're not sure what they're\ngoing to do, because they may or\n\n320\n00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,660\nmay not be able to do that.\n\n321\n00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,311\nI think Bill Murray didn't necessarily\nwant to have too much to do with it,\n\n322\n00:15:59,311 --> 00:16:00,420\nwasn't too excited about it.\n\n323\n00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,000\n>> Yeah, I don't think he\nwanted anything to do with it.\n\n324\n00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,736\n>> So I don't know if they're ever going\nto actually get that off the ground but\n\n325\n00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:07,417\nat one point there was talk about\ndoing a Ghostbusters 3, so sometimes.\n\n326\n00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,007\n>> It would be good.\n\n327\n00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:11,880\n>> Maybe, yeah, the first one was\ndefinitely pretty cool, right?\n\n328\n00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,670\n>> Yeah, the classic.\n\n329\n00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,918\n>> Yeah, yeah, Stay Puft Marshmallow guy.\n\n330\n00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:15,570\n>> [LAUGH] Yep.\n[LAUGH]\n\n331\n00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,660\n>> All right, so we got the keys, right?\n\n332\n00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,280\nWe can go up to Key Clustering,\nis that where we are?\n\n333\n00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,320\nYeah, Key Clustering.\n\n334\n00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:27,270\nSo Key Clustering, this is when\ntwo keys are going to generate,\n\n335\n00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,230\nor two different keys I should say,\nexcuse me.\n\n336\n00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,450\nSo when two different keys will\ngenerate the same ciphertext\n\n337\n00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,720\nfrom the plaintext, or\nfrom the same plaintext.\n\n338\n00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,450\nSo when two different keys generate the\nsame ciphertext from the same plaintext.\n\n339\n00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,620\nAnd as a result, obviously, if you just\nstop and ponder that for a second.\n\n340\n00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,810\nWhen we have two different keys\ngenerating the same encrypted ciphertext,\n\n341\n00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,790\nfrom the same plaintext,\nthat's a bad thing.\n\n342\n00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,410\nCuz now all of a sudden, right,\n\n343\n00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:58,100\nwe have keys that are working\nthe same way in a pool.\n\n344\n00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,320\nEither of those keys can be\nused to decrypt the message and\n\n345\n00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,530\nprovide the same result.\n\n346\n00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,250\nSo now we have twice the opportunity,\n\n347\n00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,120\npotentially, to discover what that\nkey is break the cryptosystem.\n\n348\n00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,710\nSo that's a bad thing, right, when we\nhave key clustering, that's a bad thing.\n\n349\n00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,280\nWe get key clustering because\nour key space is not big enough.\n\n350\n00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,850\nSo, obviously, small key space, very small\nnumber of keys, that could be a bad thing.\n\n351\n00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,160\nSo, the bigger the key space, obviously,\nthe less likely it is this happens.\n\n352\n00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:27,290\nBut the key space is the range of possible\nvalues that are used to create our keys.\n\n353\n00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:32,790\nRange of possible values used to\ncreate the keys for the cryptosystem.\n\n354\n00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:41,670\nAll right, very good.\n\n355\n00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,315\nSo plaintext is gonna be the unencrypted\ntext that is in our system.\n\n356\n00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:49,532\n[COUGH] Ciphertext will\nbe the encrypted text,\n\n357\n00:17:49,532 --> 00:17:53,865\nthe encrypted plaintext\nthat is in our system.\n\n358\n00:17:57,325 --> 00:17:59,400\nSubstitution Cipher,\nwe've already talked about.\n\n359\n00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,760\nScytale Cipher, we already talked about.\n\n360\n00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,545\nWe did those up top,\nthose are just place holders.\n\n361\n00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:05,020\nWe did Vignere Cipher as well.\n\n362\n00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,997\nLet's talk about Auguste Kerckhoffs and\nthe Kerckhoffs's principle.\n\n363\n00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:10,450\nWe'll talk about\nWilliam Frederick Friedman.\n\n364\n00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:13,480\nSo Kerckhoffs is gonna\ncome up with this idea,\n\n365\n00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,410\nvery important in kinda the historical arc\nof how cryptography becomes part of what\n\n366\n00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,190\nwe do every day on the history,\nor rather on the security side.\n\n367\n00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,350\nSo Kerckhoffs says basically that\nan algorithm should be known and\n\n368\n00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,150\nonly the key should be kept secret.\n\n369\n00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,640\nSo in other words,\nhe comes up with this idea of,\n\n370\n00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,350\nlet's focus on doing one thing really,\nreally well, right?\n\n371\n00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,320\nAnd if we can do just one thing really,\nreally well and\n\n372\n00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,260\nkeep it secret, we're going to be okay.\n\n373\n00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,750\nSo the thing we should\nkeep secret is the key.\n\n374\n00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,990\nEverything else can be public\nknowledge in a cryptosystem, right?\n\n375\n00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,690\nWe don't care if you know the algorithms,\nreally irrelevant from our perspective.\n\n376\n00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,112\nAs a matter of fact,\nwe want you to know them.\n\n377\n00:18:47,112 --> 00:18:49,940\nCuz you're gonna come to find out as\nwe go through some of our additional\n\n378\n00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,150\nconversations in some\nadditional episodes here,\n\n379\n00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,320\nin upcoming conversations about\nthe way this stuff works.\n\n380\n00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,070\nWe have to tell you what\nthe algorithm is cuz you have\n\n381\n00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,410\nto be able to choose the right one.\n\n382\n00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,690\nSo that when you get the ciphertext,\nyou know how to unencrypt it in effect.\n\n383\n00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,320\nSo we don't keep that secret, right?\n\n384\n00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,900\nBut Kerckhoffs is really the first one\nthat sits down and thinks about this, and\n\n385\n00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,750\nsays, you know, if we just let everybody\nknow the algorithms, no big deal.\n\n386\n00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,410\nLet's just focus on keeping the keys\nsecret because we could probably do that,\n\n387\n00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,680\nprobably keep the keys secret.\n\n388\n00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,430\nYou know, focus on that one thing and\ndo it well.\n\n389\n00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,490\nBut if we try and keep everything secret,\nthe algorithms, the cryptosystem overall,\n\n390\n00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,130\nthe whole structure, the keys,\nprobably not going to do a good job.\n\n391\n00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,920\nIt's going to be very unlikely that all\nthat stuff's gonna work in our favor and\n\n392\n00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,160\nit's all going to stay secret.\n\n393\n00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,870\nAnd so\nthat's going to be an issue as well.\n\n394\n00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,490\nSo that's why we kind\nof think about that and\n\n395\n00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:40,420\nwe refer to that as\nthe Kerckhoffs's principle.\n\n396\n00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,420\nSo he comes up with that and\nis famous for that.\n\n397\n00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,890\nAlso, William Frederick Friedman,\nexcuse me,\n\n398\n00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:52,070\nWilliam Frederick Friedman, he is known\nas the father of modern cryptography.\n\n399\n00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:54,450\nFather of modern cryptography.\n\n400\n00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:58,400\nHe writes a very influential\nbook back in the early 1920s,\n\n401\n00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,520\nreferred to as The Index of Coincidence.\n\n402\n00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,690\nThe Index of Coincidence\nis the title of the book.\n\n403\n00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,304\nThe Index of Coincidence and\nIts Application, or\n\n404\n00:20:07,304 --> 00:20:11,183\nIts Applications,\nI should say, in Cryptography.\n\n405\n00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:18,920\nApplications in Cryptography or\nApplication Cryptography, that's fine.\n\n406\n00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,170\nSo this is the name,\nthis is the title of Friedman's book.\n\n407\n00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,560\nVery famous,\ncomes out during interwar period years.\n\n408\n00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,812\nRight after the First World War,\nbefore the Second World War.\n\n409\n00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,980\nAnd he becomes the guy.\n\n410\n00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,930\nAnd everybody refers to his book,\nand really uses his thoughts as\n\n411\n00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,360\nthe building blocks to build the modern\ncryptographic systems that we see today.\n\n412\n00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,550\nHe's incredibly influential.\n\n413\n00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,217\nEspecially on the Allied side during the\nSecond World War, as they looked at how to\n\n414\n00:20:45,217 --> 00:20:48,322\ndo the code breaking around trying\nto figure out the Enigma systems.\n\n415\n00:20:48,322 --> 00:20:53,053\nAnd building the first computers that we\nthink of that were modern day computers\n\n416\n00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:56,442\nthat were built in order to\ndo the cryptographic analysis\n\n417\n00:20:56,442 --> 00:20:59,070\nthat needed to be done\nto crack those codes.\n\n418\n00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,090\nFriedman's work, and\n\n419\n00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:03,600\njust some of the stuff he did,\nwas very influential in that regard.\n\n420\n00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,800\nSo he is still considered to be, even\nthough he's long gone, considered to be\n\n421\n00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,170\nreally one of the seminal thinkers,\nthe pioneers of this whole space.\n\n422\n00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,760\nSo, good job, William.\n\n423\n00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,700\nGood job.\n>> Yes, thank you William.\n\n424\n00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,972\n>> All right, we appreciate that.\n\n425\n00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:20,040\nAll right, so\nwe have all of the background,\n\n426\n00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,630\nright, just about all the terms we have.\n\n427\n00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:24,010\nWe have a few more there,\nwe have to do One-time Pad.\n\n428\n00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,280\nBut we do have just about the background\nand vocabulary we've laid out for you.\n\n429\n00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,480\nSo let's talk a bit about One-time Pad,\nRunning Cipher, Concealment Cipher.\n\n430\n00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,258\nWe'll go through some of this.\n\n431\n00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:33,300\nSo a one-time pad,\n\n432\n00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:37,000\nyou can see here, it's considered to be\nthe only unbreakable encryption system.\n\n433\n00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,760\nIt was created and used especially\nduring that Second World War period\n\n434\n00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,600\nwhere people would have this pad,\nor key set that was created.\n\n435\n00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,959\nYou would have to synchronize that by\ngiving a copy to somebody who was gonna\n\n436\n00:21:48,959 --> 00:21:50,040\nreceive the messages.\n\n437\n00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,240\n>> And so both of these had to be securely\ntransmitted and stored, very important.\n\n438\n00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,320\nBut if we kept the keypad secret, and\nwe used the key only one time each.\n\n439\n00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,860\nSo we wrote a message,\nit was used to decrypt.\n\n440\n00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,880\nWe read a message, it was used to, rather,\nwrote a message, and then decrypted it,\n\n441\n00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,180\nvice versa, that kinda thing.\n\n442\n00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,890\nThe key was used one time one way, right?\n\n443\n00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,630\nAs a result of that,\nif we didn't reuse the key\n\n444\n00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,720\nthen it was truly unbreakable\nbecause there would be no pattern.\n\n445\n00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,107\nNo matter how we did it,\nthe keys never repeated.\n\n446\n00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:21,372\nAnd so as a result, even if you\nunencrypted one message by randomly\n\n447\n00:22:21,372 --> 00:22:25,107\nfinding that key, you would never get\na pattern that would let you establish\n\n448\n00:22:25,107 --> 00:22:28,500\na foothold in the system to encrypt or\nunencrypt more data.\n\n449\n00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,100\nAnd so this relies on\nthe series of one-time codes.\n\n450\n00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,600\nThe challenge there, the downside there\nwas really securely transmitting and\n\n451\n00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,590\nsafely securing these things and storing.\n\n452\n00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,990\n>> It reminds me of some of the issues\nwe have with symmetric algorithms,\n\n453\n00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,820\nwhere key distribution becomes a problem.\n\n454\n00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,370\nSomehow you've got to get\nthat pad to the other end,\n\n455\n00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,250\notherwise they're not gonna be\nable to decrypt my message.\n\n456\n00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,090\n>> Yup.\n\n457\n00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:46,780\nVery, very true.\n\n458\n00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,960\nSo while it is considered to be,\neven today,\n\n459\n00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,180\nthe only unbreakable encryption system\nin the world that is 100% reliable and\n\n460\n00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,860\nwill work the right way provided\nit's set up the right way.\n\n461\n00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,720\n>> If it's implemented properly.\n\n462\n00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,030\n>> The challenge is setting it up and\nimplementing it correctly.\n\n463\n00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:00,820\nThat is the issue.\n\n464\n00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,640\nAnd so that's one of the issues.\n\n465\n00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,400\nThe other thing there is that the keys\nhave to be randomly generated.\n\n466\n00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,260\nSo the question is then,\nhow random is random?\n\n467\n00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,390\nCan we really create random generation?\n\n468\n00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,730\nBecause there is a pattern,\nultimately, to everything.\n\n469\n00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,890\nThey've done studies where they do\nthings like white noise generation.\n\n470\n00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,570\nThey pull background radiation noise from\nthese radio telescopes that are looking up\n\n471\n00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,355\nat the stars.\n\n472\n00:23:22,355 --> 00:23:25,831\nAnd even then, they've done the analysis\non the background generation,\n\n473\n00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:28,161\nthe background noise,\nthese radio telescopes.\n\n474\n00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:29,288\nAnd the, literally,\n\n475\n00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:33,060\nthe beginning noise from the universe\nas it was first spinning up.\n\n476\n00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,590\nAnd they've done some of the background\nwork on analyzing that background noise,\n\n477\n00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,660\nand even then they say that\nultimately there are patterns there.\n\n478\n00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,350\n>> There are patterns, yeah.\n\n479\n00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,110\n>> They may be very long and\nthey may be very large.\n\n480\n00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:45,205\nYou have to really have a tremendous\namount of data to sample to see\n\n481\n00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:45,895\nthe pattern.\n\n482\n00:23:45,895 --> 00:23:49,081\nBut even then, there is pattern that\nthey can find there and as a result,\n\n483\n00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:50,850\nit's not truly random.\n\n484\n00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,196\nSo that is-\n>> Finding things in nature is-\n\n485\n00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:53,604\n>> That is an issue.\n\n486\n00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:55,759\nYeah, just kinda the way\nthings are set up,\n\n487\n00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,280\nwe do see patterns over time,\nso it is something to consider.\n\n488\n00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,550\nAll right, so we did have that.\n\n489\n00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:04,056\nRunning Cyphers versus Concealment\nCyphers, let's just talk about that\n\n490\n00:24:04,056 --> 00:24:06,960\nbriefly and just make sure we\nare comfortable with this idea.\n\n491\n00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,727\nSo a running cypher Is going to be this\nidea, excuse me, that we can use keys that\n\n492\n00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:16,570\ndon't require some sort of electric\nalgorithm and bit alteration, electronic\n\n493\n00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:22,020\nalgorithm rather, I said electric,\nelectronic algorithm and a bit alteration.\n\n494\n00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,970\nBut rather we're gonna use things\naround us to be able to effectively\n\n495\n00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,080\ncreate the key.\n\n496\n00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,960\nRight?\nSo\n\n497\n00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,410\nif we think about this idea of\nnormally generating keys and\n\n498\n00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,990\nwe have this mathematical system that\nruns in a computer that does this,\n\n499\n00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:40,240\nwhat if we just use things around\nus like perhaps like a book or\n\n500\n00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,610\nperhaps we use the newspaper or, Lord\nknows what, right, whatever it would be.\n\n501\n00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:47,390\nAnd so if we went ahead and\nwe tried to do that,\n\n502\n00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,859\nwe then could potentially use that as\nthe key and maybe say every fourth or\n\n503\n00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:57,082\nfifth page and then every third paragraph\nwe're going to take one word, all right.\n\n504\n00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:59,655\nAnd then that's going to become,\nin effect, our cipher key and\n\n505\n00:24:59,655 --> 00:25:01,340\nthen that's how we're gonna create it.\n\n506\n00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,110\nThese are the kinds of\nthings that we would do.\n\n507\n00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,335\nSo it could be a set of books, or\n\n508\n00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:06,710\nit could be something like a set\nof books on a shelf, right?\n\n509\n00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,685\nOr we could say, as we said,\npage number,right, paragraph number,\n\n510\n00:25:10,685 --> 00:25:13,420\ncharacter count,\nthings like that to drill in.\n\n511\n00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,580\nSo that when then\neffectively create the key.\n\n512\n00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,840\nThe challenge there would be that\nobviously both parties have to have\n\n513\n00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,300\nthe set of books, synchronize\nlike a one time pad, same idea.\n\n514\n00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,410\nNow concealment ciphers would be basically\nputting a message inside of a message.\n\n515\n00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:27,992\nRight?\nSo effectively hiding it.\n\n516\n00:25:27,992 --> 00:25:30,530\nWe're gonna talk about this\nconcept of steganography as well.\n\n517\n00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,990\nBut putting the message inside a message.\n\n518\n00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:36,170\nSo, maybe sending somebody a message\nin the personals of a newspaper,\n\n519\n00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,300\npublicly available.\n\n520\n00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,850\n>> Right.\n>> But it's kind of encoded.\n\n521\n00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,970\n>> Yeah.\n>> Did you ever see\n\n522\n00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,360\nDesperately Seeking Susan?\n\n523\n00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:41,960\n>> Yes.\n>> Right?\n\n524\n00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,370\nThat wonderful cinematographic\n\n525\n00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,560\nmasterpiece-\n>> It was\n\n526\n00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,960\n>> That Madonna produced back in\n\n527\n00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,280\nthe hay day, right.\n\n528\n00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,160\nGot to see that, if you haven't seen that,\nby the way, Oscar-worthy.\n\n529\n00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,430\nYou've got to go check that out.\n\n530\n00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,070\nRight?\n\n531\n00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,680\n>> Only if it's free on Netflix or\nsomething.\n\n532\n00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,841\n>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n533\n00:25:55,841 --> 00:25:57,680\nThe 80s, what a wild time, boy.\n\n534\n00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,890\nWhat were we thinking?\n\n535\n00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,660\n>> You've got mail.\n\n536\n00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,690\n>> Yeah.\nExactly.\n\n537\n00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,400\nSo that was more 90s, though.\n\n538\n00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,480\nSo but the idea they're in\nthat movie was that, and\n\n539\n00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,500\nthis is basically the same exact concept,\nit's a concealment cipher.\n\n540\n00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,300\nThe way that this whole movie is\nstructured is around this personal\n\n541\n00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,320\nad that comes out in the paper, and\n\n542\n00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,910\nYour Desperately Seeking Susan\nis the title of the ad.\n\n543\n00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,700\nAnd so the information there-\n>> That looks like a personal ad from\n\n544\n00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,490\nmost perspectives.\n\n545\n00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,090\n>> Right, right, right.\n\n546\n00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,670\nBut you don't really know, but\nthere's actually a message,\n\n547\n00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,610\na subtext to the message that is\nreally at the plot of the movie, or\n\n548\n00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:25,950\nthe heart of the plot of the movie.\n\n549\n00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:28,730\nSo this idea of being able to\nfigure out that there's something\n\n550\n00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,980\nhidden inside that message right is what\na concealment cipher would be all about.\n\n551\n00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,640\nWe saw this also with more\nlike a running cipher concept.\n\n552\n00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,000\nBut it's a little bit of both.\n\n553\n00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,700\nIn the first Sherlock Holmes movie with\nRobert Downey Jr. It's the more recent one\n\n554\n00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,590\nthat was created,right, this idea that,\nis it the first or the second one, I think\n\n555\n00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:51,350\nit's the second one, actually I know it's\nthe second one, where he meets Moriarty.\n\n556\n00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,500\nAnd Moriarty is the professor.\n\n557\n00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,060\nHe's in his office at Oxford or\nCambridge or wherever he is.\n\n558\n00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,900\nBy the way, spoiler alert, if you have\nnot seen the movie, just so you know.\n\n559\n00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:07,200\nTime for a coffee break,\nright, go grab a soda.\n\n560\n00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,390\nSo what happens there at some point\nin the movie, is that Holmes goes and\n\n561\n00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:15,140\nconfronts him and kind of visits\nhim in his office on the campus.\n\n562\n00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:18,600\nAnd they're talking, they're kind\nof trading wits back and forth, and\n\n563\n00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,260\nthen he's kind of walking round\nthe office, and he's examining things.\n\n564\n00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,650\nAnd you don't get it until much later\nin the movie but Holmes sees something\n\n565\n00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,700\nthat ultimately becomes the key to\nfiguring out that this is Moriarty,\n\n566\n00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,110\nwho he is, what he's doing, and\nhe finds that, he sees, rather,\n\n567\n00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,140\na dead plant on the window sill in\nthe office, and he thinks about, you know,\n\n568\n00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,140\nultimately this is the mind\nof Holmes at work.\n\n569\n00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,770\nWhy would he have a dead plant there,\nwhen right beside it he has a book on\n\n570\n00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:47,780\nhorticulture, how to raise plants or\nwhatever it was, and the book itself was\n\n571\n00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,280\nactually the key to the cipher that\nultimately unlocks all the information.\n\n572\n00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,950\nBut then he puts the two together and\nsays well the plant's dead, but\n\n573\n00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,070\nhe's got the book and\nyou should know how to raise it.\n\n574\n00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,930\nSo he gets a copy of the book and\n\n575\n00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,500\nhe figures out that this is actually\nthe code key like for the whole thing.\n\n576\n00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,610\nSo that kind of thing, the concealment\ncipher, and the running cipher, that was\n\n577\n00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,880\na little bit of both ultimately because\nit was hiding there in plain sight.\n\n578\n00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,060\nBut it was the code key with\nthe running cipher that was being used\n\n579\n00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,302\nis kind of that example.\n\n580\n00:28:11,302 --> 00:28:13,760\nAll right, so\nthis is some of the background material,\n\n581\n00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,140\nsome vocabulary we want\nto run through with you.\n\n582\n00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,570\nWhen we come back, since we've finished up\nanother perfectly good episode with you,\n\n583\n00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,330\nand since we do wanna come back and tell\nyou some more stories and share some more\n\n584\n00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,470\ninformation with you, when we do that\nwe'll continue on and we'll talk a bit\n\n585\n00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,230\nabout steganography and talk about some of\nthe other things that are going on there.\n\n586\n00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,930\nAnd also have a lot of other interesting\nstuff to talk about with you.\n\n587\n00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,210\nSo please do join us.\n\n588\n00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:36,740\nPlease come back.\n\n589\n00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,980\nSee us for another episode here.\n\n590\n00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,508\nAnd we'll see you soon.\n\n591\n00:28:40,508 --> 00:28:41,286\n>> Hopefully.\n\n592\n00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:41,931\n>> Okay.\n\n593\n00:28:41,931 --> 00:28:45,053\n[MUSIC]\n\n594\n00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:53,181\n>> [SOUND] All right welcome back\neverybody to our cryptography episode.\n\n595\n00:28:53,181 --> 00:28:56,380\nWe just got finished going through\na whole bunch of terminology and\n\n596\n00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,976\ndefinitions kind of give us that\nfoundational knowledge that we need to get\n\n597\n00:28:59,976 --> 00:29:02,460\nthrough this cryptography section.\n\n598\n00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,580\nI think we'll jump right\ninto some more terms.\n\n599\n00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,725\nMaybe before we do that a little\ndemonstration of some steganography?\n\n600\n00:29:07,725 --> 00:29:08,980\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n601\n00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,170\nSo what we thought we'd do,\nis Mike was kind enough to volunteer.\n\n602\n00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,440\nDo a little demo here for\nyou we're talking about and\n\n603\n00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,140\nhe said wow why don't I just\nshow everybody how this works.\n\n604\n00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,400\n>> Yeah and you know you got to be\ncareful when you go get these tools and\n\n605\n00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,890\nthings like this because you risk,\n\n606\n00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,630\ndepending on where you're getting\nthem from, I was like are you sure.\n\n607\n00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,400\nI'll put it on my computer.\n\n608\n00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,810\n>> Dark corners of the internet.\n\n609\n00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:28,100\nAbsolutely.\n\n610\n00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,200\n>> This one has a pay version.\n\n611\n00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,300\nSo you feel a little bit safer.\n\n612\n00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,460\n>> So you're paying for your malware,\nas opposed to simply getting it free.\n\n613\n00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,220\nThat's good.\n>> Yeah, its just like,\n\n614\n00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,140\nthis is the freeware.\n\n615\n00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,860\nAnd then if you wanna buy their\nhigher up versions, you figure, so\n\n616\n00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,280\nthey shouldn't load it up with stuff.\n\n617\n00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,130\n>> So that way they know\nyou have a bank account.\n\n618\n00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:41,801\n>> That's right.\n\n619\n00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:43,196\n[LAUGH]\n>> And then they can really take it all\n\n620\n00:29:43,196 --> 00:29:44,250\naway from you, all at one time.\n\n621\n00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,540\nI'm gonna upgrade whether I know it or\nnot.\n\n622\n00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,260\n>> Social engineering at its finest.\n\n623\n00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,169\nAll right.\n\n624\n00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:49,016\n>> All right, cool.\n\n625\n00:29:49,016 --> 00:29:49,940\n>> So, what are we gonna do here?\n\n626\n00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,370\nWhat's the plan for the demo?\n\n627\n00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:53,500\n>> Well, when we get ready,\nwe're gonna define steganography and\n\n628\n00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,740\ntalk about steganography, but\nthe idea is I'm gonna hide something.\n\n629\n00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,320\nWe're not really encrypting anything,\nright?\n\n630\n00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,650\nWe're actually almost like\nhiding it in plain sight.\n\n631\n00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,590\nAnd steganography,\nyou can use different medium, you can use\n\n632\n00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,930\npictures are very commonly used,\nMP3 files are a really good one to use.\n\n633\n00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,630\nAnd to the person that's doesn't\nknow the message is there,\n\n634\n00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,210\nit'll look just like a picture or\nan MP3 file.\n\n635\n00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,738\nWe'll talk a little bit more about,\n\n636\n00:30:15,738 --> 00:30:17,870\nlet Adam go into the details\nof how we get that done.\n\n637\n00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,621\nBut all I'm going to do is I'm\ngoing to go grab an image, so\n\n638\n00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:25,690\nI've got an image of our studio\nhere that I'm going to select.\n\n639\n00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:30,008\nIt's gonna load up this picture and then\nwhat it's gonna allow me to do is either\n\n640\n00:30:30,008 --> 00:30:33,037\ncopy text from something that\nI had already typed up, or\n\n641\n00:30:33,037 --> 00:30:34,390\nI can just type in here.\n\n642\n00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:39,179\n[SOUND] We'll put something in\nthat's gonna be good for us.\n\n643\n00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:40,800\n>> Okay.\n>> That makes the word.\n\n644\n00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:45,160\nSo you put some message in there,\nsomething that you wanna hide.\n\n645\n00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,860\nAnd then I could just click, hide text and\n\n646\n00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,910\nthe text message is now hidden in\nthe image, I'm gonna save this image.\n\n647\n00:30:53,710 --> 00:31:02,400\nAnd I'll call something like with message,\nand I'll save it.\n\n648\n00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:08,170\nAnd so now at this point I'm going to, if\nwe flip back over and look at that image,\n\n649\n00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:12,960\nand you're not gonna see\nanything different here.\n\n650\n00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,240\nI did convert it into a BMP, and that's\njust this particular piece of software.\n\n651\n00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,680\nJPEGs are compressed, and\nit makes it a little more difficult.\n\n652\n00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,854\nBut I can open it with say-\n>> Just do preview.\n\n653\n00:31:23,854 --> 00:31:24,710\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah.\n\n654\n00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,960\nWhatever we want.\n\n655\n00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:29,710\nAnd you would not be able to tell\nthat there's anything hidden in here.\n\n656\n00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:32,578\n>> Is that Don I see poking out\nfrom behind the podium there?\n\n657\n00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:35,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Where's Waldo?\n\n658\n00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,635\n>> I know.\nWhere is Waldo?\n\n659\n00:31:36,635 --> 00:31:37,175\nWhere is he?\n\n660\n00:31:37,175 --> 00:31:39,830\nOh, I think he's back there at this point\n>> But anyway-\n\n661\n00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,561\n>> We don't see the text though,\n\n662\n00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:42,039\nright so [CROSSTALK]\n>> We don't see the text.\n\n663\n00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:44,876\n>> Exactly, exactly, unless you\nknow the software that was used,\n\n664\n00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:46,939\nnow a lot of them like\nI've used camera shy, and\n\n665\n00:31:46,939 --> 00:31:49,990\nsome other programs that will\nlet you password protect them.\n\n666\n00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,873\n>> So not only do you have to have\nthe right piece of software, but\n\n667\n00:31:52,873 --> 00:31:54,660\nyou have to have the password as well.\n\n668\n00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:59,733\nSo if I go and just make sure that's\ncleared out to prove to you guys,\n\n669\n00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:02,937\nand I go ahead and\nopen up that image again,\n\n670\n00:32:02,937 --> 00:32:06,420\nI see the message that\nwas hidden inside of it.\n\n671\n00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,250\n>> Okay, very good.\n\n672\n00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:11,311\nSo, now obviously we could put different\namounts of text in there depending on\n\n673\n00:32:11,311 --> 00:32:15,384\nthe kind of program, how big the file is,\nhow big the picture is to start with.\n\n674\n00:32:15,384 --> 00:32:17,429\n>> Right.\n>> And some other variables that may or\n\n675\n00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:20,015\nmay not be important in\nthis particular example.\n\n676\n00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:23,035\nThat's probably the most important\nthing is the type of file it is.\n\n677\n00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:25,530\nSo it's a JPG file,\nas you said, compressed.\n\n678\n00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,825\n>> Right.\n>> But had a lot of rich colors and\n\n679\n00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:28,975\ndetail in there.\n\n680\n00:32:28,975 --> 00:32:32,945\nSo as a result there potentially is\nsome white space that we probably could\n\n681\n00:32:32,945 --> 00:32:34,190\nuse to hide.\n\n682\n00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:38,640\nThe stego-medium has a lot,\nin other words, of opportunity there for\n\n683\n00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,290\nus to put up what we call a payload,\nwe'll use these terms in a minute.\n\n684\n00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,920\n>> Okay.\n>> But basically the information that we\n\n685\n00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,770\nwere looking for to hide.\n\n686\n00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,880\nSo we could use those\nleast significant bits.\n\n687\n00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,380\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n688\n00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,890\n>> And\nkinda work all those terms in all at once.\n\n689\n00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:49,750\n>> Yeah, absolutely, sounds good.\n\n690\n00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,251\n>> So let's define some vocabulary there.\n\n691\n00:32:51,251 --> 00:32:52,620\n>> All right.\n>> So, steganography,\n\n692\n00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,020\nthe idea as we can see here basically,\n\n693\n00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,240\nof hiding data inside of another medium,\nright?\n\n694\n00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,580\nWhether it's hiding it in a picture, Mike\nmentioned we could do like MP3s, or sound,\n\n695\n00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,040\nor wave, or audio files,\nvideo as well by the way.\n\n696\n00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,870\nSo we can hide it in a lot\nof different places, but\n\n697\n00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,820\nhiding data inside of another medium.\n\n698\n00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,020\nSo we have some vocabulary,\nspecifically the carrier, right?\n\n699\n00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Which is what we're gonna\n\n700\n00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:18,960\ndefine as the data stream\nthat has to be hidden, right?\n\n701\n00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,210\nSo a signal, or data stream,\n\n702\n00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:23,361\nor file that has the hidden information,\nnot needs to be hidden, I'm sorry.\n\n703\n00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:25,795\nThatt has the information hidden\nwithin it, is what I meant to say,\n\n704\n00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:26,945\nfor the carrier.\n\n705\n00:33:26,945 --> 00:33:29,545\nThat's what happens when you're looking\none way, reading your notes and\n\n706\n00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:31,015\ntalking about a third thing all at once.\n\n707\n00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:33,725\n>> So, in our case,\nthe picture would have been our carrier.\n\n708\n00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:35,315\n>> The picture would have\nbeen the carrier, correct.\n\n709\n00:33:35,315 --> 00:33:38,100\nThat's the data stream that has\nthe information hidden within it.\n\n710\n00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:42,550\nAnd then the stego-medium, this is where\nin which the information is hidden,\n\n711\n00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,417\nthat will actually be, well in this case,\nthe picture was the stego-medium.\n\n712\n00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:47,010\n>> Okay.\n>> And so\n\n713\n00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:50,120\nthat was really our method\nwhere we actually hid it.\n\n714\n00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,546\nSo the stego-medium is gonna be the place\nwe actually hide all this information.\n\n715\n00:33:57,923 --> 00:34:00,310\nAnd then the payload, the payload,\n\n716\n00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:05,633\nwill be the information that is actually\ngoing to be hidden in a transmitted form.\n\n717\n00:34:05,633 --> 00:34:09,682\nIn your case it was I love IT Pro TV,\nor whatever that block of text was.\n\n718\n00:34:09,682 --> 00:34:10,208\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n719\n00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:12,490\n>> So we're gonna hide that there.\n\n720\n00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:17,000\nAnd we may also use this method,\nspecifically called least significant bit,\n\n721\n00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,550\nwhich is where we look\nat the bits of a file,\n\n722\n00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,784\nin this case maybe the white space in a\nphotograph, or whatever it would've been.\n\n723\n00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Where we really don't have anything\n\n724\n00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,400\nthat's really critical.\n\n725\n00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,100\nBut we can hide data by substituting for\nthose least significant bits, and still in\n\n726\n00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,060\neffect keep the integrity of the picture\nso you can't tell the data's there.\n\n727\n00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,510\nSo, just picking off the least\nsignificant bits allows us to basically\n\n728\n00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,970\nmove that data around on the image and\nput it in there.\n\n729\n00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,430\nThis is one way in which\nwe can actually do that.\n\n730\n00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:44,260\nSo there's lots of different ways to\nachieve the steganographic effect.\n\n731\n00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,510\nBut, kind of an interesting concept,\n\n732\n00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:51,600\na lot of times this is used in,\nunfortunately, criminal cases.\n\n733\n00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,850\nSo things like child pornography cases,\npornography in general but\n\n734\n00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,460\nchild pornography in particular.\n\n735\n00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,190\nWe often tend to see these pictures\nhidden using steganography inside of\n\n736\n00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,800\nother methods or means, and\n\n737\n00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,758\nas a result we then uncover them when\nwe do a forensic analysis of them.\n\n738\n00:35:05,758 --> 00:35:09,800\n>> All right. [COUGH] >> This was used\na lot during the Second World War and\n\n739\n00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,290\nin general, just for\nspying during the Cold War, where we would\n\n740\n00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:17,205\nshrink down information onto microdots,\nright, microfilm and microfiche.\n\n741\n00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:19,510\n>> Right.\n>> Shrink that information down and\n\n742\n00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,790\nthen hide it, effectively stego\nit is what we would call it.\n\n743\n00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:25,500\nWe would put it inside of something,\nso you didn't know it was there.\n\n744\n00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,665\n>> Right.\n>> And as a result it could\n\n745\n00:35:26,665 --> 00:35:28,885\nthen be effectively transmitted securely.\n\n746\n00:35:28,885 --> 00:35:30,575\nSo you may get a letter, and\n\n747\n00:35:30,575 --> 00:35:34,915\nthat letter would have just normal letter,\nparagraph written out, whatever.\n\n748\n00:35:34,915 --> 00:35:36,328\n>> Maybe the dots, or the periods.\n\n749\n00:35:36,328 --> 00:35:39,219\n>> The punctuation, so maybe the comma,\nthe dot, or the period, or\n\n750\n00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:42,800\nsomething would actually have a little\nmicrofilm item in place of the actual dot.\n\n751\n00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,410\nAnd so if you didn't know to look for\nit, it would effectively be stegoed.\n\n752\n00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,040\nIt would be hidden right\nthere inside the letter.\n\n753\n00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,400\n>> In plain sight, yep.\n>> You wouldn't even know.\n\n754\n00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,325\nSo, a lot of the times what would happen\nis during the war, the Allies would\n\n755\n00:35:52,325 --> 00:35:55,262\nintercept this mail that was going back\nand forth between here and Europe.\n\n756\n00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:56,574\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And they would know to look for\n\n757\n00:35:56,574 --> 00:35:59,810\nthis kind of stuff right, because they\nrealized the German spies were doing this.\n\n758\n00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,680\nAnd so they would go in and\nthey would take letters and\n\n759\n00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,040\nthey would do various things to\nthem to try to figure it out.\n\n760\n00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,470\nThey would steam them open, they would\nthen apply either chemicals or steam to\n\n761\n00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:12,505\nthe letter, and if something were suddenly\nto fall off or change, you would know.\n\n762\n00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:14,050\n>> Right.\n>> So this kinda stuff was done.\n\n763\n00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:18,350\nIt's pretty interesting stuff,\nkind of CSI kinda stuff, right?\n\n764\n00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:18,860\n>> Absolutely.\n\n765\n00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,050\n>> So, may or may not be interesting for\nyou to just be aware of, right?\n\n766\n00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,320\nSo that's the discussion on steganography.\n\n767\n00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,080\nWe do this a lot in the forensic classes,\nfor instance,\n\n768\n00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,960\nwhere we talk about forensics and things.\n\n769\n00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,620\nSpend a whole discussion area,\na whole chapter, a bunch of hands on stuff\n\n770\n00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,540\ndealing with different tools like\nthe one you showed to do steganography.\n\n771\n00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,340\nSo it's actually pretty\ninteresting stuff to play with.\n\n772\n00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,233\n>> Yeah, it is.\n>> All right,\n\n773\n00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:42,900\nao let's talk about\ndifferent types of ciphers.\n\n774\n00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,370\nWe talked already about substitution\nciphers and transposition up above.\n\n775\n00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,330\nJust wanted to remind you of that, and\nmake sure you were thinking about that.\n\n776\n00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:54,100\nSubstitution cyphers, a Caesar cypher\nis a good example there, shifted or\n\n777\n00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,130\nrotated the alphabet,\nremember we told you, by three spaces.\n\n778\n00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,850\nROT13 was another example of that from\nour prior episode, that would shift or\n\n779\n00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:06,110\nrotate by 13 characters, or\n13 spaces as we counted through.\n\n780\n00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:09,590\nAnd then transposition cyphers\nwhere we reordered the plain text.\n\n781\n00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,420\nSo you could see dictionary would\nbecome something like whatever\n\n782\n00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,790\nthe rotation was down there\nbelow in order to transpose.\n\n783\n00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:19,490\nSo just be aware of that,\nand be thinking about that.\n\n784\n00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:23,590\nWe also have this idea of key derivation\nfunctions, what are called KDFs,\n\n785\n00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,580\nthis is just a term that we use.\n\n786\n00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:29,850\nAnd this is how we are basically\ngenerating, or using this\n\n787\n00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:35,140\nfunction to generate keys that\nare used for random values, right?\n\n788\n00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,210\nSo, basically this idea is the key\nis made up of random values.\n\n789\n00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:41,040\nWe want to be able to generate\nkeys that have randomness in them.\n\n790\n00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,090\nAnd so the key derivation function,\nthe KDF,\n\n791\n00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:48,320\nis the process of being able to\ngenerate keys that are randomly made.\n\n792\n00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,120\nIn other words, keys that\nare basically made up of random parts.\n\n793\n00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,980\nSo that we can't discern,\nat least readily anyway, discern a pattern\n\n794\n00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,440\nthat may lead to us finding the key,\nfiguring out what the key is, and\n\n795\n00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,800\nas a result, effectively cracking or\nbreaking the encryption.\n\n796\n00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,960\n>> And it's tougher than what you\nmight think in computers, isn't it?\n\n797\n00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,000\nTrying to come up with some\ntruly random information.\n\n798\n00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,968\n>> It is, it is,\nwe often talk about random generators,\n\n799\n00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:12,940\npseudo-random generators,\nthis idea of trying to create randomness.\n\n800\n00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,110\nBut it's very hard to find a system that\ncan create enough randomness that will\n\n801\n00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,550\nnot discern or\nnot allow some certain patterns.\n\n802\n00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,190\n>> Right.\n>> Right, so that is important,\n\n803\n00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,170\nthat is definitely\nsomething to think about.\n\n804\n00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:24,720\nAnd number generators\nare really just that.\n\n805\n00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,360\nThey are these mathematical systems and\n\n806\n00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,830\nmathematical constructs that are used\nto generate random starting points or\n\n807\n00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:35,720\nrandom initialization vectors,\nto create our keys sometimes.\n\n808\n00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,953\nSo, we often hear pseudo-random number\ngenerators or number generators\n\n809\n00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:42,287\nbeing referred to in cryptographic\nsystems as being how we generate keys, so\n\n810\n00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,154\nthat's what we're talking about there.\n\n811\n00:38:46,468 --> 00:38:48,894\nAll right, so\nthen we have different key types.\n\n812\n00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:52,769\nWanted to talk about different algorithms,\nsymmetric versus asymmetric,\n\n813\n00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:57,580\nthis is single key or public-private key,\ndepending on how we're talking about this.\n\n814\n00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,780\nAnd so, algorithms are gonna\nbe implemented as one of two\n\n815\n00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,110\nsolutions in other words, right?\n\n816\n00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:06,110\nA symmetric key or a symmetric algorithm\nis going to be an algorithm that uses\n\n817\n00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,690\na single key, sometimes referred\nto as a private key solution, or\n\n818\n00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:12,750\nsame key solution,\nthey all basically mean the same thing.\n\n819\n00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,180\nAnd same key is used to both to\nencrypt and decrypt as you can see.\n\n820\n00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,870\nKeys must be securely exchanged\nbetween sender and recipient.\n\n821\n00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:22,560\nAnd so one of the things we run into\nhere with an issue is that, and\n\n822\n00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,600\nwe talked about this with the one time\npad where it's very hard to get those\n\n823\n00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,250\nsecurely sent and\nthen ultimately safeguarded,\n\n824\n00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:32,200\nis that since we only have what's\ncalled a private key in these systems.\n\n825\n00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,940\nIt's the issue and the difficulty of\ngiving someone your private key to allow\n\n826\n00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,470\nthem to read your message that\nreally proves to be difficult.\n\n827\n00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,838\n>> [CROSSTALK] Because if they've\nintercepted your email for example,\n\n828\n00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:44,531\nthat means they're in the channel that\nyou're using to communicate with this\n\n829\n00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:45,043\nother party.\n\n830\n00:39:45,043 --> 00:39:46,961\nSo if you send the key\nvia the same channel,\n\n831\n00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:50,014\nthere's a very good chance that\nthey're gonna steal that as well.\n\n832\n00:39:50,014 --> 00:39:53,702\nSo you'd almost have to find a different\nchannel to send that key down, or\n\n833\n00:39:53,702 --> 00:39:56,090\nanother method to get that\nkey to the other end.\n\n834\n00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:57,572\n>> You would, right, and\n\n835\n00:39:57,572 --> 00:40:02,550\nso what often happens is that we will see\nthis paired with an asymmetric system.\n\n836\n00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:05,750\nWe'll talk about this idea of hybrid\nsolutions a little bit later on.\n\n837\n00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:09,449\nAnd, when we do that, we'll see that\nwe actually use kind of the best parts\n\n838\n00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,370\nof both systems to transmit and\nsend these keys securely.\n\n839\n00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,290\nAnd we'll get to that.\n\n840\n00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:16,640\nWe'll talk about how that works in\na little while, but symmetric key systems,\n\n841\n00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,790\nsame key, must obviously\nexchange those keys securely.\n\n842\n00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:23,350\nFast is considered to be the fastest\nencryption technique meaning,\n\n843\n00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:26,070\nit is very good at doing\nbulk encryption of data.\n\n844\n00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:29,680\nSo if we have large volumes of\ndata that we want to encrypt,\n\n845\n00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,840\nsymmetric key solution is going\nto be very, very fast to do that.\n\n846\n00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,140\n>> Lightweight as far as\nthe processing power that they take.\n\n847\n00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,290\n>> By comparison to an asymmetric\nsolution, absolutely correct.\n\n848\n00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:42,470\nSo we are going to, as you can see here,\nright, block the data together.\n\n849\n00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:45,650\nWe work on blocks of data when\nwe use symmetric keys, and, so\n\n850\n00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:50,810\nwhat we're gonna do here, is just show you\nsome of these different block algorithms.\n\n851\n00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,620\nWe can also implement them\nas stream ciphers as well.\n\n852\n00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,900\nBut traditionally, symmetric systems are\ntypically seen as block implementations,\n\n853\n00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,210\nmore so than streams.\n\n854\n00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:03,060\nAnd, so you'll see that we have DES,\nthe Data Encryption Standard.\n\n855\n00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,660\nWe have triple DES, which is just\nthe DES solution multiplied by three.\n\n856\n00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,900\nWe have AES,\nthe Advanced Encryption Standard,\n\n857\n00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,680\nreplacing DES and\ntriple DES today more and more.\n\n858\n00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:16,074\nIDEA, We have the RC series,\nRC5 and 6, and\n\n859\n00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:19,657\nthen we have as a stream implementation,\nRC4.\n\n860\n00:41:19,657 --> 00:41:23,767\nAnd so we put some bit sizes or\nbit key sizes next to the algorithms for\n\n861\n00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:28,475\nyou to start getting you thinking about\nthe idea of how big is the key, right?\n\n862\n00:41:28,475 --> 00:41:29,485\nHow many bits does it have?\n\n863\n00:41:29,485 --> 00:41:32,615\nThe higher the number,\nthe stronger they key, traditionally.\n\n864\n00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,378\nAnd so\nDES there is listed as a 56-bit key.\n\n865\n00:41:35,378 --> 00:41:39,410\nThat's a 56-bit, what we call, actual key.\n\n866\n00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:44,556\nWe have 64-bit true key, which is meaning\nthat DES itself is actually a 64-bit key,\n\n867\n00:41:44,556 --> 00:41:47,260\nbut 8-bits are taken off for parity.\n\n868\n00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,381\nAnd so what we ultimately see is that we\nhave a 64-bit key total, but then we,\n\n869\n00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:52,215\nwe do have it down below\n[CROSSTALK] down there-\n\n870\n00:41:52,215 --> 00:41:53,031\n>> Yeah, I just wanna make sure\n\n871\n00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:53,685\nI've got down there.\n\n872\n00:41:53,685 --> 00:41:56,020\nOkay, so.\n>> Yeah, 64-bit total, 56-bit actual.\n\n873\n00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:59,980\nAnd so that we actually have a 56-bit\nkey that is used to encrypt, but\n\n874\n00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,740\n8 bits of the 64 are used for parity.\n\n875\n00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,960\nSo we'll talk more about\nthat as you saw briefly.\n\n876\n00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,930\nWe did our little preview there, and so\n\n877\n00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:08,545\nwe'll come back down to\nthat in just a little bit.\n\n878\n00:42:08,545 --> 00:42:12,045\nSo the hundred,\ntriple DES is a 168-bit key.\n\n879\n00:42:12,045 --> 00:42:17,185\nAgain we do this based on the actual key\nnot the true key, and so the idea is that,\n\n880\n00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:19,855\nor the actual key overall just the number\nof bits that are used to encrypt.\n\n881\n00:42:19,855 --> 00:42:23,931\nAnd so, as a result, what we're\nsaying is triple DES is 3 times 56.\n\n882\n00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:25,050\nRight?\nCuz 56 bits.\n\n883\n00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,372\nThere is a double DES by the way.\n\n884\n00:42:26,372 --> 00:42:29,380\nA 2DES, which would be 112 bits,\njust so you know.\n\n885\n00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,392\nAnd then AES can be implemented\neither as 128, or 256-bit key.\n\n886\n00:42:33,392 --> 00:42:35,940\nIt depends on the way\nyou set the system up.\n\n887\n00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,730\nIDEA is a 128-bit key solution.\n\n888\n00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:44,140\nRC5 and or RC6 will vary from\n64 all the way to 256 bits.\n\n889\n00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:47,740\nIt just depends on how, again,\nthe system is built, and then streams,\n\n890\n00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:54,630\nRC4 as a stream doesn't have a key bit\nsize associated with it in the stream.\n\n891\n00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:57,070\nWe just talk about it\nbeing a stream cipher.\n\n892\n00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,254\nSo, tripping over my own tongue here,\nas we speak.\n\n893\n00:42:58,254 --> 00:42:59,437\n>> I was gonna say,\nwe try to talk about it.\n\n894\n00:42:59,437 --> 00:43:00,458\n[LAUGH]\n>> We do.\n\n895\n00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:02,470\nWe're not very successful, typically.\n\n896\n00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,460\nAll right.\nSo let's talk about asymmetric keys, and\n\n897\n00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,490\njust asymmetric solutions here to\nkinda juxtapose, or compare the two.\n\n898\n00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,990\nWhere a stream solution, or,\nexcuse me, a symmetric key solution,\n\n899\n00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,400\nwhich is a single key solution\nwill use only a private key.\n\n900\n00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,830\nAsymmetric is gonna use\na public private key pair.\n\n901\n00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:25,013\nSo, we often hear this referred to as two\nkey system, public private key, key pairs.\n\n902\n00:43:25,013 --> 00:43:28,378\nAll these different terms we use, but\nat the end of the day we have two keys,\n\n903\n00:43:28,378 --> 00:43:30,190\none is private, one is public.\n\n904\n00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:34,790\nAnd so as a result, we keep one safe and\nsecure, we give one away freely.\n\n905\n00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:38,240\nAnd we use, depending on what\nthe function is that we want to achieve,\n\n906\n00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,420\nconfidentiality or\nnon-repudiation proof of origin integrity.\n\n907\n00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,130\nWe will use different keys to\nachieve different results.\n\n908\n00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,480\nBut the user, right?\n\n909\n00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,390\nSo the sender in this system will\nkeep their private key secure.\n\n910\n00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:54,860\nThe recipient will have a copy\nof the sender's public key,\n\n911\n00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,840\nnot their private key.\n\n912\n00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,003\n>> Hopefully.\n>> And as a result, hopefully, right.\n\n913\n00:43:58,003 --> 00:44:02,500\nAs a result of that, if the message\nin encrypted with the private key,\n\n914\n00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,370\nthe only key that can unencrypt\nthat will be the matching key, or\n\n915\n00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:07,740\nthe key pair, which is the public key.\n\n916\n00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:11,850\nSo, if we encrypt with our private key,\nit could be read, right,\n\n917\n00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:13,300\nwith our public key, right?\n\n918\n00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,170\nIf we encrypt with the public key, it\ncould only be read with the private key.\n\n919\n00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:18,850\nSo we have to think about what we're\ndoing, and what we wanna achieve, and\n\n920\n00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:19,580\nthings like that.\n\n921\n00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,174\n>> Confidentiality or non-repudiation.\n\n922\n00:44:21,174 --> 00:44:23,800\n>> Versus non-repudiation,\npre-vargin and integrity.\n\n923\n00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,280\n>> So if we keep our private key secure,\nand we use our private key, then,\n\n924\n00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,180\nobviously, we're gonna achieve one result.\n\n925\n00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,650\nIf we use our public key,\nthen we're gonna achieve another result.\n\n926\n00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:36,250\nSo, the idea here would be that\nwe wanna send a message securely\n\n927\n00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,870\nusing confidentiality.\n\n928\n00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:40,360\nWhat we're gonna do is we're\ngonna take the public key\n\n929\n00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:42,670\nof the person that we wanna\nhave read the message.\n\n930\n00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:45,550\n>> Right.\nNot mine, I get my recipient's public key.\n\n931\n00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:47,460\n>> So you want to take your\nrecipient's public key.\n\n932\n00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,710\nYou want to encrypt\nusing their public key.\n\n933\n00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:53,630\nBecause that means that only the private\nkey that they hold that, again in theory,\n\n934\n00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:57,590\nif the system is implemented correctly,\nis secure, can unencrypt that message.\n\n935\n00:44:57,590 --> 00:45:00,010\n>> So at that point I could send\nthe messages to everybody out there.\n\n936\n00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:04,120\nBut only that person with that matching\nprivate key should be able to decrypt it.\n\n937\n00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:04,620\n>> Correct.\n\n938\n00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:05,480\nRight, exactly correct.\n\n939\n00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,750\nSo that's we're gonna think about and\n\n940\n00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:11,000\nwhat we just wanna make sure we're focused\non when we're focused on confidentiality.\n\n941\n00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,830\nWhen we're focused on this idea of\nnon-repudiation, and or proof of origin\n\n942\n00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:18,870\nand integrity, what we're focused on is\nnot keeping the data hidden, so we don't\n\n943\n00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:22,200\ncare about this public-private key\nconcept in relation to confidentiality.\n\n944\n00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,910\n>> Right.\n>> When we focus on in relation to\n\n945\n00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:28,440\nintegrity, or proof of origin,\nnon-repudiation, what we wanna make sure\n\n946\n00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,440\nis that the person who sent the data and\nproof of origin has not lied.\n\n947\n00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,800\nIt's really Mike who's sending the data.\n\n948\n00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,380\nWhen we talk about integrity, we wanna\nmake sure the data has not been modified.\n\n949\n00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,730\nOne or both of these.\n\n950\n00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:43,470\nSo we'll deal with hashing when\nwe wanna deal with integrity.\n\n951\n00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:46,250\nRight we'll take a representation\nof the key mathematically.\n\n952\n00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,160\nWe don't send the key,\nwe send a representation of the data.\n\n953\n00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,490\nIf we are taking about proof of origin,\nright, non-repudiation,\n\n954\n00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:56,310\nwhat we're talking about there is\nmaking sure we are going to validate\n\n955\n00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:59,650\nthe message with our private key because\nwe're the only one that can do that.\n\n956\n00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:00,650\n>> Now we're not encrypting,\n\n957\n00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:04,790\nwe're simply digitally signing, like to\ndo proof of origin or non-repudiation.\n\n958\n00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:06,390\nAgain, terms we often hear,\n\n959\n00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,650\nwe'll explore later on in some\nof our future discussions.\n\n960\n00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:13,700\nAnd so as a result of that, what that\nmeans is that when we digitally sign\n\n961\n00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:17,940\nthe message with our private key, anybody\ncan take our public key, which is stored\n\n962\n00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:21,500\nout there in what are called key servers,\nand we can get them and download them.\n\n963\n00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,650\nAnd as a result of the public\nkey being widely available,\n\n964\n00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:28,710\nanybody that wants to validate that I'm\nthe one who signed the message can do so\n\n965\n00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:33,860\nbecause they can match my private key\ndigital signature to my public key and\n\n966\n00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,600\nshow that, in effect, they are the same.\n\n967\n00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,870\nNow what happens is again, we hash this,\nso we're doing a representation of that,\n\n968\n00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,580\nwe're not actually sending the key.\n\n969\n00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:45,300\nWe're sending a cryptographic\nrepresentation of the key through a hash\n\n970\n00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,350\nand as a result, we never expose\nthe key because you tell people,\n\n971\n00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,730\nwe signed it with our private key, and\nwe send it out so people can see it.\n\n972\n00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:53,760\nAnd they say, well, isn't that bad, right?\n\n973\n00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,990\nCuz it feels like we\nwere exposing the key.\n\n974\n00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:58,120\nIf you do that, how does the system work?\n\n975\n00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,250\nIt's no longer private, exactly.\n\n976\n00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,590\nAnd that's a good thought, right?\n\n977\n00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:02,090\nYou wanna be thinking that way.\n\n978\n00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:05,350\nBut we've anticipated that, right,\nwe've thought through that, and so\n\n979\n00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:09,530\nwhat we do is we hash the key, send out\nthe mathematical representation of it,\n\n980\n00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,300\nand then we compare that\nhash to the public key hash.\n\n981\n00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,570\nAnd if the two hashes match, we know\nthen we've got the key pair, right?\n\n982\n00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,410\nAnd that's what we're looking at.\n\n983\n00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:18,740\nSo that's what we say there.\n\n984\n00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,570\nWe say that asymmetric key\nsystems are considered to be, or\n\n985\n00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:26,820\nwe think of them as being set up in such\na way that it's computationally infeasible\n\n986\n00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,330\nto derive the private\nkey from the public key,\n\n987\n00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:31,130\nso what I was just explaining\nwith digital signatures, right?\n\n988\n00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:34,500\nWe're not exposing those keys\nby sending them out that way.\n\n989\n00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,770\n>> Yeah, if I've got your public key,\nit's like you said,\n\n990\n00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,160\nwe don't want to say impossible,\nright we never say that.\n\n991\n00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,440\n>> No, nothing will be truly impossible,\nbut it's very unlikely, highly unlikely.\n\n992\n00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,505\n>> Exactly, although that changes as\nour computers get more powerful and\n\n993\n00:47:45,505 --> 00:47:46,329\nthings like that.\n\n994\n00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:49,630\n>> It does, at some point,\nthat's a very good point to raise.\n\n995\n00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:53,030\nAt some point,\nit's gonna become computationally feasible\n\n996\n00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,040\nto break a certain set of keys\nbased on a certain algorithm.\n\n997\n00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:59,870\nSo, we're seeing the retirement of DES as\nan algorithm being used in a lot of these\n\n998\n00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:00,930\nsystems today.\n\n999\n00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:04,750\nBecause now, more or less, we've gotten to\nthe point where it can be cracked, right?\n\n1000\n00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,870\n>> With that shorter key space there,\nthat smaller key port.\n\n1001\n00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:11,462\n>> Well now with the computing power, more\nimportant, the key space was very big for\n\n1002\n00:48:11,462 --> 00:48:13,717\na long time, it was fine,\nTriple DES especially.\n\n1003\n00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:15,850\nBut because DES itself\nhas been compromised,\n\n1004\n00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,880\nthe idea is that it's\nonly a matter of time.\n\n1005\n00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,168\nAnd so what we now know,\nor what we have known for\n\n1006\n00:48:20,168 --> 00:48:23,963\nseveral years because we started planning\nfor this many moons ago, as we say.\n\n1007\n00:48:23,963 --> 00:48:27,959\nSo as a result, AES has been brought\nonline, and we're now seeing it being used\n\n1008\n00:48:27,959 --> 00:48:31,958\nto ultimately supplant and replace DES and\nultimately Triple DES in the federal\n\n1009\n00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:35,380\ngovernment, and in the military,\nand places like that.\n\n1010\n00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:40,880\nSo some examples of asymmetric keys,\nRSA is an example, the RSA keyset.\n\n1011\n00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:44,260\nThat's based on the factoring or factoring\nthe product of two prime numbers,\n\n1012\n00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,875\nreally should be very two\nlarge prime numbers, right?\n\n1013\n00:48:46,875 --> 00:48:51,606\nBecause one and three are not what we\nfactor to figure out how to do this.\n\n1014\n00:48:51,606 --> 00:48:53,899\nYes, four, that's the answer,\nit's always C, right?\n\n1015\n00:48:53,899 --> 00:48:55,015\nWe do four.\n\n1016\n00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,535\nSo it's not that,\nit's a little more involved than that, but\n\n1017\n00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:59,120\nthat is what we're talking about.\n\n1018\n00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,640\nI think Don and\nI talked about that as well.\n\n1019\n00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,740\nIn SSEP we did cryptography and\nwe just put up prime numbers and I said,\n\n1020\n00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,480\nyou know, it's actually pretty large prime\nnumbers and not just basic prime numbers.\n\n1021\n00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,520\nSo, be aware of that.\n\n1022\n00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,400\nJust show, just large prime numbers.\n\n1023\n00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:15,513\nAnd so, RSA is an example of\nan asymmetric solution Diffie-Hellman,\n\n1024\n00:49:15,513 --> 00:49:20,310\nwhich is named after the two last names of\nthe guys that created the Diffie-Hellman\n\n1025\n00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:23,140\narchitecture is gonna be used for\nkey exchange.\n\n1026\n00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,355\nSo this is used in things such as\nIPsec where we're doing key exchanges.\n\n1027\n00:49:27,355 --> 00:49:29,015\nWe'll talk more about that.\n\n1028\n00:49:29,015 --> 00:49:31,095\nEliptic curve is another example, and\n\n1029\n00:49:31,095 --> 00:49:35,185\nEl Gamel is also another example of\nthese systems that are asymmetric.\n\n1030\n00:49:36,215 --> 00:49:37,835\nSo we just wanna be aware of that.\n\n1031\n00:49:37,835 --> 00:49:40,051\nJust some starting off examples for us.\n\n1032\n00:49:40,051 --> 00:49:43,867\nNot a big deal deal, really don't have\nto know every one or individually or\n\n1033\n00:49:43,867 --> 00:49:44,647\ncollectively, but\n\n1034\n00:49:44,647 --> 00:49:47,387\nyou do wanna have a working knowledge\nof some examples of what these are.\n\n1035\n00:49:47,387 --> 00:49:48,387\n>> Which ones are which.\n\n1036\n00:49:48,387 --> 00:49:49,707\n>> Yeah.\nAnd by the way, RSA,\n\n1037\n00:49:49,707 --> 00:49:52,519\nlet's quickly throw this up there for\nthem for RSA.\n\n1038\n00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:56,427\nWe wanna make sure we know RSA, the\nbusiness RSA, in other words the company,\n\n1039\n00:49:56,427 --> 00:50:00,917\nis named after the last name of\nthe individuals that founded it.\n\n1040\n00:50:00,917 --> 00:50:04,730\nSo each letter is representing the last\nname of one of the three principals- And\n\n1041\n00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:07,350\nso R stands for Ron Rivest.\n\n1042\n00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:13,070\nLet's do it this way.\n\n1043\n00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:15,440\nRivest, R is for Rivest.\n\n1044\n00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,345\nThen we have S for Shamir, the last name.\n\n1045\n00:50:19,345 --> 00:50:23,480\nS-H-A-M-I-R, right, and A for Adleman.\n\n1046\n00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:29,010\nSo Adleman, or Rivest, Shamir and Adleman\nare the last names of the principals,\n\n1047\n00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:33,200\nthe three guys that found a couple, three\nof them, they're all mathematicians, or\n\n1048\n00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,160\nwere mathematicians, in universities, they\ngot together, kind of figured this thing\n\n1049\n00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,710\nout, came up with a plan, had this set\nof algorithms they used, and said, wow,\n\n1050\n00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:45,350\nthis may actually be worth something,\nfigured it out, went to market with it.\n\n1051\n00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:49,273\nAnd as a result they actually\nwere able to found this company.\n\n1052\n00:50:49,273 --> 00:50:54,731\nI think Adleman is A-D-L-E as opposed to\nA-D-E-L, but you get the general idea.\n\n1053\n00:50:54,731 --> 00:50:57,731\nYeah, last name,\nA-D-L-E as opposed to E-L, Adleman.\n\n1054\n00:50:57,731 --> 00:50:58,565\nYeah, there you go.\n\n1055\n00:50:58,565 --> 00:50:59,273\nVery good.\n\n1056\n00:50:59,273 --> 00:51:01,261\nAll right.\nAnd so then we have those, so\n\n1057\n00:51:01,261 --> 00:51:02,610\njust be aware of that.\n\n1058\n00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:09,480\nAnd when we talk about this idea\nof asymmetric/symmetric, right,\n\n1059\n00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,120\nwe're talking about block versus stream\nciphers, we mentioned RC4 was a stream.\n\n1060\n00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,360\nA lot of the others were implemented\nas blocks in the symmetric side.\n\n1061\n00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,020\nSo let's just make sure we talk for\n\n1062\n00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,150\na minute about the difference\nbetween these two.\n\n1063\n00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,110\nSo, we have them up here.\n\n1064\n00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:26,690\nSo stream ciphers are gonna be enciphering\ndata as a continuous stream of plain text.\n\n1065\n00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,340\nSo, bringing the data in,\n\n1066\n00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:31,860\nwalking it through an effect the crypto\nsystem in a continuous stream.\n\n1067\n00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,620\nMuch like a fire hose just\nshooting the data in there.\n\n1068\n00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,760\nAnd we encrypt it as it goes\nthrough the stream continuously.\n\n1069\n00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,590\n>> I like to think one of those old\ntimey meat grinders where you just pour\n\n1070\n00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:43,930\nthe data in, and it's coming right back\nout as it's going through your algorithm.\n\n1071\n00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:47,810\n>> So, it's the Pink Floyd the Wall\nconcept, is what we're doing there.\n\n1072\n00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:50,800\nSo, Dark Side of the Encryption Moon.\n\n1073\n00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,810\nSomething like that.\n\n1074\n00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:52,981\nOkay.\nI got that right.\n\n1075\n00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:57,132\nAll right so,\nplease join Mike after hours where he\n\n1076\n00:51:57,132 --> 00:52:01,774\nwill be hosting the psychedelic\nportion of the IT Pro TV.\n\n1077\n00:52:01,774 --> 00:52:02,816\n>> We can kick on\nthe black lights in here.\n\n1078\n00:52:02,816 --> 00:52:04,398\n>> Exactly.\n\n1079\n00:52:04,398 --> 00:52:06,065\nThe whole place lights up, it's awesome.\n\n1080\n00:52:06,065 --> 00:52:08,660\nWhat do you think all that stuff's\nblue in the background for, right?\n\n1081\n00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,330\nAll right so we do.\n\n1082\n00:52:10,505 --> 00:52:13,230\n>> Glowsticks [LAUGHS]\n>> All right so\n\n1083\n00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,930\nwe do have this idea of\ncontinuous streaming.\n\n1084\n00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:17,860\nSo what we're talking about\nhere is you have video and\n\n1085\n00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:21,230\naudio is typically encrypted this way\nbecause it's done as a continuous stream\n\n1086\n00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:23,800\nas opposed to chunking or\nblocking the text which\n\n1087\n00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,580\ncould be obviously problematic-\n>> Right.\n\n1088\n00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,710\n>> For something like video where\nyou're cutting it every 8, 10,\n\n1089\n00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:30,050\n12, 15 blocks, whatever it is.\n\n1090\n00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,740\nBecause it's gonna be very choppy, right?\n\n1091\n00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,020\nIt's gonna be very hard to deal with.\n\n1092\n00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,830\nSo this is done as a continuous stream.\n\n1093\n00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:36,850\nSo audio and\nvideo streams are done this way.\n\n1094\n00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:39,140\nAs a matter of fact,\nthe stream you guys are watching now,\n\n1095\n00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,570\nif you're watching this live, if not,\nwhen you watch the playback on this,\n\n1096\n00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:47,270\nat some point, or any of the IT Pro TV\nclasses that you go through,\n\n1097\n00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:49,620\nall of that is done with\ncontinuous streaming.\n\n1098\n00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,690\nAnd, so\nif we were to encrypt that traffic,\n\n1099\n00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:55,082\nit will be done with a stream cipher\nnot a block cipher just so you know.\n\n1100\n00:52:55,082 --> 00:52:56,700\nBlock ciphers on the other hand,\n\n1101\n00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,270\nwe have fixed size of block of\nplain text whatever that may be.\n\n1102\n00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:04,130\nIt may be eight bits in the block,\nit could be 64 bits in the block.\n\n1103\n00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:08,010\nDoesn't really matter, a variable size\ndepends on what we're using and what kind\n\n1104\n00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:11,520\nof algorithms we bring to the table,\nbut the size of the block will vary.\n\n1105\n00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,770\nThe point is, the block will be\npredetermined by the algorithm.\n\n1106\n00:53:14,770 --> 00:53:18,650\nAnd then, this is typically done in\nhardware because we have to do some\n\n1107\n00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:19,660\noffloading.\n\n1108\n00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:23,960\nWe have a little more computationally,\n\n1109\n00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,210\nwhat's the word I'm looking for,\ncomputationally intensive, right?\n\n1110\n00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:29,610\nIt's very, very intensive,\nthat's the word I was looking for.\n\n1111\n00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:34,210\nSo, computationally intensive exercises\nhere where we have to go through and\n\n1112\n00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,360\nchunk the data into blocks and\nthen run it through the crypto system and\n\n1113\n00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:41,260\nencrypt it or the other way effectively\nun-encrypt it going back the other way.\n\n1114\n00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:44,625\nWe really need to have some\nadditional hardware brought to\n\n1115\n00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:47,480\nto really have the full capabilities\nthat we need in the system\n\n1116\n00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,010\nto do this somewhat quickly because these\nsystems are much slower by comparison.\n\n1117\n00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,800\n>> Right.\n>> So block systems are gonna work\n\n1118\n00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,290\na lot slower than stream systems do.\n\n1119\n00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:58,110\nJust want to be aware of that because,\nobviously, as we're chunking the data,\n\n1120\n00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:02,100\nit takes extra steps to cut it into\nblocks and then and cipher it that way.\n\n1121\n00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,750\n>> Right.\n>> Whereas,\n\n1122\n00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:06,140\na stream cipher it's gonna be very\nquick cuz it's just moving through and\n\n1123\n00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,590\ncontinuously encrypting as we go.\n\n1124\n00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:10,148\nSo, just be aware of that as well.\n\n1125\n00:54:10,148 --> 00:54:13,440\nAll right, so\nwe have the block in the stream.\n\n1126\n00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,981\nLet's talk about the initialization\nvector, what's known as the IV.\n\n1127\n00:54:16,981 --> 00:54:20,825\nThe initialization vector injects the\nrandomness into our system that we need in\n\n1128\n00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:24,273\norder to be able to basically create\nour keys with enough randomness that\n\n1129\n00:54:24,273 --> 00:54:28,340\nwe are not gonna just generate the same\npatterns over and over and over again.\n\n1130\n00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,568\nSo in well thought out,\n\n1131\n00:54:29,568 --> 00:54:33,590\nwell-implemented crypto systems we\nuse an initialization vector, an IV,\n\n1132\n00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:38,580\nattached to our key that creates\na random starting value if you will.\n\n1133\n00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:42,280\nAnd then, as a result of that, we can\napply that randomness into the system and\n\n1134\n00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,210\ngenerate hopefully, as a result,\n\n1135\n00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:48,880\nkeys that are gonna be stronger through\nthis idea of being able to encipher,\n\n1136\n00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,060\nin effect, randomness into our systems,\nif you wanna think of it that way.\n\n1137\n00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:54,630\nSo the key goes into\nthe key stream generator.\n\n1138\n00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:58,430\nThe key stream comes down and\nwe encrypt with that along with the IV,\n\n1139\n00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:00,780\nthe initialization vector\nthat creates the randomness.\n\n1140\n00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,370\nThat's what we're gonna be\nthinking about and be looking at.\n\n1141\n00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:06,740\nSo, just random values basically,\nright, used with algorithms to ensure\n\n1142\n00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,340\nthe patterns are not created\nin a factoring key creation.\n\n1143\n00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,680\nSo we also have this idea going\nthrough and i mentioned this earlier,\n\n1144\n00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,780\nas we start to talk about asymmetric and\nsymmetric, going through and\n\n1145\n00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:20,550\neffectively combining the two, right,\ncreating what's called a hybrid system.\n\n1146\n00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:25,152\nAnd so let's just make sure we talk about\nthis idea of how we effectively take\n\n1147\n00:55:25,152 --> 00:55:28,352\nan asymmetric and a symmetric solution,\ncombine the two together,\n\n1148\n00:55:28,352 --> 00:55:31,670\nin order to effectively transmit\nthat private key securely.\n\n1149\n00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:35,540\nSo the issue with symmetric systems\nis how do we get the key from\n\n1150\n00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:39,560\none person to the other securely\nwithout having it being intercepted.\n\n1151\n00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:43,850\nSo the idea would be that if we wanna\nuse the quick encryption capabilities,\n\n1152\n00:55:43,850 --> 00:55:45,930\nbulk encryption, very fast-\n>> Doing most of the work, yeah.\n\n1153\n00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,530\n>> Of our symmetric system, but\n\n1154\n00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:51,870\nthen encrypt that key and send\nthe encrypted data with the private key\n\n1155\n00:55:51,870 --> 00:55:55,380\neither it's a long term storage to\nsomewhere else wherever we wanna do it\n\n1156\n00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:59,750\nwe need to the apply a asymmetric\nsystem that will encrypt the key and\n\n1157\n00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:03,750\nthen send the key securely and then\ndecrypt the key to then decrypt the data.\n\n1158\n00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,410\nAnd so what I just described\nroughly our hybrid system.\n\n1159\n00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:07,960\nSo let's think about how this works right?\n\n1160\n00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,326\nWe're going to take our hybrid system\ns gonna take our symmetrically\n\n1161\n00:56:12,326 --> 00:56:13,460\nencrypted data.\n\n1162\n00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:17,080\nSo we're going to encrypt our data\nsymmetrically, using our private key.\n\n1163\n00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,790\nSo let's say I'm gonna encrypt\nthe data that I want to use.\n\n1164\n00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:21,840\nThe dog is blue.\n\n1165\n00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,100\nLet's just say hypothetically.\n\n1166\n00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:23,600\nRight?\n\n1167\n00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,280\nAnd so what we're gonna do is\nwe're gonna encrypt that message.\n\n1168\n00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,441\n>> Oh no, there it is again.\n\n1169\n00:56:27,441 --> 00:56:30,180\n[LAUGH]\n>> We're gonna encrypt that message.\n\n1170\n00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:33,650\n>> We take, let's say,\nwe got our data and we wanna encrypt.\n\n1171\n00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,550\n>> Okay.\n>> Let's generate our symmetric key.\n\n1172\n00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:44,620\n>> Okay.\nSymmetric.\n\n1173\n00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:46,580\nVery good.\n>> And we'll use that to encrypt the data.\n\n1174\n00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,750\n>> And so we'll wrap that, right?\n\n1175\n00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:49,280\nSo just kind of put a wrapper around that.\n\n1176\n00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,290\nAnd that's going to be,\n\n1177\n00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:53,270\nour symmetrically encrypted data will\nbe encrypted with our private key.\n\n1178\n00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:56,910\n>> If we're doing EFS we could put\nit right there I guess, but, right?\n\n1179\n00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:57,700\n>> Okay, yeah, that's fine.\n\n1180\n00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:58,280\nYeah, that's.\n\n1181\n00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,080\nWe just wanna know it's\nsymmetrically encrypted.\n\n1182\n00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:04,520\nSo then what we need to do is we need to\nbe able to transfer that symmetric key\n\n1183\n00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:12,110\nover to the recipient in such a way\nthat we are not going to expose the key.\n\n1184\n00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:15,400\nBut at the same time, we have to be\nable to have them read the data.\n\n1185\n00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,950\nSo what we're gonna do is we're going to,\nokay, very good.\n\n1186\n00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:22,480\n>> Yeah, I know my drawing leaves\na little bit to be desired.\n\n1187\n00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,560\nSo we wanna send-\n>> You're being generous there, sir.\n\n1188\n00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,375\nIt leaves a lot to be desired,\nbut that's okay.\n\n1189\n00:57:27,375 --> 00:57:30,990\n[LAUGH] Got our anorexic stick\nfigure sitting over there.\n\n1190\n00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:31,670\n>> Yeah.\n>> He's got a hip\n\n1191\n00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:32,750\ndisplacement it looks like.\n\n1192\n00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,311\n>> Yeah.\nLet's see, we get his public.\n\n1193\n00:57:34,311 --> 00:57:35,061\n>> Okay.\n\n1194\n00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:35,840\n>> And private key over here.\n\n1195\n00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,720\n>> All right.\nSo we'll just finish putting out our\n\n1196\n00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,910\nlittle do-dads,\nthat's our technical term by the way.\n\n1197\n00:57:42,910 --> 00:57:43,560\n>> Yes, yes.\n\n1198\n00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,130\n>> That's the official IT Tech term.\n\n1199\n00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:48,230\nOur do-dads to be able to do\nour encryption/decryption here.\n\n1200\n00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:51,390\nAll right, so what we have, is we have\nsymmetrically encrypted data on the left.\n\n1201\n00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:53,140\nWe're now gonna go through and\n\n1202\n00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:59,180\ndo an asymmetric encryption wrapper\naround that symmetrically encrypted data.\n\n1203\n00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:02,160\nBut specifically around\nthe symmetrically encrypted key.\n\n1204\n00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,440\nMost importantly, we don't really care\nabout re-encrypting the data as much as we\n\n1205\n00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,130\ndo about re-encrypting the key.\n\n1206\n00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:08,390\nThat's going to be critical.\n\n1207\n00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:10,380\nSo we're going to take\nthat symmetric key and\n\n1208\n00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,830\nwe're going to asymmetrically encrypt it.\n\n1209\n00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:16,640\nWe're going to asymmetrically encrypt it\nin such a way that we can send it over\n\n1210\n00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,100\nthere to our person,\nour recipient, whoever it is.\n\n1211\n00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:24,740\nAnd so what we have to do, is we have to\ntake the recipient's public key, right?\n\n1212\n00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,280\nAnd we have to encrypt,\n\n1213\n00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,240\nso that they're the only ones that can\nde-crypt the massage to get the key\n\n1214\n00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,960\nthat has been use to symmetrically\nused to encrypt the data.\n\n1215\n00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,380\nSo we're gonna take that, we're gonna\ntake the recipient's public key.\n\n1216\n00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:41,300\nWe're gonna asymmetrically encrypt\nthe symmetric, private key.\n\n1217\n00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:45,990\nAnd then we are then gonna send\na message along with the symmetrically\n\n1218\n00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:51,500\nencrypted key over to the recipient, the\ntarget recipient, whoever that will be.\n\n1219\n00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,700\nWhen they receive the message,\n\n1220\n00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:58,250\nwhat they have to do is they have to\nasymmetrically un-encrypt the symmetric\n\n1221\n00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:04,160\nkey using their private key to un-encrypt\nthe encrypted symmetric private key.\n\n1222\n00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:09,326\nAnd then, when they've un-encrypted\nthe symmetric key, the private key,\n\n1223\n00:59:09,326 --> 00:59:14,520\nfrom the sender that was used\nto encrypt the data initially,\n\n1224\n00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,370\nthey can effectively unlock the key.\n\n1225\n00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:19,510\nThen they can unlock the data.\n\n1226\n00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:23,820\nAnd so, think of this as being\nputting the data inside of a chest,\n\n1227\n00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:28,690\nlocking it with a key padlock, taking\nthat key and then encrypting it, and\n\n1228\n00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:32,020\nputting it inside another box\nwith another lock on it, right?\n\n1229\n00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:36,090\nSo two sets of boxes,\nwe ship both sets to the recipient.\n\n1230\n00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:39,870\nThe recipient has to have the key that\nunlocks the box with the first key in it,\n\n1231\n00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:42,040\nto unlock the box with the data.\n\n1232\n00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:45,370\nAnd that's effectively what\nwe see with a hybrid system.\n\n1233\n00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:48,430\nAnd so as a result of this, right, once we\n\n1234\n00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:53,890\nprogrammatically send the symmetric key\nover to the recipient safely and securely.\n\n1235\n00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:57,930\nThen they can un-encrypt the data\nthat was symmetrically encrypted.\n\n1236\n00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:00,430\nBut now, and\nwe point this out there as well,\n\n1237\n01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,590\nwe now have the symmetric-key safely and\nsecurely transmitted.\n\n1238\n01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:07,440\nSo now that they have it, we can\neffectively decide to use symmetric-key\n\n1239\n01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,150\nencryption for everything else if we\nwant to, because as a result of that,\n\n1240\n01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,500\nthey have a copy of the key.\n\n1241\n01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:13,764\n>> And we see this in many places.\n\n1242\n01:00:13,764 --> 01:00:14,461\nI mean, in use, right?\n\n1243\n01:00:14,461 --> 01:00:16,190\nWe see-\n>> We do, we do.\n\n1244\n01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:17,990\nOh, sure, of course, right, right.\n\n1245\n01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:20,290\n>> EFS uses a hybrid like this.\n\n1246\n01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:22,940\n>> It does, the encrypting file\nsystem inside of Windows, right?\n\n1247\n01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:24,840\nSo absolutely, we see it there.\n\n1248\n01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,180\nWe see it in lots of places.\n\n1249\n01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,340\nYou actually see an example of this,\n\n1250\n01:00:28,340 --> 01:00:32,570\nalthough it's not using code keys like\nthis, but physicality- physical keys.\n\n1251\n01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,220\nWe see this represented in movies,\nof course, all the time.\n\n1252\n01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,410\nBut it happens to work this\nway in the real world as well.\n\n1253\n01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:39,770\nSo when you think about\nlaunching nuclear weapons.\n\n1254\n01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,260\n>> Right.\n>> For instance we see an example of this.\n\n1255\n01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,430\nWhere the launch keys are separated.\n\n1256\n01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:46,610\nThat's where you have\na public-private key pair in effect.\n\n1257\n01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,190\nTwo officers have the keys.\n\n1258\n01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:51,660\nThey both have to effectively be present,\ninsert their keys into the system.\n\n1259\n01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,550\n>> Too far for one person to reach?\n\n1260\n01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:54,597\n>> Too far.\nUnless you have this really,\n\n1261\n01:00:54,597 --> 01:00:55,475\nabnormally long arms, right?\n\n1262\n01:00:55,475 --> 01:00:56,178\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n1263\n01:00:56,178 --> 01:00:58,270\nif you're the octopus running around,\nOctoman can do it, right?\n\n1264\n01:00:58,270 --> 01:00:59,270\n>> Right, Stretch Armstrong, yeah.\n\n1265\n01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:01,440\n>> But if you think about it right,\nso that's what we see.\n\n1266\n01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,023\nBut what you see in a lot of the movies,\nand is indeed the case,\n\n1267\n01:01:04,023 --> 01:01:06,150\nis there's a third part to that system.\n\n1268\n01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:08,310\nWhich is that there is a safe\nsomewhere on the building, or\n\n1269\n01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:11,730\nwherever they are, where the launch codes\nor the instructions to arm the system,\n\n1270\n01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:15,473\nwhatever, that are part of that sequence,\nare stored separately, right?\n\n1271\n01:01:15,473 --> 01:01:18,210\nAnd so,\nthere's like multiple parts of the system.\n\n1272\n01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:22,470\nThey have to go in and open the vault,\ntake out the launch code container, break\n\n1273\n01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:26,680\nit open, follow those instructions to t\nup the system in effect and turn it on.\n\n1274\n01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,558\nThen they have to insert\ntheirs keys ultimately,\n\n1275\n01:01:29,558 --> 01:01:32,867\nto be able to arm the system and\nblow the world up,right?\n\n1276\n01:01:32,867 --> 01:01:35,255\nWould you like to play a game?\n\n1277\n01:01:35,255 --> 01:01:37,217\nGlobal thermonuclear war, right?\n\n1278\n01:01:37,217 --> 01:01:38,677\nThat's another one I gotta re-watch.\n\n1279\n01:01:38,677 --> 01:01:40,597\n>> What would we do without War Games?\n\n1280\n01:01:40,597 --> 01:01:41,687\n>> Have nothing to talk about.\n\n1281\n01:01:41,687 --> 01:01:43,397\nIt's all these movies, right?\n\n1282\n01:01:43,397 --> 01:01:44,767\nSo War Games, right?\n\n1283\n01:01:44,767 --> 01:01:46,227\nWe've got Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\n\n1284\n01:01:46,227 --> 01:01:48,227\n>> Ferris Bueller's Day Off,\nI mean those two are on my list.\n\n1285\n01:01:48,227 --> 01:01:49,937\n>> We've gotta work Fast Times\nin there somewhere, right?\n\n1286\n01:01:49,937 --> 01:01:50,807\n>> Oh, we really should.\n\n1287\n01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,267\n>> Yeah with the whole black light thing.\n\n1288\n01:01:52,267 -->

times.\n\n1298\n01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:08,478\nRight?\nSo speaking of fast, right?\n\n1299\n01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:11,200\nSo, your symmetric system's\nobviously very fast, right.\n\n1300\n01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,640\nAsymmetric system's much\nslower by comparison\n\n1301\n01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:16,930\nbecause we have to do the encryption,\ndecryption using multiple keys and so\n\n1302\n01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:18,490\nit does take a little longer, right?\n\n1303\n01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:21,520\nSo now that we've talked about asymmetric,\ntalked about symmetric,\n\n1304\n01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:25,590\ntalked about hybrid systems, wanna make\nsure we have a good understanding of this,\n\n1305\n01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:30,210\nlaying another layer in there if we will,\nof some of the complexity of how we build\n\n1306\n01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:33,080\nsome of these systems using these\nalgorithms, bring them together.\n\n1307\n01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,560\nWe're going to delve a little\ndeeper in our next discussion\n\n1308\n01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:37,240\ninto some of the underlying algorithms.\n\n1309\n01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:39,160\nWe're gonna tear DES apart a little bit,\n\n1310\n01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,910\nlook at what goes on in there Talk about\nnot just DES, but we'll also talk about,\n\n1311\n01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:47,330\nexcuse me, AES and some of the other\nalgorithms that we structure as well.\n\n1312\n01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:49,730\nTalk about the different ways\nin which they are set up and\n\n1313\n01:02:49,730 --> 01:02:52,690\nhow we actually use them to\ncreate these secure solutions.\n\n1314\n01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:53,220\n>> Very good.\n\n1315\n01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:53,730\nSounds good.\n\n1316\n01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,940\nWell all right,\nwe'll see everybody back here in a few.\n\n1317\n01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:03,352\n[SOUND].\n\n1318\n01:03:03,352 --> 01:03:06,520\nAll right, welcome back everybody\nto our Cryptography episode.\n\n1319\n01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:10,060\nAnd, we left off going over the breakdown\nof some of our encryption algorithm.\n\n1320\n01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:11,470\n>> We did.\n\n1321\n01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:14,480\n>> Kind of how they work and how-\n>> Doing the encryption breakdown.\n\n1322\n01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,005\n>> Yeah, the encryption breakdown.\n\n1323\n01:03:16,005 --> 01:03:17,175\nI like it.\nWe'll see a new fad coming out\n\n1324\n01:03:17,175 --> 01:03:18,205\nwith that one now.\n\n1325\n01:03:18,205 --> 01:03:19,225\nWell, let's go right back into it.\n\n1326\n01:03:19,225 --> 01:03:21,705\nI think we left off getting ready\nto talk about good old DES, or\n\n1327\n01:03:21,705 --> 01:03:22,545\nData Encryption Standard.\n\n1328\n01:03:22,545 --> 01:03:23,565\n>> We did, we did, yes.\n\n1329\n01:03:23,565 --> 01:03:26,515\nWe're gonna do a deeper dive on some of\nthese protocols, now that we're talked\n\n1330\n01:03:26,515 --> 01:03:29,235\na little bit about them, these algorithms,\nI should say, not protocols, excuse me.\n\n1331\n01:03:29,235 --> 01:03:31,815\n>> Yep.\n>> Right idea, wrong topical reference.\n\n1332\n01:03:31,815 --> 01:03:34,640\nAnd so we're gonna start with DES and\nwork our way down.\n\n1333\n01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,100\nThere's a lot to do here just\naround DES and the modes of DES and\n\n1334\n01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,690\nthe different ways it can be implemented.\n\n1335\n01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,630\nSo DES, as you can see,\nis gonna be a 64-bit.\n\n1336\n01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:43,375\nWe spoke about this in our last episode.\n\n1337\n01:03:43,375 --> 01:03:47,150\n64-bit total algorithm but 56-bit actual.\n\n1338\n01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:50,211\nWe effectively say there Is\nthat the 56-bit true key is\n\n1339\n01:03:50,211 --> 01:03:52,140\nwhat's used to do the encryption.\n\n1340\n01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:56,350\nWe have an 8-bit parity key, or\n8-bit parity take off rather.\n\n1341\n01:03:56,350 --> 01:04:00,540\nSo you have the 64-bit total loses 8-bits\nwhen we actually go to do the encryption.\n\n1342\n01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,530\nSo wanna be aware of that.\n\n1343\n01:04:02,530 --> 01:04:06,240\nAnd then we have symmetric block,\nright, encryption.\n\n1344\n01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,590\nIt is remember going to be\na symmetric block solution.\n\n1345\n01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:13,460\nWe go through 16 rounds of transposition\nand substitution when we implement DES.\n\n1346\n01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:17,352\nSo 16 rounds of basically this\ntransposition and substitution,\n\n1347\n01:04:17,352 --> 01:04:21,378\nthe XORing that is being done to\nsubstitute out and to go through this,\n\n1348\n01:04:21,378 --> 01:04:23,810\nis gonna be done through 16 rounds.\n\n1349\n01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:30,800\nAnd so what we see there,\nis we see DES modes coming up and\n\n1350\n01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,620\nso we're gonna have several different\nmodes that we're going to take a look at.\n\n1351\n01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,760\nWe're gonna have five of them overall.\n\n1352\n01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,855\nI was gonna do this, but we have five.\n\n1353\n01:04:37,855 --> 01:04:38,364\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1354\n01:04:38,364 --> 01:04:40,290\n>> So we have five modes overall.\n\n1355\n01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:43,050\nI don't think you can see them all on\nthe screen right now, but that's okay.\n\n1356\n01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:43,700\nWe'll get to them.\n\n1357\n01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:47,100\nI think we're missing a couple down at\nthe bottom, OFB and counter are there but\n\n1358\n01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:47,720\ndown at the bottom.\n\n1359\n01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:50,530\nSo, we're gonna go through, and we're\ngonna talk about the different ways in\n\n1360\n01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:53,290\nwhich guess and effect can be\nimplemented and the ways it works.\n\n1361\n01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:57,500\nNow you'll notice there's a fairly\nbig conversation up front about ECB,\n\n1362\n01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:58,760\nElectronic Code Booking.\n\n1363\n01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,060\nWe have some, a little bit of detail for\n\n1364\n01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,840\nsome of the others because ECB\nis one of the more common ones.\n\n1365\n01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,020\nIt's usually one that's\nimplemented most often and\n\n1366\n01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,600\nas a result the one that you\nprobably wanna know the most about.\n\n1367\n01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:13,350\nSo Electronic Code Book, ECB,\nlet's just talk a little bit about this.\n\n1368\n01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:17,970\nSo we take 64 bit blocks of\ndata in along with a key and\n\n1369\n01:05:17,970 --> 01:05:22,490\nwe produce ciphertext out the backend\nusing the electronic codebook DES mode.\n\n1370\n01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:25,892\nAnd effectively, what we say there is\nthat you can see, for a given block of\n\n1371\n01:05:25,892 --> 01:05:31,220\nplain text and a given key, we always get\nthe same block of ciphertext out the back.\n\n1372\n01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,000\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n1373\n01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,250\nwhile that's good because it's something\nthat we can rely on, it's bad in the sense\n\n1374\n01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:42,435\nthat if we have two keys that are used\nagainst two pieces of plain text and\n\n1375\n01:05:42,435 --> 01:05:45,995\nwe get some sort of collision that\ngives us the same ciphertext,\n\n1376\n01:05:45,995 --> 01:05:48,585\nwhat's going to happen is,\nultimately we will start to see patterns.\n\n1377\n01:05:48,585 --> 01:05:51,185\nAnd so this can obviously be a problem.\n\n1378\n01:05:51,185 --> 01:05:55,300\nSo what we say is we really only want\nto see this used for short messages\n\n1379\n01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:58,780\nbecause if we use this very large amounts\nof data we're going to run the risk of\n\n1380\n01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:02,170\nhaving this collision so those keys\nrepeating and those patterns emerging.\n\n1381\n01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,216\nSo, we don't want to encrypt War and\nPeace with this\n\n1382\n01:06:05,216 --> 01:06:05,990\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1383\n01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:09,230\n>> But we do want to encrypt very\nbasic messages like maybe three, four,\n\n1384\n01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:10,940\nfive pages of text, something like that.\n\n1385\n01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,490\nNo problem but\nnot very big messages, certainly.\n\n1386\n01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:13,000\n>> Right.\n\n1387\n01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,055\nSo given block of plain text and\n\n1388\n01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:18,750\na given key we always get the same\nblock ciphertext out the back end.\n\n1389\n01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:22,690\nNot all plain text, however, comes in\nthese nice little 64-bit block packages\n\n1390\n01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:26,320\nneatly wrapped up and so we do what's\ncalled padding, right, where we have to\n\n1391\n01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:31,000\nadd blocks in effectively to bring that\nparticular, or rather add bits in to\n\n1392\n01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,810\nthe block, I should say, to bring it up to\nthe full size of the block because we only\n\n1393\n01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:39,410\nencrypt 64-bit blocks at a time, and\nif it's not 64 bits, we can't encrypt it.\n\n1394\n01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:40,540\n>> Right.\n>> So we pad or\n\n1395\n01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:45,910\nadd extra stuff in, effectively noise,\njust random bits in the block.\n\n1396\n01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:46,670\nThey don't mean anything.\n\n1397\n01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,739\nThey're tagged in such a way that we know\nto remove them when we do the decryption,\n\n1398\n01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:50,635\nso it's not a big deal.\n\n1399\n01:06:50,635 --> 01:06:54,383\nBut it does allow us to get a fully formed\nblock on the back end of that to be able\n\n1400\n01:06:54,383 --> 01:06:56,150\nto effectively do the encryption.\n\n1401\n01:06:56,150 --> 01:06:58,449\n>> Because that mode is expecting\na 64-bit chunk to come in.\n\n1402\n01:06:58,449 --> 01:06:59,111\n>> Absolutely correct.\n\n1403\n01:06:59,111 --> 01:07:00,300\nIt's expecting that.\n\n1404\n01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:04,820\nIf it doesn't have that then we have an\nissue cuz it doesn't work the right way.\n\n1405\n01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:07,330\nSo expectation's obviously\nvery important there.\n\n1406\n01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:10,000\nWhen we go through and we do that,\nwe can run this in parallel.\n\n1407\n01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,460\nMultiple blocks can be\nencrypted simultaneously.\n\n1408\n01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:16,190\nSo, we have multiple streams running\nwhich is good cuz economy of scale there.\n\n1409\n01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:19,940\nAnd the other nice thing about ECB is\nthat if we have errors that occur,\n\n1410\n01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:22,430\nthey're limited to that\nsingle block of text, or\n\n1411\n01:07:22,430 --> 01:07:26,190\nthat single block, that encryption block,\nbecause they don't get out beyond that.\n\n1412\n01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:29,890\nSo you imagine you're packing up two or\nthree different boxes,\n\n1413\n01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:32,960\nputting stuff into two or\nthree different boxes, if you screw up and\n\n1414\n01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,080\nput something in one box that doesn't\nbelong there, it's only in that one box.\n\n1415\n01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:37,400\n>> Right.\nDoesn't affect the other box.\n\n1416\n01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,430\n>> So that won't be found anywhere else.\n\n1417\n01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:38,940\nRight.\nSo\n\n1418\n01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:41,820\nthat's good, because we contain\nthe error to the particular block that\n\n1419\n01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:43,750\nthe encryption was working on at the time.\n\n1420\n01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:46,650\nSo in that respect, it's very good\nthe error doesn't spread, and potentially\n\n1421\n01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:50,330\ndisrupt the entire data stream,\nwhich can obviously be very problematic.\n\n1422\n01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:53,680\nSo we wanna make sure we have\na sense of ECB and how this works.\n\n1423\n01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:55,550\nPretty common as a DES mode.\n\n1424\n01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:58,800\nCipher Block Chaining (CBC),\nalso failure common.\n\n1425\n01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,470\nThis overcomes the issue of pattern\nrecognition that's found in ECB\n\n1426\n01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:07,200\nbecause what we do is we use this concept\nof XORing, where we're creating randomness\n\n1427\n01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,440\nby taking the enciphered output of one\nround and using it as the random input to\n\n1428\n01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:18,180\ngenerate along with the next round to go\nin as the input for the new enciphering.\n\n1429\n01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:22,113\nAnd so as a result, we're re-encrypting,\nin effect, the encrypted data, but\n\n1430\n01:08:22,113 --> 01:08:26,090\nthat encrypted input is then gonna create\nrandomness for the next go around.\n\n1431\n01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:28,660\nAnd so it's the concept of\nXORing that we refer to.\n\n1432\n01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:31,990\n>> And we lose that repeatability or\nthat pattern.\n\n1433\n01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:33,810\n>> Well, we do if it's done the right way.\n\n1434\n01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:34,310\nRight?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1435\n01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:35,510\n>> If it's not then obviously we\n\n1436\n01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:38,510\npotentially can find out\nthat there was a pattern.\n\n1437\n01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:42,540\nAnd remember, errors can ripple through\nthe system because now we're overcoming\n\n1438\n01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:46,340\nthis idea of repeatability\nby isolating each block\n\n1439\n01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:48,990\ninto this idea of streaming\nthis information in effect.\n\n1440\n01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:51,610\nBlocks, don't get me wrong,\nwe're not talking about streaming and\n\n1441\n01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:52,390\nstream ciphers,\n\n1442\n01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:56,290\nall I'm pointing out is we're effectively\nmoving the contents of one block\n\n1443\n01:08:56,290 --> 01:09:00,630\ninto the beginning of the next one to\nreplicate that and create some randomness.\n\n1444\n01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:04,535\nBut because we're moving now, we can take\nthat error that was created in block one\n\n1445\n01:09:04,535 --> 01:09:08,499\nand see it in effect, stream all the way\nthrough the system because we're now using\n\n1446\n01:09:08,499 --> 01:09:10,660\nthat as we push it out\nfrom multiple blocks.\n\n1447\n01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:15,640\nSo,we do potentially have the issue to\ncreate almost like a ripple effect as it\n\n1448\n01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:19,960\nmoves through in cipher block chaining,\nso that is something to consider.\n\n1449\n01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:23,740\nSo, the results of one blocks are XORed\nwith the next block before encrypting and\n\n1450\n01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:27,110\nas a result the output of one\nbecomes the input for the next.\n\n1451\n01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:31,100\nSo imagine we're going this way,\nright, so we take plain text, right?\n\n1452\n01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:31,740\nWe cipher it.\n\n1453\n01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:33,270\nWe run it through the crypto system.\n\n1454\n01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:34,750\nDrops down right here.\n\n1455\n01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:36,360\nThis is now ciphertext.\n\n1456\n01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,230\nWe take that ciphertext.\n\n1457\n01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:41,290\nWe XOR it through and\nput it up as the input for\n\n1458\n01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:44,100\nthe next go around and\nwe do this multiple times.\n\n1459\n01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,170\nRight?\nDoing this.\n\n1460\n01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:45,830\nAll the way around.\n\n1461\n01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:46,820\nI'm gonna turn around.\n\n1462\n01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:47,920\nAll the way around, right?\n\n1463\n01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,990\nSo we do it all the way around\nthrough the whole thing and\n\n1464\n01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:54,010\nthen what happens is ultimately you have\n16 rounds, 12 rounds, whatever it is.\n\n1465\n01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:54,900\nDoesn't really matter.\n\n1466\n01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:59,900\nThe end of the day, when we get done, the\nonly way to unencrypt that is to reverse\n\n1467\n01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:04,830\nengineer the number of rounds we did and\neffectively unXOR by unwrapping\n\n1468\n01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:09,250\nthat input every time to undo it to get\nback to the original ciphertext and\n\n1469\n01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:10,870\nultimately the original plaintext.\n\n1470\n01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:14,440\nSo this could become very difficult to\nunwind because we have to know the exact\n\n1471\n01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:18,450\npattern of sequencing that the ciphering\nwas done and that the XORing was done to\n\n1472\n01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:21,490\napply the randomness in or,\nin effect, we have a problem.\n\n1473\n01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:24,286\nAnd so if there's an error that\npropagates through the system,\n\n1474\n01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:27,308\nwe actually wind up having an issue\nbecause we may screw up the error.\n\n1475\n01:10:27,308 --> 01:10:32,665\nThe error can screw up and affect that\npattern and then we run into an issue.\n\n1476\n01:10:32,665 --> 01:10:35,592\nAnd so you get the,\nsorry I can't un-encrypt your data,\n\n1477\n01:10:35,592 --> 01:10:36,980\ncome back later attitude.\n\n1478\n01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:37,550\n>> Right.\n\n1479\n01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:38,810\n>> Try us again in a few years.\n\n1480\n01:10:38,810 --> 01:10:40,225\nRight?\nSo this is cipher block change.\n\n1481\n01:10:40,225 --> 01:10:42,020\n[LAUGH] Wanna make sure\nwe understand that.\n\n1482\n01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:43,700\nNo, we're not gonna give it back\nto you we're just gonna keep it.\n\n1483\n01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:44,200\nSorry.\n>> Yep, yep.\n\n1484\n01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:44,700\n>> You didn't really\n\n1485\n01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:46,220\nwant it back, did you?\n\n1486\n01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:47,410\nSo big disclaimer, right?\n\n1487\n01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:48,960\nYou never get data back.\n\n1488\n01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:49,540\nRight?\n\n1489\n01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:52,010\nAll right.\nSo cipher feedback, CFB,\n\n1490\n01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:55,540\nthis is gonna combine block and\nstream ciphers together so\n\n1491\n01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:57,860\nas a result we kinda use\nthe best of both here.\n\n1492\n01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,220\nRight?\nJust remember stream cipher's very fast,\n\n1493\n01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:04,030\nblock cipher's slower, a little bit\nmore involved, more complicated.\n\n1494\n01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:07,560\nSo the initialization vector plus\nan algorithm is used to create a key\n\n1495\n01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,540\nstream here.\n\n1496\n01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,590\nWhich is then used to be able\nto ultimately encrypt the data.\n\n1497\n01:11:11,888 --> 01:11:15,700\nAnd so cipher feedback then is\nbasically gonna combine block and\n\n1498\n01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:17,130\nstream functionality together.\n\n1499\n01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:18,255\nThis is what we wanna know about this.\n\n1500\n01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:23,180\nOutput feedback, OFB, is a block\ncipher that emulates a stream, so\n\n1501\n01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,630\nit's a block that works like a stream.\n\n1502\n01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:30,900\nAnd counter mode, CTR,\nis going to be same as output feedback so\n\n1503\n01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:35,110\nit's gonna basically do that emulation,\nblock like a stream but\n\n1504\n01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:39,250\ninstead of randomized initialization\nvectors, cuz we used random IVs in\n\n1505\n01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:43,820\nthese other methods, we actually use an IV\nthat is incremented on a counting system.\n\n1506\n01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:48,160\nSo the initialization vector\nis still randomly chosen, but\n\n1507\n01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:52,530\nonce we choose it, we then have a counter\nsystem that increments that by some value.\n\n1508\n01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:53,350\nDepends on what it is.\n\n1509\n01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,800\nMaybe it's every two or\nthree or five or whatever.\n\n1510\n01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:59,649\nBut there's a counter system and\nas a result of that, the IV,\n\n1511\n01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:03,880\nonce initialized, will go up by\na certain sequence of iterations.\n\n1512\n01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:07,001\nA certain amount of numbers are added,\na certain amount of places,\n\n1513\n01:12:07,001 --> 01:12:10,340\nwhatever it is And as a result,\nwe ultimately then are able to track every\n\n1514\n01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:13,760\ntime we use that initialization\nvector because it's incremented.\n\n1515\n01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,110\nAnd so as a result, we then know.\n\n1516\n01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:18,930\nSo that's why we call it countermode,\nbecause it is gonna use an IV\n\n1517\n01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:22,860\nthat is going to have some sort of\nincremental association with it and\n\n1518\n01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:24,490\nwe could track that incrementing is.\n\n1519\n01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:30,860\nSo these are the five different modes,\nthe DES can be set up to run it and\n\n1520\n01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:35,660\nagain typically ECB electronic code\nbooking and cypher block chaining CBC,\n\n1521\n01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:39,440\nthese others are a little\nless likely to be seen.\n\n1522\n01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,180\nThey are used but\n\n1523\n01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:44,690\nperhaps not used as often, you\nare unlikely to see them by comparison.\n\n1524\n01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:48,440\nOn having said that the idea of knowing\nthe five different modes that DES\n\n1525\n01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:51,650\nis implemented in will be valuable for\nyou and it's certainly a good time, or\n\n1526\n01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:54,250\na good place, for you to spend\na little bit of time, for you,\n\n1527\n01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:57,830\nas you learn to prepare and\nstudy for CISSP exam.\n\n1528\n01:12:57,830 --> 01:13:00,550\nTo go through this material,\nwanna get a little bit more functional,\n\n1529\n01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:02,705\na bit more comfortable with\nthe ideas of cryptography.\n\n1530\n01:13:02,705 --> 01:13:03,750\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> This is one of those areas to\n\n1531\n01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,210\nspend some time on.\n\n1532\n01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:08,520\nMost of the people that I deal with that\nare looking to become Become CISSPs.\n\n1533\n01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:13,120\nMost people that are CISSPs don't tend\nto spend a lot of time in cryptography.\n\n1534\n01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:15,530\nThey don't tend to spend a lot of time,\n\n1535\n01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:18,760\nspending their time every day\nworking with crypto systems.\n\n1536\n01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,770\nAnd so as a result, they may or may not be\ncomfortable with some of this material.\n\n1537\n01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:26,020\nYou watching now or\nwatching us perhaps not that live but\n\n1538\n01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,470\ncertainly at some point\nmay not prove to be\n\n1539\n01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,910\nas comfortable as some of this as\nyou are let's say with Networking.\n\n1540\n01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:35,233\nAnd some of the things there like\ndeal with site model or subnetting,\n\n1541\n01:13:35,233 --> 01:13:37,538\nIP addressing DHCP,\nDNS, whatever it maybe.\n\n1542\n01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:41,198\nAnd so as a result this tends to be\na place where a lot of people are a little\n\n1543\n01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:44,934\nbit gun shy getting ready for the exam,\nthey've heard horror stories.\n\n1544\n01:13:44,934 --> 01:13:48,914\nOh my God, I'm going to have to know how\nto encrypt things, I'm going to actually\n\n1545\n01:13:48,914 --> 01:13:52,940\nhave to decrypt something, have to\nunderstand everything there is to know.\n\n1546\n01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:54,930\nYeah, there is a lot of vocabulary,\nno doubt about it.\n\n1547\n01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:58,530\nWe spent our whole first episode in\nthis particular series going through and\n\n1548\n01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:00,480\njust throwing term after term at you, and\n\n1549\n01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,200\nmaking sure you were\ncomfortable with that.\n\n1550\n01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:06,430\nThere's a lot for you to be aware of, but\nwhat we want you to be thinking about\n\n1551\n01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:11,110\nIs the fact that, we really wanna make\nsure that you're focusing in on the key\n\n1552\n01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:15,245\nareas that are gonna have to be,\nas well as depth, a little bit of breadth.\n\n1553\n01:14:15,245 --> 01:14:16,160\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Brought to the table.\n\n1554\n01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,040\n>> Right.\n>> And then there's\n\n1555\n01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,910\nsome areas that are really just\ngonna be very surface, right?\n\n1556\n01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:21,230\nYou're just gonna have to know a simple\nvocabulary word from definition.\n\n1557\n01:14:21,230 --> 01:14:22,970\n>> Yeah.\nRight, know what an algorithm is,\n\n1558\n01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:25,310\nknow what a cryptosystem is,\nknow what a key is.\n\n1559\n01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:28,420\nBut, then taking that knowledge,\nand applying it into\n\n1560\n01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:32,000\na functioning cryptosystem to\nunderstand how an asymmetric and\n\n1561\n01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,430\nsymmetric solution are implemented\nis that next level down, right.\n\n1562\n01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:38,300\nAnd that's where we spend some time and\nreally build that next level of knowledge.\n\n1563\n01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:41,030\nSo I just wanna make sure we bring\nboth together, and really feel,\n\n1564\n01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:43,050\nhopefully, comfortable\nwith our definitions and\n\n1565\n01:14:43,050 --> 01:14:45,650\nour discussions to make\nsure we work through that.\n\n1566\n01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:49,910\nNow having said that with DES, we then\ntake a step up and say, well, we have DES,\n\n1567\n01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:54,150\nbut then remember if we multiply our\nbasic DES solution by three, in effect,\n\n1568\n01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:58,320\ntripling the strength of DES, we then\nget what is known as triple DES, right.\n\n1569\n01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:03,540\nSo triple DES would be 56 bits times 3,\nor 168 bits when we implement it.\n\n1570\n01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:08,300\nAnd then we have four modes that triple\nDES can actually be implemented through.\n\n1571\n01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,386\nAnd so we want to quickly\nwalk through those as well,\n\n1572\n01:15:10,386 --> 01:15:15,550\nWe'll see DES EEE or triple E, three E's.\n\n1573\n01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:21,190\nSo DES-E3, okay and so there's a method\nto reading this This by the way so\n\n1574\n01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:22,720\nlet's look at how to break this down.\n\n1575\n01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,520\nMike discovered as he was very\nquickly typing while I was\n\n1576\n01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:27,020\ntalking after getting the notes ready.\n\n1577\n01:15:27,020 --> 01:15:29,260\nAll right what is it and\nhe starts going, oh, wait a second,\n\n1578\n01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:30,580\nisn't that what the means.\n\n1579\n01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:37,010\nTriple E All right, so we have DES-EEE3,\nand what we mean here, in effect,\n\n1580\n01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:38,210\nis the following.\n\n1581\n01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:41,640\nThe three Es represent\nthe encryption runs,\n\n1582\n01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,470\nthe three different encryption\nruns that are used and\n\n1583\n01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:48,310\nthe number three at the end represents\nthe number of keys that are used.\n\n1584\n01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:52,620\nAnd, so in effect, what we see with\nDES-EEE3 is that we use three different\n\n1585\n01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:57,210\nkeys for three different encryption runs\nwhen we implement triple DES this way.\n\n1586\n01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:01,240\nAnd so we would have three separate keys,\neach key would be used once to do one\n\n1587\n01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:04,948\nencryption run of the data, and all three\nkeys need to be used to decrypt the data.\n\n1588\n01:16:04,948 --> 01:16:08,498\nThat's what DES-EEE3 means.\n\n1589\n01:16:08,498 --> 01:16:15,860\nDES-EDE3, E for encrypt, D for\ndecrypt, E for encrypt 3.\n\n1590\n01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:19,490\nThree different keys for encryption.\n\n1591\n01:16:19,490 --> 01:16:22,660\nData is encrypted, decrypted,\nand then encrypted again.\n\n1592\n01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:24,970\nSo we may stop here for\na second, and just ponder and\n\n1593\n01:16:24,970 --> 01:16:28,140\nsay okay you know that sounds interesting.\n\n1594\n01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:29,350\nI get the general idea.\n\n1595\n01:16:29,350 --> 01:16:32,330\nEncrypt three times, three separate keys,\nsounds pretty secure.\n\n1596\n01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:38,710\nWhy would we want to encrypt data, then\ndecrypt it, and then encrypt it again?\n\n1597\n01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:40,710\n>> Aren't I right back to\nmy original plain text?\n\n1598\n01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:42,750\nYou're really only doing\none round of encryption.\n\n1599\n01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:43,860\nYou would think.\nRight, yes.\n\n1600\n01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,290\n>> In effect.\nRight, you would think, you would think.\n\n1601\n01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:48,310\nAnd then you would perhaps Not\nbe too far off from correct.\n\n1602\n01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:49,260\n>> Right.\n>> If you thought that way,\n\n1603\n01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:50,125\nwith one exception.\n\n1604\n01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:51,210\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so, obviously,\n\n1605\n01:16:51,210 --> 01:16:54,375\nwe wouldn't just plan it this way, if\nthere wasn't some method to the madness.\n\n1606\n01:16:54,375 --> 01:16:54,890\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, so\n\n1607\n01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:57,310\nthere has to be more to it than just,\nencrypt the data, decrypt it.\n\n1608\n01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:58,541\n>> Right.\n>> Oh look, we have the same data.\n\n1609\n01:16:58,541 --> 01:16:59,842\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Well, it's encrypted again, right,\n\n1610\n01:16:59,842 --> 01:17:00,724\ncuz we had nothing better to do.\n\n1611\n01:17:00,724 --> 01:17:02,240\n>> Just wanted to check and\nmake sure it was still there.\n\n1612\n01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,510\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right, just wanted to check and\n\n1613\n01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:04,440\nmake sure it was really good.\n\n1614\n01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,320\nTurn off the light.\n\n1615\n01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,630\nYou ever do that when you were a kid?\n\n1616\n01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:09,040\nTurn off the light, look under the bed,\nturn back on the light, right?\n\n1617\n01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:09,620\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1618\n01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:10,555\nClose the refrigerator door.\n\n1619\n01:17:10,555 --> 01:17:11,820\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Open it to make sure, right?\n\n1620\n01:17:11,820 --> 01:17:13,260\nDoes it really go off?\n\n1621\n01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:14,260\n>> Crack it just a little bit.\n\n1622\n01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:14,940\n>> Yep.\nSo, no,\n\n1623\n01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:16,600\nwe're not doing that exactly, all right?\n\n1624\n01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:18,565\nWe are in the sense that, yes,\nwe're definitely decrypting the data.\n\n1625\n01:17:18,565 --> 01:17:19,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> But\n\n1626\n01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:21,670\nthe idea is that we're encrypting and\ndecrypting with different keys.\n\n1627\n01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:22,260\n>> Right.\n>> Right?\n\n1628\n01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:23,910\nAnd so\nwhen you think about the randomness here,\n\n1629\n01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:25,570\nin terms of what we're putting into this.\n\n1630\n01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:28,400\nSo the idea here is that\nsince we are decrypting, with\n\n1631\n01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,010\na different key that we are encrypting\n>> Effect the wrong key so\n\n1632\n01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:34,150\nwe're not getting our plain text back\n>> We're effectively creating more\n\n1633\n01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:38,540\nrandomness in the system if we think about\nit that way and so as a result, again if\n\n1634\n01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:41,980\nwe dont have all three keys in the proper\nsequence applied in the right order.\n\n1635\n01:17:41,980 --> 01:17:44,540\nWe're not gonna be able to ultimately get\nthe plain text as you pointed out back\n\n1636\n01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,450\nup and back in.\n\n1637\n01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:50,460\nSo it actually is a fairly robust and\nsecure solution in that respect.\n\n1638\n01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:55,330\nSo DES EDE3 we encrypt, decrypt and\nencrypt again using three separate keys.\n\n1639\n01:17:55,330 --> 01:18:02,500\nDES EEE2, three encryption runs but two\nkeys as opposed to three keys being used.\n\n1640\n01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:06,350\nWhich means, as we say there,\nthe first and the third encryption run\n\n1641\n01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:10,180\nare done with the same key, right,\ncuz we have two keys instead of three.\n\n1642\n01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:15,060\nSo wanna be aware of that and then\nDES-EDE2, effectively encrypt, decrypt,\n\n1643\n01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:19,970\nencrypt again, just like DES-EDE3,\nbut with two keys instead of three.\n\n1644\n01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:23,750\nSo again, the first and the third\nencryption runs are done with the same key\n\n1645\n01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:25,250\ndecryption is done with a different key.\n\n1646\n01:18:26,958 --> 01:18:30,930\nSo we wanna make sure we're comfortable\nwith this idea of our encrypt/decrypt,\n\n1647\n01:18:30,930 --> 01:18:32,770\nyou know different DES modes.\n\n1648\n01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:35,908\nMaking sure we understand that this is for\ntriple DES right?\n\n1649\n01:18:35,908 --> 01:18:39,380\nAs supposed to the discussion\nwe just had up above which were\n\n1650\n01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:43,010\nthe implementation modes or\nmethods for DES by itself.\n\n1651\n01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:45,510\nRight, so\nwe have five modes to implement for DES.\n\n1652\n01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:49,260\nAnd then for triple DES, we have four\ndifferent ways of implementing triple DES.\n\n1653\n01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:51,430\nSo a little bit of stuff\nwe got to master there.\n\n1654\n01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:55,070\nDES is obviously gonna be probably the one\narea where we have the most information\n\n1655\n01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:58,245\nregarding what we do in relation\nto our discussion here.\n\n1656\n01:18:58,245 --> 01:19:02,365\nIt's the most widely deployed of these\nalgorithms at least to date that has been.\n\n1657\n01:19:02,365 --> 01:19:05,865\nIt's obviously changing a yes really\nbecoming a lot more popular now but\n\n1658\n01:19:05,865 --> 01:19:07,295\ndec has been around and\n\n1659\n01:19:07,295 --> 01:19:10,730\nused for so many years that we've really\nyou know seen the development of all these\n\n1660\n01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:13,150\ndifferent mechanisms as part of\nthe overall plan of using it.\n\n1661\n01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:14,810\nSo we have to be comfortable with them and\n\n1662\n01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:16,752\nyou know just make sure\nwe understand them.\n\n1663\n01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,690\nAll right, so Mike's going to\nbe doing the tutorial for this.\n\n1664\n01:19:19,690 --> 01:19:23,352\nRight in the black light segment later\non as we said in our prior episode.\n\n1665\n01:19:23,352 --> 01:19:26,178\nHe's gonna be hosting\nthe after hours desk show.\n\n1666\n01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:30,310\nAnd he's gonna walk you through all of\nthat in real time while singing a tune.\n\n1667\n01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:35,660\nSo please come back and join us for\nthat because that will be exciting.\n\n1668\n01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:36,510\n>> The wall.\n[LAUGH]\n\n1669\n01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:37,220\n>> The DES wall.\n\n1670\n01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:41,250\nAll right let's continue on, we're talking\nabout AES, we talked about DES a lot.\n\n1671\n01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,082\nAES the Advanced Encryption Standard.\n\n1672\n01:19:43,082 --> 01:19:45,890\nWe wanna make sure we understand\nthe newer algorithm it's really taking\n\n1673\n01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:47,000\nthe place of DES.\n\n1674\n01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,210\nWhat is it versus what DES is?\n\n1675\n01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:51,450\nSo AES, symmetric block cypher.\n\n1676\n01:19:51,450 --> 01:19:56,510\nIt supports three different key bit\nsolutions as you can see there,\n\n1677\n01:19:56,510 --> 01:19:57,970\n128, 192 and 256 bit keys.\n\n1678\n01:19:57,970 --> 01:19:59,850\nDepending on how we\ninitialize the algorithm,\n\n1679\n01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:02,830\nhow we set up the system,\nwe can use different key strengths.\n\n1680\n01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:05,250\nSo you see here we've kinda\ndetailed that for you.\n\n1681\n01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:11,170\nIf both key and block are set at 128 bits,\nthen we'll do the XORing with ten rounds.\n\n1682\n01:20:11,170 --> 01:20:13,250\nSo we'll effectively\nuse the ten round XOR.\n\n1683\n01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:17,380\nIf both key and blocks are set\nto 192 bits in size, 12 rounds.\n\n1684\n01:20:17,380 --> 01:20:21,801\nAnd if both key and\nblock is set to 256 bits, then 14 rounds.\n\n1685\n01:20:21,801 --> 01:20:25,685\nSo wanna make sure that we're comfortable\nwith this idea of the key bit strength,\n\n1686\n01:20:25,685 --> 01:20:27,218\nthe block and the key strength.\n\n1687\n01:20:27,218 --> 01:20:31,299\nSo the block size as well as the key size,\nbeing the deterministic factor there for\n\n1688\n01:20:31,299 --> 01:20:33,901\nthe number of rounds that we\ndo to do the encryption or\n\n1689\n01:20:33,901 --> 01:20:35,532\ndecryption as we go backwards.\n\n1690\n01:20:35,532 --> 01:20:37,770\nSo wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n1691\n01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:39,450\nAll right, let's go continue on with IDEA.\n\n1692\n01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:43,780\nWe're just gonna kinda roll through some\nadditional algorithms here pretty quickly.\n\n1693\n01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:48,100\nTalking about block size, whether they're\nblock or stream, in this case, and\n\n1694\n01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:50,200\nthen obviously bit key size as well.\n\n1695\n01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,590\nSo IDEA is gonna be 64 bit as\na block cipher, 128 bit key.\n\n1696\n01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:58,740\nSo the block size is 64 bits,\nbut the key is 128 bit.\n\n1697\n01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:00,500\nBlowfish, IDEA, by the way, I'm sorry,\n\n1698\n01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:05,190\nInternational Data Encryption Algorithm in\ncase you wanna know what IDEA stands for.\n\n1699\n01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:07,820\nRemember, you don't have to know\nthe actual name of these things.\n\n1700\n01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:09,890\nWe're just telling you so you have\na sense of them if you're interested,\n\n1701\n01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:12,940\nbut you really don't have to memorize\nwhat the name of the algorithm is.\n\n1702\n01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:18,720\nBlowfish, Blowfish is going to be, as you\ncan see there, 64 bit block cipher and\n\n1703\n01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:24,060\nkey size randomized variable there from\n32 bit all the way up to 448 bits.\n\n1704\n01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:27,490\nAgain, it depends on implementation.\n\n1705\n01:21:27,490 --> 01:21:30,350\nRC4, RC4 is a stream cipher.\n\n1706\n01:21:30,350 --> 01:21:32,070\nIt has a variable key size.\n\n1707\n01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:37,060\nRC4 is actually used underlying\nthe SSL protocol, so we see it there.\n\n1708\n01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:39,801\nSo you are actually using\nit every day pretty much.\n\n1709\n01:21:39,801 --> 01:21:41,550\nRC5 is a block cipher.\n\n1710\n01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:46,610\nThe key size can go up to 2048 bits and\n\n1711\n01:21:46,610 --> 01:21:51,430\nwas created by Ron Rivest who's one of\nthe three principles from RSA, as in RSA,\n\n1712\n01:21:51,430 --> 01:21:53,030\nthe security company RSA.\n\n1713\n01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:54,690\nSo I wanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n1714\n01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:59,460\nRC6 is a block cipher that's built\non top of the RC5 architecture.\n\n1715\n01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:04,822\nIt was competitive with AES in the initial\nkind of random event that was used,\n\n1716\n01:22:04,822 --> 01:22:08,218\nthat's probably not a good\nway of putting that.\n\n1717\n01:22:08,218 --> 01:22:09,593\nThe contest-\n>> Contest, yeah.\n\n1718\n01:22:09,593 --> 01:22:10,801\n>> Is what I was thinking about,\nnot random event.\n\n1719\n01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:15,636\nThe contest that was sponsored by\nthe NSA to ultimately come up with a new\n\n1720\n01:22:15,636 --> 01:22:20,885\nalgorithm that would be ultimately\nused to replace D-E-S and replace DES.\n\n1721\n01:22:20,885 --> 01:22:27,926\nAnd so AES was chosen and RC6 did not\nmake the final, final, final cut.\n\n1722\n01:22:27,926 --> 01:22:30,905\nBut was architected and submitted\nas basically one of the competitive\n\n1723\n01:22:30,905 --> 01:22:33,135\nalgorithms that may have\nbeen in the running there.\n\n1724\n01:22:33,135 --> 01:22:35,011\n>> Yeah, I think Blowfish was too,\nwasn't it?\n\n1725\n01:22:35,011 --> 01:22:36,821\n>> Yeah, but\nultimately it didn't it make it.\n\n1726\n01:22:36,821 --> 01:22:39,169\nYeah, they decided that they didn't\nwant the Dr. Seuss algorithm.\n\n1727\n01:22:39,169 --> 01:22:40,052\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right, so\n\n1728\n01:22:40,052 --> 01:22:42,801\ninstead they wanted to go with something\nthat sounded a little bit better.\n\n1729\n01:22:42,801 --> 01:22:44,426\nThey were afraid the Russians\nmight make fun of them.\n\n1730\n01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:45,635\n>> They might get laughed at, yeah.\n\n1731\n01:22:45,635 --> 01:22:50,296\n>> Chinese will be laughing,\n[LAUGH] look at that, right, Blowfish.\n\n1732\n01:22:50,296 --> 01:22:51,728\nSo couldn't take it seriously.\n\n1733\n01:22:51,728 --> 01:22:54,331\nCame up with a bad, had a bad\nmarketing group that represented it,\n\n1734\n01:22:54,331 --> 01:22:56,718\ndidn't really have a really good\nway of coming up with that.\n\n1735\n01:22:56,718 --> 01:22:57,800\n>> They needed better PR people.\n\n1736\n01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:58,719\n>> Yeah, exactly, right.\n\n1737\n01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:02,650\nSo, the old thing where we\ndo classes on this stuff.\n\n1738\n01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:05,330\nWe talk about Blowfish and we talk\nabout Blowfish, one fish, two fish,\n\n1739\n01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:08,822\nred fish, blue fish, the old Dr.\nSeuss solution there.\n\n1740\n01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:11,072\nBut Blowfish is actually\na very good algorithm,\n\n1741\n01:23:11,072 --> 01:23:12,760\nimplemented in a lot of systems, but\n\n1742\n01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,690\njust not chosen, unfortunately, as part\nof the overall thought process there.\n\n1743\n01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:18,280\nSo you just wanna be aware of that.\n\n1744\n01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:18,810\nAll right, very good.\n\n1745\n01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:21,130\nSo we've gone through all\nthe different algorithms and\n\n1746\n01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:25,680\nmade sure that we have kind of\ndiscussed all the stuff there that,\n\n1747\n01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,288\nthere's that preview again, right,\njust rearing it's ugly head.\n\n1748\n01:23:29,288 --> 01:23:30,828\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we've gone through and\n\n1749\n01:23:30,828 --> 01:23:34,160\nnow discussed [LAUGH] how all of\nthis stuff is gonna be implemented,\n\n1750\n01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,070\nto make sure that we understand it.\n\n1751\n01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:38,340\nWhat we wanna do, and\nmaybe just take a moment and\n\n1752\n01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:41,210\nkinda gather ourselves up here and\njust get a little perspective,\n\n1753\n01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:43,910\njust step back up a little\nbit higher in our discussion.\n\n1754\n01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:47,830\nSo what we've been doing is laying out for\nyou a whole bunch of algorithms,\n\n1755\n01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:51,266\nboth in the asymmetric, and\nin this case symmetric and\n\n1756\n01:23:51,266 --> 01:23:54,230\nasymmetric algorithms, block and stream,\ndepending on how they're implemented.\n\n1757\n01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:57,426\nAnd we've gone through and talked about\nhow they're implemented, but also really\n\n1758\n01:23:57,426 --> 01:24:00,093\nwant to make sure you understand\nthe bit strength associated with it.\n\n1759\n01:24:00,093 --> 01:24:03,490\nIf it's a block, the block size,\nhow that's associated.\n\n1760\n01:24:03,490 --> 01:24:07,363\nWanna make sure we understand that concept\nbecause that, or these concepts rather,\n\n1761\n01:24:07,363 --> 01:24:10,170\nknowledge concepts,\nbecause this is very important.\n\n1762\n01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:13,910\nWanna make sure we understand the ways in\nwhich these algorithms are structured and\n\n1763\n01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:14,960\nwhat they do.\n\n1764\n01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:18,800\nSo that way as we look at them, we work\nwith them, we understand that obviously\n\n1765\n01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:22,620\nthe larger the bit size,\nthe stronger the key, in effect.\n\n1766\n01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:23,790\nThe larger the bit size,\n\n1767\n01:24:23,790 --> 01:24:27,370\nthe more likely it is that that encryption\nwill not only stay in place longer and\n\n1768\n01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:31,290\nnot be cracked, but it's a lot less\nlikely that we will have key collisions.\n\n1769\n01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:34,490\nSo keys will effectively repeat in\nthe key space because the key space\n\n1770\n01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:35,640\nwill be a lot bigger.\n\n1771\n01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:39,196\nSo these are all things we have to\nconsider when we're building algorithms,\n\n1772\n01:24:39,196 --> 01:24:41,735\nand ultimately then building\ncryptosystems on them.\n\n1773\n01:24:41,735 --> 01:24:45,955\nAs we look to build secure systems,\ndefense in-depth, and really build out\n\n1774\n01:24:45,955 --> 01:24:49,747\nthese solutions, this is the kind of thing\nthat we really have to take into account.\n\n1775\n01:24:49,747 --> 01:24:52,593\nCan we go and search quickly for\ngraphic on XORing?\n\n1776\n01:24:52,593 --> 01:24:56,051\nWanna just quickly just do\na quick discussion on that, or\n\n1777\n01:24:56,051 --> 01:24:58,417\nat least show you this idea of XORing.\n\n1778\n01:24:58,417 --> 01:25:03,736\nWe mentioned a couple of times in\nthe SSCP class that we have done,\n\n1779\n01:25:03,736 --> 01:25:07,135\nwe have put together a discussion there.\n\n1780\n01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:09,401\nAnd we never wanna take anything for\ngranted,\n\n1781\n01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:13,433\nnever want to assume that you're going\nto be comfortable with the concept.\n\n1782\n01:25:13,433 --> 01:25:17,523\nSo we wanna make sure that we are going\nto be able to quickly just put\n\n1783\n01:25:17,523 --> 01:25:21,023\ntogether something for\nyou that will make sense.\n\n1784\n01:25:21,023 --> 01:25:24,660\nSo while Mike is searching, we're just\ngonna quickly take a look there or\n\n1785\n01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,440\nat least try to find a graphic.\n\n1786\n01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:30,770\nI'm going to just quickly give you\na high level of what this may be.\n\n1787\n01:25:30,770 --> 01:25:32,850\nSo the concept of XORing, as we mentioned,\n\n1788\n01:25:32,850 --> 01:25:35,652\nis this idea of basically going\nthrough and doing a quick comparison.\n\n1789\n01:25:35,652 --> 01:25:37,343\nNo, that's perfect, do the one all\nthe way on the right, right there.\n\n1790\n01:25:37,343 --> 01:25:38,900\nYeah, perfect, do that one,\nlet's just do that one.\n\n1791\n01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:41,920\nRight, it's very simple cuz it's\ngonna say same is gonna equal this,\n\n1792\n01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,720\nnot same is gonna equal different, right?\n\n1793\n01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:45,210\nAll right, so, general idea.\n\n1794\n01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:49,091\nAssume x, y is just two things\nthat we're comparing, two values,\n\n1795\n01:25:49,091 --> 01:25:50,868\na 1 or a 0, as we line up data.\n\n1796\n01:25:50,868 --> 01:25:51,590\n>> Two bits.\n\n1797\n01:25:51,590 --> 01:25:53,066\n>> Yeah, so can we do,\ncan you write on that or\n\n1798\n01:25:53,066 --> 01:25:54,341\ndo we have to zoom in a different way?\n\n1799\n01:25:54,341 --> 01:25:55,218\n>> We can zoom in, just a second.\n\n1800\n01:25:55,218 --> 01:25:58,301\n>> So we're just gonna zoom out,\nzoom back in so Mike can actually write.\n\n1801\n01:25:58,301 --> 01:26:02,093\nSo at the bottom there,\njust of to the side somewhere, if you can.\n\n1802\n01:26:02,093 --> 01:26:06,233\nLet's just put down at\nthe bottom below the graphic,\n\n1803\n01:26:06,233 --> 01:26:11,028\nmaybe in the middle of the screen,\nlet's just put 1100.\n\n1804\n01:26:11,028 --> 01:26:11,832\n1100.\n\n1805\n01:26:11,832 --> 01:26:16,926\nThen go down, hit Enter and\ngo below, and do 0101.\n\n1806\n01:26:16,926 --> 01:26:18,510\nOkay, we're gonna compare these two.\n\n1807\n01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:22,158\nIn fact, we think of these as two\nstreams of bits that we wanna compare.\n\n1808\n01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:26,181\nAnd so as a result of that, what we're\ngonna is we're gonna effectively compare,\n\n1809\n01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:28,490\nand we're gonna then XOR and\nsee what happens.\n\n1810\n01:26:28,490 --> 01:26:30,400\nWe're gonna draw a little line\nthere in effect, perfect.\n\n1811\n01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,301\nAnd so\nthe idea with XORing is the following.\n\n1812\n01:26:32,301 --> 01:26:38,010\nWhen we compare bits up and\ndown like this, 1 0, 1 1, 0 0, 0 1.\n\n1813\n01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:43,156\nIf we have two bits that are going to\nbe the same, either two 0s or two 1s,\n\n1814\n01:26:43,156 --> 01:26:48,930\nthen we're gonna put a value of 0\nunderneath as our comparison rendered bit.\n\n1815\n01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:53,591\nIf we have different values, 1 0, or\n0 1, we're gonna put instead of a 0 to\n\n1816\n01:26:53,591 --> 01:26:57,980\nrepresent sameness, we're gonna\nput a 1 to represent difference.\n\n1817\n01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:02,510\nSo 1 and 0 XORed together, as we can see,\ndifferent bits, we put a 1.\n\n1818\n01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:05,096\nWhen we have two bits the same,\n1 and 1, we're gonna put a 0.\n\n1819\n01:27:05,096 --> 01:27:07,910\nWhen we have two bits the same,\n0 0, we're gonna put a 0.\n\n1820\n01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:10,676\nAnd when we have two bits different,\n0 1, we're gonna put a 1.\n\n1821\n01:27:10,676 --> 01:27:15,550\nSo when we compare 1100,\n0101, we XOR them.\n\n1822\n01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:18,426\nThe output of the XORing is 1001.\n\n1823\n01:27:18,426 --> 01:27:19,343\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1824\n01:27:19,343 --> 01:27:22,823\n>> And so what this would represent for\nus is effectively then,\n\n1825\n01:27:22,823 --> 01:27:27,191\nthe ability to do the comparison on\nthe bits, and then take that XOR value and\n\n1826\n01:27:27,191 --> 01:27:29,940\nhave that become input for something else.\n\n1827\n01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:33,880\nAnd if we then run this backwards or run\nthis forwards a number of times, we would\n\n1828\n01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:38,301\ndo this again so that XORed value would\nthen be combined with our now new input.\n\n1829\n01:27:38,301 --> 01:27:39,060\n>> Next new input.\n\n1830\n01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:41,988\n>> Our next key, our next\ninitialization vector, whatever it is.\n\n1831\n01:27:41,988 --> 01:27:45,190\nAnd we're gonna take that,\ndo that comparison, and\n\n1832\n01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:48,260\nthen go through and\nroll through whatever that is.\n\n1833\n01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:49,426\n>> Whatever it may be.\n>> And as a result will come out right.\n\n1834\n01:27:49,426 --> 01:27:52,051\nYeah, whatever is is, we'll come out\nwith another value, roll that through.\n\n1835\n01:27:52,051 --> 01:27:53,164\n>> Oops.\n>> And so this is done.\n\n1836\n01:27:53,164 --> 01:27:54,147\nYeah-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1837\n01:27:54,147 --> 01:27:55,540\n>> We're inventing a new cryptosystem.\n\n1838\n01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:58,160\nLook we're now doing\nthree as opposed to two.\n\n1839\n01:27:58,160 --> 01:27:58,906\n>> It's a new binary.\n\n1840\n01:27:58,906 --> 01:28:02,253\n[LAUGH]\n>> Binary 2.0, right?\n\n1841\n01:28:02,253 --> 01:28:05,310\nAnd so, what we would see,\nis we do this comparison right,\n\n1842\n01:28:05,310 --> 01:28:06,790\n0 1 or 1 0 is gonna be a 1.\n\n1843\n01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:09,880\nRight, that's gonna be a 1,\nthat's gonna be a 1, that's gonna be a 1.\n\n1844\n01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,690\nSo, by adding in that\nrandomness we now have all 1s.\n\n1845\n01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:15,640\nWe would effectively take that,\nthat would go up to the next one.\n\n1846\n01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:16,710\nRight, and that kind of thing.\n\n1847\n01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:19,285\nDrawing's getting much smoother\non those arrows there.\n\n1848\n01:28:19,285 --> 01:28:21,590\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> A lot smoother, right.\n\n1849\n01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:24,920\nNot the horror story we had there earlier,\n\n1850\n01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,240\nwhere we were going\nthrough all those arrows.\n\n1851\n01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:27,910\n>> That was Adobe Whiteboard, you know.\n\n1852\n01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:28,550\nDifferent product.\n\n1853\n01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:29,500\nThat's what it was.\n\n1854\n01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,100\nThat's what I'm gonna blame it on anyway.\n\n1855\n01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:32,770\n>> Our displaced hip stick figure person.\n\n1856\n01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:33,810\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> All right, so,\n\n1857\n01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:36,650\nthe idea with XORing then, just to make\nsure you're comfortable with this, cuz,\n\n1858\n01:28:36,650 --> 01:28:37,680\nagain, we wanna lay this out.\n\n1859\n01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,230\nWe wanna talk about it.\n\n1860\n01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:40,610\nMake sure that you've seen it.\n\n1861\n01:28:40,610 --> 01:28:42,700\nBut also make sure you have\na working knowledge of it visually.\n\n1862\n01:28:42,700 --> 01:28:44,418\nI often find that when\nI look at something,\n\n1863\n01:28:44,418 --> 01:28:47,114\nI tend to absorb it in a different\nway than when I just hear about it.\n\n1864\n01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:49,230\n>> Yeah, visual learners,\ntactile learners, audible learners.\n\n1865\n01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:51,156\n>> Absolutely.\n>> We're gonna cover everybody out there.\n\n1866\n01:28:51,156 --> 01:28:54,111\n>> This is gonna be the interactive\nscratch and sniff and\n\n1867\n01:28:54,111 --> 01:28:55,628\nsmell portion of IT Pro TV.\n\n1868\n01:28:55,628 --> 01:28:58,947\nSo, if you're a tactile learner, this is\nthe point at which you wanna reach out,\n\n1869\n01:28:58,947 --> 01:29:00,410\noh, you see, we took it down.\n\n1870\n01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:04,334\nWanna reach out and touch the screen and\nactually trace over,\n\n1871\n01:29:04,334 --> 01:29:09,330\nright, the area there, and you can feel\nthe XORing happening in real time.\n\n1872\n01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:11,580\n>> I think it's Adult Swim now\nthat has one of their bumps,\n\n1873\n01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:15,940\none of their commercials, where they have\na hand drawn out something like that,\n\n1874\n01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:18,520\non either side, and they want you to\ncome up and give the TV a big hug.\n\n1875\n01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,340\n>> Awesome.\n\n1876\n01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:22,050\n>> That's for the tactile people.\n\n1877\n01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:23,851\n>> All right, so\nwe have this idea with XORing, so\n\n1878\n01:29:23,851 --> 01:29:26,070\nyou want to make sure you're\ncomfortable with this idea.\n\n1879\n01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:28,210\nYou've heard us refer to it,\na few times in this episode,\n\n1880\n01:29:28,210 --> 01:29:29,930\njust as we talk through what things are.\n\n1881\n01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:32,620\nWanted to give you that graphical\nrepresentation though really quickly.\n\n1882\n01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:34,050\nMake sure you understand\nthe pattern there.\n\n1883\n01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:37,540\nAnd so to be clear just to summarize,\nbefore we get off the graphic there.\n\n1884\n01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:41,323\nThe pattern is, that if we have sameness,\ntwo bits that are zero, two bits that\n\n1885\n01:29:41,323 --> 01:29:44,837\nare one, we're gonna represent that\nwith a zero in the comparison line.\n\n1886\n01:29:44,837 --> 01:29:47,930\nIf we have difference, two bits\nthat are different, either one and\n\n1887\n01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:51,360\nzero in either way, we're gonna represent\nthat with a one as we do the XOR.\n\n1888\n01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:54,590\nSo wanna make sure you're comfortable with\nthis, wanna make sure you got a chance\n\n1889\n01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:57,550\nto see this and see how we take\nthe output of one and XOR through and\n\n1890\n01:29:57,550 --> 01:29:59,690\nadd that as the input into the next round.\n\n1891\n01:29:59,690 --> 01:30:02,540\nAnd we can do that for multiple rounds,\ndepending on the algorithm and\n\n1892\n01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:03,970\nhow it's implemented.\n\n1893\n01:30:03,970 --> 01:30:04,760\nAll right, very good.\n\n1894\n01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:07,350\nSo we've gone ahead and\nI think laid out a really good,\n\n1895\n01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:10,265\nsolid foundation with the last\ndiscussion we just had.\n\n1896\n01:30:10,265 --> 01:30:10,810\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1897\n01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:11,880\n>> I think it's probably time for\n\n1898\n01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:15,210\nus to say goodbye to the nice\npeople out there for the moment.\n\n1899\n01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:17,360\n>> It is.\nTime to say goodbye to my computer too,\n\n1900\n01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:18,450\nif I can get my screen back up here.\n\n1901\n01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:19,430\n>> Oh, did we just lose that?\n\n1902\n01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:20,350\nOkay.\n>> Yeah, we lost it, but\n\n1903\n01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:21,170\nthat's okay, we don't need it anymore.\n\n1904\n01:30:21,170 --> 01:30:22,300\nWe're done with that, so.\n\n1905\n01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:23,720\n>> And\nwhat operating system do you run in there?\n\n1906\n01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,180\n>> Yeah, that's Windows 8.1, of course.\n\n1907\n01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:25,750\n>> Okay, all right.\n\n1908\n01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,455\n>> I need my new update,\nthat's what it is.\n\n1909\n01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:28,210\n>> 8.1.1, right?\n>> I need to get 1.1\n\n1910\n01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:28,970\n>> I told you about that.\n\n1911\n01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:29,830\n>> Yeah, you did, you did.\n\n1912\n01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:31,810\n>> Very good.\n>> I just got through reading your blog,\n\n1913\n01:30:31,810 --> 01:30:32,630\nas a matter of fact.\n\n1914\n01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:34,010\n>> You did?\nOkay, all right, cool.\n\n1915\n01:30:34,010 --> 01:30:35,040\nWas it helpful?\n\n1916\n01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:35,630\n>> I'm ready to go.\n\n1917\n01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:37,270\nAll those new features, I know exactly-\n>> You know\n\n1918\n01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:38,900\nwhat I'm gonna do is put\na download link in there.\n\n1919\n01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:39,650\nI should probably do that.\n\n1920\n01:30:39,650 --> 01:30:40,176\nRight?\n\n1921\n01:30:40,176 --> 01:30:41,910\n>> [LAUGH] All right,\nladies and gentlemen, well,\n\n1922\n01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:43,610\nI hope everybody

--> 00:00:38,790\nTo another episode of ITProtv.\n\n4\n00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,960\nI'm your host,\nDon Pezet back again with Mr. Adam Gordan.\n\n5\n00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,710\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n6\n00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,330\n>> Good.\nHowdy, everybody.\n\n7\n00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,990\n>> So yesterday we broke the seal.\n\n8\n00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,860\nWe started on cryptography which is,\nif not the largest,\n\n9\n00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,660\none of the largest sections of the exam.\n\n10\n00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,620\nOr just the example content,\nso much content.\n\n11\n00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,645\nAnd what we're gonna do today is\nwe're gonna pick back up with part 2,\n\n12\n00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:04,160\nright the cryptography strikes back and\nthen continue on.\n\n13\n00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,995\nWe'll more than likely have a part\nthree just because it is so much stuff.\n\n14\n00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:11,290\nBut we left off with some of the really\ncool stuff we went into yesterday,\n\n15\n00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,870\nthe basics of cryptography,\nsome of the really key things.\n\n16\n00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,710\nToday we're gonna pick up with, I think\nwe're jumping into hashes aren't we?\n\n17\n00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,850\nWell, asymmetric algorithms.\n\n18\n00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,500\n>> Asymmetric.\n\n19\n00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,680\nHashing will be in there somewhere.\n\n20\n00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,600\nAbsolutely.\n\n21\n00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,515\n>> Right, somewhere.\n\n22\n00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:23,080\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, very good.\n\n23\n00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,890\nWe spoke at some length in our\nprior episodes around cryptography,\n\n24\n00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,930\naround the symmetric side,\nall the symmetric algorithms.\n\n25\n00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,350\nSingle key, we sometimes refer to\nthem as private key algorithms.\n\n26\n00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,790\nWe talked about the use\nof symmetric algorithms.\n\n27\n00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:40,660\nWe also spoke a little bit about\nthe asymmetric algorithms and\n\n28\n00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,910\nhybrids in the sense of just putting\nthose together overviewed that.\n\n29\n00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,030\nBut now we're gonna go a little deeper,\n\n30\n00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,420\ndrill into the asymmetric algorithms to\nbetter understand what's going on there.\n\n31\n00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,620\nSo we're going to talk a little\nbit [COUGH] excuse me,\n\n32\n00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,570\nat a high level before we get into\nour list of asymmetric algorithms.\n\n33\n00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,930\nLet's just remind everybody what\nasymmetric algorithms really are for.\n\n34\n00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,770\nSymmetric key or single key algorithms\nare used primarily very fast.\n\n35\n00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,710\nSo they're used for bulk encryption.\n\n36\n00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,480\nWe use the private key of\nthe sender to encrypt the data.\n\n37\n00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,510\nAnd then the recipient has to have a copy\nof that key which proves to be a challenge\n\n38\n00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,700\nsometimes in certain systems, because\nif we can't securely transmit the key,\n\n39\n00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,510\nthere's really no way for the recipient\nto understand how to receive the data and\n\n40\n00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,070\nthen open it up and ultimately read it.\n\n41\n00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,750\nSo in other words,\nit stays encrypted, right?\n\n42\n00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,005\nReally no way to interact with\nthe data which is good in one respect.\n\n43\n00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:31,305\nBut the problem is, if you need the data\nit doesn't really work very well.\n\n44\n00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:34,495\nSo things like long term storage for\nyour archiving data\n\n45\n00:02:34,495 --> 00:02:38,715\ncan be done with symmetric keys because\nwe can safely and securely keep the key.\n\n46\n00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:41,775\nBut the problem then still becomes we have\nto have the key active in the system.\n\n47\n00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:43,045\nLater I'm gonna go back and\n\n48\n00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:46,615\nretrieve the data in order to be\nable to hopefully unencrypt it.\n\n49\n00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:50,970\nSo symmetric key systems by themselves,\nwhile they're very quick, can prove\n\n50\n00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,900\nto unfortunately provide some challenges\nto us in terms of key management and\n\n51\n00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,790\nkey dispersal.\n\n52\n00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,720\nRight?\nGetting the keys out there securely.\n\n53\n00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,700\nSo we talked about pairing\nthem with asymmetric systems.\n\n54\n00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,270\nAsymmetric systems are public/private key\npairs where we effectively keep one key\n\n55\n00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,290\nsecret, make one key available\ntypically through a directory service.\n\n56\n00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,660\nOr some sort of web-based service,\n\n57\n00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,030\nwhere you can download the key\nthrough some sort of a cloud.\n\n58\n00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,300\nAnd when you go out and get the key,\nyou're then able to use that key\n\n59\n00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,600\nin partnership with the key that is kept\nsecure, to be able to identify the data,\n\n60\n00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,830\nprovide non-repediation, provide\nintegrity, provide proof of origin.\n\n61\n00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,550\nProvide confidentiality depending on the\nways in which we combine these functions,\n\n62\n00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,590\nand what kind of key we start with,\nwhich one is ultimately made available for\n\n63\n00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,320\nthe encrypt or decrypt functionality,\nor the signing, or the hashing, or\n\n64\n00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,950\nwhatever it is we look to do.\n\n65\n00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,330\nSo as an example, if Don and\nI were to exchange some information.\n\n66\n00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:45,200\nIn a symmetric system, Don and\n\n67\n00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,720\nI would both have to have\nknowledge of the private key.\n\n68\n00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,710\nBut in an asymmetric system, if I wanted\nto send Don some information securely,\n\n69\n00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,470\nwhat I would do is I would send it with\nDon's public key used as the encryption\n\n70\n00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,130\nmechanism, and if I encrypt with Don's\npublic key, available typically, again,\n\n71\n00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,774\nfrom a key server or\na directory service somewhere out there.\n\n72\n00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:09,480\nThen what I would do is by encrypting\nwith Don's public key, Don should be,\n\n73\n00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,440\nif the system is set up the right way,\nthe only user that knows how to decrypt\n\n74\n00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,520\nthat data, because Don is the only person\nwho has access to his private key, right?\n\n75\n00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,610\nThe Don key as we often call\nit when we are talking.\n\n76\n00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,332\nRight?\nSo if Don is the only one who has\n\n77\n00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:26,985\naccess to the private key, then Don\nshould be the only recipient in theory,\n\n78\n00:04:26,985 --> 00:04:30,756\neverything is relative of course because\nthere's always this opportunity,\n\n79\n00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:33,805\npotentially to break the crypto system,\nsomehow get the key.\n\n80\n00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:37,465\nThere's always this opportunity,\npotentially that exists,\n\n81\n00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:40,645\nthis risk or this threat that\nsomebody could manipulate the system.\n\n82\n00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:42,475\nBut assuming it's set up the right way,\n\n83\n00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:44,697\nassuming there's no what we\ncall malfunction malfeasance.\n\n84\n00:04:44,697 --> 00:04:48,367\nRight, no monkey business to use\nthe official technical term that we use.\n\n85\n00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:51,647\nSo if nobody's up to no good, then Don\nshould be the only one that can unencrypt\n\n86\n00:04:51,647 --> 00:04:54,007\nthat data in this particular exchange.\n\n87\n00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:58,177\nHowever, if I wanted to provide\ninstead of confidentiality,\n\n88\n00:04:58,177 --> 00:04:59,417\nwhich is what we just discussed.\n\n89\n00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:02,860\nIf I wanted to provide proof of origin,\nnon-repudiation.\n\n90\n00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,050\nVerify for Don that really I was\nthe one who sent this data and\n\n91\n00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,730\nit wasn't somebody else like a bad\nactor who's trying to impersonate me.\n\n92\n00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,150\nThen what I would try and do instead\nis instead of using Don's public key to\n\n93\n00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,732\nencrypt because then don would be able to\ndecrypt the data, that wouldn't really\n\n94\n00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:24,100\nwouldn't make a lot of sense for\nnon-repudiation or for proof of origin.\n\n95\n00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,040\nWhat I would do is I want to\ndigitally sign the data instead.\n\n96\n00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,480\nAnd so what I would do is if\nI digitally sign the data,\n\n97\n00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,740\nI can digitally sign it with a key\nthat only is known to one person.\n\n98\n00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,000\nAnd then can be publicly proofed\nin effect with a copy or\n\n99\n00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,160\na representation of that key\nthat is publicly available.\n\n100\n00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,950\nA different key, but\nthe public key in the pair.\n\n101\n00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,230\nAnd so, if I digitally sign with\nmy private key, then in fact,\n\n102\n00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,090\nthe only person that\nvalidate that signature,\n\n103\n00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,600\nthat knows it was mine Is the person who\nactually uses the private key to sign.\n\n104\n00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,240\nThe public key that's available\nout there as a key pair\n\n105\n00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,650\ncan be used to cross reference the key and\neffectively show\n\n106\n00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,890\nthat the private key was used to sign\nwithout exposing the private key.\n\n107\n00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,860\nAnd so by making the public key available,\n\n108\n00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,700\nwe effectively give everybody else out\nthere the opportunity to validate the fact\n\n109\n00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,990\nthat I'm the one who signed it\neffectively proving that it must be me.\n\n110\n00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,100\nAgain, we put off to the side for\n\n111\n00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,250\nnow the business cases where somebody may\nhave manipulated the system, somehow got\n\n112\n00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,040\nin the key, impersonates me by sitting\ndown at the keyboard, gets my username and\n\n113\n00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,980\npassword, logs in, steals my smart card,\ngets my certificate whatever that is.\n\n114\n00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,641\nWe'll talk about those things at the end\nof our discussions of cryptography.\n\n115\n00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:40,290\nWe talk about known attacks and\nhow those are executed.\n\n116\n00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,650\nRight?\nWe'll have a whole discussion about that.\n\n117\n00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,020\nBut for now, let's just assume,\nthat's the way the system works.\n\n118\n00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,536\nAs long as the system is secure,\n\n119\n00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:49,930\nthen this is what will typically\nbe behavior we expect.\n\n120\n00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,438\nAnd so laying out the concept,\n\n121\n00:06:51,438 --> 00:06:55,700\nthe over-arching functional idea of\nthe architecture of asymmetric systems.\n\n122\n00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,290\nIs an important starting point, because\nnow we can throw out some algorithms and\n\n123\n00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,720\ngo through our bulleted list of notes\naround the things that go into making\n\n124\n00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,900\nthese systems work the way they do.\n\n125\n00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,730\nBecause now you have a better\nunderstanding, just of the architecture,\n\n126\n00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,415\njust the high level functionality.\n\n127\n00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:13,650\nSo I know, Don, you primarily,\nhad done the majority of the work,\n\n128\n00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,005\nall I did was talk while you\nwere scribing in effect.\n\n129\n00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:19,245\nSo, I know we put together a bunch of\nnotes and we wanna start sharing those.\n\n130\n00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:20,280\nSo, on the screen,\n\n131\n00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,270\nyou'll be able to see the asymmetric\nalgorithms that are listed out here.\n\n132\n00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,800\nWe have several of them.\n\n133\n00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,030\nDiffy Hellman, pretty popular one,\nwe tend to hear about it a lot.\n\n134\n00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,560\nIt is used as you can see here for key\ndistribution, key exchange in other words.\n\n135\n00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,500\nAnd the idea here is that the two systems\nthat are, gonna use this, the sender and\n\n136\n00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,010\nreceiver in effect, right?\n\n137\n00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,640\nCan generate a symmetric key,\n\n138\n00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,700\nsingle private key, securely without\nrequiring a previous relationship.\n\n139\n00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,974\nIt's one of the things that if\nyou [INAUDIBLE] allows us to do.\n\n140\n00:07:46,974 --> 00:07:51,324\nThe algorithm is based on, as you could\nsee there, the difficulty of calculating\n\n141\n00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:54,614\nwhat's known as discreet\nlogarithms within a finite field.\n\n142\n00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:58,754\nAnd so we're able to securely\nexchange public and private keys.\n\n143\n00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:02,277\nMainly private keys, obviously back and\nforth, but key pairs,\n\n144\n00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:06,531\nIf you think about it, using an asymmetric\nalgorithm like Diffie-Hellman.\n\n145\n00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:10,622\nNow, Diffie-Hellman is, potentially,\ngoing to have a security flaw in it,\n\n146\n00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:13,429\nor based on the way it's implemented,\nhave an issue,\n\n147\n00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:18,210\nwhich is that it's susceptible, it's\nvulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n148\n00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:21,990\nBecause of the fact we have to send\nthe key out, and somebody can impersonate\n\n149\n00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,390\nthe sender or the receiver to potentially\nintercept the key and use it.\n\n150\n00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,640\nIn and of itself, Diffie-Hellman\nwhen it's implemented by itself,\n\n151\n00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,890\nin its traditional form, is vulnerable.\n\n152\n00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,470\nAnd we just want to\nmake you aware of that.\n\n153\n00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,150\nWe didn't make a note on that, it's just\nmore some additional information for you.\n\n154\n00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,980\nHowever, most systems when\nthey implement Diffie-Hellman\n\n155\n00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,870\nare implementing it with additional\nprotocols or additional security measures,\n\n156\n00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,590\nthat effectively offset this\nman-in-the-middle issue.\n\n157\n00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:50,060\nAnd so usually when you see it\nused in production systems,\n\n158\n00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,918\nwhen you are maybe managing\nyourself if you are using it.\n\n159\n00:08:52,918 --> 00:08:56,090\nYou're not gonna see a system that is\nset up where the man-in-the-middle\n\n160\n00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:57,010\nissue is usually a problem.\n\n161\n00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,250\nYou are going to see it implemented\npaired with other security\n\n162\n00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,280\nto prevent man-in-the-middle\nattacks from taking place.\n\n163\n00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,840\nSo, it is considered to be\nrelatively secure, just so you know.\n\n164\n00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,220\nWe also have RSA.\n\n165\n00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,540\nRSA is an algorithm,\nis a very important one.\n\n166\n00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,210\nIt is the name of the company as well\nas the name of the algorithm, and\n\n167\n00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,430\nthe company that created RSA was\nactually created by three gentlemen.\n\n168\n00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,600\nYou see their names on the screen there.\n\n169\n00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,370\nThree mathematicians that actually did\nall the background work, and came up with\n\n170\n00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:27,040\nthe mathematics of the algorithms that\nnow make up the RSA security family.\n\n171\n00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,602\nRon Rivest, Adi Shamir,\n\n172\n00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:32,910\nand Leonard Adleman are the names\nof the principals behind RSA.\n\n173\n00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,600\nBelieve it or not,\nprobably just important for\n\n174\n00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,680\nyou to be aware of some\nof these pretty seminal,\n\n175\n00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,930\npretty important people in the history\nof security in areas like this.\n\n176\n00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,760\nSo we put their names up there for you.\n\n177\n00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,335\nSo you know them.\n\n178\n00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:44,070\nDiffie-Hellman, for\n\n179\n00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:48,190\ninstance, the last names of\nthe gentleman who came up with that.\n\n180\n00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,760\nThings like, what was the other\none that we talked about?\n\n181\n00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,560\nGraham Nash.\n\n182\n00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,350\nOne of the other models.\n\n183\n00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:56,280\nFor instance, the Chinese Wall model and\nsome of the other ones\n\n184\n00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,560\nare named after the mathematicians or\npeople that came up with them.\n\n185\n00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,727\nSo, RSA is the initials, if you will,\n\n186\n00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,970\nof the last name of each\nof the gentlemen behind it.\n\n187\n00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,530\nSecurity of RSA algorithms,\n\n188\n00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,240\nwe've talked about this in\nsome of our earlier episodes,\n\n189\n00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,400\ncome from the difficulty of factoring\nlarge numbers into their original primes.\n\n190\n00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,730\nAnd so you just wanna make sure\nyou understand this again.\n\n191\n00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,850\nI think I made the reference several\ntimes, probably about large numbers,\n\n192\n00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:19,920\nnot like one in three.\n\n193\n00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,330\nBut these are many, many zeros in terms of\nplaceholders there to get these numbers,\n\n194\n00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,240\ntied to some very, very large numbers.\n\n195\n00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,730\nNumbers that to us, as human beings, would\nreally just have no sense of space or\n\n196\n00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,570\ntime or concept.\n\n197\n00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,200\nCuz, we can't wrap our mind around\na number that big, but computers can.\n\n198\n00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,003\nAnd so obviously computers are used\nto hack away at these numbers and\n\n199\n00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:40,229\nultimately factor them into\ntheir original primes.\n\n200\n00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:44,648\nThe process of doing that is kind of\nthe secret sauce, the underlying magic\n\n201\n00:10:44,648 --> 00:10:48,730\nthat takes place within the RSA\nalgorithm and that's what's used.\n\n202\n00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,790\nThe primes that are used are secret,\nso no one knows what they are,\n\n203\n00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,900\nwhich is why RSA is considered to\nbe relatively secure algorithm.\n\n204\n00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,560\nAt least it has been up until now.\n\n205\n00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,690\nOf course with the march of technology and\n\n206\n00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,760\ntime at some point we'll probably\nuncover the inner workings of that.\n\n207\n00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,204\nOr if you work for the NSA you might\nvery well understand RSA already works,\n\n208\n00:11:06,204 --> 00:11:06,758\nI suppose.\n\n209\n00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:08,337\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So one-way functions.\n\n210\n00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:11,460\nOne-way functions are mathematical\nfunctions as you can see there.\n\n211\n00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:15,110\nTraditionally considered to be easier\nto compute in one direction than\n\n212\n00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,520\nthe opposite direction.\n\n213\n00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,320\nAll we really mean is that we make these\nthings work in such a way that we can use\n\n214\n00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,730\nthem to typically hash, for instance.\n\n215\n00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,580\nAnd so we use them to create hashes.\n\n216\n00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,590\nSo you can run the hash in one direction.\n\n217\n00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:31,460\nYou don't worry about reversing\nthe hash in effect or unencrypting, or\n\n218\n00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,660\nwhatever it is we may be doing\nwith a one way function,\n\n219\n00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,870\nbecause it's really designed\njust to work one way, one time.\n\n220\n00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:42,820\nSo the idea is to use the one-way function\nto hash the data, not to use it backwards\n\n221\n00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,870\nor reverse it to unhash the data cuz\nthere's no value in un-\\hashing the data.\n\n222\n00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,732\nThe value is in using the hash to\nrepresent the data to do a comparison to\n\n223\n00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:55,053\nunderstand whether the data has been\nmodified or whether we actually have true\n\n224\n00:11:55,053 --> 00:11:59,654\ndata, the data that we initially decided\nto send because of the idea of integrity.\n\n225\n00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:02,275\nRight, it's really focused on integrity,\nthe manipulation and\n\n226\n00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:05,570\nchanging of data is what we focus on\nwith one-way functions typically.\n\n227\n00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,930\nWe use this concept of what is known\nas trap door, which is this kind of opt\n\n228\n00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:14,750\nout option that the one way function can\nbe run in reverse if we have the key.\n\n229\n00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,820\nSo we could unencrypt the data that\nwas encrypted with a one-way function.\n\n230\n00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,980\nWe could unhash it in effect,\nif you think of it,\n\n231\n00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,480\nor whatever you wanna do with\nit with a one-way function.\n\n232\n00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,280\nBut the concept of a trapdoor is simply\nthis ability to insert a key into\n\n233\n00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,510\nthe system, and as a result\neffectively run the system in reverse.\n\n234\n00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,167\nIt's an escape hatch, right, that allows\nus to effectively create a two-way,\n\n235\n00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:37,160\nwhere in fact there was just\na one-way function before.\n\n236\n00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,070\nSo just know the concept of\nwhat a trap door represents.\n\n237\n00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,070\nEl Gamal is the name of a public key\nalgorithm as you can see here, used for\n\n238\n00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,740\ndigital signatures,\nencryptions, and key exchange.\n\n239\n00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:52,180\nThe El Gamal algorithm has been around for\nsome time.\n\n240\n00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,770\nOne of the first publicly available\nalgorithms that did these things.\n\n241\n00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,370\nSo it is a famous one in that respect.\n\n242\n00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,410\nIt's still used in many systems today and\nsince it has a broad appeal,\n\n243\n00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,850\ndigital signatures for\nproof of origin, non-repudiation,\n\n244\n00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:12,260\nencryption for cryptography, meaning we\ncan do confidentiality and key exchange.\n\n245\n00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:16,716\nIt is pretty robust in that,\nas a result in that respect.\n\n246\n00:13:16,716 --> 00:13:20,540\nIt is gonna be very flexible so we can see\nit used in a lot of different scenarios.\n\n247\n00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,620\nElliptic curve cryptosystems,\nwhat we know as ECC systems.\n\n248\n00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,660\nThey're similar to RSA, so\nthey work very similarly to RSA, but\n\n249\n00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,720\nthey actually are going to be a little bit\nfaster, and ultimately more efficient.\n\n250\n00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,220\nBecause they require smaller key sizes\n\n251\n00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,210\nto effectively get to\nthe same place that RSA does.\n\n252\n00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:43,480\nSo the systems can be smaller, more\nefficient, quicker, just as powerful, but\n\n253\n00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,610\nthey are going to effectively be like\na competitive solution with RSA.\n\n254\n00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,970\nNot as well known, you don't tend to see\nthem and hear about them as often, but\n\n255\n00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,920\nwe actually use them all the time.\n\n256\n00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,190\nYou just don't realize this.\n\n257\n00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,990\nBut they're used in cell phones for\ninstance.\n\n258\n00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,348\nThe cell phone technology that does\na lot of the encryption of signals and\n\n259\n00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:03,643\nthings of that nature is built on ECC.\n\n260\n00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,475\nBecause the systems are much smaller,\nfootprints much lighter,\n\n261\n00:14:06,475 --> 00:14:09,622\nthey're much quicker so they can be\ndone in mobile scenarios typically.\n\n262\n00:14:09,622 --> 00:14:13,630\nSo you actually are using them probably\non a regular basis without realizing it.\n\n263\n00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,825\nBut they also provide digital signatures,\nsecure key distribution and encryption.\n\n264\n00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:21,615\nSo, you can see they mirror\nthe functionality of El Gamal as well, for\n\n265\n00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:24,776\ninstance, where they can do\nbasically all those things.\n\n266\n00:14:24,776 --> 00:14:29,374\nAnd so there's several different ways to\nimplement ECC, but at the end of the day\n\n267\n00:14:29,374 --> 00:14:33,330\nwe basically graph out an elliptic\ncurve on grid, so on an xy-axis.\n\n268\n00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,320\nAnd then we will plot points\non that grid and then,\n\n269\n00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,620\nbased on the plotting of points in\na random order, we will then start\n\n270\n00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,850\nencrypting based on values that\nare drawn from those data points.\n\n271\n00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,760\nAnd we run through that in a sequence\nof patterns to be able to understand\n\n272\n00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,660\nultimately how to do that,\n\n273\n00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,796\nor in this case reverse it depending\non what we're looking to do.\n\n274\n00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:54,305\nZero Knowledge Proof, zero knowledge\nproof is simply this idea of need to\n\n275\n00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:57,340\nknow where we give you\na zero knowledge proof.\n\n276\n00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,510\nWe're basically telling you what\nyou need to know but nothing more.\n\n277\n00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:04,220\nYour little piece of the puzzle\nto solve that particular issue\n\n278\n00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,300\nis being provided to you.\n\n279\n00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,600\nBut we don't provide\nyou the entire picture.\n\n280\n00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,923\nRight, this is often seen in high secure\nsystems where you're given just a piece of\n\n281\n00:15:11,923 --> 00:15:14,530\nthe puzzle,\nyou're not shown the entire thing.\n\n282\n00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:17,410\nSo, typically compartmentalized\nworkstations fall under this\n\n283\n00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,780\ncategory as well.\n\n284\n00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,840\nWhere they show you only\nthe information you need to work on.\n\n285\n00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,840\nYou may think of a constrained\nview in a database or\n\n286\n00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,320\nsomething like that also as\npotentially need to know.\n\n287\n00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,770\nYou only see certain things.\n\n288\n00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,010\nThe menu doesn't show you others.\n\n289\n00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,700\nAll of these are examples\nof zero knowledge proofs or\n\n290\n00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,748\nneed to know solutions.\n\n291\n00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:35,327\nOne-way hashes.\n\n292\n00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:40,028\nOne-way hashes, as we talked about one-way\nfunctions generically, easy to in one way,\n\n293\n00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:43,400\nreally almost impossible to reverse\nunless we use the trap door.\n\n294\n00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:48,039\nSo the idea of a hash, and we talked about\nthis in the SSCP class, for instance.\n\n295\n00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:51,372\nSo in those episodes and\nin that content you can always go back and\n\n296\n00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:53,359\nlook at a conversation there as well.\n\n297\n00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:56,499\nBut here, just remind you of what it is.\n\n298\n00:15:56,499 --> 00:16:00,434\nThe idea of a hash,\nis basically taking any amount of text,\n\n299\n00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:04,839\nso we could do something like,\nthe dog is blue, or the moon is red,\n\n300\n00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,275\nor, War and Peace,\nthe entire written book, for instance.\n\n301\n00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:10,220\nDoesn't really matter.\n\n302\n00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,605\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just finished reading that not too\n\n303\n00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:12,565\nlong ago, by the way.\n\n304\n00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:13,955\n>> Oh, really?\n>> I read it on my, for real, and\n\n305\n00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:16,375\nI read it again because I, you know,\nI have read it a long time ago, but\n\n306\n00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,950\nI read it on my Windows\n8 tablet of all things.\n\n307\n00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:19,830\nRight?\n\n308\n00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,410\nMy girls do soccer practice, so\nwhen I go to soccer, sitting there,\n\n309\n00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,030\nbeing the good soccer dad that I am,\nI don't necessarily have a lot to do while\n\n310\n00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,170\nthey're kicking the ball around, so\nI figure I might want something.\n\n311\n00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,200\nIt's a long season, so\nI actually read War and Peace.\n\n312\n00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,980\n>> That must have been\nsome long soccer games.\n\n313\n00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,640\n>> They were some long soccer games.\n\n314\n00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,960\nBut I read it, and\nI read it on a tablet of all things,\n\n315\n00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,480\nwhich was a new experience for me.\n\n316\n00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,940\nBecause I'm just not used to,\nI use tablets and computers as you do, for\n\n317\n00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,510\na lot of things, but I don't tend\nto think of it as book reading.\n\n318\n00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,628\nYou know we had that conversation.\n\n319\n00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:50,630\nThat old fashioned,\nI want a piece of paper,\n\n320\n00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,995\nI want to hold it in my\nhand kind of person.\n\n321\n00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:52,520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n322\n00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,240\nit was kind of a interesting experience,\nbut yeah,\n\n323\n00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,640\nyeah just finished reading\nit not to long ago.\n\n324\n00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,540\nI didn't hash it however,\nbut I did read it.\n\n325\n00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,550\nSo had I hashed it would have been a very,\nvery quick experience by comparison.\n\n326\n00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:05,520\nSo the idea here is that the hash\ntakes variable length text,\n\n327\n00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,509\nliterally could be a single bit of text.\n\n328\n00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:10,803\nCould be every text that's ever been\nwritten, in all of human history,\n\n329\n00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:13,920\nall put together in just a stream,\nit wouldn't really matter.\n\n330\n00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,600\nWe take that,\nwe mix it with the hashing algorithm,\n\n331\n00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,140\nwhatever the hashing algorithm\nis that we're going to use,\n\n332\n00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,190\nwe have some examples down below\nher,e we'll talk through in a minute.\n\n333\n00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:26,430\nCould be the md series, md 5,\ncould be a sha series, sha 1,\n\n334\n00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,490\nsha 512, sha 256, doesn't really matter.\n\n335\n00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,990\nWe get fixed bit output back\nout at the backend as a hash.\n\n336\n00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,640\nThe hash is a representation,\nalpha-numeric,\n\n337\n00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,240\nof the data that was put\ninto the hashing algorithm.\n\n338\n00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,870\nSo in other words,\nwe're not trying to hide the data.\n\n339\n00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,440\nThere's no confidentiality here.\n\n340\n00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,770\nThere's only integrity.\n\n341\n00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:51,750\nWe're validating that the data is going to\nbe in a certain form, of a certain length,\n\n342\n00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,670\nin a certain format, right?\n\n343\n00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,940\nThe dog is blue.\n\n344\n00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,850\nThat format, that way,\nwith those letters in that order,\n\n345\n00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:04,700\nis what we're validating with a hash, as\na freeze-frame, a snapshot moment in time.\n\n346\n00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,060\nIf the data were to change,\ninstead of the dog is blue,\n\n347\n00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,290\nwe then modify the data either in\ntransit or while it's at rest.\n\n348\n00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:17,600\nAnd then we go back and look at it later,\nand the dog is green is, let's just say,\n\n349\n00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,340\nnow what appears there.\n\n350\n00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,260\nIf we run the hash again, if we run the\nhashing algorithm, the output of the hash\n\n351\n00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,490\nwill still be the same number of bits, but\nthe sequence of those bits will change.\n\n352\n00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,800\nAnd as a result we have what's called,\na trip wire system in effect Right?\n\n353\n00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,910\nIt tells us, and I think I have trip\nwire solution there in the notes.\n\n354\n00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,350\nWe have then a, effectively\nan alert that says, screams at us,\n\n355\n00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,080\nthat we're paying attention.\n\n356\n00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,600\nHey listen,\nthe data's modified in some way.\n\n357\n00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,600\nAny change causes results in\nthe hash to be different.\n\n358\n00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,850\nSo the idea with integrity, is we're\nproviding the guarantee that the data will\n\n359\n00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,660\nremain in the current state it is,\nwhen we seek the initial hash.\n\n360\n00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,880\nSo there are some common algorithms,\nwe have MD5.\n\n361\n00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,420\nThere are several MD algorithms out there,\nMD2, MD4, MD5.\n\n362\n00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,770\nThe entire series of the message\ndigest hashing algorithm, so\n\n363\n00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:07,430\nthat's what md stands for,\nwill output at 128 bits.\n\n364\n00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,570\nSo regardless of which one you use,\nyou get 128 bit output.\n\n365\n00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:16,660\nAnd then the sha series secure hashing\nalgorithm, that's what sha stands for.\n\n366\n00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,790\nHas a number designation at\nthe back end of it, the sha one for\n\n367\n00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,220\ninstance it will put out,\nit's really sha 160.\n\n368\n00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,590\nBut it will put out at 160 bit.\n\n369\n00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,000\nSha 512 puts out at 512 bits.\n\n370\n00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,650\nSha 256 puts out at 256 bits,\nyou know, that kind of thing.\n\n371\n00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,610\nSo when you see the number\ndesignation with it,\n\n372\n00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:41,405\nyou are Seeing the actual number of the\nbits, that the hashing algorithm produces.\n\n373\n00:19:41,405 --> 00:19:44,345\nGood for you, good for everybody in\ngeneral, because if you know that,\n\n374\n00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:46,755\nyou understand the amount of bits\nyou'll get off the back end.\n\n375\n00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:50,665\nShould you ever have to answer questions\nabout something like that, you at least\n\n376\n00:19:50,665 --> 00:19:54,435\nhave a general indicator, a general\nidea perhaps of how to figure that out.\n\n377\n00:19:54,435 --> 00:19:57,305\nSo I know we did a couple of quick\nexamples, something near and\n\n378\n00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:58,245\ndear to my heart.\n\n379\n00:19:58,245 --> 00:20:01,150\n[LAUGH]\n>> We took Starbucks, and\n\n380\n00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,850\nwe went ahead and\n\n381\n00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,410\nran the plaintext of the word Starbucks\nthrough several hashing algorithms.\n\n382\n00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,030\nMike used a, Mike, I'm sorry.\n\n383\n00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,060\nI keep saying Mike.\n\n384\n00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,810\nDon used, I did that yesterday\nas well on point, didn't I?\n\n385\n00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,480\n>> Mike 2.0, remember.\n\n386\n00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,582\nI didn't- [CROSSTALK]\n>> Mike 2.0.\n\n387\n00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:15,480\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So Don went ahead, and\n\n388\n00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,200\nused a little hashing tool\nto produce the outputs.\n\n389\n00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,385\nAnd we see that MD5 puts out\nwhatever that string is there.\n\n390\n00:20:22,385 --> 00:20:27,680\nSHA-1, at 160 bits, and SHA-512,\nthe larger stream down below.\n\n391\n00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,650\nAnd then we went ahead and went back and\n\n392\n00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:34,700\ndid Starbuicks, as a offset,\nto change the idea of Starbucks.\n\n393\n00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,210\nYou just change the format of the text.\n\n394\n00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,230\nWe added the i in other words.\n\n395\n00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,930\nAnd you'll notice the MD5 hash,\nwhen we compare the two, has changed.\n\n396\n00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,050\nAnd as a result, we can see that\nthe data has been modified, right?\n\n397\n00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,480\n>> And it's not just a little change,\nright?\n\n398\n00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,970\nThe entire hash changed.\n\n399\n00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:53,580\nI don't think there's any common letters,\nor number between the two.\n\n400\n00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,200\n>> Not in sequence, anyway, right.\n\n401\n00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,330\nI mean, there may certainly\nbe other ones that are there,\n\n402\n00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,240\nlike we do have Cs in both, right?\n\n403\n00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,960\nBut, yeah, right yeah, but\nit's just, its out of sequence,\n\n404\n00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,560\nyou're not gonna find them lined up,\nmore often than not,\n\n405\n00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,520\nyou're certainly not gonna find\nthem lined up the same way.\n\n406\n00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,880\nSo yeah the entire hash does change.\n\n407\n00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,970\nJust want to show you that,\nrepresent that for you,\n\n408\n00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,800\nmake you visually aware of this, and this\nis the idea behind hashing, so that way,\n\n409\n00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,970\nwe know we have integrity in our data.\n\n410\n00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,410\nVery useful when we talk about chain\nof custody of evidence with data for\n\n411\n00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,281\ninstance, managing data,\nmaking sure it isn't modified,\n\n412\n00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:28,740\nwhen we take it away from crime scene,\nbefore we'd bring it into the courtroom.\n\n413\n00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,630\nAnd ultimately may have to testify as\nto its authenticity and it's integrity.\n\n414\n00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,760\nThe court will accept, for instance,\na hash value on the data that's taken\n\n415\n00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,950\nat moment of intake, when you\neffectively create the data as evidence.\n\n416\n00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,470\nAnd then we'll often want a hash\ncomparison done the day of testimony,\n\n417\n00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,140\nthe day before, whatever it is.\n\n418\n00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,390\nMay randomly ask for\none to validate the chain of custody.\n\n419\n00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:55,480\nAs long as that hash stays consistent,\nthe court can then assure itself of\n\n420\n00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,970\nthe fact that the integrity of the data\nhas not in any way been compromised.\n\n421\n00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,480\nWhether the data is exculpatory or not,\n\n422\n00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,490\nwhether it allows you to effectively\nprove for the defense, or prove for\n\n423\n00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,940\nthe prosecution if something\nhappened is irrelevant.\n\n424\n00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,590\nWe're not worried about what\nthe value of the data is,\n\n425\n00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:12,830\nwe're simply worried about the integrity\nof the data in this case right.\n\n426\n00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,170\nWe don't get to pass judgement on that,\n\n427\n00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,080\nwe simply get to understand\nhow to provide integrity.\n\n428\n00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,430\nSo that's what we're talking about.\n\n429\n00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,160\nWe talked about hashing, and then we also\nhave some message authentication codes,\n\n430\n00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,790\nwhat are called max,\nthat we also make some comparisons of.\n\n431\n00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,800\nTalk a bit about, and\n\n432\n00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,630\nI think we have a little chart\nthat we put together here, right?\n\n433\n00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,230\nIt kind of runs down the whole thing.\n\n434\n00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,800\nSo, let's go through, and,\nwe'll just talk about\n\n435\n00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,100\nthe different types of,\n>> Okay.\n\n436\n00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,990\n>> The max, and\nwe'll talk about hash in relation with us.\n\n437\n00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,100\n>> Do you wanna use my,\nmy notes here or the chart?\n\n438\n00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,320\nThe actual.\n\n439\n00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,530\n>> No, no, no, no.\n\n440\n00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,680\nWe'll just use this.\n\n441\n00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,910\nI just meant that you had put this\ninto the notes for us, right?\n\n442\n00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,340\n>> Yep.\n>> You had done all the work to actually\n\n443\n00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,390\nput all this together.\n\n444\n00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,820\nSo the message authentication codes,\nright?\n\n445\n00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,730\nThe idea of a MAC, a MAC as you can see\nthere, authentication scheme, right?\n\n446\n00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,100\nWhere using the secret key,\napplying it to a message in some form,\n\n447\n00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,510\ndoesn't necessarily mean\nwe're encrypting the message.\n\n448\n00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,820\nWe're just applying the key to be able\nto then somehow authenticate it, right?\n\n449\n00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,480\nSo, this is what we're really doing.\n\n450\n00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,140\nSo, with three types, the hash is\nthere just as a point of reference.\n\n451\n00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,690\nSo, remember hashes provide integrity.\n\n452\n00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,430\nThe steps of the hash, you may want to\nkind of come up just a little bit, so\n\n453\n00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,220\nwe can see that.\n\n454\n00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,880\nThere we go.\n\n455\n00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,290\nSo the hash is just to kind of remind you,\nalready did this, but basically you know,\n\n456\n00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:26,550\nwe use the algorithm, provide the hash,\nthe plain text is sent through.\n\n457\n00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,550\nWe then send the hash, along with\nthe plain text, to the recipient.\n\n458\n00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,240\nThe recipient can run\nthe hash on their side.\n\n459\n00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,830\nWithout it, the plain text has\neffectively not modified in any way,\n\n460\n00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,300\nwhile the data is on the wire.\n\n461\n00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,106\nAnd assuming that the hash is comparing or\nequal, we know there is integrities, but\n\n462\n00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:44,640\nno malfeasance,\nthat has not been modified in any way.\n\n463\n00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,964\nWith an HMAC, where we're talking about\na hash message authentication code,\n\n464\n00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:54,820\nyou'll see here we provide both\nintegrity and origin authentication.\n\n465\n00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:59,341\nSo the steps involved here will be that\nthe center uses the hashing algorithm on\n\n466\n00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:02,710\nplain text and a secret key\nthat's used to generate a Mac.\n\n467\n00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:04,340\nPlain text and\n\n468\n00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:08,580\nMac are then sent to the receiver,\nthe receiver uses the same algorithm.\n\n469\n00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,720\nSo the key here, very important to point\nout with any of these that the receiver\n\n470\n00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,570\nhas to know the algorithm that was used.\n\n471\n00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,380\nWe don't keep the algorithm secret.\n\n472\n00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,150\nWe use MD5 they have to know\nthe hash was created with MD5 in\n\n473\n00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,590\norder to be able produce the same\nresults on the other side,\n\n474\n00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,340\notherwise we get a totally random and\ndifferent output.\n\n475\n00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,860\nSo the receiver uses the same\nalgorithm on plain text and\n\n476\n00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,425\ntheir own symmetric key they\nthey generate a new MAC.\n\n477\n00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:32,155\nSo the private key is used on either side.\n\n478\n00:24:32,155 --> 00:24:35,465\nReceiver than compares the two MACs\nto verify that they are identical.\n\n479\n00:24:35,465 --> 00:24:40,271\nSo basically the idea here is that we're\ngoing to combine a secret key along\n\n480\n00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:45,015\nwith a hash to be able to effectively\ncreate some form of authentication.\n\n481\n00:24:45,015 --> 00:24:45,655\n>> Right.\n\n482\n00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:46,620\n>> So that's what we have here.\n\n483\n00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:50,380\nCBC-MAC Next one down.\n\n484\n00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,310\nAnd we actually combine\nthese two CBC-MAC and CMAC.\n\n485\n00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:58,450\nSo, CBC-MAC Cipher Block Chaining\nMessage Authentication Code.\n\n486\n00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,794\nThat's a mouthful, CBC-MAC.\n\n487\n00:24:59,794 --> 00:25:03,520\nAnd then Cipher-Based Message\nAuthentication Code, CMAC.\n\n488\n00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,260\nCMAC works identically to CBCMAC.\n\n489\n00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,190\nBasically the only\ndifference there is that as\n\n490\n00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,310\nyou could see there it's\na little bit more complex.\n\n491\n00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,930\nThe algorithm use is a little bit more\ninvolved, a little bit more complex.\n\n492\n00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:17,195\nBut basically effectively the steps we\noutline are gonna be the same for both.\n\n493\n00:25:17,195 --> 00:25:19,125\nSo, just swap out the algorithm for\n\n494\n00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:22,035\na more complex one effectively,\nwe get the same thing.\n\n495\n00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:26,475\nSo we provide integrity and\norigin authentication.\n\n496\n00:25:26,475 --> 00:25:29,277\nThat's what all the MAC solutions do.\n\n497\n00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,247\nSo In that respect is the same as HMAC.\n\n498\n00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:34,077\nThe sender uses a symmetric\nblock algorithm\n\n499\n00:25:34,077 --> 00:25:35,547\nto be able to generator ciphertext.\n\n500\n00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:40,007\nThe last block is the MAC,\nthe [COUGH] MAC in other words would\n\n501\n00:25:40,007 --> 00:25:42,237\nbe generated as the last block,\nthe last output.\n\n502\n00:25:42,237 --> 00:25:45,160\nAnd then the message authentication\nis basically that block.\n\n503\n00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,580\nPlain text and\nMAC then sent over the receiver,\n\n504\n00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,770\nthe receiver uses the same\nsymmetric algorithm.\n\n505\n00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,730\nAgain we have to know the algorithm\non the plain text to effect,\n\n506\n00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,310\nwe generate cypher text.\n\n507\n00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,070\nThey compare that final block.\n\n508\n00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,805\nThe final block is the message\nauthentication code the MAC.\n\n509\n00:25:58,805 --> 00:26:02,380\nAnd if they are identical, effectively,\nwe know we have the same solution again,\n\n510\n00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,560\nthe data has not been modified in any way.\n\n511\n00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,990\nThis is almost like putting some sort\nof a tag, somewhere in the message\n\n512\n00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,200\nhiding in an effect so we know it's\nthere but it's just not obvious.\n\n513\n00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,570\nAnd then we look for the tag when we\nget the package on the other side.\n\n514\n00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,840\nOpen box 3 halfway down,\nthere's a piece of paper,\n\n515\n00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,320\nif the paper hasn't been disturbed or\nsomething like that.\n\n516\n00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320\nYeah, we know that that's\nbasically the shipment is good.\n\n517\n00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,030\nAnd so you see this stuff in\nyou know like spy movies and\n\n518\n00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,800\nall sorts of things where you know maybe\nthey tape the hair across the door and so\n\n519\n00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,410\nif somebody opens the door\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n520\n00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,540\n>> The piece of hair breaks and\n\n521\n00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,292\nthen you know, James Bond knows somebody\nwas in his room or something like that.\n\n522\n00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:41,770\nSee those representations in movies and\n\n523\n00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,500\nTV series that come from these kinds\nof things, when you think about it.\n\n524\n00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,650\nI mean at the end of the day,\n\n525\n00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:50,530\nsomebody putting that piece of hair\nacross the door frame is this idea of\n\n526\n00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,930\ncreating a tripwire solution\nvalidating the integrity of the room.\n\n527\n00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,130\nNobody's been in there.\n\n528\n00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,440\nWe do that by using a system that\nallows us to immediately tell\n\n529\n00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,350\nif somebody has come in or\nnot, that kinda thing.\n\n530\n00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:05,220\nSo you have these kinds of solutions,\nactually have very,\n\n531\n00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:11,120\nvery important implications in the way we\nbuild our systems because they provide for\n\n532\n00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,020\nus the ability to validate our data.\n\n533\n00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,380\nUltimately, and it's sure that it\nhasn't been modified in any way.\n\n534\n00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,180\nIt's very, very important.\n\n535\n00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,000\nSo I wanna talk also, quickly,\n\n536\n00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,970\nabout some attacks that can occur\nagainst these one-way hash functions.\n\n537\n00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,760\nBecause we've laid out the actual\nsolutions, but we wanna make sure we\n\n538\n00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,880\nunderstand the concept of how we\ncan then take these systems down.\n\n539\n00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,450\nBecause just like everything else, this\nis the yin and yang of security, right?\n\n540\n00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:37,510\nWe always have systems, but then we\nhave to worry about how we attack them.\n\n541\n00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,170\nThis is also the same concept that we see\n\n542\n00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,600\nreplicating itself\nthroughout anywhere we go.\n\n543\n00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,530\nIf you think about the idea that the same\npeople typically build the radar detectors\n\n544\n00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,431\nare the ones that build the radar guns.\n\n545\n00:27:48,431 --> 00:27:48,994\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n546\n00:27:48,994 --> 00:27:51,570\nso a good little racket to get in there,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n547\n00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:54,900\nBut the idea is that for every system we\nbuild there is always going to be a way to\n\n548\n00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,710\ntake that system apart if we\njust work hard enough at it.\n\n549\n00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,620\nThe question is, is the value at the end\nof the day we extract from breaking\n\n550\n00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:03,010\nthe system worth the time and\neffort that we put in?\n\n551\n00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:05,580\nBecause that's really kind\nof the quick algebra or\n\n552\n00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,350\nthe calculus that we have to do.\n\n553\n00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,460\nSo when we attack one-way hash functions\nwe are basically using attacks\n\n554\n00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,500\nas you can see there, they're\ndesigned to force collisions, right?\n\n555\n00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,470\nThat happen when two different\nmessages as you can see there\n\n556\n00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,770\nproduce the same hash value.\n\n557\n00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:23,368\nSo if I send the dog is green and\nthe dog is blue into a system.\n\n558\n00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,940\nAnd I affect we get the same\nhash value out the backend\n\n559\n00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,220\nI've created what is called a collision.\n\n560\n00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,640\nThis idea of sameness occurring and\n\n561\n00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,840\nmessages effectively popping up on our\nradar that are gonna be decrypted or\n\n562\n00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,410\nperhaps have the same hash values and\nwe start to discern patterns there\n\n563\n00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,250\nbased on the fact that normally\nthere should be no pattern.\n\n564\n00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:47,530\nWell structured, well architected\ncryptosystems should not produce sameness.\n\n565\n00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,045\nCollision should not happen we should say.\n\n566\n00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:53,880\nSo one way we can figure out\nif there are collisions and\n\n567\n00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,660\ntry to form this idea of attack of vectors\nthat we can use to bring a system down\n\n568\n00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:02,540\nis through, it's actually a mathematical\nparadox, it's mathematical problem,\n\n569\n00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,535\nvery famous called the birthday attack.\n\n570\n00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:08,170\nAnd so the birthday attack basically boils\ndown to two questions and we use these\n\n571\n00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:12,120\nquestions then to figure out how to go\nin and try to attack a cryptic system.\n\n572\n00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:15,650\nThe first question there,\nis if you were in a room, so you and\n\n573\n00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,385\na whole bunch of other people,\nhow many people must be in that room for\n\n574\n00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:22,385\nthe chances to be greater than even,\nmeaning greater than 50%,\n\n575\n00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:26,625\nthat another person in that room\nhas the identical birthday as you?\n\n576\n00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:30,805\nSo, if Don was in a room with\na whole bunch of other people,\n\n577\n00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:35,205\nincluding Mike,\nhow many people would have to be there for\n\n578\n00:29:35,205 --> 00:29:39,045\nsomebody to have the identical\nbirthday as Don?\n\n579\n00:29:39,045 --> 00:29:43,160\nSo, in other words Don,\nwe picked Don out as the individual.\n\n580\n00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:47,020\nSay, Don, we want you to find the same\nmatch, find your birthday in one other\n\n581\n00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:52,440\nperson in this room, we'd have to put 253\npeople in that room, including Don, right?\n\n582\n00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,810\nTo be able to find that match.\n\n583\n00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:57,010\nThat person that's the same\nexact birthday as Don.\n\n584\n00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:59,775\n>> Or at least to increase\nour odds to more than even.\n\n585\n00:29:59,775 --> 00:30:02,350\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Right, to more than 50%.\n\n586\n00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:02,950\nWe would need 253.\n\n587\n00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:07,410\nAnd so the idea is that, when we specify\na unique message or a unique value,\n\n588\n00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:12,520\nand wanna find its match,\nwe need a very large pool to have a better\n\n589\n00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,320\nthan 50% chance to be able to do that,\nas the first part of the birthday attack.\n\n590\n00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,820\nSo then, the second question we posed in\nthe birthday attack is the following.\n\n591\n00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,720\nHow many people must be in that same room,\nright, for the chance to be\n\n592\n00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,050\ngreater than even that any random\ntwo people will share a birthday?\n\n593\n00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:31,860\nSo not say who has the match to Don,\nbut rather everybody in the room,\n\n594\n00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,860\nlet's just kind of all pair\nup who has the same birthday.\n\n595\n00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:40,670\nAnd random two two be better than 50%,\nonly 23, we reduce that by\n\n596\n00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:45,796\nbasically a factor of almost 90,\nif we think about a scale of one to 100.\n\n597\n00:30:45,796 --> 00:30:51,020\nWe are basically nine times more likely\nin other words, on a scale of one to ten,\n\n598\n00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:55,620\nto get a better than 50-50 hit if we\nrandomly sample the message pool,\n\n599\n00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,050\nif we try to find messages that are the\nsame and will produce the same hash or\n\n600\n00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,420\ndecrypt with the same key.\n\n601\n00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,730\nAnd this is what the birthday\nattack shows us.\n\n602\n00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:07,190\nIs that if the pool is\nlarge to begin with and\n\n603\n00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:12,600\nwe randomly sample often enough in\nthat pool, we will most likely find,\n\n604\n00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,960\nright, [COUGH] very,\nvery difficult [COUGH] excuse me.\n\n605\n00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,480\nWe will often find that it's very\ndifficult, to be able to pull those\n\n606\n00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,920\nmatches out very quickly, cuz the pools\nvery large, but if the pool is smaller,\n\n607\n00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,950\nwith a small number of messages,\nand we randomly sample.\n\n608\n00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:32,230\nIt's very likely, very quickly, that we're\ngonna find a match, because the smaller\n\n609\n00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:35,700\nthe pool, the more likely it is,\nthat number goes up above 50%.\n\n610\n00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,459\nSo we have to manipulate\nthe birthday attacks shows us,\n\n611\n00:31:38,459 --> 00:31:41,229\nnot just the actual kinds of\nthings we're looking for.\n\n612\n00:31:41,229 --> 00:31:45,142\nRandomly sampling is very important versus\npicking out a specific message, but\n\n613\n00:31:45,142 --> 00:31:48,707\nalso the size of the pool we sample from,\nis also going to impact whether or\n\n614\n00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:49,819\nnot we are succesful.\n\n615\n00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:53,159\nSo the birthday attack is just one of\nmany attacks that exist out there.\n\n616\n00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:54,810\nBut we want to make sure\nyou have a sense of it.\n\n617\n00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,770\nIt's one of the ones that we tend\nto see referenced very frequently.\n\n618\n00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:01,160\nIt's one of the ones that you want to have\nsome knowledge of, be generally aware of.\n\n619\n00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,900\nI would not worry about reproducing\nthe logic of the questions,\n\n620\n00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,490\nas much as understanding the conceptual\nidea of what the birthday attack\n\n621\n00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:13,150\nrepresents when we talk about how me\nmight break a one way hash function.\n\n622\n00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:16,480\nWhere, if we can sample\nout of that pool randomly,\n\n623\n00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,750\nassuming the pool is not too large,\nwe're gonna pretty quickly find a match.\n\n624\n00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,370\nIf the pool is very large,\nwe're still gonna find matches,\n\n625\n00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,970\nas long as we're not trying\nto match a specific message.\n\n626\n00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:29,940\nBut it's just gonna take longer because\nthe larger the pool, the more likely it is\n\n627\n00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,150\nthat we have to spend more time fishing to\nfind that match, because there's just so\n\n628\n00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:35,390\nmany others that potentially\nare options there.\n\n629\n00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,750\nSo just be aware of what\nthe birthday attack implies for\n\n630\n00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:41,000\nus in relation to how we may execute\nan attack against a one-way function.\n\n631\n00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,900\n>> Excellent, excellent.\n\n632\n00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,720\nWell, Adam, it's probably a pretty good\nspot for us to stop and take a break.\n\n633\n00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,950\nSo why don't we pause here and\ntake a breather.\n\n634\n00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,886\nWhen we get back, we still have\nsome more hashing information.\n\n635\n00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:54,021\nI know we haven't talked about\ndigital signatures in depth yet, so\n\n636\n00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:54,928\nwe've got those coming up.\n\n637\n00:32:54,928 --> 00:32:56,175\n>> Got those coming up.\n\n638\n00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:57,505\n>> So, stay tuned for that.\n\n639\n00:32:57,505 --> 00:32:59,553\nAnd yeah, that'll be good from there.\n\n640\n00:32:59,553 --> 00:33:00,136\n>> Great.\n\n641\n00:33:00,136 --> 00:33:01,595\n>> Stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n642\n00:33:01,595 --> 00:33:02,386\n>> See you in a few.\n\n643\n00:33:02,386 --> 00:33:09,530\n[SOUND].\n\n644\n00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,300\nAll right, welcome back everybody.\n\n645\n00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,690\nSo we left off talking about\nall sorts of stuff, right?\n\n646\n00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,046\nAll sorts of encryption types,\nand birthday attacks,\n\n647\n00:33:17,046 --> 00:33:19,011\nthat's the last thing\nwe were talking about.\n\n648\n00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:19,595\n>> We were.\n\n649\n00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:22,280\n>> So now we're gonna jump-\n>> So, when's your birthday, by the way?\n\n650\n00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,836\n>> [LAUGH] You know,\nfunny story, here at the office,\n\n651\n00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:28,821\nthere's a good bit of confusion as to when\nmy birthday is cuz every time somebody\n\n652\n00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:30,266\nasks I say a different date.\n\n653\n00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:33,590\n[LAUGH] So I usually get a good three or\nfour birthdays a year.\n\n654\n00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,436\nSo, my odds of somebody successfully\npulling off a birthday attack against me\n\n655\n00:33:37,436 --> 00:33:38,261\nis pretty high.\n\n656\n00:33:38,261 --> 00:33:40,137\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right, okay.\n\n657\n00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:43,590\n>> All right, so\nlet's take a stab at digital signatures.\n\n658\n00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,310\n>> All right, very good.\n\n659\n00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:48,710\nSo, the idea with digital signatures is\ngoing to be the idea of proof of origin.\n\n660\n00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:53,742\nWe want to make sure that there's no way\nthat the person that sent the message is,\n\n661\n00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:57,970\nwithin reasonable limits of course,\nable to not claim it was them.\n\n662\n00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,336\nAnd nobody can impersonate them,\nagain within reasonable limits,\n\n663\n00:34:01,336 --> 00:34:02,750\nmore often than not.\n\n664\n00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:06,220\nSo the idea is proof of origin,\nnon-repudiation, can't say you didn't send\n\n665\n00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,270\nit, definitely want to prove it was you,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n666\n00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:12,130\nSo the hash value there that we\ndeal with has been encrypted with\n\n667\n00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,276\nthe sender's private key.\n\n668\n00:34:13,276 --> 00:34:18,206\nSo when we digitally sign we use our\nprivate key as the sender to basically be\n\n669\n00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:20,990\nable to encrypt and create a hash.\n\n670\n00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,670\nThen ultimately, what is the security or\n\n671\n00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,580\nwhat are the things we thing\nabout with digital signatures?\n\n672\n00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,130\nWhat are we going to be able to do?\n\n673\n00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,590\nWe'll get to this what are security\nservices here in a minute.\n\n674\n00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,714\nBut you'll see Digital Signatures\nthere in the middle,\n\n675\n00:34:32,714 --> 00:34:37,130\nprovides authentication non-repudiation\nand integrity as we were talking about,\n\n676\n00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:41,050\nthis idea of proof of origin,\ncan't claim we didn't send it.\n\n677\n00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,040\nThese are the things that we\nare doing with digital signatures and\n\n678\n00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,230\nauthenticating the person\non the other end.\n\n679\n00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:49,410\nBut notice nowhere there does it say\nanything about encryption, right?\n\n680\n00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:53,100\nWe are not creating confidentiality\nwhen we digitally sign,\n\n681\n00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,140\nwe are leaving the data wide open.\n\n682\n00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,620\nWe simply digitally sign an email,\nwe don't bother to encrypt the email\n\n683\n00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,000\nif all we want to do is\nprovide non-repudiation.\n\n684\n00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,030\nWe're just providing proof of origin.\n\n685\n00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:06,170\nSo I thought it would be good just to\nreview quickly what the other ways in\n\n686\n00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,710\nwhich we can use cryptography are,\nwhat services in effect do we expect or\n\n687\n00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,560\nprovide.\n\n688\n00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,310\nSo you'll see there,\nencryption creates confidentiality.\n\n689\n00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,140\nHashing, the act of hashing\ncreates integrity, right.\n\n690\n00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,170\nData is not manipulated,\ndoes not change in any way.\n\n691\n00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:25,865\nDigital signatures creates this\nnon-repudiation, this idea of proof of\n\n692\n00:35:25,865 --> 00:35:31,320\norigin, can't say we didn't actually\ndo something, but also integrity.\n\n693\n00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,040\nAnd then encrypt and digitally sign,\ncombine the two together as you can see\n\n694\n00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,750\nthere, we're then right, proof of origin\nis effectively what non-repudiation is.\n\n695\n00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,550\nThen we can see there, that as\na result of combining encryption and\n\n696\n00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,090\ndigital signatures, we effectively\nget the best of both worlds.\n\n697\n00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:50,120\nWe are gonna create, or\nget confidentiality, as well as getting or\n\n698\n00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:55,200\ncreating integrity along the way there\nwith the non-repudiation element.\n\n699\n00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,890\nBasically proof of origin,\ncan't say we didn't do it.\n\n700\n00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,490\nSo when we look at digital signatures\nwe're looking at this ability to be able\n\n701\n00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:06,050\nto verify identity, and\nensure that the person that sends\n\n702\n00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,330\nis indeed the person that we\nare expecting to hear from, if you will.\n\n703\n00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,768\nSo we put together a little chart, Don\nactually put together a little chart for\n\n704\n00:36:14,768 --> 00:36:18,210\nus, that really puts all of\nthis into perspective, right?\n\n705\n00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,240\nSo it takes all of the algorithms that\nare currently available out there that we\n\n706\n00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,040\ntalk about, some we've mentioned.\n\n707\n00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,345\nA few are on there, for instance,\nwe haven't really spoken about.\n\n708\n00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:27,982\nThings like SAFER, Tiger and\nHAVAL, for instance,\n\n709\n00:36:27,982 --> 00:36:32,552\nwe haven't really mentioned before, but\nsome others we have, most of them we have.\n\n710\n00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:34,840\nAnd you'll see that we lay them out,\nas either asymmetric,\n\n711\n00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,115\nsymmetric, or hashing algorithms.\n\n712\n00:36:37,115 --> 00:36:41,660\nAnd then on the right hand side,\nwe have the functionality.\n\n713\n00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,560\nAre they doing encryption for\nconfidentiality?\n\n714\n00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,715\nAre they doing digital signatures\nthere where we are dealing with\n\n715\n00:36:47,715 --> 00:36:50,090\nthe non-repudiation, proof of origin?\n\n716\n00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,275\nAre they doing hashing for integrity?\n\n717\n00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:54,290\nAnd/or are they used for key distribution?\n\n718\n00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,360\nSo, securely sending and\ntransmitting keys.\n\n719\n00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,000\nSo this is actually a very nice\npiece of work you put together.\n\n720\n00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,383\nIs very, very valuable as a resource.\n\n721\n00:37:01,383 --> 00:37:02,400\n>> I have my moments.\n\n722\n00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,080\nI was just trying to think of all\nthe different ones that might show up on\n\n723\n00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,732\nthe exam.\n\n724\n00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:09,530\nCuz sometimes, I think you said\nit in the very first episode,\n\n725\n00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,680\nsometimes there's just\nstuff you have to memorize.\n\n726\n00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,230\nThere's no elegant, sexy way about it.\n\n727\n00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:16,532\nYou just have to raw memorize that data.\n\n728\n00:37:16,532 --> 00:37:17,994\nAnd so I threw it together in a chart and\n\n729\n00:37:17,994 --> 00:37:20,386\nI did this in Google Docs so\nI'll share this out with you guys.\n\n730\n00:37:20,386 --> 00:37:25,284\nBy the time this makes it out onto\nthe website the link will be right beneath\n\n731\n00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,840\nthe video.\n\n732\n00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,500\n>> Yeah, I probably should shorten it,\nit's kind of a long one.\n\n733\n00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,840\n>> It's kind of a long one, yeah.\n\n734\n00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,370\n>> But yeah, so you'll be able\nto get to this and pull it up.\n\n735\n00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,405\nPrint it out, just save it,\nlook at it, and\n\n736\n00:37:34,405 --> 00:37:37,553\nit breaks them down based on their\nkind of functions and their uses.\n\n737\n00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:41,630\nSo it's good information to have committed\nto memory before sitting the exam.\n\n738\n00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,480\n>> All right, very good.\n\n739\n00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,362\nSo a good reference point for you.\n\n740\n00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:47,180\nAnd obviously wanna know\nthe type of algorithm,\n\n741\n00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:50,180\nasymmetric versus\nsymmetric versus hashing.\n\n742\n00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:53,290\nAnd as a result of that, the functionality\nthat we can expect from that algorithm.\n\n743\n00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:56,740\n>> You'll see for instance,\nRSA is an asymmetric algorithm and\n\n744\n00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,210\nit provides encryption, digital signature\ncapabilities and key distribution\n\n745\n00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:03,750\ndepending on what it's being used for\nand how it's implemented, right?\n\n746\n00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:09,380\nWhereas, if we take something like,\noh, Blowfish, right?\n\n747\n00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,930\nCuz I just love the concept of a Dr.\nSeuss-like algorithm.\n\n748\n00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,244\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So, Blowfish there,\n\n749\n00:38:15,244 --> 00:38:17,060\nwe have a symmetric algorithm, right?\n\n750\n00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,610\nSingle key, private key only, and\nyou see it's used exclusively for\n\n751\n00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:24,060\nencryption, or\nto provide confidentiality of that.\n\n752\n00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,050\nSo this is the way we would\nread a chart like this and\n\n753\n00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,410\nuse it as a reference point for us.\n\n754\n00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,900\nSo, great opportunity for\nyou guys to do a little studying there.\n\n755\n00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,560\nMake sure you bone up on your algorithms,\n\n756\n00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,250\nunderstand what kind of algorithms\nthey are and how they work.\n\n757\n00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,114\nAnd it'll be, as Don suggested,\nmaybe a good piece of information for\n\n758\n00:38:38,114 --> 00:38:40,136\nyou to print out and use,\nput in your study notes.\n\n759\n00:38:40,136 --> 00:38:43,970\n>> Yeah, and let me throw that in\nthe chat room, just for the live viewers.\n\n760\n00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,559\n>> Okay, great.\n>> In case you need them them,\n\n761\n00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:46,685\nwanted to get that early.\n\n762\n00:38:46,685 --> 00:38:48,335\nBut otherwise,\nif you're watching this recorded,\n\n763\n00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:52,135\nit should just be posted\nbeneath the episode.\n\n764\n00:38:52,135 --> 00:38:52,805\n>> Okay, very good, and\n\n765\n00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:55,825\nthat is a whole URL, not truncated,\nso you have to actually make sure\n\n766\n00:38:55,825 --> 00:38:59,940\nit goes out as a single stream even\nthough it's truncated in the chat room.\n\n767\n00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,620\nAll right, very good.\n\n768\n00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,240\nSo, we've talked a bit\nabout digital signatures.\n\n769\n00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,190\nLet's delve into another very large,\nvery important architectural area when\n\n770\n00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,120\nwe talk about information security and\ncryptography.\n\n771\n00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,130\nThis is the idea of PKI,\nPublic Key Infrastructure.\n\n772\n00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,053\nThe idea of being able\nto create a solution.\n\n773\n00:39:17,053 --> 00:39:19,490\nThis is really, and\nthis is an architecture,\n\n774\n00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:23,992\nwe're creating infrastructure, building\nsystem infrastructure that allows us to\n\n775\n00:39:23,992 --> 00:39:26,690\nuse digital certificates\nas identity solutions.\n\n776\n00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:30,587\nTo be able to validate identity, to be\nable to, among other things obviously,\n\n777\n00:39:30,587 --> 00:39:34,255\ncreate digital signatures cuz digital\ncertificates are used to digitally\n\n778\n00:39:34,255 --> 00:39:34,969\nsign things.\n\n779\n00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:39,816\nBut in general, to validate identity and\nto make sure that if we are, for instance,\n\n780\n00:39:39,816 --> 00:39:42,344\nrequesting a service\nfrom a web server for,\n\n781\n00:39:42,344 --> 00:39:46,129\nperhaps example may be an email service or\nsome sort of a web page.\n\n782\n00:39:46,129 --> 00:39:50,609\nWe wanna have proof of that service's and\nthat content's integrity.\n\n783\n00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:54,400\nAnd that services that content's proof\nof origin, where it's coming from.\n\n784\n00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,718\nWanna make sure we're not seeing a man\nin the middle attack, a replay attack,\n\n785\n00:39:57,718 --> 00:39:59,120\nsome sort of a redirect.\n\n786\n00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,380\nWanna make sure we're getting good\ncontent that we can validate and trust.\n\n787\n00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:07,130\nFor all these reasons, PKI becomes central\nto how we do things on the web today.\n\n788\n00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,880\nReally, you can't find a solution today,\nat least f you do,\n\n789\n00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,560\nI hope you don't engage that solution but\nit will be very difficult to find in\n\n790\n00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:18,330\nthe e-commerce sector in actors that\nare acting in good faith, right.\n\n791\n00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,530\nSo not actors who try and\nsteal your money, right,\n\n792\n00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:23,850\nbut good faith actors who are actually\nselling things and exchanging goods for\n\n793\n00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:27,230\nservices, goods and\nservices rather for money.\n\n794\n00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:30,425\nIt would be almost impossible today to\nfind a solution that's publicly available,\n\n795\n00:40:30,425 --> 00:40:34,330\nright, that's not behind a firewall,\nthat's not internal only to a company.\n\n796\n00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:38,090\nWhere they don't use PKI to\nsecure their e-commerce solution\n\n797\n00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,030\nwhere they're not using\ndigital certificates,\n\n798\n00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:43,860\namong other mechanisms,\nto be able to provide that architecture.\n\n799\n00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,600\nOr at least the frame work\nof that architecture.\n\n800\n00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,632\nSo, it's very ubiquitous,\nit's very widespread today.\n\n801\n00:40:48,632 --> 00:40:52,700\nReally the foundational, underlying,\none of the key foundational underlying\n\n802\n00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,890\nunderpinning of the world wide web\ntoday in terms of the commerce element\n\n803\n00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:59,860\nis going to be seeing broader\nin this idea of PKI plus set,\n\n804\n00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,588\nthe secure electronic transaction,\nconcept.\n\n805\n00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:08,570\nWe talked about PSS DCI\nthe whole idea of processing and\n\n806\n00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,500\ncredit card payments and things like that.\n\n807\n00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,230\nBut this idea of secure electronic\ntransactions being built on PKI\n\n808\n00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:18,330\ninfrastructure is really what drives\nthe modern commerce on the web today.\n\n809\n00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:22,460\nSo having said that, the idea behind PKI\nis basically establishing a level of\n\n810\n00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,560\ntrust within an enterprise.\n\n811\n00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,880\nSo if I was to say that I\nwanna do something with Don,\n\n812\n00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,350\nmaybe send from information to him,\n\n813\n00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:33,880\nget some information from him, I would\nhave to somehow establish trust with him.\n\n814\n00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,690\nNow we have trust mechanisms in\nvarious LDAP systems, for instance,\n\n815\n00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:41,320\nwe talked extensively in our network\nconversation about Crowbros.\n\n816\n00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,740\nCrowbros is built on this idea of\nexchanging tickets that are from a trusted\n\n817\n00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,760\nsource, so\nwe imply we have trust in that system.\n\n818\n00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,000\nWe talk about transitive trust, or\ninherited trust in a directory service\n\n819\n00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,680\ngenerically, and specifically in Windows,\nfor instance, where we create our tree.\n\n820\n00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,540\nOur tree leads down to our domain, and\nthe tree's encompassed in the forest.\n\n821\n00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,050\nWe have passed through, trusted\neffectively of transitive of transfer,\n\n822\n00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,560\nfrom one segment or\none hierarchy down to the other.\n\n823\n00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,230\nSo trust is not an unknown\nconcept in network architecture,\n\n824\n00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:14,540\nnot unknown in network security, but we\nbasically have to trust each other, right?\n\n825\n00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,100\nAnd so, I often do this when I teach,\ndo you have any money on you?\n\n826\n00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,410\nDo you have any paper money.\n\n827\n00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,218\n>> I do.\n\n828\n00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:21,320\n>> Okay.\nDo you wanna take something out of our\n\n829\n00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,013\npocket and let me have it for a minute?\n\n830\n00:42:22,013 --> 00:42:22,954\n>> Well, I don't know.\n\n831\n00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:24,690\nWhere's our trust.\n\n832\n00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,790\nI-\n>> Well, I'm tethered to the podium here.\n\n833\n00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:27,990\nI'm not gonna get too far, right?\n\n834\n00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,450\n>> I'll tell ya, up until this moment,\nmy trust for you was high.\n\n835\n00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,188\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And then all the sudden when you start\n\n836\n00:42:32,188 --> 00:42:34,316\nasking for paper money-\n>> Now all the sudden my trust factor is\n\n837\n00:42:34,316 --> 00:42:35,185\ngoing through the floor.\n\n838\n00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:35,750\n>> I'll tell ya.\n\n839\n00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,910\nFloor here.\n>> Simple things, I think because I\n\n840\n00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,990\n>> Oh, we got a big one too, a 20.\n\n841\n00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,190\n>> It's all about the Jacksons.\n\n842\n00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,116\n>> All right,\nit's all about the Jacksons, all right.\n\n843\n00:42:43,116 --> 00:42:45,080\nSo I often do this when I teach.\n\n844\n00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,620\nI usually just use a dollar bill\nbecause most of my students don't\n\n845\n00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,930\nfeel comfortable trusting\nme with any more.\n\n846\n00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:52,860\nBut now that Don has trusted me with this,\n\n847\n00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,315\nlet's talk about what this is for\na minute.\n\n848\n00:42:55,315 --> 00:43:00,490\nSo, we've all, at least if you live in, or\nwork, or do business in the United States,\n\n849\n00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:03,080\nhave seen this money, but certainly\nhave seen it outside the U.S., as well.\n\n850\n00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,310\nIt's not limited to the U.S..\n\n851\n00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:07,220\nBut, I represent this\nidea of trust using U.S.\n\n852\n00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:11,235\ncurrency just because we happen to put the\nword trust on the back of our currency.\n\n853\n00:43:11,235 --> 00:43:12,955\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so, it's very easy to use.\n\n854\n00:43:12,955 --> 00:43:15,260\nWhereas other countries may or\nmay not have that.\n\n855\n00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,650\nSo what we have here,I know it\nmay be kind of hard to see, but\n\n856\n00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:23,880\nwe have right here we have\nthe words in God We Trust.\n\n857\n00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,840\nIn this case above the White House\non the back of the $20 bill, right?\n\n858\n00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,510\nAnd so the idea of trust is\n\n859\n00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,550\nrepresented by something like this\ncause if you think about currency.\n\n860\n00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:35,700\nAnd if you do watch,\nyou'll notice Don has hawk eyes on this.\n\n861\n00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,070\nHe's not letting this out of his sight.\n\n862\n00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,630\nWherever I go, wherever this goes,\nhe's moving with me.\n\n863\n00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:42,040\nSo the idea here is that\nthis you know basically for\n\n864\n00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:42,960\nall intensive purposes, right?\n\n865\n00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,230\nIt's just a piece of paper.\n\n866\n00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,610\nIt's special paper,\nI don't wanna belabor the point.\n\n867\n00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,760\nBut we know that this is special paper,\nright?\n\n868\n00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,130\nCan't just run down to Kinko's and\nget this kind of paper.\n\n869\n00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,690\nAnd it represents something very\nspecial and very important.\n\n870\n00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:55,190\nRight?\n>> Mhm.\n\n871\n00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:57,760\nIt represents the idea, all currency does,\n\n872\n00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,490\nthat for the equivalent value, face value\nof whatever the currency is, in this case\n\n873\n00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:06,510\na $20 U.S. bill, that we should be able to\nexchange this for some sort of goods or\n\n874\n00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:11,940\nservices in most systems that we think of\ntoday where we engage in commerce, right?\n\n875\n00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,660\nEven outside the United States, although\nit may not be worth this exact amount,\n\n876\n00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:19,550\npeople have a value idea attached to this,\nright?\n\n877\n00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:23,640\nYou can exchange this for so\nmany Deutschmarks, so many Yen, right?\n\n878\n00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,150\nSo many Canadian dollars\nwhatever it may be.\n\n879\n00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,520\nRight.\nSo the idea would be that there is\n\n880\n00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,000\nvalue in other systems related to this.\n\n881\n00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,902\nAnd the value comes from trust, right?\n\n882\n00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:34,210\nThe value comes from that\nfact that the full faith and\n\n883\n00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:38,670\ncredit of the United States, as we often\nsay the government, backs our currency.\n\n884\n00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:42,205\nUp until the mid 1970s we were on\nthe gold standard in this country.\n\n885\n00:44:42,205 --> 00:44:44,483\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And so up until about 1973,\n\n886\n00:44:44,483 --> 00:44:48,533\nwhen President Nixon took us off\nthe gold standard, you could walk into\n\n887\n00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:53,460\na bank anywhere in the United States with\nthe equivalent dollar value, a $20 bill,\n\n888\n00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,103\nput it on the table, in effect and\nwe say to somebody in the bank,\n\n889\n00:44:57,103 --> 00:45:01,590\nI'd like the equivalent amount of gold\nin effect for this piece of paper.\n\n890\n00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:05,360\nNow, you wouldn't necessarily be handed a\nbar of gold, but the idea behind the gold\n\n891\n00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,320\nstandard was that the value of the gold\nreserves the United States' government\n\n892\n00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,930\nheld were backing up and propping up the\ncurrency, where our trust, in other words,\n\n893\n00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:17,970\nwas based on something tangible, based\non gold sitting in vaults in Fort Knox,\n\n894\n00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,100\nor the bank, federal reserve banks in\nNew York, wherever it would have been.\n\n895\n00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,963\nWhen we got off the gold standard\nwe still have trust, right?\n\n896\n00:45:23,963 --> 00:45:27,150\nBut the idea that we put in God we\nTrust on the back of our currency\n\n897\n00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,160\nis not the reason that we have trust,\nright?\n\n898\n00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,970\nIt's a statement of many other things,\nright?\n\n899\n00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:33,470\nI don't certainly wanna offend anybody, so\n\n900\n00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:35,170\nplease don't take what\nI said the wrong way.\n\n901\n00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:38,710\nIt's not about a religious thing when\nwe talk about trust in this regard,\n\n902\n00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:39,650\nwith security.\n\n903\n00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:43,903\nBut we have a statement of intent on here,\nbut the idea that it says In God We Trust\n\n904\n00:45:43,903 --> 00:45:48,350\nis important, but it's not the reason\nthat we trust the currency exclusively.\n\n905\n00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:50,380\nRight?\nWe trust the currency because\n\n906\n00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,140\nthe government of the United States says,\nwe're gonna effectively make sure\n\n907\n00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:58,060\nthat you can exchange this for\nsomething else of relative value.\n\n908\n00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,380\nWhatever that may be, right.\n\n909\n00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,110\nDon's getting nervous,\nhe wants his money back.\n\n910\n00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:05,430\n>> And it kind of goes without saying that\nthere's one thing we have learned over\n\n911\n00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,960\nthe years which is,\nboy if you can't trust the U.S.\n\n912\n00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,370\ngovernment, who can you trust, right?\n\n913\n00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:09,970\n>> Exactly.\n\n914\n00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:13,160\nThat's who you should definitely be\nable to trust, the U.S. government.\n\n915\n00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,990\nBut you know this idea of currency and\ntrust is important because it brings home\n\n916\n00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:19,450\nfor all of us cuz we all, at some point,\nright, use money everyday,\n\n917\n00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,760\nwhether it's plastic money,\nvirtual money, right, or whatever it is.\n\n918\n00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,810\nBut we all engage in\nsome sort of commerce.\n\n919\n00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:26,130\nWe buy things all the time.\n\n920\n00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,105\nAnd so we engage in this web\nof trust all the time, right?\n\n921\n00:46:29,105 --> 00:46:32,080\nWithout even thinking about it,\nit just becomes second nature.\n\n922\n00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,170\nYou go through a drive through,\nyou buy something, you give them money,\n\n923\n00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,490\nthey give you something that\nprobably more often than not,\n\n924\n00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:38,965\nsomewhat resembles a food\nlike product in a bag, right.\n\n925\n00:46:38,965 --> 00:46:39,550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And so\n\n926\n00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:42,072\nthe idea is that you are gonna\nhave trust everywhere you go.\n\n927\n00:46:42,072 --> 00:46:44,670\nNow is all this trust built around PKI,\nright?\n\n928\n00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,330\nBecause that's really the question.\n\n929\n00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:49,960\nDo we have a PKI solution that\nvalidates our money, right?\n\n930\n00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:52,650\nWe don't really have PKI\nto validate everything but\n\n931\n00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:58,320\nin information security as a CIS SSP, when\nwe deal with validation of information,\n\n932\n00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,810\nwe have to come up with another way other\nthan just saying the government's gonna\n\n933\n00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:06,070\nprovide that web of trust, because we\nknow that for certain things like money,\n\n934\n00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:10,560\nthat works, but for other things it\ndoesn't work as well, as something that's\n\n935\n00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,188\ntangible, that we can ascribe value to by\nseeing it, like a digital certificate.\n\n936\n00:47:14,188 --> 00:47:19,242\nSo, we have this idea, of PKI, because we\nwanna make sure we can validate the trust,\n\n937\n00:47:19,242 --> 00:47:23,594\nthat it has to be built into a system,\nso that when somebody unknown to us,\n\n938\n00:47:23,594 --> 00:47:28,508\nsends information, or provides a service,\nor wants to validate their identity,\n\n939\n00:47:28,508 --> 00:47:33,356\nor anything that goes on with PKI that we\nhave a basically impartial mechanism that\n\n940\n00:47:33,356 --> 00:47:37,428\nallows us to do so, because the system\nis set up in such a way through,\n\n941\n00:47:37,428 --> 00:47:41,993\nas we're going to document in a couple\nminutes, through a hierarchy of trust\n\n942\n00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:46,559\nthat allows us to specify from the top\ndown, that everything at that level and\n\n943\n00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,699\nbelow should be trusted because\nthe trust is inherent in the system.\n\n944\n00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:54,299\nAnd, there is a certain element of, you\nknow, close your eyes and believe, right?\n\n945\n00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:56,519\nWe almost refer to it as like magic.\n\n946\n00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:00,699\nBecause you have to believe in the trust\nhierarchy for this whole thing to work.\n\n947\n00:48:00,699 --> 00:48:05,945\nIf you don't believe in the idea that\na root CA, a root certificate authority,\n\n948\n00:48:05,945 --> 00:48:11,290\nis going to be the ultimate place where\ntrust is instantiated in the system.\n\n949\n00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:15,776\nAnd if the root CA is intact and\nsecure, and the subordinate,\n\n950\n00:48:15,776 --> 00:48:20,366\nthe hierarchically linked children\nto the roots are trusted.\n\n951\n00:48:20,366 --> 00:48:25,163\nAnd then, maybe, the sub subordinate CAs\nare trusted and the certificates that come\n\n952\n00:48:25,163 --> 00:48:28,810\nfrom them can be trusted,\nthen the whole system breaks down.\n\n953\n00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,400\nThere's no way to validate the trust.\n\n954\n00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,620\nBut if you believe in that chain of trust,\nas we call it the trust hierarchy, then\n\n955\n00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:39,420\nyou should understand and believe that\nsomebody or something that shows up and\n\n956\n00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:44,100\nrepresents, with a certificate from\na trusted CA, a trusted certificate\n\n957\n00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,210\nauthority, should have the full faith and\nbacking of the system.\n\n958\n00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:49,680\nWe should believe, in other words,\nthat they are a good actor,\n\n959\n00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,350\na good faith actor and\nare not out to do us harm.\n\n960\n00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:56,710\nNow, we know that there are cases where\ncertificates have been compromised,\n\n961\n00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:01,286\nso certificates can indeed be rendered\neither untrustworthy or no longer valid.\n\n962\n00:49:01,286 --> 00:49:02,860\nThere's several ways to think about that.\n\n963\n00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:07,738\nIf somebody's able to break into the trust\nhierarchy somewhere along the chain, and\n\n964\n00:49:07,738 --> 00:49:11,939\ncompromise that level, everything\nbelow that level becomes suspect and\n\n965\n00:49:11,939 --> 00:49:13,550\ncompromised as well.\n\n966\n00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:17,040\nAnd so, we saw this, for instance,\nin the Middle East several years back, or\n\n967\n00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:17,990\nover the last several years.\n\n968\n00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,810\nBeen going on for\nabout five or six years, but\n\n969\n00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:24,230\nit came to light last year where we saw\nthe idea, or we heard conversations around\n\n970\n00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:28,690\nFlame, the big security warning\nthat was put out there.\n\n971\n00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:32,375\nAnd there were others, there's and some\nof these others that were used to attack\n\n972\n00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:34,985\ninfrastructure in certain\ncountries in the Middle East.\n\n973\n00:49:34,985 --> 00:49:38,502\nSpecifically, typically,\nthe systems that control power generation,\n\n974\n00:49:38,502 --> 00:49:42,575\nnuclear power plants, and maybe, chemical\nweapons factories and things like that,\n\n975\n00:49:42,575 --> 00:49:45,588\nthat we were targeting without\ngetting into all the politics and\n\n976\n00:49:45,588 --> 00:49:47,233\nthen the pointing of the fingers.\n\n977\n00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:51,820\nAnd the spooky spy stuff about whether\nwe were behind it or not ultimately.\n\n978\n00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:56,315\nAt the end of the day, the way that\nFlame was specifically targeted and\n\n979\n00:49:56,315 --> 00:50:01,015\ncreated was to use fake digital\ncertificates that effectively spoofed\n\n980\n00:50:01,015 --> 00:50:03,085\nthe Windows update process.\n\n981\n00:50:03,085 --> 00:50:07,569\nSo, they didn't go in and actually take\nover the Microsoft certificate authorities\n\n982\n00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:11,865\nto validate these certificate, but were\nable to craft digital certificates that\n\n983\n00:50:11,865 --> 00:50:15,478\neffectively fooled machines that\nwere targeted into believing that\n\n984\n00:50:15,478 --> 00:50:19,847\nthe updates that were being loaded\nwere digitally signed from Microsoft.\n\n985\n00:50:19,847 --> 00:50:21,187\nAnd in effect, of course, they were not.\n\n986\n00:50:21,187 --> 00:50:24,030\nWhat they were simply,\nwe can think of them as malware, but\n\n987\n00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:28,000\nthey were basically targeted software\nthat was being loaded in under the guise\n\n988\n00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,760\nof Windows updates that was then able to\nspread ultimately this malware, the worm.\n\n989\n00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,000\nAnd the damage that it was able\nto do was a direct result of\n\n990\n00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,960\nthis idea of opening up the certificate\nauthority, the trust if you will, and\n\n991\n00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,070\nusing those digital certificates for\nbad as opposed to for good.\n\n992\n00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:46,330\nSo, we inserted malware,\n\n993\n00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:49,400\nwe inserted remote access trojans,\nall sorts of things.\n\n994\n00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,790\nAnd then, we're able to monitor these\nsystems, and he'll take them offline do\n\n995\n00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:56,020\nall sorts of things with them as a result\nof manipulating a digital certificate.\n\n996\n00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,854\nSo, kind of interesting when you look back\non some of the history of this stuff,\n\n997\n00:50:59,854 --> 00:51:01,817\nhow it works, what can be done with PKI.\n\n998\n00:51:01,817 --> 00:51:03,882\nSo, now, that we've kind of\nlaid the foundation there,\n\n999\n00:51:03,882 --> 00:51:04,820\nwhy don't we take a look.\n\n1000\n00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,910\nI know we have a diagram that we laid\nout or at least that we put together and\n\n1001\n00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:10,730\ndrew out to show everybody\nhow this is going to work.\n\n1002\n00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,732\n>> So, let's see.\n\n1003\n00:51:14,732 --> 00:51:16,620\n>> That is our structure certificate.\n\n1004\n00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:17,370\n>> Hang on a second.\n\n1005\n00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:18,540\nDo we have.\n\n1006\n00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,540\nOh you know what?\n[LAUGH] This one.\n\n1007\n00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,510\n>> Yeah, the Visio diagram.\n\n1008\n00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:22,800\n>> I forgot, it's the one I drew myself.\n\n1009\n00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,320\n>> Yes, okay.\n\n1010\n00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,280\nWe're just gonna zoom in there for\njust a second.\n\n1011\n00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,830\nJust let everybody see it,\nwe'll kinda move it over and\n\n1012\n00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,820\nI think Don has the ability to\ndraw on it as well, if we need to.\n\n1013\n00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,110\nSo, we'll do that.\n\n1014\n00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:36,400\nSo [COUGH], the idea here is that we\nhave often left the internet cloud, and\n\n1015\n00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,120\nbelow it we have some input devices.\n\n1016\n00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,250\nWe have tablet and we have some laptops.\n\n1017\n00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:45,690\nSo, whatever they may be, some external\nto the network external end points and\n\n1018\n00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:48,870\nwe'll obviously have users out\nthere trying to consume services.\n\n1019\n00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:51,935\nWe have our firewalls to traffic that\ncomes in through the end points gonna have\n\n1020\n00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,153\nto move through our firewall.\n\n1021\n00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:56,304\nAnd although we don't have\nit in the diagram here,\n\n1022\n00:51:56,304 --> 00:52:00,310\nwe wanna insert what's known\nas a registration authority.\n\n1023\n00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:03,420\nSo, Don's gonna draw just a little box or\nsomething over there.\n\n1024\n00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,940\nAnd it's gonna put that there and just\nlabel it RA or Registration Authority.\n\n1025\n00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:11,230\nAnd we're gonna direct that traffic\ndown to the RA that comes in\n\n1026\n00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,890\nthrough the firewall,\nbefore it goes anywhere else.\n\n1027\n00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:17,150\nSo, we're gonna move it there\nbecause the first stop on the PKI\n\n1028\n00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,890\ntrain is gonna be the RA,\nthe Registration Authority.\n\n1029\n00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:22,810\nThis is gonna be the box that\naccepts inbound requests for\n\n1030\n00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,730\nservices and certificate validation.\n\n1031\n00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:29,350\nAnd what this does is effectively\nbrokers the conversation\n\n1032\n00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:33,360\nwith the directory service,\nthe LDAP provider or whoever it may be,\n\n1033\n00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,860\nvalidate some of the information\ncoming from the end user.\n\n1034\n00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:38,980\nSo, who are you?\n\n1035\n00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,650\nDo you have the right credentials?\n\n1036\n00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:43,840\nIf you have a certificate,\nis that certificate valid?\n\n1037\n00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,940\nIf it is, is it from this PKI?\n\n1038\n00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:46,590\nThat kind of stuff.\n\n1039\n00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,210\nSo, we're gonna talk to the RA.\n\n1040\n00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,960\nThe RA then is ultimately going\nto take some information,\n\n1041\n00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,690\ngathered from the user, and have\na conversation with the LDAP provider.\n\n1042\n00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:01,290\nWe labelled the domain controller cuz we\nassumed this would be a Windows solution,\n\n1043\n00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:04,010\nso we could show you\nthe Enterprise Root CA.\n\n1044\n00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:07,080\nBut it's just the LDAP provider,\nwhoever that LDAP provider is.\n\n1045\n00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,700\nThe registration authority and\nthe LDAP provider talk back and\n\n1046\n00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:14,540\nforth, assuming that that is good, that\nconversation ends well, in other words.\n\n1047\n00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:18,500\nWhat will then happen is that we\ncan register the information for\n\n1048\n00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,220\nthe certificate.\n\n1049\n00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:23,310\nSo, the LDAP provider talks to\neither the subordinate CA and\n\n1050\n00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:25,340\nor the enterprise route CA.\n\n1051\n00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:29,451\nNow, let's just explain quickly where\nthese roles actually live because\n\n1052\n00:53:29,451 --> 00:53:31,473\nthe way we have this set up right now,\n\n1053\n00:53:31,473 --> 00:53:35,536\nthe enterprise route CA indicates that\nthis is a Windows based solution.\n\n1054\n00:53:35,536 --> 00:53:40,500\nSo, maybe, Windows server 2008 or 2012\nis being used to drive the certificate,\n\n1055\n00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,784\nthe underlying architecture\nof the certificate servers.\n\n1056\n00:53:43,784 --> 00:53:48,374\nAnd since this is a domain based solution,\nthe enterprise root CA is going to\n\n1057\n00:53:48,374 --> 00:53:52,900\nbe part of the domain, the subordinate\nCA will be part of the domain.\n\n1058\n00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:57,830\nAnd it will be installed as a certificate\nservice, an add-on, if you will.\n\n1059\n00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:00,040\nIt is not gonna be on the domain\ncontroller, typically.\n\n1060\n00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,780\nBest practices say, don't wanna\nrun this on a domain controller,\n\n1061\n00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,220\nwant to run it separate somewhere,\ntypically.\n\n1062\n00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:09,000\nBut we do see in some instances where\nwe actually just install the roll and\n\n1063\n00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,830\nit potentially can be an all in one.\n\n1064\n00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:14,410\nBut the route domain controller, or\nthe enterprise route CA is typically kept\n\n1065\n00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:18,870\nseparate from everything else because\nit is a highly vulnerable machine.\n\n1066\n00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,000\nIf we get to it and\n\n1067\n00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,430\ntake it over, everything that's in the web\nof trust below it, can be compromised.\n\n1068\n00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,880\nAnd so,\nwe often will set this up as a machine\n\n1069\n00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,800\nseparate from the domain controller,\npart of the domain but\n\n1070\n00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,880\nseparate, we will then\ncreate the enterprise root.\n\n1071\n00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,150\nWe will instantiate,\n\n1072\n00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:36,510\ngive out the certificates to enable\nthe subordinates to operate.\n\n1073\n00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:40,570\nWe will then typically take that\nenterprise root CA and shut it down and\n\n1074\n00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,200\nstore it securely somewhere.\n\n1075\n00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,920\nMaybe, done on a laptop and\nremovable drive kind of thing.\n\n1076\n00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,950\nReally depends on how\nyou wanna secure this.\n\n1077\n00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,790\nSometimes, they're just left up and\nrunning.\n\n1078\n00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:53,550\nBut more often than not,\nwe wanna secure the system so\n\n1079\n00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:58,660\nthat nobody can use it to issue additional\ncertificates and bring on additional CAs.\n\n1080\n00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:02,845\nReally, the only role that the root RA or\nthe root CA rather has,\n\n1081\n00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:08,465\nis to issue subordinate CA certificates to\nenable those child certificate holders,\n\n1082\n00:55:08,465 --> 00:55:12,885\nthe subordinate CAs, to come online and\ndeal with end users to give out requests.\n\n1083\n00:55:12,885 --> 00:55:16,519\nAnd occasionally, it has to do some\nvalidation if a certificate authority's\n\n1084\n00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:18,555\nsubordinate CA comes to\nthe end of its life,\n\n1085\n00:55:18,555 --> 00:55:21,150\nwe have to reissue its certificate,\nthings like that.\n\n1086\n00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:24,238\nSo, every so often, it does have to be\navailable, but more often than not,\n\n1087\n00:55:24,238 --> 00:55:25,320\nit doesn't do anything.\n\n1088\n00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,402\nWhat it never does is talk directly\nto end users requesting certificates,\n\n1089\n00:55:29,402 --> 00:55:31,818\nunless it is the only CA that's available.\n\n1090\n00:55:31,818 --> 00:55:33,866\nIn other words,\nif you don't have any subordinates,\n\n1091\n00:55:33,866 --> 00:55:36,237\nall you have is a single root CA,\nthen it issues certificates.\n\n1092\n00:55:36,237 --> 00:55:38,335\nBut in a well architected solution,\n\n1093\n00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,210\nit should not be able to\nbe reached by end users.\n\n1094\n00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,070\nIt should be isolated.\n\n1095\n00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:45,407\nSo, it may be talking to the main\ncontroller on occasion to do some\n\n1096\n00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:49,540\nvalidation, but typically it's kinda\noff-line, more often than not.\n\n1097\n00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:52,130\nThe subordinate CA is really\nwhere the magic happens.\n\n1098\n00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:54,560\nSo, this is where all the certificates for\nend users get issued.\n\n1099\n00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,640\nThey get updated.\n\n1100\n00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:59,979\nCertificates have a lifetime associated\nwith them, what's known as the TTL.\n\n1101\n00:55:59,979 --> 00:56:01,499\nA time to live value.\n\n1102\n00:56:01,499 --> 00:56:04,549\nIt could be a day, it could be a year,\nit could be five years.\n\n1103\n00:56:04,549 --> 00:56:09,331\nWe as the owner, the one who creates the\ncertificate, tends to get to decide based\n\n1104\n00:56:09,331 --> 00:56:13,020\non the template that we use,\nwhat kind of scripts that we want?\n\n1105\n00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,148\nAnd as a result, how long that\ncertificate is going to be alive for?\n\n1106\n00:56:16,148 --> 00:56:19,980\nWe don't wanna see certificate\nlifetimes that are very, very long,\n\n1107\n00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:24,810\nbecause the certificates get compromised,\nwe have to then get rid of them,\n\n1108\n00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:26,270\ninvalidate them, in other words,\nand turn them off.\n\n1109\n00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:29,890\nAnd we have to put them on what's known as\na CRL or a certification revocation list.\n\n1110\n00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,250\nSo if we leave certificates out there for\ntoo long,\n\n1111\n00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,900\nthe likelihood is that they\nwill become compromised.\n\n1112\n00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,320\nSo over time, and other words somebody may\nactually find a way to take them over.\n\n1113\n00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,913\nSo we tend to see, from a best practice\nperspective, that we have small TTLs for\n\n1114\n00:56:41,913 --> 00:56:45,767\naverage certificates,\nthings that are used maybe to sign email.\n\n1115\n00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:49,520\nMaybe they get a year, maybe they get\ntwo years and then they get renewed.\n\n1116\n00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:54,130\nThe certificates that are used\nto set up Outlook web access,\n\n1117\n00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:56,880\nlike a web service for\nemail, that kinda thing.\n\n1118\n00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,940\nTypically, a year or so, for\nthe TTL, I had a customer once,\n\n1119\n00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,760\nthat set this up in fact I think, I told\nthis story in the SSCP class as well.\n\n1120\n00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,580\nWe had a customer once,\nthat set up their Exchange System,\n\n1121\n00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,650\nset up Outlook Web Access, did all\nthat certificates, we did all that.\n\n1122\n00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:14,040\nShowed them how to do everything,\nand then I warned them,\n\n1123\n00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,685\nI specifically said, make sure you\npay attention to your TTL value here.\n\n1124\n00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:19,680\nWe're setting it to a year, by default.\n\n1125\n00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,920\nYou gotta know that in 11 and\na half months, you've gotta go out and\n\n1126\n00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:27,240\nrenew the certificate before it expires or\nif you don't, bad things happen.\n\n1127\n00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,470\nBad things means, you can't get email-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1128\n00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:30,670\n>> Because the certificate is no\n\n1129\n00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:32,310\nlonger valid,\nyou can't get into the directory,\n\n1130\n00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:34,800\nyou can't open up the web portal,\nno email.\n\n1131\n00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:40,240\nAnd so sure enough, a year later,\nI'm in California, speaking\n\n1132\n00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,660\nat a conference somewhere, I get a phone\ncall, it's like 6 o'clock in the morning,\n\n1133\n00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,380\neast coast time, I get a phone call\nlike three in the morning in California.\n\n1134\n00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:51,750\nI'm in San Francisco, wherever I was,\nI get a panic phone call.\n\n1135\n00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,340\nHey Adam, you remember us?\n\n1136\n00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,050\nFunny story,\n\n1137\n00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:57,820\nand they walked me through the idea that\nbasically they can't get an email and\n\n1138\n00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:01,460\nvery quickly, we narrowed down the fact\nthat it's got to be a certificate issue.\n\n1139\n00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,110\nAnd so it's a very quick fix,\ntook five minutes, say to explain\n\n1140\n00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:07,320\nwhat the problem was, they just had to\ngo back, issue another certificate.\n\n1141\n00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,870\nThis one had now expired, so\nthey had to basically issue a new one\n\n1142\n00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:12,050\nas opposed to simply\nrenewing the existing one.\n\n1143\n00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:14,250\nIssue a new one,\nimport it into the directory,\n\n1144\n00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:16,420\nattach it to the virtual directory,\nand you're up and running.\n\n1145\n00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:19,480\nAnd sure enough,\nfive minutes later, email was fine.\n\n1146\n00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,550\nSo TTL value's very, very important here.\n\n1147\n00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:24,815\nWanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n1148\n00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:27,230\nCan you bring our diagram back up?\n\n1149\n00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,320\nSo back to this original concept.\n\n1150\n00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,730\nThe end user talks to the RA.\n\n1151\n00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:34,610\nThe Registration Authority,\nis going to validate the user,\n\n1152\n00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:37,880\nhave a conversation with\nthe subordinate CA most likely.\n\n1153\n00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,250\nAnd so get in there and talk.\n\n1154\n00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,700\nGet the certificate issued\nultimately through the directory,\n\n1155\n00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,262\nthey're gonna be talking back and forth.\n\n1156\n00:58:43,262 --> 00:58:44,580\nThen through the certificate is issued,\n\n1157\n00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:48,770\nthe subordinate CA is gonna hand\nthat certificate out to the user or\n\n1158\n00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:50,940\nwhoever is gonna get it to the user,\nwherever they get it from.\n\n1159\n00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,940\nBut at the end of the day,\na certificate is issued.\n\n1160\n00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:57,190\nNow, a certificate issued, there will\nbe a copy that is going to be given to\n\n1161\n00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:02,200\nthe user, and will be implemented at the\nuser typically in the certificate cache.\n\n1162\n00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:07,130\nSo if it's a web certificate for instance,\nthen it will be in Internet Explorer or\n\n1163\n00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:09,370\nthe equivalent browser\nwhere it will cache.\n\n1164\n00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:13,840\nIf it is a certificate that deals with the\nuser identity or deals with the ability\n\n1165\n00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:18,750\nto be able to consume that identity\nin some way inside the directory.\n\n1166\n00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:21,310\nThat certificate will be\nbound to the user's profile,\n\n1167\n00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:25,210\nin fact bound to that user\nobject inside the LDAP provider.\n\n1168\n00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:28,940\nSo not all certificates will actually\nwind up in Internet Explorer or\n\n1169\n00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,340\nthe equivalent web browser in the cache.\n\n1170\n00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,380\nSome of them, indeed a fair number\nof them will actually live inside of\n\n1171\n00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:40,010\nthe LDAP directory provider associated\nwith that user in some form or another.\n\n1172\n00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:43,480\nSo the certificate actually allows us\nto understand the user as an individual\n\n1173\n00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:47,500\nobject with unique along with things\nlike digital signing for email.\n\n1174\n00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,730\nThose certificates are bound to\nthe user in the LDAP provider as well.\n\n1175\n00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:55,590\nThe certificate itself has\nthe form of X509 version 3.\n\n1176\n00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:59,090\nThis is the certificate\ntemplate type that we use.\n\n1177\n00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:03,750\nSo that certificate icon down\nthere would be an X.509v3.\n\n1178\n01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:07,340\nYou may find version two and maybe even\nversion one old templates laying around.\n\n1179\n01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:10,620\nBut the modern standard\ntoday is this version three.\n\n1180\n01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:11,890\nAnd then, we talked about the CRL,\n\n1181\n01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:16,720\nthe Certificate Revocation List,\nthis is gonna be the published list that\n\n1182\n01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,560\nbasically is going to show us all\nthe certificates that are no longer valid.\n\n1183\n01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,110\nIn the old days,\nthis used to be a manual process.\n\n1184\n01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:26,310\nYou would have to go out, you would\nhave actually get or download the CRL.\n\n1185\n01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:30,243\nYou can still do this by the way, but\nyou downloaded a CSV file basically,\n\n1186\n01:00:30,243 --> 01:00:33,557\ncommon separate value file,\nwith all the certificate data.\n\n1187\n01:00:33,557 --> 01:00:37,335\nAnd you would then have to manually parse\nor the application that was looking to\n\n1188\n01:00:37,335 --> 01:00:41,055\nvalidate, would have to parse that\ninformation to find that certificate and\n\n1189\n01:00:41,055 --> 01:00:44,780\nsee whether, it was on the hot list,\nin effect if it was good or bad.\n\n1190\n01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:48,720\nWe've modified that process in\nthe last several iterations of PKI and\n\n1191\n01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:53,610\nwe use now something in automated\nprotocol called the OS or OSCP rather,\n\n1192\n01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:58,180\nOnline Certificate Status Protocol.\n\n1193\n01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:04,270\nOCSP, Online Certificate Status Protocol,\nand what OCSP\n\n1194\n01:01:04,270 --> 01:01:09,140\ndoes is it modifies and therefore\nbasically, automates the CRL process.\n\n1195\n01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:13,630\nSo now we can automate the check on\na certificate and it's validation.\n\n1196\n01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:18,030\nSo if it's invalid, it's been compromised,\nit's been TTL down to zero, whatever it\n\n1197\n01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:21,880\nis, if it's on that certificate revocation\nlist, then we automatically will know,\n\n1198\n01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,090\nthe software will know\nthat it's no longer valid.\n\n1199\n01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:27,810\nIf you don't pay your monthly\nsubscription fees in a SASS model, for\n\n1200\n01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,510\na Cloud based service, for instance.\n\n1201\n01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:31,400\nYour certificates gets\nrevoked by the vendor.\n\n1202\n01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,410\nSo this is a very important automation\nprocess that we bring to the table\n\n1203\n01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:37,280\nusing OCSP today.\n\n1204\n01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,480\nAnd so\nthis is an overview of our PKI solution.\n\n1205\n01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,998\nSo I think at this point probably a good\npoint for us to take a small break?\n\n1206\n01:01:42,998 --> 01:01:43,578\n>> Sure.\n\n1207\n01:01:43,578 --> 01:01:47,670\n>> Come back, we can wrap up and\nresummarize that in our next episode.\n\n1208\n01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:50,940\nSo please come back and join us for that\nand then we'll continue talking about some\n\n1209\n01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:53,880\nadditional stuff with cryptography\n>> Stay tuned.\n\n1210\n01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,107\n>> See you soon.\n>> We'll be back in just a few.\n\n1211\n01:01:55,107 --> 01:02:01,054\n[MUSIC]\n\n1212\n01:02:01,054 --> 01:02:04,440\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back every body.\n\n1213\n01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:07,120\nSo at the end of the last segment\nwe were talking about PKI and Adam,\n\n1214\n01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,530\nyou're gonna recap for\nus before we move on.\n\n1215\n01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:11,350\nIt is an important topic, right?\n\n1216\n01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:13,240\n>> I am.\nPKI you should trust everybody.\n\n1217\n01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,218\nWe're done.\n>> Everybody done.\n\n1218\n01:02:14,218 --> 01:02:14,772\nThat's it.\n\n1219\n01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:16,442\n>> [LAUGH] No we are gonna do a recap.\n\n1220\n01:02:16,442 --> 01:02:19,384\nWe're gonna run back through everything,\nand just kinda summarize all the stuff we\n\n1221\n01:02:19,384 --> 01:02:21,800\ntalked about, spend some time in\nthe diagram and looking at things.\n\n1222\n01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,103\nBut now, we want to run through\nthe notes we made for you and\n\n1223\n01:02:24,103 --> 01:02:26,032\njust make sure that\neverything comes together.\n\n1224\n01:02:26,032 --> 01:02:30,142\nSo we had spoken about PKI as being able\nto establish this level of trust within\n\n1225\n01:02:30,142 --> 01:02:33,190\nan enterprise web of trust\nas we often refer to it.\n\n1226\n01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,460\nRemember, the standard\nfour digital certificates,\n\n1227\n01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,570\nthe templates that you often\nuse in the root CAs or\n\n1228\n01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:44,080\nthe subordinate CAs to issue certificates\nare gonna be x.509 v3 or version three.\n\n1229\n01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:47,010\nThis is the current standard,\nyou may see older version two or\n\n1230\n01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:50,980\nversion one certificates out there, but\nversion three is the current standard.\n\n1231\n01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:55,020\nAnd we have a picture of what goes on\ninside of a certificate that we want to\n\n1232\n01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:58,180\nshare with you,\nthe header information about how CA,\n\n1233\n01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:01,090\nor certificates are set up and\nwhat they actually look like?\n\n1234\n01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:04,490\nSo we just want to quickly show that to\nyou, so Don's gonna bring that up for\n\n1235\n01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:06,480\nus here, and\njust kinda zoom us in a little bit.\n\n1236\n01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,710\nAnd so what we see here is when\nwe look at a typical certificate,\n\n1237\n01:03:11,710 --> 01:03:15,440\nwe see that there are different items\nthat are noted within the header field or\n\n1238\n01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,970\nthe structure of the certificate.\n\n1239\n01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:19,764\nAnd so we start at the top,\nwe can see version,\n\n1240\n01:03:19,764 --> 01:03:24,294\nso that would be where we would see\nthe X509 v3 or whatever that will be.\n\n1241\n01:03:24,294 --> 01:03:27,870\nThe certificate serial number, so there's\na unique identifier associated with\n\n1242\n01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,980\nthe serial number for each certificate.\n\n1243\n01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:33,110\nThe certificate algorithm identifier\nthat tells us basically what algorithms\n\n1244\n01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:35,600\nare being used, to do the digital signing.\n\n1245\n01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,780\nAnd the certificate issuer so\nwhoever is the issuer,\n\n1246\n01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:43,360\nMicrosoft, Verisign,\nwhoever it may be, issuer there,\n\n1247\n01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:47,030\nthe actual issuer supposed to just\nthe certificate issuer signature.\n\n1248\n01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:50,250\nSo company name, signature up top,\ncompany name down below.\n\n1249\n01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:53,040\nValidity period,\nthat's the TTL that we spoke about.\n\n1250\n01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:54,869\nHow long is the certificate good for?\n\n1251\n01:03:54,869 --> 01:03:58,260\nWhat is the subject and\nthen what is the subject PKI information?\n\n1252\n01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:02,240\nThat's the PK value, the Public Key Value\nof the algorithm- Identifier.\n\n1253\n01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,984\nSo the subject there\nwould be something like,\n\n1254\n01:04:05,984 --> 01:04:09,640\nwe are using it for\ndigitally signing email.\n\n1255\n01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:13,090\nOr it could be that we are going\nto use it for user identity,\n\n1256\n01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:16,780\nor any of those things,\nweb services of some kind.\n\n1257\n01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:20,670\nSo whatever the function and effect of\nthe certificate, will be is noted there.\n\n1258\n01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:23,330\nNotice there are some\noptional areas in blue.\n\n1259\n01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,000\nSo they may or may not appear.\n\n1260\n01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,780\nAnd then the CAs digital certificate,\n\n1261\n01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:30,970\nvalidating it's identity, creating\nthe trust, is listed there as well.\n\n1262\n01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:33,760\nSo we can find these certificates\ninside web browsers,\n\n1263\n01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,320\nI mentioned among other places,\n\n1264\n01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:39,460\nthat are also in the LDap directory,\nassociated with the object in question.\n\n1265\n01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,773\nBut in a typical web browser,\nyou would go in, and\n\n1266\n01:04:41,773 --> 01:04:44,806\nyou would be able to look inside\nof the internet options, right,\n\n1267\n01:04:44,806 --> 01:04:48,350\ndepending on the version of\nInternet Explorer that you're running.\n\n1268\n01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:53,390\nYou will go the certificate area, I can't\nsee because it's a little far away for me.\n\n1269\n01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:54,766\n>> It is a little on the microscopic\nside there [CROSSTALK]\n\n1270\n01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:55,626\n>> Oh!\n\n1271\n01:04:55,626 --> 01:04:56,820\nThere we go.\n\n1272\n01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:58,470\nNope, we will go back to content.\n\n1273\n01:04:58,470 --> 01:04:59,570\n>> Privacy, content.\n\n1274\n01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:03,010\nThere we go, and there area you would see\nunder, yeah, please don't clear SSL state.\n\n1275\n01:05:03,010 --> 01:05:05,125\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You will go to certificates there, and\n\n1276\n01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:08,955\nwe would see, in this case Don\nhas one certificate listed, but\n\n1277\n01:05:08,955 --> 01:05:11,235\nwe can look at different\ntabs there are for personal.\n\n1278\n01:05:11,235 --> 01:05:12,005\nHe's got one.\n\n1279\n01:05:12,005 --> 01:05:15,805\nIf we look at trusted roots certificate\nauthorities, there's a whole bunch there.\n\n1280\n01:05:15,805 --> 01:05:19,585\nSo if we just pull one up randomly,\ndoesn't really matter which one,\n\n1281\n01:05:19,585 --> 01:05:20,735\nany one of them will do.\n\n1282\n01:05:20,735 --> 01:05:22,055\nJust highlight one, double click on it.\n\n1283\n01:05:22,055 --> 01:05:23,855\n>> Take somebody I've\nnever heard of Sertum.\n\n1284\n01:05:23,855 --> 01:05:24,950\n>> Sertum.\n\n1285\n01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:25,910\nThat's a good name for a CA.\n\n1286\n01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:27,920\n>> Yeah, Will Sternum.\n\n1287\n01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,360\n>> And so\nwe see the certificate is intended for.\n\n1288\n01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,070\nWe can see a list of\nwhat it's intended to do.\n\n1289\n01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,200\nIssue two, who's an issue to, and by..\n\n1290\n01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,720\nWhat is the validity period, the TTL?\n\n1291\n01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:42,550\nI love where trusted CA's from these\nvendors are good for 20 something years.\n\n1292\n01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:43,330\nThat's great.\n\n1293\n01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:47,080\nSo nobody's ever,\never gonna compromise that certificate.\n\n1294\n01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,790\nAnd when we look at details.\n\n1295\n01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:52,150\nWhat we will see on the details tab, is\nthis is where all of this information we\n\n1296\n01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:55,290\nwere just talking about,\nin the header in effect is going to be.\n\n1297\n01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:55,950\nThe version,\n\n1298\n01:05:55,950 --> 01:06:00,702\nthe serial number, we're seeing sha 1\nthere as an RSA signature algorithm.\n\n1299\n01:06:00,702 --> 01:06:03,015\nSo all that stuff is listed here, and\n\n1300\n01:06:03,015 --> 01:06:06,825\nthat's where we actually see\nall this information, right.\n\n1301\n01:06:06,825 --> 01:06:10,065\nI notice it's got a 2048 bit RSA\nkey associated with it, right.\n\n1302\n01:06:10,065 --> 01:06:13,125\nSo it's got a pretty secure key.\n\n1303\n01:06:13,125 --> 01:06:17,040\nSo maybe I was being fialcious,\nand really fiscicious when I said\n\n1304\n01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:20,860\nnobody will compromise it in 25 years,\ncuz it's quite possible they won't.\n\n1305\n01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:24,060\nAnd then the certification\npath on the last tab there.\n\n1306\n01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,000\nYou will see if we go up to the last tab,\n\n1307\n01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,660\nthat is going to be where we are going\nto see the certificate path.\n\n1308\n01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,200\nIt goes up.\nThis is a root CA, so\n\n1309\n01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,200\nthere's only one item on the path.\n\n1310\n01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,680\nIf we were subordinate CA,\nwe would see the root above it, and\n\n1311\n01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,450\nsee the hierarchical path\nworking its way back up.\n\n1312\n01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:41,545\nWe can see all the information about\na certificate, simply by looking.\n\n1313\n01:06:41,545 --> 01:06:43,670\nNow if you happen to be using Windows, and\n\n1314\n01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:47,990\nyou set up your own CA, you can get your\ncertificates automatically issued and\n\n1315\n01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:52,050\nsigned, and look at the certificate\nmanagement capabilities, inside Windows.\n\n1316\n01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:55,950\nBy using a Windows M-M-C in\nMicrosoft management console,\n\n1317\n01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:58,420\nadding in the certificate\nmanagement information.\n\n1318\n01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:02,640\nThere is a little snap in for it, so\nyou can see the local certificate store,\n\n1319\n01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:05,510\nyou can also see the web\nbased certificate store,\n\n1320\n01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:08,760\nthat's in the server by using\nthat management console.\n\n1321\n01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,590\nAnd if this is a Lennox solution,\nor you're doing PKI,\n\n1322\n01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:15,330\nyou have management tools and capabilities\nthere for certificates as well.\n\n1323\n01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:19,840\nAnd so we could simply just\ndo the ad in real quick, and\n\n1324\n01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:22,040\nfind the certificate's add-in there.\n\n1325\n01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:25,660\nThat will give us, if we just\nfocus locally on the user account,\n\n1326\n01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:28,160\nthe ability to manage our\nlocal certificate store.\n\n1327\n01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,330\nAnd so, Don can open that up and\nwe see all of the certificates there.\n\n1328\n01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:36,270\nJust like we did in Internet Explorer,\nthis is just the Windows Management Tool,\n\n1329\n01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:39,390\nthat shows us more certificates\nout beyond just the ones in IE.\n\n1330\n01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:42,470\nWe could see the personal certificates for\ntoken signing,\n\n1331\n01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:46,730\nso you know used with the tokens he's\ngoing to generate, things like that.\n\n1332\n01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:48,090\nAnd then we have trusted route CAs,\n\n1333\n01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:50,710\nyou know we have all sorts of additional\ncertificates listed are there,\n\n1334\n01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:52,480\nthese are the same ones that\ncome out of the web browser.\n\n1335\n01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,710\nRight, so this is how we actually\ninteract with certificates, and\n\n1336\n01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:56,540\nwe can see them there.\n\n1337\n01:07:56,540 --> 01:08:00,230\nWe got some GoDaddy certificates\ndown there as well, and\n\n1338\n01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:03,452\nsome other certificates from various\nplaces, and try to support that.\n\n1339\n01:08:03,452 --> 01:08:04,740\n>> You get your discount SSL.\n\n1340\n01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:06,900\n>> So you could see all those there.\n\n1341\n01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,450\nSo this is how we would actually\nmanage certificates in a Windows\n\n1342\n01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:10,480\nbased environment.\n\n1343\n01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,330\nCreate the MMC, and\nsimply throw the snap in there.\n\n1344\n01:08:12,330 --> 01:08:16,570\nThe certificate services are available in\nWindows, so they are going to be added in.\n\n1345\n01:08:16,570 --> 01:08:19,000\nThey are rolled in\nthe feature that you added.\n\n1346\n01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,290\nYou do not build them as part of\nsimply building the directory.\n\n1347\n01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:23,460\nThe way we do, for instance,\n\n1348\n01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:26,990\nwith Curbrose as we mentioned\nin our Curbrose conversation,\n\n1349\n01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:31,970\nthat Curbrose is natively part of the\ndirectory setup when you setup a domain.\n\n1350\n01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:34,570\nCertificates have to be added\nin as a functional item.\n\n1351\n01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:36,410\nSo just be aware of that as well.\n\n1352\n01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:37,440\nSame thing in Linux, by the way.\n\n1353\n01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:40,070\nYou have to add the certificate\nservices to PKI infrastructure.\n\n1354\n01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:41,560\nIt's not natively there.\n\n1355\n01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:43,810\nAlthough you may have the modules\ncompiled to support it.\n\n1356\n01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:45,870\nYou have to actually install and\ninstantiate and\n\n1357\n01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:48,480\nconfigure it, in order for it to work.\n\n1358\n01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,130\nAlright, very good.\n\n1359\n01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:50,190\nWe've seen the overview there.\n\n1360\n01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:52,720\nLet's just go back, and\njust finish up with our notes,\n\n1361\n01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:56,790\nand make sure that we capture\nall this additional material.\n\n1362\n01:08:56,790 --> 01:09:00,580\nPKI provides authentication,\nconfidentiality, non repudiation,\n\n1363\n01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:04,240\nas well as integrity for any and\nall messages that are exchanged.\n\n1364\n01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:05,750\nIt is gonna be a hybrid solution.\n\n1365\n01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:08,500\nIt uses both symmetric and\nasymmetric algorithms.\n\n1366\n01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:10,490\nWe talked about the structure\nof a certificate.\n\n1367\n01:09:10,490 --> 01:09:15,310\nWe mentioned the idea of OCSP,\nthe online certificate status protocol.\n\n1368\n01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:17,230\nWe also mentioned just\nthe building blocks.\n\n1369\n01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:21,960\nWe have the CAs, the root CA, whether\nit is a standalone, or an enterprise,\n\n1370\n01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:26,490\nis really a function of whether it is\nattached to a domain, or it is on its own.\n\n1371\n01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:30,340\nSo the building blocks will be as follows.\n\n1372\n01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,580\nWe have certificate authorities.\n\n1373\n01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,710\nAnd these are two types.\n\n1374\n01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:39,200\nThey can either be root CA, and\n\n1375\n01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,500\nthe root CA can be a,\nright, or subordinate CA.\n\n1376\n01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,620\nSo under root we have enterprise and\nstandalone.\n\n1377\n01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:49,250\nEnterprise means it's associated\nwith a directory, an LDAP directory,\n\n1378\n01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,702\na standalone it's outside\nof the LDAP directory.\n\n1379\n01:09:51,702 --> 01:09:58,670\n[COUGH] And then standalones.\n\n1380\n01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:00,360\nThe chief stands alone, right?\n\n1381\n01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,010\n>> There we go.\n>> At the end of a fairy tale.\n\n1382\n01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:06,170\nAnd then subordinate CA is gonna be\na child to the root, in effect, right?\n\n1383\n01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:09,330\nIt's gonna be below,\nin the path of trust, from the root,\n\n1384\n01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:12,190\nwhether it's an enterprise or\na standalone, it doesn't really matter.\n\n1385\n01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:14,690\nAnd then we have a registration authority.\n\n1386\n01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:16,330\nThe registration authority, or\n\n1387\n01:10:16,330 --> 01:10:20,140\nwhat's called the RA, remember handles\nthe inbound request from the user.\n\n1388\n01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:23,340\nValidates all the stuff\nnecessary before the CA\n\n1389\n01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:25,698\nis able to issue\nthe certificate to the user.\n\n1390\n01:10:25,698 --> 01:10:28,510\nSo the RA doesn't actually\nissue certificates.\n\n1391\n01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:32,600\nJust basically brokers the initial upfront\n,who are you, and validation conversation,\n\n1392\n01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,530\nright, and then ultimately gives\nthe certificate authority,\n\n1393\n01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:39,170\nthe thumbs up to be able to issue\nthat certificate back to the user.\n\n1394\n01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:44,960\nAs we had discussed we have the CRL,\nI'll give you a second to catch up,\n\n1395\n01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,920\nI know your buffer is pretty quick, but\nwe still don't want to miss anything.\n\n1396\n01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,130\nThe certificate revocation list.\n\n1397\n01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:56,490\nAnd that will be, simply the,\nused to be the manual list.\n\n1398\n01:10:56,490 --> 01:11:00,460\nThese days it is going to be tied to or\npaired with the OCSP,\n\n1399\n01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:05,950\nthe online certificate status protocol,\nwhich automates the use of the CRL.\n\n1400\n01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:08,680\nProbably want to use this,\nmove the CRL out from under the RA,\n\n1401\n01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:09,900\nbecause it is a separate entity.\n\n1402\n01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:10,970\n>> Oh, yeah.\n>> Because it's not part of the RA.\n\n1403\n01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:13,560\nJust want to make sure that people\nknow that it's a separate function.\n\n1404\n01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,130\nThat's right, exactly.\n\n1405\n01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,420\nPeople know that it's not actually\nconsidered part of the RA.\n\n1406\n01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:19,720\nSo we have that, and\nthen all of this together,\n\n1407\n01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:23,380\nallows us to create certificate\ninfrastructure, PKI infrastructure,\n\n1408\n01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:28,270\npush it down to various users, and we\nwill just see multiples of these, right?\n\n1409\n01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:29,990\nWe may have multiple RAs, and\n\n1410\n01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:34,570\nlarge Enterprise level implementations\nmay have multiple subordinate CAs.\n\n1411\n01:11:34,570 --> 01:11:36,100\nHere's your subordinate CA.\n\n1412\n01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:39,620\nA path maybe two or three layers deep,\nspread out geographically,\n\n1413\n01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,550\nif we have very large enterprises.\n\n1414\n01:11:41,550 --> 01:11:45,059\nAnd we may have individual,\nseparate routes for various geodes.\n\n1415\n01:11:45,059 --> 01:11:48,964\nSo, in a large global organization,\nNorth America may have it's own route\n\n1416\n01:11:48,964 --> 01:11:51,894\nCA separate from Latin America,\nseparate from Europe,\n\n1417\n01:11:51,894 --> 01:11:55,495\neven though they're apart of the same\nOver arching infrastructure,\n\n1418\n01:11:55,495 --> 01:11:59,097\noverall enterprise, we may handle\nthose certificates separately so\n\n1419\n01:11:59,097 --> 01:12:02,393\nthat waywe can effectively can\nsegment our security profile and\n\n1420\n01:12:02,393 --> 01:12:05,135\nkeep track of our certificates\nbased on geography.\n\n1421\n01:12:05,135 --> 01:12:07,220\nIt's a lot of ways to do this.\n\n1422\n01:12:07,220 --> 01:12:10,942\nIt really just depends on how we are\nlooking from a best practice perspective\n\n1423\n01:12:10,942 --> 01:12:12,463\nto manage that dividing line.\n\n1424\n01:12:12,463 --> 01:12:16,596\nWhere do we kind of call the line on who\ngets to issue certificates and how broad\n\n1425\n01:12:16,596 --> 01:12:21,350\nthat certificates issuance is, so these\nare the building blocks of the PKI System.\n\n1426\n01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:25,045\nWould be very important for you to be\naware of them, to understand them, to kind\n\n1427\n01:12:25,045 --> 01:12:28,924\nof put them in context and make sure that\nwe understand how they function together.\n\n1428\n01:12:28,924 --> 01:12:31,885\nThe next step in our process\nin terms of looking at PKI and\n\n1429\n01:12:31,885 --> 01:12:36,484\ndiscussing digital identity is really then\nto discuss now that we've talked about all\n\n1430\n01:12:36,484 --> 01:12:40,290\nof this stuff key management and\nwhat does key management do for us?\n\n1431\n01:12:40,290 --> 01:12:44,470\nWhat are the responsibilities that key\nmanagement really brings to the table and\n\n1432\n01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:48,232\nthis is broader, this is not just PKI,\nnot just digital certificates.\n\n1433\n01:12:48,232 --> 01:12:53,940\nThis is any kind of key, symmetric,\nprivate-only, asymmetric public-private.\n\n1434\n01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:58,710\nThis is really best practices around the\nconcept of key management, holistically.\n\n1435\n01:12:58,710 --> 01:13:00,880\nIn other words, how do we secure our keys?\n\n1436\n01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,930\nHow do we keep them secure?\n\n1437\n01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:04,920\nWhat are some of the best\npractices associated with this?\n\n1438\n01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,100\nAnd so, we thought we'd list\nout some things for you.\n\n1439\n01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:12,720\nThe ideas here would be things such as,\nby the way not in any particular order,\n\n1440\n01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:15,380\nbut really important items\nwe want to consider.\n\n1441\n01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:18,630\nKey length, as we've talked about\nalready should be long enough to\n\n1442\n01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:21,100\nprovide the necessary protection\nthat we're looking for.\n\n1443\n01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:28,173\nA 128 bit key for example versus\na 2,048 bit key versus the 4,096 bit\n\n1444\n01:13:28,173 --> 01:13:33,435\nkey is really different from a protection\nperspective in terms of the kind\n\n1445\n01:13:33,435 --> 01:13:37,847\nof protection that those keys based on\ntheir bit strength are going to offer us.\n\n1446\n01:13:37,847 --> 01:13:42,712\nA 128-bit key, depending on the algorithm\nthat is used to create the key,\n\n1447\n01:13:42,712 --> 01:13:44,712\ncould be compromised today, or\n\n1448\n01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:47,422\nat least it's possible that it\ncould be compromised today.\n\n1449\n01:13:47,422 --> 01:13:51,891\nWhereas a 2,048-bit key, and\ncertainly a 4,096-bit key it is,\n\n1450\n01:13:51,891 --> 01:13:54,918\nwith today's current technology,\nimpossible for\n\n1451\n01:13:54,918 --> 01:13:58,830\nus to compromise those keys if\nthe system is set up correctly.\n\n1452\n01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:02,570\nSimply by brute-forcing our way through\nand trying to find the match and\n\n1453\n01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:06,220\ndecode the key,\nit would be computationally infeasible,\n\n1454\n01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:09,800\nas we have said, for us to do that,\ngiven the current technology that exists.\n\n1455\n01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:14,680\nThat's not to say that in 20, 30, 40, 50,\n100 or more years, as computing power\n\n1456\n01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:19,950\ncontinues to evolve, that we won't be\nable to do that at some point in time.\n\n1457\n01:14:19,950 --> 01:14:21,450\nBut of course, the key strength and\n\n1458\n01:14:21,450 --> 01:14:25,270\nthe algorithms will hopefully keep up with\nthat and continue to get larger, right?\n\n1459\n01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:29,080\nAt some point we'll just pop the data into\nthe computer access port on our head.\n\n1460\n01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:31,960\nAnd we'll just do\nthe decryption in real time.\n\n1461\n01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,870\nAnd then it will just spit\nright out the front there\n\n1462\n01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:35,430\non a roll of tape or something.\n\n1463\n01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:37,155\nLike Johnny Mnemonic, remember that movie?\n\n1464\n01:14:37,155 --> 01:14:38,285\n[LAUGH] Keanu Reeves?\n\n1465\n01:14:38,285 --> 01:14:39,569\n[CROSSTALK] Johnny Mnemonic\nwhere he would.\n\n1466\n01:14:39,569 --> 01:14:40,650\n>> Keanu Reeves.\n\n1467\n01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:41,810\n>> He was basically the carrier.\n\n1468\n01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:47,340\nSo in the movie, 80s movie and\nconsider that in the context it's offered,\n\n1469\n01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,426\nwas not a cinemagraphic\nmasterpiece by an means.\n\n1470\n01:14:49,426 --> 01:14:50,428\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But it was one of\n\n1471\n01:14:50,428 --> 01:14:54,090\nthe earlier movies he did, but\nthe idea was actually pretty cool.\n\n1472\n01:14:54,090 --> 01:14:56,840\nAnd it carries forward to today if\nyou think about the logic of this.\n\n1473\n01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,720\nBecause we're seeing\nthis with robots today.\n\n1474\n01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:02,270\nWhere he's a human carrier and\nthe idea is he carries information.\n\n1475\n01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:06,060\nHe's kind of like The Transporter but he's\ncarrying a bunch of information in his\n\n1476\n01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:08,840\nhead, instead of driving a cool car and\nkilling a bunch of people.\n\n1477\n01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:13,390\nAnd so he uploads memory, extra memory\ninto his head to be able to keep\n\n1478\n01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:16,340\nall this information in there, and\nthen it's a race to see whether or\n\n1479\n01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:19,400\nnot he can get the information out\nbefore all this bad stuff happens.\n\n1480\n01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:23,010\nSo the idea of being able to just crank\nthrough these computations is really not\n\n1481\n01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:24,780\nso necessarily farfetched.\n\n1482\n01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:25,600\n>> And he had to jam so\n\n1483\n01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,835\nmuch information in there that it kind\nof bumped out his acting training.\n\n1484\n01:15:28,835 --> 01:15:31,270\n>> [LAUGH] That might have\nbeen where it happened.\n\n1485\n01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:33,950\nThat's where we saw the transformation.\n\n1486\n01:15:35,025 --> 01:15:37,420\n[LAUGH] Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\nand it never changed.\n\n1487\n01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:38,330\n>> There we go.\n\n1488\n01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:39,240\n>> All right, another good movie.\n\n1489\n01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,634\nThat one actually was a pretty good movie.\n\n1490\n01:15:40,634 --> 01:15:42,324\n[LAUGH] Bill and\nTed's Excellent Adventure.\n\n1491\n01:15:42,324 --> 01:15:44,210\nAll right so\nif we go back here what we see is right,\n\n1492\n01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:48,150\nwe have to obviously have the right length\nof the key long enough to create security.\n\n1493\n01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:50,460\nKeys should be stored and\ntransmitted securely.\n\n1494\n01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,960\nCan't say enough about that right.\n\n1495\n01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,490\nIf you share your key with somebody,\n\n1496\n01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:56,150\ngive it to somebody,\nchances are good, we always\n\n1497\n01:15:56,150 --> 01:16:00,120\nexponentially understand that as more\npeople get their hands on things, more\n\n1498\n01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:02,930\nlikely that somebody will find out about\nit that isn't supposed to know about it.\n\n1499\n01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:04,350\nSo understand that.\n\n1500\n01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:07,250\nKeys should be random and\nthe algorithm that is used should\n\n1501\n01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:09,660\nreally use the full keyspace\nto generate the keys.\n\n1502\n01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:12,780\nWe talked about the keyspaces\nbeing indicator of strength.\n\n1503\n01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:13,790\nIf it's a largekey space,\n\n1504\n01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:16,980\nit's very unlikely we're going to have\ncollisions and as a result, hopefully\n\n1505\n01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:21,640\nInformation stays secure over the lifetime\nof that cryptosystem being used.\n\n1506\n01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,970\nSo we want to make sure\nwe use the full keyspace.\n\n1507\n01:16:23,970 --> 01:16:26,950\nThis gets into the architecture\nof the cryptosystem and\n\n1508\n01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:28,590\nhow the algorithms are implemented.\n\n1509\n01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:32,450\nIf we implement them incorrectly, if we\nuse algorithms that are not fully vetted,\n\n1510\n01:16:32,450 --> 01:16:34,590\nthan we could potentially\nhave problems with this.\n\n1511\n01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,755\nKey lifetime should correspond\nto sensitivity of data.\n\n1512\n01:16:36,755 --> 01:16:40,500\nWe talked about TTLs and the fact that\nyou don't want to use keys forever.\n\n1513\n01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,913\nSo keys should be used based on\nthe sensitivity of the data.\n\n1514\n01:16:42,913 --> 01:16:47,345\nThe more sensitive the data, ultimately\nif you think about the logic of this,\n\n1515\n01:16:47,345 --> 01:16:49,235\nthe less that key should be used.\n\n1516\n01:16:49,235 --> 01:16:52,765\nWe should use it then, not use it\nvery often to keep that data secure.\n\n1517\n01:16:52,765 --> 01:16:55,665\nThe more the key is used, the shorter the\nlife, if you think about the inverse of\n\n1518\n01:16:55,665 --> 01:16:58,240\nwhat we've just said It's basically\nthe mirror opposite there.\n\n1519\n01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,610\nKeys should be escrowed.\n\n1520\n01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:03,950\nEscrowing is this idea of keeping keys, a\ncopy of the keys, almost like a master or\n\n1521\n01:17:03,950 --> 01:17:08,330\na skeleton key, secure, off-site,\nsomewhere else in digital storage,\n\n1522\n01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:12,400\navailable for recovery given the proper\nsecurity credentials being provided and\n\n1523\n01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,230\nproper security procedures being followed.\n\n1524\n01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:18,140\nSo this is basically a fail safe solution,\nwhere we will have a copy of the key,\n\n1525\n01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,280\na master key, whatever it may be,\n\n1526\n01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:23,690\nthat can be used to open up encrypted\nmessages if the keys have been lost.\n\n1527\n01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,180\nVery important.\n\n1528\n01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:28,130\nKeys should be destroyed at the end of a\nlife cycle, so we want to get rid of keys,\n\n1529\n01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:29,530\nand no longer use them.\n\n1530\n01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:31,550\nAll of these things are part of,\nor part and\n\n1531\n01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:35,320\nparcel of the best practices\nassociated with key management.\n\n1532\n01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:39,640\nSo as a CISSP looking to not only certify,\npass the exam,\n\n1533\n01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,900\nso that's obviously a very\nimportant milestone.\n\n1534\n01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:46,470\nBut out beyond that becoming\na certified CISSP as a practitioner and\n\n1535\n01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:48,640\ncarrying that credential\ninto the business.\n\n1536\n01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,010\nYou have to understand these things and\n\n1537\n01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:54,350\nhave to be the champion of key management\nin the business if that's your role.\n\n1538\n01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:58,068\nBecause these are some of\nthe responsibilities that CISSPs oversee.\n\n1539\n01:17:58,068 --> 01:18:01,570\nAnd things in best practices and thought\nprocesses, they bring to the table around\n\n1540\n01:18:01,570 --> 01:18:05,120\narchitecture of these PKI and\ncrypto systems overall.\n\n1541\n01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:05,936\nVery, very important.\n\n1542\n01:18:05,936 --> 01:18:08,970\nAll right, so out beyond that\n\n1543\n01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:12,040\nwe move down to this idea of what's\ncalled a trusted platform module.\n\n1544\n01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,470\nIt's called a TPM.\n\n1545\n01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:17,320\nI actually have a TPM chip\nembedded in my Windows 8 Slate.\n\n1546\n01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:19,500\nSo my Windows 8 device has a TPM in it.\n\n1547\n01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:23,819\nAnd most modern high end\ncomputing systems will have them.\n\n1548\n01:18:23,819 --> 01:18:25,691\nNot all because it is an expensive add on.\n\n1549\n01:18:25,691 --> 01:18:29,262\nIt's not something you'll find in\nevery system but high end laptops,\n\n1550\n01:18:29,262 --> 01:18:32,308\nhigh end devices like tablets\nwill tend to have TPMs in them.\n\n1551\n01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:35,857\nCertainly security systems will have TPMs\nin them so you'll to look for that or\n\n1552\n01:18:35,857 --> 01:18:38,624\nhave ask the manufacturer\nwhether it's part of the system.\n\n1553\n01:18:38,624 --> 01:18:43,780\nIt will not be in low end laptops, so that\n$300 best buy special, running that mobile\n\n1554\n01:18:43,780 --> 01:18:48,455\nchip set is not going to have a TPM in it\nbut certainly typically anything else with\n\n1555\n01:18:48,455 --> 01:18:53,131\na factor of zeroes on the end of it but\nyou're paying several thousand dollars for\n\n1556\n01:18:53,131 --> 01:18:57,150\na device you're probably gonna\nmost likely end up with a TPM.\n\n1557\n01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:59,483\nSo what is a TPM,\na trusted platform module.\n\n1558\n01:18:59,483 --> 01:19:01,169\nThis is a dedicated microchip so\n\n1559\n01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:04,916\nit's a separate chip in the motherboard\nthat's dedicated to carrying\n\n1560\n01:19:04,916 --> 01:19:08,925\nout the security functions that we tend\nto have to execute in these systems.\n\n1561\n01:19:08,925 --> 01:19:12,815\nSo things like storage and processing\nas we say there, of asymmetric and\n\n1562\n01:19:12,815 --> 01:19:16,899\nsymmetric keys, hashing,\ndigital signatures, digital certificates,\n\n1563\n01:19:16,899 --> 01:19:20,110\nall that stuff is gonna be stored and\nor executed in the TPM.\n\n1564\n01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:23,620\nAnd the idea of the TPM is creating\nthis trusted architecture and\n\n1565\n01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:26,675\nthis is part of it where we\nhave what's known as the TCB,\n\n1566\n01:19:26,675 --> 01:19:30,848\nthe trusted computing base, which is\nthis trusted architecture overall.\n\n1567\n01:19:30,848 --> 01:19:33,879\nThe infrastructure of the system,\neverything is vetted,\n\n1568\n01:19:33,879 --> 01:19:36,847\ntested, structured in such\na way that it acts securely and\n\n1569\n01:19:36,847 --> 01:19:40,015\ncontributes to the overall\nsecurity of the platform.\n\n1570\n01:19:40,015 --> 01:19:44,145\nAnd so, the TPM by itself is one of those\nsecurity elements in the architecture,\n\n1571\n01:19:44,145 --> 01:19:47,486\nthat allows us effectively to\ncreate like a secure key vault, and\n\n1572\n01:19:47,486 --> 01:19:49,149\nsecurely lock those keys away.\n\n1573\n01:19:49,149 --> 01:19:52,609\nIn a place where they cannot be tampered\nwith, and cannot be gotten at or\n\n1574\n01:19:52,609 --> 01:19:54,469\ncomprised easily inside the system.\n\n1575\n01:19:54,469 --> 01:19:57,860\nYou may break open the computer,\nliterally.\n\n1576\n01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:01,260\nAnd rip the TPM out of the motherboard,\nbut it's not good for anything.\n\n1577\n01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:04,100\nBecause, in effect,\nyou can't extract the keys out of the TPM.\n\n1578\n01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,270\nSo just understand that.\n\n1579\n01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:09,570\nIt's really considered to be secure, and\nas a result it's part of an overarching,\n\n1580\n01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:12,970\nlarger TCB, or\ntrust the computing based architecture.\n\n1581\n01:20:12,970 --> 01:20:16,780\n>> That's really why you can't, I get this\nquestion from time to time, which is that\n\n1582\n01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:20,860\n\"my computer doesn't have a TPM, can I\nadd one?\" and answer is, no, you can't.\n\n1583\n01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:25,250\nThat's because the TPM Is really useless\nby itself, it's part of a system.\n\n1584\n01:20:25,250 --> 01:20:29,320\nThe manufacturer has to design and\nconfigure that to work\n\n1585\n01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:32,830\nwith your motherboard with the processing\nhardware to ensure that security.\n\n1586\n01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:36,550\nYou just can't ensure it if you're\nadding it on, sticking a PCI card in or\n\n1587\n01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:37,300\nsomething like that.\n\n1588\n01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,570\n>> Yeah, so don't go to Tiger and try to\nbuy a TPM is what we would suggest, or\n\n1589\n01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,350\nBest Buy or anywhere like that.\n\n1590\n01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:45,970\nRight, if you see one on New Egg or\nAmazon, good for you.\n\n1591\n01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:48,590\nBut if it's not attached to\na hardware device already,\n\n1592\n01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:52,170\ndon't try to buy somebody's used TPM\noff of Ebay is what we're saying.\n\n1593\n01:20:52,170 --> 01:20:53,880\nIt's not going to do you any good,\nto your point.\n\n1594\n01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:58,000\n>> And we talk about these a lot, if any\nof you guys jump over to the Windows 8\n\n1595\n01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,680\nshow and\nyou see the ones we do on BitLocker.\n\n1596\n01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,690\nRight yeah absolutely.\n\n1597\n01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:03,470\n>> Because like my laptop right here,\nI have a TPM, and so\n\n1598\n01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:07,420\nI can enable Bitlocker and I can store my\nencryption key right here in that TPM,\n\n1599\n01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,920\nright here in the laptop, works great.\n\n1600\n01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,220\nIf you don't have a TPM\nyou're not out of luck,\n\n1601\n01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:15,140\nyou can use a USB key or\nsomething like that.\n\n1602\n01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:16,600\nNow, you know, for everything.\n\n1603\n01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,820\nWindows can go for whatever.\n\n1604\n01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:22,200\nAnd it works but\nit's not the same level of security.\n\n1605\n01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:25,300\nYou know, your USB key can be duplicated,\na TPM can't.\n\n1606\n01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:27,410\nAnd so\n>> And you could lose your USB key.\n\n1607\n01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:28,170\n>> Well that's true too.\n\n1608\n01:21:28,170 --> 01:21:32,070\nIf you lose your TPM you've\nlost your whole laptop.\n\n1609\n01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:33,190\nSo there is that.\n\n1610\n01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:34,860\nYou know, pros and cons.\n\n1611\n01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:38,360\nAnother thing we're throwing out is\nthat there's multiple versions of TPM.\n\n1612\n01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:42,570\nLike, over the years it's kind of evolved\na bit, so just because you have a TPM\n\n1613\n01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:44,760\ndoesn't mean you'll be able to support\nall the various features out there.\n\n1614\n01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:47,690\nMicrosoft is big about this, where\nthey say, if you want to do BitLocker,\n\n1615\n01:21:47,690 --> 01:21:50,520\nyou have to have a TPM 2.0 chip.\n\n1616\n01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,300\nSo, ULAP has a TPM 1.1.\n\n1617\n01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,420\nWell, you're out of luck, you can't.\n\n1618\n01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:58,220\nSo you do end up having to pay to play,\nis that fair?\n\n1619\n01:21:58,220 --> 01:21:58,720\n>> Pay to play?\n\n1620\n01:21:58,720 --> 01:21:59,940\n>> That's not fair.\n\n1621\n01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:03,620\nWe call that planned\nobsolescence in the design area.\n\n1622\n01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:06,945\nRight, so you have a shelf life in effect,\nand now that Microsoft.\n\n1623\n01:22:06,945 --> 01:22:08,965\nUp to foray into the hardware business.\n\n1624\n01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:12,130\nWe might see more of that going\non later on down the road, right?\n\n1625\n01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:12,825\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Alright.\n\n1626\n01:22:12,825 --> 01:22:15,445\nDo you know do the services\nhave TPMs though?\n\n1627\n01:22:15,445 --> 01:22:16,125\nNo, they do not.\n\n1628\n01:22:16,125 --> 01:22:16,765\n>> They don't?\n\n1629\n01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:17,515\nOkay.\n>> No, they do not.\n\n1630\n01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:19,195\nNot the, not the RTs.\n\n1631\n01:22:19,195 --> 01:22:24,340\nThe pros, that's a good question, how do\nwe look at the latest version of 2.0 Pro?\n\n1632\n01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:28,910\nI don't know if they do, I don't think\nthe old ones do, but I think the new ones\n\n1633\n01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:33,530\nPro 2.0 may because you can run eight one,\neight one one and\n\n1634\n01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:36,875\nyou can run the full enterprise\n>> That would allow you do BitLocker,\n\n1635\n01:22:36,875 --> 01:22:38,030\nAdBlocker.\n\n1636\n01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:41,510\nSo I would assume that the Pro\n2.0 version definitely does.\n\n1637\n01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:42,910\nBut I know the RT's do not.\n\n1638\n01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:45,800\nRight?\nThe RT's do not.\n\n1639\n01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:46,470\nVery good.\nSo\n\n1640\n01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:49,380\nif we could go back to our notes there for\na moment.\n\n1641\n01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:51,570\nWanted to just continue thinking about and\n\n1642\n01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:55,910\ntalk about some of the other vocabulary\nassociated with this architecture, and\n\n1643\n01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:57,730\nsetting up trust, and\nthese kind of things.\n\n1644\n01:22:57,730 --> 01:23:02,470\nAnd so we have our Link Encryption versus\nEnd-to-end Encryption thought process.\n\n1645\n01:23:02,470 --> 01:23:04,270\nWe've mentioned some of these items.\n\n1646\n01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:08,050\nI know, for instance Link Encryption and\nLMSI was mentioned in our network\n\n1647\n01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:11,030\ndiscussion when we did networking and\ntelecommunications.\n\n1648\n01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:13,760\nWe talked a bit about this when we\ntalked about setting up incription\n\n1649\n01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:18,910\nwith things like IP sec or whatever we\nmay be using there to set up incription.\n\n1650\n01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:22,330\nWe'll talk about IP sec again\nhere as we continue our\n\n1651\n01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,610\ncryptography conversations\na little later on.\n\n1652\n01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:25,790\nBut link encryption,\n\n1653\n01:23:25,790 --> 01:23:30,970\nthe idea here we encrypt all the data\nlong that specific communication path.\n\n1654\n01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:34,220\nSo, you know, when we think of\nthings like a telephone line,\n\n1655\n01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:38,390\nyou pick up either end, you're talking\nthat data effectively was encrypted\n\n1656\n01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:41,040\nbetween the actual\ncommunication endpoints.\n\n1657\n01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,130\nA T Carrier like a T1, a T3,\n\n1658\n01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:46,650\nwhatever it would be, uses Link Encryption\nto be able to do that encryption.\n\n1659\n01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:51,080\nWhereas End-to-end Encryption does not\nencrypt any of the header information.\n\n1660\n01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:55,120\nSo things like addresses, headers,\nrouting and trailer, it's just basically\n\n1661\n01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:58,340\nencrypting the data but not encrypting\nall the header information around it.\n\n1662\n01:23:58,340 --> 01:23:59,100\nSo it's kind of interesting\n\n1663\n01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,510\nbecause you would almost think like\nthey should be reversed right?\n\n1664\n01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:05,270\nAnd almost should be like what link does,\nbecause it encrypts all the data\n\n1665\n01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:08,760\nalong a specific path, along with\nthe header and all that information.\n\n1666\n01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:12,070\nBut it's encrypting it on the link,\nit's the link endpoint sort of doing\n\n1667\n01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:16,390\nthe encryption, and whereas end to end\nis just doing the actual data itself,\n\n1668\n01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:18,130\nthe data packet in effect, but\n\n1669\n01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:21,610\nnot the header on the data packet if\nyou want to think of it that way.\n\n1670\n01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:23,010\nSo encryption in different layers,\n\n1671\n01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:26,020\nwhere do we see these encryption\nmechanisms taking place?\n\n1672\n01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,474\nThat'll be good just to mention these and\n\n1673\n01:24:27,474 --> 01:24:30,030\nyou'll put them into the LMSI\ncontext model for you.\n\n1674\n01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:33,410\nWe have that as a point of reference for a\nlot of things that we have been doing, so\n\n1675\n01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:37,420\nwe can see here that we have\nEnd-to-end Encryption is\n\n1676\n01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,860\nhappening at layer 7 at\nthe application layer.\n\n1677\n01:24:39,860 --> 01:24:43,770\nSSL our old friend secure sockets\nis going to be at layer four,\n\n1678\n01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:46,170\ntransport layer, We have PPTP,\n\n1679\n01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:49,430\npoint to point tunneling, that's going\nto be a layer two data link protocol.\n\n1680\n01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:52,430\nWe talked about that extensively\nin our networking conversations.\n\n1681\n01:24:52,430 --> 01:24:55,070\nAnd link encryption is seen\nas being both layer one and\n\n1682\n01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:58,350\nlayer two established in both\nthe physical and the data link layer.\n\n1683\n01:24:58,350 --> 01:25:00,311\nSince we want to make sure\nwe're referencing that and\n\n1684\n01:25:00,311 --> 01:25:01,410\nthinking about that as well.\n\n1685\n01:25:01,410 --> 01:25:06,930\nAnd we do have some other examples of just\nsome odds and ends, vocabulary terms that\n\n1686\n01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:10,630\nwe want to throw out and just make sure\nwe have, and that we are aware of there,\n\n1687\n01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:14,090\nwhich is that we have MIME,\nthe multipurpose internet mail extensions.\n\n1688\n01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:17,300\nSo this is used to basically set up and\nstructure Mail exchange.\n\n1689\n01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:20,910\nMost modern mail systems today\nuse SMTP as their protocol, but\n\n1690\n01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:24,440\nuse MIME as the architectural structure\naround how we send or receive mail.\n\n1691\n01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:27,810\nAnd SMIME, secure MIME,\nsimply is the encryption overlay and\n\n1692\n01:25:27,810 --> 01:25:29,290\ndigital signature overlay for mail.\n\n1693\n01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:32,900\nSo that's how we implement again\nfrom an architectural perspective.\n\n1694\n01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:37,580\nThe concept of multipurpose internet mail\nand sending it or receiving it securely.\n\n1695\n01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:42,340\nPretty good privacy PGP,\nis a cryptosystem that is going to be\n\n1696\n01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:46,810\na complete cryptosystem as we say they are\nusing can we just scroll up just a smidge.\n\n1697\n01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:48,630\nYeah, I suppose we could do that.\n\n1698\n01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:49,870\n>> << Thank you so much.\n\n1699\n01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:54,850\nSo pretty good privacy is just going to\nbe able to present to us a cryptosystem\n\n1700\n01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:58,240\ncreated by a guy named Phil Zimmermann\nmany, many years back.\n\n1701\n01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:00,340\nHad a nice little battle with the U.S.\n\n1702\n01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:05,140\ngovernment about the IP around his\nsystem and ultimately was taken over and\n\n1703\n01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,760\nnow is a public domain, or\nwas in the public domain.\n\n1704\n01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,700\nCause he put it out there in public domain\nrather than letting them take it, but\n\n1705\n01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:13,328\nultimately he then sold out so to speak.\n\n1706\n01:26:13,328 --> 01:26:14,320\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH\n\n1707\n01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:15,410\n>> It became a company and\n\n1708\n01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:19,030\nnow you can buy pgp if you want to\nuse it for an enterprise solution.\n\n1709\n01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:19,580\n>> Wow.\n\n1710\n01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,400\n>> But it's Symantec that bought it,\n>> Yeah.\n\n1711\n01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,830\nAnd the thing I always say is Symantec\nis where software goes to die.\n\n1712\n01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:29,090\nSo, right now you can buy it, but\neventually, some people kill it.\n\n1713\n01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:30,630\nYeah, somebody will kill it off.\n\n1714\n01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:33,370\nBut the idea was it seeing this\nas being a complete cryptosystem,\n\n1715\n01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:35,200\nwe use cryptography and all its forms,\n\n1716\n01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:38,820\nin the cryptosystem in a variety of\nways to protect email and files.\n\n1717\n01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:43,080\nHe has this idea of a key ring,\nwhere you keep your public keys available.\n\n1718\n01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:46,410\nYou can download them through key servers,\nyou get your own public key collection.\n\n1719\n01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:48,840\nPublic keys for\npeople you want to interact with.\n\n1720\n01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,170\nThen the private keys, so\nit's an asymmetric system, public/private.\n\n1721\n01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:56,130\nThe private key is kept by the originator,\nand then you're able to send or\n\n1722\n01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:59,137\nreceive files purely as a result of that,\nall right?\n\n1723\n01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:03,310\nAnd then the last one I think we just\nwant to quickly cover here will be\n\n1724\n01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:04,720\nquantum cryptography.\n\n1725\n01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:08,510\nSo this is the idea of using light\neffectively to create encrypting file\n\n1726\n01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:12,125\nsystems or systems that can encrypt files,\nand create secure solutions.\n\n1727\n01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:14,735\nKind of a cutting edge\ntechnology by today's standards.\n\n1728\n01:27:14,735 --> 01:27:18,245\nBeen around a few years, kind of very\ninteresting, off on the fringe for\n\n1729\n01:27:18,245 --> 01:27:22,155\nthe moment, we're not really seeing a lot\nof practical applications right now with\n\n1730\n01:27:22,155 --> 01:27:23,300\nquantum cryptography.\n\n1731\n01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:24,790\nBut we are hearing more and more about it.\n\n1732\n01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:28,970\nThere are rumors and rumblings of\nsystems being designed to do this and\n\n1733\n01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:32,510\nso the photons of light, which\nare the particles that make up light,\n\n1734\n01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:36,690\nare being pulverized to effectively create\na little miniature binary system, one and\n\n1735\n01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:40,890\nzero, on and off and depending on\nthe polarization the charge on the photon.\n\n1736\n01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:42,180\nIt's either on or off.\n\n1737\n01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:45,900\nWe're then able to arrange them in such\na way that we can do this at almost\n\n1738\n01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,460\ndown at the molecular level.\n\n1739\n01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:50,430\nIn the sense that these photons\nare incredibly small particles and\n\n1740\n01:27:50,430 --> 01:27:55,410\ncreate secure cryptosystems using light\nas opposed to using electrical pulses to\n\n1741\n01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:59,700\nrepresent data and or to ultimately\napply mathematics in cryptography.\n\n1742\n01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:01,250\nSo it's very interesting stuff.\n\n1743\n01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:05,620\nIf you think about, very Johnny Rocket,\nsuper science stuff, right?\n\n1744\n01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:09,630\nAnd I mean it literally is the cutting\nedge of science because you're hearing\n\n1745\n01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:12,550\na lot where somebody will come out\nGoogle just did this but they said they\n\n1746\n01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:16,020\nhad a computer that was just doing\nquantum mathematics and whatever.\n\n1747\n01:28:16,020 --> 01:28:19,170\nThey made a quantum computer And\nnow there's all sorts of debate over\n\n1748\n01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:21,130\nwhether or\nnot it's actually quantum or not.\n\n1749\n01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:23,820\nSo this is something we'll\ncontinue to see evolve.\n\n1750\n01:28:23,820 --> 01:28:28,065\nIt's extremely powerful just because of\nthe speed at which it can move the data.\n\n1751\n01:28:28,065 --> 01:28:30,887\n[CROSSTALK] It's really impressive.\n\n1752\n01:28:30,887 --> 01:28:34,057\n>> You'll figure out you wanted something\nbefore you even wanted something.\n\n1753\n01:28:34,057 --> 01:28:36,251\n[CROSSTALK] You'll get it before\nyou even realized you wanted it.\n\n1754\n01:28:36,251 --> 01:28:37,360\nIt'll just show up.\n\n1755\n01:28:37,360 --> 01:28:38,000\nThe instant.\n\n1756\n01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,250\n>> Very, very cool.\n\n1757\n01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:42,820\nI know we've got a laundry list\nof other terms to get to, and\n\n1758\n01:28:42,820 --> 01:28:45,290\nI know you want to get to\nthe IP sec process, but\n\n1759\n01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:49,060\nthis is probably a pretty good\nstopping point for us for part two.\n\n1760\n01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:51,688\nAnd here's where I set up our cliffhanger,\nright?\n\n1761\n01:28:51,688 --> 01:28:55,870\nWe're going to have to come back\nwith CISSP cryptography part\n\n1762\n01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:58,488\nthree to be able to dive into\nsome of the other things.\n\n1763\n01:28:58,488 --> 01:29:01,660\nThe IP sec process is really important so\nI want to make sure we don't just have to\n\n1764\n01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:04,900\nrush through it, that we spend\nthe appropriate amount of time on it.\n\n1765\n01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,086\nSo let's stop here.\n\n1766\n01:29:06,086 --> 01:29:08,730\nI do want to remind you guys that\nif you ever have any questions,\n\n1767\n01:29:08,730 --> 01:29:12,840\nlive during the show, you can go to\nitpro.tv/live, you'll see the video and\n\n1768\n01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,340\nright beneath it

--> 00:00:40,381\nI'll be your host today and\nwith me is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n4\n00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:41,270\nHow you doing today, Adam?\n\n5\n00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,300\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n6\n00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,550\nI'm doing great.\nHow about you?\n\n7\n00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,990\n>> Eh, you know better if we\ncould do these in the first take.\n\n8\n00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,550\nBut sometimes I guess, actually,\nyou guys won't even see that part.\n\n9\n00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,210\n>> You won't know.\n\n10\n00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,060\nWell, they know now.\n\n11\n00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,275\n>> I guess they know now.\n\n12\n00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:55,140\n[LAUGH] Little microphone issue but\nall is better.\n\n13\n00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,330\nSo yes, welcome again, this is going to\nbe Part 3 of our cryptography episodes\n\n14\n00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,080\nin our CISSP track and\nwe're going to dive into some,\n\n15\n00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,020\nyou tell us, where are we heading\nwith our cryptography on this one?\n\n16\n00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,140\n>> So we're going to do a little\nbit with HTTP versus SHTTP, HTTPS,\n\n17\n00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,065\nkind of talk through that.\n\n18\n00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:15,350\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Some things some people may not\n\n19\n00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,280\nbe aware of.\n\n20\n00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,120\nTalk a bit about cookies,\ndo a deep dive on IPsec.\n\n21\n00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,060\nKind of look at the component parts\nthere and wanna talk about attacks and\n\n22\n00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,900\nthe kind of attacks we may see.\n\n23\n00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,410\nSo we always want to try to\nstart out reminding you and\n\n24\n00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,020\nourselves as we go, we always want to make\nsure we're focused at the right level.\n\n25\n00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,990\nJust thinking about where we've been and\nsince we look back over the other\n\n26\n00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,790\nshows from cryptography that we've done,\nthe other episodes.\n\n27\n00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,080\nWe've talked about a lot of\ndifferent component parts and\n\n28\n00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,220\nbuilding blocks that\nhelped us to make this up.\n\n29\n00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,460\nTalked a bit about the symmetric\nsingle key or private key algorithms.\n\n30\n00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,530\nTalked about asymmetric\npublic private key solutions.\n\n31\n00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,660\nThe ones that are going to be used to\nbe able to create confidentiality,\n\n32\n00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,680\ncreate integrity.\n\n33\n00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,470\nDifferent ways of looking at that.\n\n34\n00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,780\nSpoke about hashing, spoke about\ndigital signatures, spoke about PKI,\n\n35\n00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,530\npublic key infrastructure.\n\n36\n00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,877\nAnd all these different things are used\nto be able to create secure environments.\n\n37\n00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:09,334\nWhere in effect, we layer on top of our\nexisting infrastructure these extra\n\n38\n00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:13,723\nadd-ons that bring you the\nconfidentiality, bring integrity, or bring\n\n39\n00:02:13,723 --> 00:02:18,340\nboth, depending on how we set them up\ninto the mix to add additional security.\n\n40\n00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,950\nSo remember some of the overarching\nthemes that we speak about as we\n\n41\n00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,370\nthink about being a CISSP.\n\n42\n00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,600\nWhat does it mean for you looking\nto ultimately certify out there?\n\n43\n00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,475\nWhat does it mean for those of you\nthat are practitioners everyday but\n\n44\n00:02:31,475 --> 00:02:33,555\nare looking to broaden\nyour knowledge base.\n\n45\n00:02:33,555 --> 00:02:35,535\nIt means awareness,\nwe've talked a lot about this,\n\n46\n00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:39,305\nyou know this a theme that I spend\ntime on several of our discussions.\n\n47\n00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:41,145\nThis idea of defense in depth, right.\n\n48\n00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:46,205\nBuilding out layers of concentric defense\nthat help us to understand that if one\n\n49\n00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:51,270\narea, one solution, one thought process\ndoesn't always work for that problem.\n\n50\n00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,820\nHopefully, there's one or\ntwo more that'll catch it, right?\n\n51\n00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,490\nReally help us to identify that.\n\n52\n00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,570\nSo, building those layer\ndefense is very important.\n\n53\n00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,460\nIn cartography, in general, speaks to that\nbecause it helps us to understand how to\n\n54\n00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,560\ncreate both secure key exchange but also\nsecure dynamic exchange of information, so\n\n55\n00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,510\nthat information we sent back and forth.\n\n56\n00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,810\nBut we could do securely and\n\n57\n00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,980\nthis obviously very important so we want\nto make sure that we're aware of that.\n\n58\n00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,850\nSo we've done a lot of that and\nwhat we want to do looking ahead and\n\n59\n00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:20,910\ngoing forward focusing on wrapping\nup this idea of confidentiality,\n\n60\n00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,345\nwrapping up this idea of integrity into\nsome of the systems that we implement.\n\n61\n00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:26,765\nWanna look at IPSec.\n\n62\n00:03:26,765 --> 00:03:29,165\nWanna get in there and talk a bit more\nabout how it works under the hood.\n\n63\n00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:31,375\nAnd then really look at how we\nbreak some of these systems.\n\n64\n00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,485\nYou know the nice thing about\nbeing a security practitioner\n\n65\n00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:36,685\nis you can play both sides\nof the fence a little bit.\n\n66\n00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:37,475\nRight?\nSo\n\n67\n00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:40,915\nyou wanna make sure we understand how\nto do things, how to create security,\n\n68\n00:03:40,915 --> 00:03:43,920\nmake sure we understand how build and\narchitect secure solutions.\n\n69\n00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,240\nBring that idea of common\nsense to the mix, right?\n\n70\n00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,120\nSo when we talk about common sense,\n\n71\n00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,410\nmake sure we think through\nthe things that are obvious to us.\n\n72\n00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,230\nBut then understand there may be other\nthings that we're thinking about\n\n73\n00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,680\nthat are may be not so obvious to us, but\n\n74\n00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,540\nmay be obvious to others and\nyou address those, deal with those, right?\n\n75\n00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,020\nBut then also, you wanna make sure you\nunderstand the mindset of the attacker.\n\n76\n00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,670\nHow are they gonna come after us and how\nare they gonna look to break our system?\n\n77\n00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,660\nWhatever that is.\n\n78\n00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,960\n>> If I know what they're gonna do, or\n\n79\n00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,590\nsome of the techniques\nthat they're gonna use,\n\n80\n00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:12,570\nthat makes it easier for me to try to\nfigure out a way to protect against those.\n\n81\n00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,180\n>> Absolutely.\n\n82\n00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,280\nAnd so Mike raises a very good point\nbecause it really is about understanding\n\n83\n00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,410\nthat and planning, right?\n\n84\n00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,920\nBeing proactive, planning that\nprotection profile as we talked about.\n\n85\n00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,880\nBe able to create that risk, management\ncomes in there, absolutely correct.\n\n86\n00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,965\nAnd you know, cookie management as well.\n\n87\n00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,219\n>> Cookie management is very important.\n\n88\n00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,569\n>> Cuz cookie management\nis very important as well.\n\n89\n00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:28,544\n>> You've got to protect those cookies.\n\n90\n00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:32,810\n>> [LAUGH] Absolutely, all right, so\nlet's talk a little bit about this.\n\n91\n00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,450\nLet's go to our notes if we could.\n\n92\n00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,260\nAnd so what we have here\nis a beginning conversation\n\n93\n00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,860\naround protocol that's old and\nreally very well known to us.\n\n94\n00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,320\nAnd one that may not be so well known.\n\n95\n00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,140\nRight?\nSo we'll talk about the difference here\n\n96\n00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,810\nbetween HTTPS, something we tend to\nuse everyday, any of us that deal with\n\n97\n00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,630\nanything on the Web, deal with any\ne-commerce of any kind, electronic\n\n98\n00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,160\nbanking, pay your bills, that kind of\nstuff, you use HTTPS all the time, right?\n\n99\n00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,500\nAnd in some of our prior discussions,\n\n100\n00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,590\nwe gave you a rather long laundry list of\nports and port numbers associated with\n\n101\n00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,980\nprotocols that you wanna use, HTTPS,\nright, remember is gonna be on port 443.\n\n102\n00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,990\nJust wanna make sure\nwe're aware of that so\n\n103\n00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,730\nHTTPS is a protocol when we implement\nit and we use it for security, it's\n\n104\n00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,970\ngoing to protect the communication channel\nas you can see there between two nodes.\n\n105\n00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,220\nAnd an effective node is an endpoint.\n\n106\n00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,720\nRight?\n>> Right.\n\n107\n00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,640\n>> So, fancy word, fancy terminology for\n\n108\n00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,605\nsomething pretty basic.\n\n109\n00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:20,410\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> If Mike and\n\n110\n00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,280\nI are looking to exchange information.\n\n111\n00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,190\n>> Right.\n\n112\n00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,490\n>> Maybe Mike wants to\nsend me a secured email.\n\n113\n00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,000\nOr I want to login to a website he has,\nbut do so\n\n114\n00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,170\nsecurely with some sort of\nvalidation of identity.\n\n115\n00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,700\nUsername and a password or\nsome sort of token or whatever it may be.\n\n116\n00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,060\nA claim based authentication mechanism,\nsome sort of claim that we use.\n\n117\n00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,690\nWe're going to use HTTPS\nin order to validate that.\n\n118\n00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,530\nThat's implemented with SSL,\nsecure socket layer.\n\n119\n00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,540\nAnd with TLS, Transport Layer Security,\n\n120\n00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,680\ntypically that's how we're gonna\nsee this solution implemented.\n\n121\n00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,000\nWhereas Secure HTTP, a little bit\ndifferent, this is one of those things,\n\n122\n00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,754\nkind of sits off in the corner,\n\n123\n00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:58,484\nkinda the dark area where we don't\ntypically spend a lot of time.\n\n124\n00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:01,923\nI ask most people when I talk about it\nwith them, or I ask people about it.\n\n125\n00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:05,893\nDo you know about SHTTP,\ndo you implement SHTTP?\n\n126\n00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,808\nNo, we didn't even realize,\nisn't that HTTPS,\n\n127\n00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:10,878\nwe didn't realize there was a difference\nand you don't tend to hear and see that,\n\n128\n00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:12,854\nright, a lot of people tend\nto think the same thing.\n\n129\n00:06:12,854 --> 00:06:16,539\nSo it is different, by the way, just so\nyou know, if you don't believe me,\n\n130\n00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:19,140\nthen please take Wikipedia or\nGoogle's word for it.\n\n131\n00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,040\nIf you go out to Google, you will find it.\n\n132\n00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,540\nWikipedia's a little light on that one.\n\n133\n00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,340\nBut if you google for\n\n134\n00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,620\nit you will find it in a lot of\nthe network architecture references,\n\n135\n00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,320\nprotocol references, things like that,\nyou will see references to this.\n\n136\n00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,870\nThis is real,\nit is a legitimate protocol, and\n\n137\n00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,640\na way of implementing it,\nbut the difference here\n\n138\n00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,560\nIs that this is really focused on\nan individual message transaction.\n\n139\n00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,160\nSo we're synchronizing and securing that\nindividual message as we send it back and\n\n140\n00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,610\nforth between two nodes.\n\n141\n00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,880\nSo it's on the message level.\n\n142\n00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,650\nSo imagine trying to secure one single\nmessage out of 10, or 20 or 30.\n\n143\n00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,818\nThen that's the way and I think you,\nwhen we were talking about this before,\n\n144\n00:06:54,818 --> 00:06:55,960\nyou really framed it well.\n\n145\n00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,092\nYou made a great reference to it, which is\nthere may be a stream of information going\n\n146\n00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:02,046\nback and forth, but there may only be\ncertain aspects of it that really require\n\n147\n00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,020\nthis level of security.\n\n148\n00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,829\n>> Need that level of security, yeah,\n[CROSSTALK] stop and secure that and\n\n149\n00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:09,188\ngo back to your unsecured communications.\n\n150\n00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:10,663\nLike you were saying, a lot of overhead.\n\n151\n00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,550\n>> A lot of overhead,\na lot of overhead, right.\n\n152\n00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,490\nSo make sure we're comfortable with\nthe difference between the two.\n\n153\n00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,430\nJust throwing it out there for you so\nyou have a reference point for it,\n\n154\n00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,910\nand that way you have a sense of the fact\nthat they actually do both exist.\n\n155\n00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,780\nAnd as you prepare to\nanswer some questions,\n\n156\n00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,620\nshould you be thinking about this and\nwanna make sure you're comfortable and\n\n157\n00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,710\nclear on the differences between the two,\nyou now have a point of reference for it,\n\n158\n00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,000\nso it's gonna be very valuable.\n\n159\n00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,200\nAll right, so cookies, right.\n\n160\n00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,940\nSo cookies, one of Mike's favorite topics.\n\n161\n00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,592\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> Of all\nthe times to talk about cookies so\n\n162\n00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:39,168\nMike is a big cookie fan.\n\n163\n00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:43,097\n>> You know, I do love my cookies and I've\ngotta share with everybody my favorite\n\n164\n00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:45,860\nlittle cartoon where my tagline came from.\n\n165\n00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,990\nI gotta give credit where credit is due.\n\n166\n00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:54,375\nI just had it pulled up a minute ago.\n\n167\n00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,708\nThere she is.\n\n168\n00:07:56,708 --> 00:08:00,750\nSomething about this, just every time\nI see it kind of makes me chuckle.\n\n169\n00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,042\nIt's that expression\nthat he has on his face.\n\n170\n00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:05,400\n[LAUGH] That look of sheer horror.\n\n171\n00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,550\n>> Yes.\nOh my God.\n\n172\n00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,610\nSo the Cookie Monster, aka Mr.\nMike, deleting cookies.\n\n173\n00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,210\nSo there you go.\n\n174\n00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,585\nSo let's talk about cookies and\nthe real sense of the word,\n\n175\n00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:17,735\nnot the kinds that you eat but\nthe kind that live inside of your machine.\n\n176\n00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:19,045\n>> That live inside of my hard drive.\n\n177\n00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:20,565\n>> Exactly the kind that\nreside in your hard drive.\n\n178\n00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:21,555\nSo virtual cookies,\n\n179\n00:08:21,555 --> 00:08:25,325\nmuch like virtual currency, so\nthe cookies that exist, right?\n\n180\n00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:27,627\nAnd so the idea here these are just\ntext files that are created.\n\n181\n00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:29,327\nThey're maintained by a web browser.\n\n182\n00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:31,907\nWe often find them cached stored\nlocally in your hard drive,\n\n183\n00:08:31,907 --> 00:08:36,037\nwhich you know if obviously potentially an\nissue for us if they contain information.\n\n184\n00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,157\n>> Depending on what they contain, right?\n\n185\n00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:38,677\n>> Right.\nUser names perhaps,\n\n186\n00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:42,720\npasswords session information,\nyou know we use it for a lot of things.\n\n187\n00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,500\nAnd you know, it makes a lot of sense in\none respect, you get into that system,\n\n188\n00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,520\nit lets you back in.\n\n189\n00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,930\nBut as a result of that,\nwe could just have this happen just now,\n\n190\n00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,080\nwhile we were on the break.\n\n191\n00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,730\nI logged back into my mail system,\nso used Office 365.\n\n192\n00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,880\nSo I have to log in every time\nbecause we used cloud based solution.\n\n193\n00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,620\nSo that's secure.\n\n194\n00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,220\nYou have to log in.\n\n195\n00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,580\nYou don't cache credentials.\n\n196\n00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,220\nYou don't cache that session\ninformation with a cookie.\n\n197\n00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,630\nBut I've had it happen before\nwhere if something like Gmail,\n\n198\n00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,280\nGoogle Mail, you log in.\n\n199\n00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,330\nIf you stay logged in on the browser on\nthat session, you don't close it down,\n\n200\n00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,650\nyou log out in a fact, which kill it, but\n\n201\n00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:17,210\nyou don't log out the right way by\nshutting it off or signing out.\n\n202\n00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,070\nYou just close it.\n\n203\n00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,000\nYou keep the machine open, the session is\nlive, come back several hours later, and\n\n204\n00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,250\nyou can just bring that\nright back up again.\n\n205\n00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,490\nAll you have to do is just basically\ntype in the Gmail address to\n\n206\n00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,570\nget up the interface.\n\n207\n00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,900\nYou're not required to log back in.\n\n208\n00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,280\n>> Which might seem convenient at first,\nbut what if that person is not you.\n\n209\n00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,550\nThat's now accessing your computer and-\n>> Somebody else is eating your cookies.\n\n210\n00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,180\n>> Yes, exactly.\n\n211\n00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:37,770\n>> Yeah, that's a bad thing.\n\n212\n00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,120\n>> So that has become a serious problem.\n\n213\n00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,910\nNow a lot of that's controlled by\nthe website themselves, right?\n\n214\n00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,220\nThey decide what information is\ngonna be stored in those cookies.\n\n215\n00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,600\nSo we kinda have to one,\ntrust them and then protect them.\n\n216\n00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,680\n>> They do, they do.\n\n217\n00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,040\nSo, should I do the trust thing\nI did with Mr. Don earlier?\n\n218\n00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,970\n>> Oh, sure.\n\n219\n00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,800\n>> All right.\n\n220\n00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,550\nWith you,\nwe did the whole thing on trust, so\n\n221\n00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,001\nI'm thinking about maybe\ngiving some money.\n\n222\n00:09:56,001 --> 00:09:57,234\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We talked about trust for a lot.\n\n223\n00:09:57,234 --> 00:09:58,646\nWe're talking about trust now,\nand great trust.\n\n224\n00:09:58,646 --> 00:10:00,380\n>> [CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]\n>> Right, exactly.\n\n225\n00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,770\nAll right, so remember, and Mike raises\na really good point, all kidding aside.\n\n226\n00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,070\nYou know, this idea of cookies\nis about trust in one respect.\n\n227\n00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,350\nBut unfortunately they're often pushed\non us without us really knowing, right?\n\n228\n00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,310\nSo we may trust the web vendor,\nhypothetically BankABC.com or\n\n229\n00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,300\nwhatever it is, right?\n\n230\n00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,940\nWe may trust them because we give them our\nmoney, the ultimate sign of trust, right?\n\n231\n00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,923\nSo we borrowed theirs, they trust us.\n\n232\n00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:23,390\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Maybe the bigger sign of trust.\n\n233\n00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,800\nAnd so either way, however we get there,\nwe already have an implicit and\n\n234\n00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,090\nimplied trust relationship so why wouldn't\nwe do whatever it takes to log on and\n\n235\n00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,030\ncheck our balance?\n\n236\n00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,510\nWe accept the cookie,\nwe accept whatever they give us.\n\n237\n00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,760\nBut the problem, the downside is that we\ndon't really understand sometimes and\n\n238\n00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,210\nknow what's going on there.\n\n239\n00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,430\nRight?\nAs you point out.\n\n240\n00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,590\nIt may be doing more than we're aware\nof There is malware out there that\n\n241\n00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,380\nwill malform these cookies and use them to\nits advantage to create session redirects,\n\n242\n00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,410\nthings like that.\n\n243\n00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:51,330\n>> Try to intercept them\nwhen you go back to-\n\n244\n00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,640\n>> There could be a man in the middle.\n\n245\n00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,810\nThere could be replay\nattacks that come up there.\n\n246\n00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:58,250\nWe've really changed the architecture\nof the web over the last few years.\n\n247\n00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,280\nTo address a lot of these concerns we no\nlonger use unlimited session keys and\n\n248\n00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,590\nbanking and things like that with time\nout values where if you go inactive for\n\n249\n00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,900\nmore than may as little as 30 seconds or\n\n250\n00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,545\nless depending on the secure interface\nautomatically times you out.\n\n251\n00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,345\nSo there are things we do, but\n\n252\n00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:16,985\neven having said that, the basic\ninfrastructure still works the same and\n\n253\n00:11:16,985 --> 00:11:20,665\nwe see this pushed out to the next layer\ndown to the handheld devices with cookies.\n\n254\n00:11:20,665 --> 00:11:22,435\n>> Yep.\n>> These things live on your cell phones,\n\n255\n00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:23,915\nthey live on your tablets.\n\n256\n00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:26,065\nYou don't really know what's there and\nthis is one of the challenges,\n\n257\n00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:29,455\nso as a CISSP, looking to become one, or\n\n258\n00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,723\nultimately, if you are one and just\nlooking to brush up on some knowledge and\n\n259\n00:11:32,723 --> 00:11:36,600\nyou'll really get focused on certain\nareas by watching some of our shows.\n\n260\n00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,520\nWant to make sure we remember this piece,\nnot because it's any more or\n\n261\n00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,680\nless important than any other, but\njust because it's so prevalent, right?\n\n262\n00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,280\nWe see them everywhere,\n\n263\n00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,612\nwe just want to understand what they are,\nhave a general awareness of them.\n\n264\n00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:48,590\nAll right, so having said that,\nlet's talk a little bit about IPSec,\n\n265\n00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,860\nbecause IP SAC is going\nto be very important.\n\n266\n00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,250\nNow, in one of our previous discussions\nwe went through IPSec at some length,\n\n267\n00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,150\nwent to talk about how it works,\ndiagrammed it out for you.\n\n268\n00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,020\nAnd so I want to quickly review that,\nbut what I really then want to do,\n\n269\n00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,020\nmore importantly, is talk about all these\nindividual items that are on the hit list\n\n270\n00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,960\nhere, make sure we understand what\nthey are and what they represent.\n\n271\n00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,760\nAnd by doing that, we also have a little\ndiagram I think we're gonna throw up and\n\n272\n00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,150\nshow you here, which is the diagram we've\nbeen using for the IPSec discussion.\n\n273\n00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,920\nThis is gonna just paint a picture for\nus, in effect.\n\n274\n00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,610\nIt gives a picture of how IPSec works.\n\n275\n00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,000\nSo if we could bring up, yeah,\njust bring up the diagram real quick.\n\n276\n00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,765\n>> I have it there.\n>> I think you have it there, right?\n\n277\n00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:24,180\nWe'll just zoom in real quick.\n\n278\n00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,653\nAnd so what we're gonna see,\nis this is right off of, I think,\n\n279\n00:12:26,653 --> 00:12:30,090\nthe tech notes site from Microsoft,\nsince Microsoft's implementing IPSec.\n\n280\n00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,300\nAnd their products have for\nmany, many years.\n\n281\n00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,070\nWhat we wanna do is just give you\na visual representation of this.\n\n282\n00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,040\nIf you find a better picture, different\npicture, one that works for you great.\n\n283\n00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,710\nGo with that.\n\n284\n00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,750\nNo problem at all.\n\n285\n00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,820\nWhen studying it's really\nabout personalizing and\n\n286\n00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,030\ninternalizing that information.\n\n287\n00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,560\n>> Right.\n>> I want to make sure you're comfortable\n\n288\n00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,830\nwith it, however you get there.\n\n289\n00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:52,460\nComputer A on the left, is going to be\none of the two partners in this exchange.\n\n290\n00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,030\nComputer B on the right.\n\n291\n00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,295\nAnd so the idea is that we have\ntwo endpoints well defined.\n\n292\n00:12:56,295 --> 00:12:59,870\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We have the ike solution\n\n293\n00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:04,490\nwhich is the key exchange and negotiation\nupper left rectangles on each side.\n\n294\n00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,110\nInternet key exchange that we're going\nto talk about in our hit list in\n\n295\n00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,000\njust a minute.\n\n296\n00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,130\nWorking in a stack there and\nthis is going to generate for us the SA,\n\n297\n00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,180\nthe security association back and\nforth these are uni-directional.\n\n298\n00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,890\nSo we need two essays, one in each\ndirection for the connection we create.\n\n299\n00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:23,770\nAnd so this is basically the agreement and\nthe instruction set on how we're going to\n\n300\n00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,150\nengage in using IPSec up and\nbasically breakdown is discussed there.\n\n301\n00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,650\nAnd so you'll see see this is TCP,\nUDP in the transport layer.\n\n302\n00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,360\nSo we're going to be at\nlayer 4 of the OSI model.\n\n303\n00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,920\nAnd we inject the IPSec drivers basically\ninjected inside the network stack of use.\n\n304\n00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,300\nThis is going to be the driver that's\nimplemented based on the operating system.\n\n305\n00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,080\nSo which ever vendor you use,\n\n306\n00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,850\nyou have the equivalent IPSec\ndriver they're implementing there.\n\n307\n00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,780\nAnd then we are gonna secure those\npackets through some sort of\n\n308\n00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,740\ntunnel as they move out across the wire or\nsome sort of transport security,\n\n309\n00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,330\ndepending on whether we're doing\ntunnel mode or transport mode.\n\n310\n00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,740\nOut across the wire from\none endpoint to other.\n\n311\n00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,440\nAnd we'll talk about\nwhere we transport and\n\n312\n00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,550\nwhere we tunnel to go back to our list.\n\n313\n00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,430\nBut this is the general visual,\nthe general overview\n\n314\n00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:09,160\nof IPSec Now some of the things that are\non our hit list we're gonna go back and\n\n315\n00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,880\nrefer to here in a minute,\nbut not shown in the diagram.\n\n316\n00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,330\nSo for instance under ike we're gonna\nadd two additional sub items there.\n\n317\n00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,902\nThe protocols that actually\nare used to make up ike.\n\n318\n00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:22,900\nThe ISAKMP and the OAKLEY protocols\nthat are used for negotiation of and\n\n319\n00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,470\nactual exchange of keys.\n\n320\n00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,020\nSo we'll take a look at\nwhat those are there.\n\n321\n00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,370\nWe're also gonna wanna make\nsure we understand that we have\n\n322\n00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,660\nauthentication headers and or\nencapsulating security payload technology.\n\n323\n00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,870\nSo when we set up and actually apply IPSec\n\n324\n00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,820\nthrough the IPSec driver in the network\nstack, what we're doing is setting up and\n\n325\n00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,530\nusing either Authentication Headers\nto create integrity, authentication.\n\n326\n00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,700\nWho are we?\nRight?\n\n327\n00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,540\nAnd, or we're using\nthe Encapsulated Security Payload\n\n328\n00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,670\nthe ESP to do the encryption,\nthe confidentiality absolutely correct.\n\n329\n00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,170\nRight?\nSo, what we're gonna do is add in all that\n\n330\n00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,700\nlayer of complexity there,\nkind of the knowledge and overlay it.\n\n331\n00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,060\nAnd just make sure we're\ncomfortable with it.\n\n332\n00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,610\nBut we wanted you to quickly\nsee a picture of it,\n\n333\n00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,010\nhave a visual, get the general idea,\n\n334\n00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,480\nand then we're gonna just add in all this\nvocabulary and just document it for you.\n\n335\n00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,940\nSo, let's leave that just kind\nof the way it is marked up.\n\n336\n00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,800\nBut let's go back to our vocabulary list,\nand we can flip back and\n\n337\n00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800\nforth if we have a need,\nwe'll just go back to our notes.\n\n338\n00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,990\nWe'll give Mike just a second to zoom\nout again and then, get some more notes.\n\n339\n00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:23,640\nOkay, there we go.\n\n340\n00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,090\nWe'll just go back to our notes.\n\n341\n00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,610\nLet's talk about IPsec.\n\n342\n00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,770\nCould we scroll down just a little so,\n\n343\n00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:29,720\nthe bottom area you can kind of\nsee it right above the frame.\n\n344\n00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,590\nMaybe, one more.\n\n345\n00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,570\nI think my frame is just.\n\n346\n00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,470\nYeah, there we go.\nPerfect.\n\n347\n00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,510\nCatching the edge there.\n\n348\n00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,570\n>> I'm gonna drop this over to there.\n\n349\n00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,570\n>> Maybe even, just bring it over one.\n\n350\n00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,300\nI think, we have.\nDon and\n\n351\n00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,940\nI were talking about the fact that it\nwas indented a little too far over.\n\n352\n00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,410\nWe didn't see it all.\n\n353\n00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:44,830\nNow that you can see it hopefully,\ncentered in the frame for you.\n\n354\n00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,500\nLet's go through our vocabulary list.\n\n355\n00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,850\nAs you're studying, you may want to\nliterally think about this as just items\n\n356\n00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,300\nyou want to be able to understand and\ndefine in the context of IPsec.\n\n357\n00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,945\nGood flashcard material,\nas we've said time and again, right?\n\n358\n00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:58,910\n>> [COUGH] Any time I need memorization,\nthat's typically where I go.\n\n359\n00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,810\n>> One of those things, right.\n\n360\n00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,660\nThat and a cookie.\n\n361\n00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,362\nThat and a cookie, and you're good, right?\n\n362\n00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:02,875\nOkay.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n363\n00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:05,052\n>> All right, so Authentication Header,\n\n364\n00:16:05,052 --> 00:16:08,660\nand Encapsulation or\nEncapsulating Security Payload, ESP.\n\n365\n00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,750\nThis is gonna provide the confidentiality\nand,or the integrity for us within IPsec.\n\n366\n00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,200\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n367\n00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,760\nSo this is what we're using\nas we apply one or both here.\n\n368\n00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,320\nThe Tunnel Mode and Transport Mode.\n\n369\n00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,761\nSo we talked about the fact that\nwe transport on the LAN but\n\n370\n00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:25,300\nwe tunnel on the WAN.\n\n371\n00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,850\nAnd so this is hopefully a great\nway of remembering this for you.\n\n372\n00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,280\nWe tunnel between WAN endpoints,\n\n373\n00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,920\nmeaning between routers and/or firewalls,\nwell-defined endpoints on the WAN.\n\n374\n00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,840\nWe transport up to the LAN side, up to\nthe LAN side of the connectivity device,\n\n375\n00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,370\ntypically the router.\n\n376\n00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,120\nSo we will see Transport Mode\nbeing implemented on the LAN,\n\n377\n00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,720\nTunnel Mode implemented on the WAN.\n\n378\n00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,680\n>> Right.\n\n379\n00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,040\n>> Just be aware of that.\n\n380\n00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,470\nSecurity Association, as we said, or SA.\n\n381\n00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,230\nThis is the one-way unidirectional\nnegotiation, kind of instruction set and\n\n382\n00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,430\nagreement to be able to\nexchange information through,\n\n383\n00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,900\nexcuse me, through this idea of IPsec.\n\n384\n00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,180\nSo we just wanna make sure\nwe're thinking about that and\n\n385\n00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,310\nare aware of that as we\ntalk through that here.\n\n386\n00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,936\nRemember, unidirectional meaning we\nneed one in each direction to be able\n\n387\n00:17:09,936 --> 00:17:11,442\nto set up that communication.\n\n388\n00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:18,515\nAnd the way we manage those, yeah,\ndirect, yeah, I think it's the i and\n\n389\n00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:21,706\nthe o, right,\nit did look a little out of place.\n\n390\n00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:22,436\nThere we go.\n\n391\n00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:25,626\nAll right so, the way we manage those\nessays and keep track of them and\n\n392\n00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:28,708\nunderstand which is going which\ndirection and which ones we need or\n\n393\n00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:33,250\ndon't have, is through what's known as the\nSPI, the Security Parameter Index there.\n\n394\n00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:39,810\nThe SPI is going to be just that mechanism\nthat basically keeps track of the the SAs.\n\n395\n00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,960\nUnderstands what direction\nthey are tied up in, and\n\n396\n00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,740\nkind of going this way or\nthat way, and brokers and\n\n397\n00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,845\nnegotiates for us, and\nmakes sure they're applied the right way.\n\n398\n00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:51,385\nIt's called the Security Parameter Index,\nthe SPI is what we see there.\n\n399\n00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:55,165\nIt's another little sub-area,\nlittle sub-part, of IPsec.\n\n400\n00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:58,710\nAnd then Internet Key Exchange,\nIKE as it's often referred to,\n\n401\n00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,830\nis gonna be the process of\nexchanging these secure keys.\n\n402\n00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,110\nMaking sure we're able to set up and\ntear down IPsec as needed.\n\n403\n00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,990\nThe two ways or the two sub-component\nparts that are done for\n\n404\n00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,120\nthis are gonna be ISAKMP\nas I said a minute ago.\n\n405\n00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,840\nISAKMP is more properly referred to\n\n406\n00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,345\nas Internet Security Association\nKey Management Protocol,\n\n407\n00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:20,310\nI-S-A-K-M-P is just pronounced isacamp.\n\n408\n00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,430\nAnd then, I never went to\nan ISAKMP when I was a kid.\n\n409\n00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,060\n>> I didn't either.\n\n410\n00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,020\nI don't think they had\nit when I was around.\n\n411\n00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,710\n>> Yeah, I went to football camp.\n\n412\n00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:26,520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Went to code camp, right?\n\n413\n00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,990\nI went to sleep away camp.\n\n414\n00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,170\n>> Right.\n>> Never went to ISAKMP though.\n\n415\n00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,880\nThat might have been interesting.\n\n416\n00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,082\nAnd then OAKLEY Protocol,\nthe OAKLEY Protocol.\n\n417\n00:18:33,082 --> 00:18:35,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You gotta make it up as you go, right?\n\n418\n00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,650\nYou gotta find humor where you find it.\n\n419\n00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,154\nAnd the OAKLEY Protocol which is,\nagain, another protocol that's used.\n\n420\n00:18:40,154 --> 00:18:43,055\nThese are used for secure key exchanges,\nthe negotiation of and\n\n421\n00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,690\nthe setup of the key exchange.\n\n422\n00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,640\nAnd then the key exchange itself is gonna\nbe referenced here by using both of these.\n\n423\n00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,630\nSo when we add all these together, we get\nbasically an entire system that's referred\n\n424\n00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,950\nto as IPsec and this is what we see.\n\n425\n00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,490\nNow I have two additional notes\ndown there at the bottom.\n\n426\n00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:03,450\nOne is that something called SKIP, which\nis Simple Key Management Protocol for\n\n427\n00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,280\nIP, is sometimes seen,\nvery similar to IKE.\n\n428\n00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,240\nIt's kind of seen in\nsome of these systems.\n\n429\n00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,820\nIt works just like IKE, so\nwhen you say we like IKE,\n\n430\n00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,570\nit's because-\n>> We like Ike.\n\n431\n00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,500\n>> We are like Skip and we like IKE.\n\n432\n00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,773\nSo, similar to IKE, and\n\n433\n00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:20,035\nit's just another example of a system like\nIKE that can be used to do key exchanges.\n\n434\n00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,674\nSo you may just want to have\nthat as a point of reference,\n\n435\n00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:25,760\na little trivia if you will,\nthat may be valuable for you.\n\n436\n00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,710\nAnd also understand that all\nthese key management protocols\n\n437\n00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,450\nare found working at the network layer,\nlayer four of the OSI model.\n\n438\n00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,650\nOr excuse me, at [COUGH] yeah,\n\n439\n00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,024\nlayer four of the OSI, no, layer three of\nthe OSI model, why did we say layer four?\n\n440\n00:19:37,024 --> 00:19:37,560\n>> I don't know.\n\n441\n00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,440\n>> No, transport layer is layer four.\n\n442\n00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,000\n>> But we got the network layer right.\n\n443\n00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,510\n>> What?\n\n444\n00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:43,890\n>> We got network right,\njust wrong number.\n\n445\n00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,650\n>> Yes exactly.\n\n446\n00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:46,852\nYeah we just want to,\nyeah I don't know why we-\n\n447\n00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,573\n>> We wandered a little.\n\n448\n00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:49,333\n>> I think for\nsome reason we just made a mistake there,\n\n449\n00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,415\nwe weren't paying attention.\n\n450\n00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:53,350\nSo just want to make sure we\nhave that available as well.\n\n451\n00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:55,250\nBut we do just want to know, or\n\n452\n00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,660\nthink about the fact that we see\nthese working at the network layer.\n\n453\n00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,112\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n454\n00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:01,950\nAll right so, very good,\n\n455\n00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,580\nI think in terms of IPsec probably the\nonly other thing to throw out there and\n\n456\n00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,360\nto summarize around this is, we often\nsee IPsec associated with Windows.\n\n457\n00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,869\nSo we're gonna really think about it in\nWindows, setting it up, tearing it down.\n\n458\n00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:13,507\n>> Clearing of policies.\n\n459\n00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:16,665\n>> It's done with an MMC,\na Microsoft Management Console.\n\n460\n00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:20,270\nI know in one of our prior discussions\nwe actually did a quick demo, Don and I.\n\n461\n00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,396\n>> Yeah, I think Don opened one up.\n\n462\n00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:22,870\nWhere we actually had one opened up and\nset it up.\n\n463\n00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:26,498\nSo don't be afraid out there,\nif you're gonna go look for this stuff,\n\n464\n00:20:26,498 --> 00:20:28,020\nto open up some of those MMCs.\n\n465\n00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,289\nAnd go add the management console in\nyourself, add the little plugin in, and\n\n466\n00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:34,830\npoke around in it\na little bit like we did.\n\n467\n00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,199\nYou're not gonna hurt anything as long\nas you don't apply anything permanently.\n\n468\n00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,648\nYou can apply to then remove it,\nno big deal.\n\n469\n00:20:40,648 --> 00:20:43,670\nBut it's gonna be valuable for you,\nespecially if you're gonna be one of those\n\n470\n00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,160\npeople that understands the technology\nat maybe a theoretical level, but\n\n471\n00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,490\nyou may not be doing it everyday.\n\n472\n00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,520\nSo maybe you don't have hands-on\nmanaging this, it will be helpful for\n\n473\n00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,875\nyou to go in and\nreally just spend a few minutes.\n\n474\n00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,835\n>> Yeah go in there and at least look\nat those default policies that exist.\n\n475\n00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:59,010\nI think we've got our three in\nthere that we could use and-\n\n476\n00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,195\n>> Right, negotiate a request require,\n\n477\n00:21:01,195 --> 00:21:01,855\nthat kind of thing.\n\n478\n00:21:01,855 --> 00:21:04,210\nSo just want to make sure you take\nsome time to look at that and\n\n479\n00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,082\njust be aware of that,\nthat will be important as well.\n\n480\n00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:09,720\nAll right so very good, so\nI think that takes us up to\n\n481\n00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,590\nmaking sure that we are thinking about\nattacks and kind of attack types, right.\n\n482\n00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,100\nSo I want to make sure we talk,\n\n483\n00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,530\nat least for a few minutes anyway,\nabout different attack types that exist.\n\n484\n00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,061\nSo these are gonna be attacks that could\nbe executed against either plaintext or\n\n485\n00:21:23,061 --> 00:21:23,840\nciphertext.\n\n486\n00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,190\nBasically against\ncryptosystems at some level,\n\n487\n00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,910\nthat are gonna allow us to understand how\nwe can break the cryptosystem in some way.\n\n488\n00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,892\nAnd hopefully, if we're successful,\ngarner or get back the data and\n\n489\n00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:35,521\nunencrypt the ciphertext.\n\n490\n00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:37,698\nOr somehow find out what the key is and\nsomehow break the system,\n\n491\n00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:38,555\nin some form or another.\n\n492\n00:21:38,555 --> 00:21:40,380\n>> Compromise the security.\n\n493\n00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,950\nSo let's talk about\nCiphertext Only attacks.\n\n494\n00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,290\nThis is where we only have the ciphertext,\nso we know the ciphertext.\n\n495\n00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,100\nAnd as a result of that,\nmaybe several messages have been ciphered.\n\n496\n00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,610\nWe have that but\nwe don't have anything else.\n\n497\n00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,550\nWe don't have the key.\n\n498\n00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,750\nWe don't have the plaintext.\n\n499\n00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,980\nWe don't know anything\nabout the cryptosystem.\n\n500\n00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,010\nProbably don't know\nthe algorithms involved.\n\n501\n00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,500\nAnd as a result,\nwe just work on the ciphertext.\n\n502\n00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,260\nSo this is where the Allies in\nWorld War II found themselves early on,\n\n503\n00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,850\nwhen they were looking at a lot of the,\neither the purple traffic,\n\n504\n00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,100\nwhich was the Japanese military\ncodes in the Asian Pacific theater.\n\n505\n00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,170\nOr the Enigma traffic,\n\n506\n00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,780\nwhich was coming out of the Axis powers,\nthe German military traffic.\n\n507\n00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,120\nAnd they didn't really know the system,\n\n508\n00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,160\nthey didn't have the Enigma\nmachine early on.\n\n509\n00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,662\nThey didn't understand the code, and\n\n510\n00:22:21,662 --> 00:22:24,494\nthey had to figure out how to crack it\njust basing it on having ciphertext.\n\n511\n00:22:24,494 --> 00:22:26,572\nThis would have been\na Ciphertext Only attack.\n\n512\n00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:28,430\nAnd so, it can be complicated.\n\n513\n00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,868\n>> Absolutely cuz you really start,\nlike you said, with nothing.\n\n514\n00:22:30,868 --> 00:22:33,477\nSo the more you have I\nguess of that ciphertext,\n\n515\n00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,836\nmaybe it starts to get\na little bit easier.\n\n516\n00:22:35,836 --> 00:22:38,886\n>> Well hopefully, what we're looking for\nultimately, is this idea of,\n\n517\n00:22:38,886 --> 00:22:41,286\nif we get enough of it,\nwe want to start to see patterns and\n\n518\n00:22:41,286 --> 00:22:44,090\nwhat we call collisions,\nin the language of cryptography.\n\n519\n00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:47,540\nIf we start seeing collisions,\nmultiple ciphered messages,\n\n520\n00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,370\ndifferent messages that ultimately have\nvalues in them that look the same,\n\n521\n00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,530\nwe may start to see patterns,\nmay be able to discern the key.\n\n522\n00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,540\nAnd if multiple keys were used but that\nkey was used for a lot of text messages,\n\n523\n00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,890\nor a lot of plaintext in ciphering,\nmaybe we could find that group and\n\n524\n00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,960\nfind that pattern and maybe unencrypt.\n\n525\n00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,870\nSo that's gonna be Ciphertext Only.\n\n526\n00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,000\nKnown Plaintext?\n\n527\n00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,410\nA lot of these a pretty straight forward,\njust like the name implies, right?\n\n528\n00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,730\n>> Yeah.\n>> We know the plaintext\n\n529\n00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,350\nthat goes into the system\n>> And so\n\n530\n00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,880\nas a result of that,\nif the attacker has the plaintext and,\n\n531\n00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,530\nvery important here,\nthe corresponding ciphertext.\n\n532\n00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,460\nSo we could control the plaintext and\nwe control,\n\n533\n00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,200\nas a result, the outcome we get, both.\n\n534\n00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,030\nWe now can begin to see how\nthis enciphered, and so\n\n535\n00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,390\nwe see the dog is blue-\n>> [COUGH]\n\n536\n00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,110\n>> The dog is green.\n\n537\n00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,330\nMike coughs, that kind of stuff.\n\n538\n00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:33,720\nSo as we see, Mike coughs,\nwe see the output of that.\n\n539\n00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,775\n>> The output of that is, oof!\n\n540\n00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:35,340\nYeah.\n\n541\n00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,206\n>> However we control that, if we have the\nplaintext and the ciphertext coming out\n\n542\n00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:42,511\ncorresponding, we now can begin to\ntry to figure out how to decode.\n\n543\n00:23:42,511 --> 00:23:43,455\nThat's a Known Plaintext.\n\n544\n00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,583\n>> A lot easier trying to see\nthem as patterns, exactly.\n\n545\n00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,055\n>> That's a known plaintext, right.\n\n546\n00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:48,904\nSo the attacker has,\nin other words, the plaintext and\n\n547\n00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:52,190\nthe corresponding ciphertext of one or\nmore of these messages.\n\n548\n00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,130\nThat's we're gonna know.\n\n549\n00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,600\nWe may not choose what it is.\n\n550\n00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,100\nWe may not know and be able to say.\n\n551\n00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,830\nMike, I'm gonna say this\nis what it's gonna be.\n\n552\n00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,870\nAnd then, I wanted to see\nthe cyber text on the back end.\n\n553\n00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:02,560\nWe don't control that.\n\n554\n00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,940\nThat's chosen.\n\n555\n00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,760\nNext set of attacks.\n\n556\n00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,990\nBut, known implies however we got it,\nwe got both.\n\n557\n00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:10,960\nWe didn't necessarily control\nthe imput but we now have both.\n\n558\n00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,010\n>> But I know what they're putting into\nthe system before it got encrypted so.\n\n559\n00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:16,930\n>> Right.\nSo now we have chosen plain text,\n\n560\n00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:17,810\nsame idea.\n\n561\n00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:22,535\nThe attacker has plain text encipher text\nbut we basically choose the plain text\n\n562\n00:24:22,535 --> 00:24:26,906\nthat gets encrypted so we modify and\ncontrol the imput as a result we modify\n\n563\n00:24:26,906 --> 00:24:30,960\nand control the output because now\nwe get the exact cipher text out.\n\n564\n00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,170\nFor that plain text,\nwe can start choosing.\n\n565\n00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:38,706\nSo, we may wanna focus in on things like\nmilitary, if we're thinking about military\n\n566\n00:24:38,706 --> 00:24:42,108\ncode cracking, we may wanna focus\nin on putting in things like,\n\n567\n00:24:42,108 --> 00:24:45,581\ntanks, bombs, guns, planes, so\nwe can see what the cipher is.\n\n568\n00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:50,003\nAnd then when we see it later on, we see,\noh, that must be about an air attack or\n\n569\n00:24:50,003 --> 00:24:51,140\nsomething.\n\n570\n00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,946\nSo, I often tell the story when I talk\nabout chosen plain text and chosen cipher\n\n571\n00:24:54,946 --> 00:24:58,060\ntext, which by the way, is basically\nthe same concept just working in reverse.\n\n572\n00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,410\nIt's the identical attack,\njust on the opposite end.\n\n573\n00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,600\nI tell the story about what\nhappened in World War II.\n\n574\n00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,540\nThere were very famous cases in\noccupied Europe, especially in Paris or\n\n575\n00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,380\nin France in general.\n\n576\n00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,130\nBut in Paris and these other area were\nthe French Resistance was operating when\n\n577\n00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:16,900\nthe Germans were still in France before\nthe Allied landing, before D-Day.\n\n578\n00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,933\nAnd so a lot of the time what would happen\nis the London based controllers that were\n\n579\n00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:24,435\ncontrolling elements of the Underground\nhad to send messages over and\n\n580\n00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:26,629\ntell the Underground,\nhey go attack this or\n\n581\n00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:30,044\ngo blow up that bridge or\nwe're gonna land people here or whatever.\n\n582\n00:25:30,044 --> 00:25:31,634\nAnd so they would do those things and\n\n583\n00:25:31,634 --> 00:25:33,966\nthose were go gonna be\ndifferent kinds of messages.\n\n584\n00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:38,605\nBut when the resistance wanted to\nreport back to the Allied handlers and\n\n585\n00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:43,319\nsay, we think that the Germans\nare planning this or that, they wanted to\n\n586\n00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:48,240\nfigure out how to read the German\ncodes to tell them more information.\n\n587\n00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,495\nAnd so one of the famous stories was that\nthere was this very large train depot,\n\n588\n00:25:51,495 --> 00:25:53,532\nthere were several of\nthese throughout Europe.\n\n589\n00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:57,190\nAnd there was this very big one in France\nwhere a lot of the Allied, excuse me,\n\n590\n00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:00,870\na lot of the German munitions and\ntroop transfers and stuff took place.\n\n591\n00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:05,590\nAnd so the resistance would go down to the\ndepot, and would try to blow things up and\n\n592\n00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:06,470\ndo whatever.\n\n593\n00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,080\nBut what they would do to try and\nfigure out the codes was,\n\n594\n00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:15,060\nthey would shoot out the light\nbulbs on the platform.\n\n595\n00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:17,630\nAnd so they knew that every day,\nif they did this for every other day or\n\n596\n00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:21,800\nwhatever, if they shot out the lightbulbs,\nthen basically the report for that day\n\n597\n00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,795\nwould have to be something like light\nbulb shot out by resistance, or whatever.\n\n598\n00:26:25,795 --> 00:26:27,190\nHad to replace how so many lightbulbs.\n\n599\n00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:30,760\nBecause they knew the Germans would\ndocument this and talk about it.\n\n600\n00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,320\nSo they manipulated the input for\nthe cipher text, so\n\n601\n00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,330\nthat they could understand it.\n\n602\n00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,460\nAnd the plain text, so\nthey could understand it, so\n\n603\n00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,110\nthey would begin to see\nwhat the code looked like.\n\n604\n00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:39,660\n>> Right.\n>> And so\n\n605\n00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,360\nthey did a lot of these stupid little\nthings to understand how to basically get\n\n606\n00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,540\nthese code snippets that would translate\ninto, hey we shot out five light bulbs,\n\n607\n00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,360\nneed five replacements.\n\n608\n00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,390\nDidn't find anybody or whatever it was.\n\n609\n00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,480\nAnd they began to put together\nenough information they could\n\n610\n00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,160\nactually read the code.\n\n611\n00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,680\n>> Nice.\n>> So it's kind of an interesting little\n\n612\n00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,660\nstory, but\nit illustrates how these things happen.\n\n613\n00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,110\n>> Cuz you don't think about it, but\n\n614\n00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,390\nthat's a great way to do\nthe chosen plain takes.\n\n615\n00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,050\nYou're basically saying okay, I'm gonna\nmake sure that they include these words\n\n616\n00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,490\nin their message back to headquarters.\n\n617\n00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,040\n>> Exactly, right.\n\n618\n00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,950\nSo you get them, in effect,\n\n619\n00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,005\nto do the work for you and\nhelp you break their own codes.\n\n620\n00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:11,350\nWhich makes a lot of sense.\n\n621\n00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,170\nSo if the Germans had really figured it\nout and wanted to mess with them, it would\n\n622\n00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,080\nhave been something like yeah, we sat down\nand had popcorn and a movie, so you know.\n\n623\n00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,280\nOr whatever it would have been.\n\n624\n00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,705\n>> I had to replace five tires.\n\n625\n00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:21,696\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, exactly.\n\n626\n00:27:21,696 --> 00:27:22,340\nSo you don't know.\n\n627\n00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,910\nBut, obviously, it didn't work out\nthat way, but they figured it out.\n\n628\n00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,618\nEverything was good in the end,\nso it's just interesting, right?\n\n629\n00:27:28,618 --> 00:27:30,078\nBecause it's just one of those stories,\n\n630\n00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:32,498\nthose narrative stories that you\ndon't often, as you pointed out,\n\n631\n00:27:32,498 --> 00:27:34,980\nyou don't often think about this,\nbut it's the common sense stuff.\n\n632\n00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,220\nAnd we keep talking about this\nidea of common sense, right?\n\n633\n00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,610\nBring common sense to the party.\n\n634\n00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,280\nIt's probably the best gift\nyou can give to anybody.\n\n635\n00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,640\nIf you think about that,\nthis is one of the ways that you can break\n\n636\n00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,300\nthese systems just by looking at it and\nexamining.\n\n637\n00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,550\nGoing, well if I did this,\nwhat would happen?\n\n638\n00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,860\nHow would that work?\n\n639\n00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,060\nSpeaking of that,\ndifferential crypt analysis.\n\n640\n00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,940\nAnother interesting concept.\n\n641\n00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,980\nThis is where we're gonna go ahead, and\nwe're gonna look at the keys, right?\n\n642\n00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,430\nAnd the key pairs that are generated.\n\n643\n00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,990\nSo we're gonna look at the keys\nthat are used to encrypt, and\n\n644\n00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,060\nwhat we're gonna do ultimately is look at\nthe cipher text that's generated there,\n\n645\n00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,660\nthe pairs of cipher text rather.\n\n646\n00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,710\nAnd we're gonna go ahead and try to\nanalyze the results to see differences.\n\n647\n00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,970\nSo we're gonna look at differential\ndifferences in the keys,\n\n648\n00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,050\nthe key pairs, and the analysis of those,\nas well as the plain text and cipher text.\n\n649\n00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,720\nSo we're basically gonna examine\nall of that information,\n\n650\n00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,040\nand we're gonna try to figure out,\nif I use this key this way, I get this.\n\n651\n00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,150\nIf I use this key this way, I get that.\n\n652\n00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,700\nSo I'm seeing a lot of this\nother thing over here.\n\n653\n00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,700\nSo what combination am I going to need\nin order to figure out what kind of\n\n654\n00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,610\ncryptosystem they're using and as a result\ntry to find weaknesses and break that.\n\n655\n00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,210\nSo it's more of a scientific\nlook at things, but\n\n656\n00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,980\nwe're looking really at just deltas,\nwhat we call differences.\n\n657\n00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,170\nAnd linear cryptanalysis,\nsomewhat similar.\n\n658\n00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,240\nWe're basically going to look at\nthe functions that identify, or\n\n659\n00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,960\nlook at how this is being done with\nthe analysis of the algorithms.\n\n660\n00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960\nThe implementation,\n\n661\n00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,440\nlook at the functions that have the\nhighest probability of yielding success.\n\n662\n00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,710\nSo as we look at all these\ndifferent options we get for\n\n663\n00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,446\noutput we're trying to figure out\nwhich ones are most likely to\n\n664\n00:29:02,446 --> 00:29:04,417\nyield results by us being\nable to crack them.\n\n665\n00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:08,429\nSo it's linear analysis,\nhighest probability of specific keys that\n\n666\n00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:11,150\nare being employed, so\nwe are taking a chance.\n\n667\n00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,180\nAlmost like rolling the dice and\n\n668\n00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:16,110\nsaying what's the likely hood that this\nkey was used for this encryption or\n\n669\n00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,610\nthis block of encryption and then trying\nto read messages associated with it.\n\n670\n00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,810\nYou know we look at patterns or\nresults of pattern analysis and\n\n671\n00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,070\nwe look at the English language.\n\n672\n00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,315\nYou know they do these analysis runs on\nthe English language and they say there's\n\n673\n00:29:28,315 --> 00:29:31,672\nso many of these letters, so many of these\nthose letters in an average body of text.\n\n674\n00:29:31,672 --> 00:29:35,177\nThere's more t's and more a's than\nanything else whatever it is.\n\n675\n00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:38,855\nAnd so you can do these analysis runs,\nthese linear analysis runs, and\n\n676\n00:29:38,855 --> 00:29:42,485\nreally look for those and try to figure\nout what the output of that was.\n\n677\n00:29:42,485 --> 00:29:44,095\nSo that's what that's gonna yield or\n\n678\n00:29:44,095 --> 00:29:46,565\nwhat we're looking at there,\nside channel attacks.\n\n679\n00:29:46,565 --> 00:29:49,975\nSide channel attacks are gonna be attacks\nwhere we're basically looking at or\n\n680\n00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:53,950\ndetecting how much power\nconsumption we may use, right?\n\n681\n00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,690\nSo we're looking at the system itself and\ntrying to figure out if we can tell things\n\n682\n00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:02,670\nabout the encryption based on the way the\nsystem runs, not the actual implementation\n\n683\n00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:06,670\nof the crypto-system in\nthe implementation of the algorithm but\n\n684\n00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:10,270\nrather what is the surrounding box,\nthe infrastructure around it.\n\n685\n00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,385\nThat can be used to break the encryption.\n\n686\n00:30:12,385 --> 00:30:16,990\n[COUGH] So as a result, we may be looking\nat the way in which the system is powered\n\n687\n00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:21,200\non, how much power does it take when it's\ndoing encryption versus not encrypting?\n\n688\n00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,900\nDoes it encrypt and\ndecrypt at the same power levels?\n\n689\n00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,760\nIf not, what's that fluctuation?\n\n690\n00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,800\nSo we can always tell when encryption and\ndecryption are taking place.\n\n691\n00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,870\nWe could also intercept\nradiation emissions, so\n\n692\n00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:36,450\nthings like electronic eminence, right?\n\n693\n00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,680\nSo this EMI that goes out and we could,\nif we can, try to grab that and get that.\n\n694\n00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,650\nMaybe then we can actually see something\nor understand something that's going\n\n695\n00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,640\non there so wanna make sure we're\naware of those kind of things.\n\n696\n00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,160\nThese would be examples\nof side channel attacks.\n\n697\n00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,850\nReplay attacks,\nthis is almost like a man in the middle.\n\n698\n00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:57,950\nWe capture something,\ntry to resubmit it, retransmit it, and\n\n699\n00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,720\nhopefully the person on the other\nend doesn't realize that, and\n\n700\n00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,350\nthen let's us in and\nmaybe let's us poke around a little bit.\n\n701\n00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,140\nSo we traditionally see these more as\njust man in the middle attacks, when\n\n702\n00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,840\nwe talk about web services generically or\nnetwork services generically.\n\n703\n00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,349\nBut basically, capture something,\nreplay it or reuse it later.\n\n704\n00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,200\nAlgebraic attacks.\n\n705\n00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,360\nThis is where we look at the underlying\nmathematics and are they vulnerable?\n\n706\n00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:22,340\nSo the actual underlying structure of the\nalgorithms themselves, the mathematics.\n\n707\n00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,150\nThere may be vulnerabilities or\nerrors in the implementation.\n\n708\n00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:28,110\nYou know, you put a zero in\nthe wrong place, you know?\n\n709\n00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:28,940\nFactor something.\n\n710\n00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,870\nDon't pay attention to it.\n\n711\n00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,300\nYou can have all sorts of errors there,\nright?\n\n712\n00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,015\nSo are you a Big Bang Theory fan?\n\n713\n00:31:35,015 --> 00:31:35,977\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> The TV show?\n\n714\n00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:36,500\nAbsolutely.\n\n715\n00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,534\nYeah, absolutely.\n>> So if you remember that episode of\n\n716\n00:31:38,534 --> 00:31:42,542\nBig Bang Theory, one of Sheldon's\nheroes is Steven Hawking, right?\n\n717\n00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:43,209\n>> Yes.\n\n718\n00:31:43,209 --> 00:31:46,201\n>> So if you may or may not have seen\nthe episode, big spoiler alert here if\n\n719\n00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:49,169\nyou haven't seen it [LAUGH] Right,\nbut if you've seen the episodes.\n\n720\n00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:50,167\nIt's an older one now.\n\n721\n00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:53,405\nIt's obviously not one of the newer ones,\nbut if you've seen the episode of\n\n722\n00:31:53,405 --> 00:31:56,360\nthe series episode where\nSteven Hawking comes to the college.\n\n723\n00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,760\nHoward Wallowitz works on his, kind of,\nsupport team, helping him out.\n\n724\n00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,900\nHe introduces him to Sheldon,\nso Sheldon gets the opportunity\n\n725\n00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,940\nto finally meet Steven Hawking\nat the end of the episode, and\n\n726\n00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,420\npresents him with this thesis that he's\nwritten, and he's all happy and excited.\n\n727\n00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,670\nAnd Hawking has read it, and\n\n728\n00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,200\nthey're talking in the library\nat the end of the thing.\n\n729\n00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,230\nAnd Hawking is like,\nyeah this is really interesting,\n\n730\n00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,490\nreally great, innovative way of thinking,\nbut it's wrong!\n\n731\n00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:23,500\n[LAUGH] And Sheldon looks at him,\nlike, what do you mean it's wrong?\n\n732\n00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,180\nAnd he says, yeah there's\na mathematical computation error,\n\n733\n00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,510\npage three, you did this wrong thing.\n\n734\n00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,010\nAnd Sheldon says, absolutely not.\n\n735\n00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,730\nNo way I could possibly\nnot have done that.\n\n736\n00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,140\nAnd his face and\nhe sort of goes and oh my God.\n\n737\n00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:35,670\nAnd he gave Steven Hawking an animator and\nhe faints.\n\n738\n00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:40,180\n[LAUGH] And so it's just really funny\nbecause of the character and whatever.\n\n739\n00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,280\nIt's just a funny thing.\n\n740\n00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,880\nIf you're not laughing right now or\n\n741\n00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,190\nnot laughing when you see this you\nshould watch, it is very funny.\n\n742\n00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,250\n>> Get on Netflix and go check it out.\n\n743\n00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,210\n>> Get on Netflix, check it out.\n\n744\n00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:49,490\nBut the idea is that it's really funny.\n\n745\n00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,385\nAnd the idea is, if you put these\narrows in without realizing it,\n\n746\n00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:53,870\nthey're gonna screw things up.\n\n747\n00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,139\nAnd then there may be,\nas a result of that,\n\n748\n00:32:56,139 --> 00:32:59,690\nthe possibility to extract\nsome advantage to the system.\n\n749\n00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:02,220\nSo we got just three or four more here\nwe wanna go through here quickly.\n\n750\n00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,650\nSo, analytic,\nanalytic is basically just that.\n\n751\n00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:09,810\nAgain looking at the underlying\nweakness of the algorithms themselves.\n\n752\n00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:11,170\nIt's kind of a different approach.\n\n753\n00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:13,250\nAlgebraic is specific to the math.\n\n754\n00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:16,730\nAnalytic looks at the algorithms as well,\nlooks at the structure of them,\n\n755\n00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,780\nthe implementation of them.\n\n756\n00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,240\nSo it's kind of a very\nsimilar thought process.\n\n757\n00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,170\nStatistical just while you're typing that.\n\n758\n00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,810\nI'll let you finish your thought.\n\n759\n00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:24,710\n>> Okay.\n>> The structure real quick\n\n760\n00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,390\nwill capture that.\n\n761\n00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:28,980\nThe structure of the algorithms and\nthen statistical.\n\n762\n00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,000\nWe're going to identify statistical\nweaknesses in the algorithm so\n\n763\n00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,090\nthis whole grouping algebraic,\nanalytics, statistical.\n\n764\n00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,270\nMaking up a word there?\n\n765\n00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:39,285\nWhat the?\n\n766\n00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:40,043\nOkay statistical.\n\n767\n00:33:40,043 --> 00:33:45,500\n[LAUGH] We're gonna be able to identify,\nthe idea here is any statistical weakness\n\n768\n00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,300\nas we run variations on the algorithm\nlooking for mathematical proofs or\n\n769\n00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,870\nstatistical weaknesses about how the\nalgorithm may or may not behave over time.\n\n770\n00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,890\nSo there's another way of looking at this.\n\n771\n00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:59,160\nSocial engineering, this is just\nlike we talked about in other areas,\n\n772\n00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,240\nthis is really the idea of perhaps\ngetting somebody to give up the key,\n\n773\n00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,670\ngetting them to tell you\nabout the cryptosystem.\n\n774\n00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,320\nOh yeah we do it this way and, you know,\nit's got this amount of stuff with it and\n\n775\n00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,060\nyou get 'em drunk,\nget 'em talking, whatever it is.\n\n776\n00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,430\nThey may give up information\nwithout meaning to.\n\n777\n00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:15,620\nAnd then meet in the middle,\nthis is a kind of attack.\n\n778\n00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,590\nWhere basically we're just gonna try\nto attack the system from both sides.\n\n779\n00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,110\nRight.\nWe start at the plain text,\n\n780\n00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,930\nstart at the cipher text, kinda work\non both, try to break the system\n\n781\n00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:27,880\nfrom multiple angles, and if we can\ncrack it from one side or the other.\n\n782\n00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,120\nWe're usually more successful, if we\nwork it in multiple places all at once.\n\n783\n00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,950\nSo we call that a meat\nin the middle attack.\n\n784\n00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,720\nAll right very good.\n\n785\n00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,860\nSo think we've basically talked\nthrough all the attack types right?\n\n786\n00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,510\n>> Yep, think so.\n\n787\n00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,610\n>> Talked about all that stuff.\n\n788\n00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:45,995\nDid a little deep dive there on IP sec,\nworked the whole Big Bang Theory in, so\n\n789\n00:34:45,995 --> 00:34:46,770\nwe got that.\n\n790\n00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,671\nGot the Cookie Monster in the set up so\nthat was a twofer.\n\n791\n00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,772\nSo I think we've done pretty much our job.\n\n792\n00:34:51,772 --> 00:34:54,340\n>> Maybe one of my most favorite\nepisodes we've done so far.\n\n793\n00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,509\n>> I think so, Cookie Monster made it.\n\n794\n00:34:55,509 --> 00:34:56,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Alright ladies and\n\n795\n00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,810\ngentlemen well I hope you guys\nhave enjoyed the show, guys and\n\n796\n00:34:58,810

and\n\n4\n00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:37,070\ngood evening and welcome back.\n\n5\n00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,660\nTo another episode of It Pro Tv.\n\n6\n00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,230\nI'm your host, Don Pizette,\nagain with Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,240\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,530\n>> It is going swimmingly well, Don.\n\n9\n00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,580\nSwimmingly well.\n\n10\n00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,470\n>> We've progressed to\nan all new level of swell.\n\n11\n00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,015\n>> We have.\n\n12\n00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:51,610\n[LAUGH] Very true.\n\n13\n00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,950\n>> All right, well, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n14\n00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,290\nwe are back in with\nanother episode of CISSP.\n\n15\n00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,920\nAnd we're moving into kind of a neat area,\nin my opinion, someone with my background.\n\n16\n00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,110\nWe've been talking about a lot of\nhigh level technical stuff and\n\n17\n00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,920\nsecurity concepts and very complex ideas.\n\n18\n00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,520\nAnd now, we're kinda going back to basics\nand jumping into computer hardware.\n\n19\n00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,270\nOr what, I would consider with\nmy background, the basics.\n\n20\n00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,850\nBut for somebody who doesn't\nhave exposure in this domain,\n\n21\n00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,220\nit's kind of an unknown world.\n\n22\n00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,900\nSo we're gonna be diving back, a little\nbit of a little bit through history,\n\n23\n00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,960\nwhich is always fun.\n\n24\n00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,020\nAnd taking a look at the components that\nactually build up the infrastructure that\n\n25\n00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,020\nwe have to support as\na security professional.\n\n26\n00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:33,870\n>> Infrastructure.\n\n27\n00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,670\n>> Infrastructure.\n\n28\n00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,370\nWe actually have a 5 and\na 1/4 inch floppy disk,\n\n29\n00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,570\nwhich I guess if I hold in front\nof my face, as you can see.\n\n30\n00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,370\nBut otherwise, I get my urban camoflauge-\n>> It's\n\n31\n00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,500\nalmost like a wrestling mask, right?\n\n32\n00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,040\n>> But, yeah.\nWe're gonna talk about his guy here.\n\n33\n00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,850\nAnd if you've never seen one of these,\n\n34\n00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,660\nthis will be quite an adventure\nof an episode for you.\n\n35\n00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,200\n>> It's also a great coaster and\na cocktail napkin.\n\n36\n00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,060\n>> Yeah,\n>> When not passing as a floppy disk.\n\n37\n00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,000\nSo all right.\n\n38\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,510\nSo Thrown Under the Data Bus, I love that.\n\n39\n00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,200\nSo let's talk a bit about\nsecurity architecture and design.\n\n40\n00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,635\nThe idea in this particular\narea of knowledge in the domain\n\n41\n00:02:02,635 --> 00:02:04,095\nis really as Don laid out for us.\n\n42\n00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:08,025\nTo talk about the physicality of\nthe systems that we try to secure.\n\n43\n00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:09,585\nSo, what are they made up of?\n\n44\n00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:11,195\nWhat are the component parts?\n\n45\n00:02:11,195 --> 00:02:12,465\nWe're gonna talk about things like,\n\n46\n00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,445\nalthough we're not really going\nto spend time on what a five and\n\n47\n00:02:14,445 --> 00:02:15,355\na quarter floppy is.\n\n48\n00:02:15,355 --> 00:02:16,717\nBut if you've never seen one,\n\n49\n00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:20,077\nit's a historical reference,\nthat we used to manage information.\n\n50\n00:02:20,077 --> 00:02:22,837\nBut if we had to secure that\nkind of device, you know,\n\n51\n00:02:22,837 --> 00:02:25,867\nthat's security is a lot\ndifferent than logical security.\n\n52\n00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:28,488\nAnd so, we have to talk about\nthe component parts of a system.\n\n53\n00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:29,928\nTo understand what makes them up,\n\n54\n00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:33,298\nin order to understand how to build better\nmousetraps, build more secure systems.\n\n55\n00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:35,418\nSo we're gonna talk about\nsystem architecture.\n\n56\n00:02:35,418 --> 00:02:37,898\nWe'll focus on that,\nreally understand that.\n\n57\n00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:41,330\nWe're gonna do a little show and tell I\nthink, at least for a couple of things.\n\n58\n00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,570\nShow you some general ways\nof looking at your hardware.\n\n59\n00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,660\nWhat it is and\njust give you a general sense.\n\n60\n00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,720\nComputer hardware architecture overall,\n\n61\n00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,360\noperating system architecture,\nwhat goes on in there.\n\n62\n00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,120\nOverall what are secure systems?\n\n63\n00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,150\nThe idea of a security system and\nsecure system architecture.\n\n64\n00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,140\nThings like the TCB,\nthe trusted computing base.\n\n65\n00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,700\nThe TOE, or what we call toe,\nthe target of evaluation.\n\n66\n00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,730\nDifferent evaluation and\ncriteria levels so\n\n67\n00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,450\nwe can look at it to\nassess system security.\n\n68\n00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,500\nWe'll talk about information\nsecurity software models.\n\n69\n00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,530\nThings that we've talked about\nin SSCP like BIBA, Belapadual.\n\n70\n00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,770\nHow we compare and\ncontrast information management.\n\n71\n00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,160\nClark Wilson, you know,\nfocusing on integrity,\n\n72\n00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,930\nfocusing on confidentiality\nthings like that.\n\n73\n00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,970\nAnd we'll talk about certification,\ntalk about assurance and\n\n74\n00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:27,910\nall those kinds of things.\n\n75\n00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,870\nThose are all things we'll be speaking\nabout and talking about here.\n\n76\n00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,470\nWhen we talk about,\nas we do in the beginning of any of our\n\n77\n00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,770\ndiscussions around\nthe bodies of knowledge.\n\n78\n00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,050\nWe talk about this area.\n\n79\n00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,670\nI want to make sure we remember.\n\n80\n00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,370\nAnd we focus on the ideas\nof the three pillars.\n\n81\n00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,010\nThe main areas that we focus on\naround information security.\n\n82\n00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,602\nThis idea of confidentiality.\n\n83\n00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:51,500\nOf really building in security in such\na way that we can encrypt and protect and\n\n84\n00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,930\nsafeguard information.\n\n85\n00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,390\nKeep it from prying eyes.\n\n86\n00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,180\nIn this case, we show you how it's\ndone down at the hardware level.\n\n87\n00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,430\nAre we using secure architectures\nthat allow us to process information\n\n88\n00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,870\nthrough things like a TPM,\na Trusted Protection Module.\n\n89\n00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,440\nIn such a way that as a result of that,\nwe don't expose information even at the,\n\n90\n00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,040\nbasically the hardware level, the\narchitectural level of the motherboard.\n\n91\n00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,480\nAre we using those kinds\nof thought processes?\n\n92\n00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,410\nOr are we simply just\nrelying on upper level\n\n93\n00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,560\napplication and/or some logical controls\nto enforce that kind of confidentiality?\n\n94\n00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,730\nTalking about integrity.\n\n95\n00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:29,200\nThe safeguarding of information\nfrom somehow being modified,\n\n96\n00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,610\nwhether it's data at rest on a hard drive.\n\n97\n00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,660\nData on the wire whether it is being\ntransmitted across the network.\n\n98\n00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,510\nOr in long term archival storage,\nmaybe in a file system somewhere.\n\n99\n00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,260\nSitting on a tape as a backup.\n\n100\n00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,300\nWe want to make sure we have integrity,\nthe ideas of hashing and\n\n101\n00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,690\npercentages are going\nto be important here.\n\n102\n00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,440\nWe are really going to talk about\nhow we are going to implement that\n\n103\n00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,320\nthought process from\na architecture perspective.\n\n104\n00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,930\nSo, architecturally, we may talk about\nthings like protection rings that will\n\n105\n00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,290\ngive us the ability to\nunderstand confidentiality.\n\n106\n00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,538\nBut also, the idea of integrity and\nhow we implement that and what this is.\n\n107\n00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:01,400\nAnd then,\nwe'll be talking about availability.\n\n108\n00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,800\nAnd what is availability?\n\n109\n00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,580\nIn regards to architectures?\n\n110\n00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,270\nAgain, the hardware can we build\nsystems from component parts\n\n111\n00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,070\nthat are gonna lead to system information.\n\n112\n00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,560\nGenerally, data being\navailable when we want it.\n\n113\n00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,330\nBut also, making sure that we know\nthat people are accessing it.\n\n114\n00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,840\nSo how are we doing that in such a way\nthat we keep track of these things?\n\n115\n00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,230\nThis is all the kind of focus.\n\n116\n00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,800\nThe kind of information that we'll\nbe spending some time on here.\n\n117\n00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,570\nSo it'll be a very\ninteresting conversation.\n\n118\n00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,330\nIt's always one of the areas\nthat I look forward to.\n\n119\n00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,090\nAs Don says, he does as well.\n\n120\n00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,680\nGiven the many years that\nI've been doing this and\n\n121\n00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,040\nchanges in technology that we've seen.\n\n122\n00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,510\nWe've got some old technology.\n\n123\n00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,730\nWe're gonna demonstrate for you.\n\n124\n00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,260\nKind of a look backwards,\nbut also just thinking about\n\n125\n00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,800\nthe way in which technology progresses and\nall the things that we can do with it.\n\n126\n00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,010\nAnd the ways that we can combine it\ntogether, is really kind of interesting.\n\n127\n00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,280\nAnd, I always find it interesting in\nthese conversations in this section,\n\n128\n00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,550\nto spend some time thinking about what\nmight have been going on, you know, two,\n\n129\n00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,410\nthree, four years ago.\n\n130\n00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,910\nBut maybe, as early as, or\nas recently as just a few months ago.\n\n131\n00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,290\nAnd then looking at where we are today.\n\n132\n00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,272\nAnd looking ahead to what tha's going\nto look like over the next few months.\n\n133\n00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:03,310\nYou know,\njust kind of playing the what if game.\n\n134\n00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,810\nWhat if this or that happens and\nhow does that work.\n\n135\n00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,450\nSo it's very interesting stuff.\n\n136\n00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,450\nAnd I hope you'll find it to\nbe interesting as well as we\n\n137\n00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,420\nstart to go through it.\n\n138\n00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,700\nSo I know we've put together some notes\nas we try to do for every session.\n\n139\n00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,460\nWant to make sure we share those with you.\n\n140\n00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,800\nAnd so up top here we have this idea of,\nas we move to the top of the nodes,\n\n141\n00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,890\nbecause we're down there in\nthe middle just a little bit.\n\n142\n00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,560\n>> You know what?\n\n143\n00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,290\n>> Did we?\n>> Actually,\n\n144\n00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,690\nI think my video output might have frozen.\n\n145\n00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,980\nLet me.\n>> Okay, we'll fix that.\n\n146\n00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,030\nNot a big deal.\nYeah, we'll fix that in just a second.\n\n147\n00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,970\nLet's just start talking about\nthis idea of stakeholders, right?\n\n148\n00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,230\nAnd this idea while we're talking about\nthe general idea about where information\n\n149\n00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:37,740\ncomes from.\n\n150\n00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,800\nWe first want to think about how we\nunderstand the importance of information\n\n151\n00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,690\nin an organization.\n\n152\n00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,590\nSo, this idea of stakeholders,\nproject management concept,\n\n153\n00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,070\nright, come to us from\nthis idea of identifying.\n\n154\n00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,400\nThe people that are really\ngonna help us to set the tone,\n\n155\n00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,210\nfocus us on what's important.\n\n156\n00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,490\nThey're gonna set priorities for us.\n\n157\n00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,620\nWe sometimes refer to these people\nin other areas, in other ways,\n\n158\n00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,730\nin other bodies of knowledge, or\n\n159\n00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:04,560\nother areas of the domains, as perhaps\ndecision makers, senior managers.\n\n160\n00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,300\nBut in the formal project management\nlanguage or project management speak,\n\n161\n00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,650\nwe're talking about the idea of\nstakeholders and who they are.\n\n162\n00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,950\nSo the idea of stakeholders really for\na system, for an architecture,\n\n163\n00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:19,640\nis gonna be this idea of users, operators,\nmaintainers, developers, and suppliers.\n\n164\n00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,250\nEverybody that kind of goes into\nbuilding this all up overall and\n\n165\n00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,850\nmaking sure that we have\na sense of who they are.\n\n166\n00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,410\nAnd so you can see here, right, for\n\n167\n00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,350\na Systems Takeholder Certificate\nidentified as I just said.\n\n168\n00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,230\nAs the end users, people that\nare gonna use the system themselves.\n\n169\n00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,500\nThe operators, the people that are gonna\nactually manage it, maintain it,\n\n170\n00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,590\nthe maintainers.\n\n171\n00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,950\nDevelopers, people that build systems and\ncreate functionality,\n\n172\n00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,470\nthink of new ways to do that.\n\n173\n00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,900\nAnd suppliers, people that\nare gonna effectively sell us or\n\n174\n00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,340\nprovide component parts.\n\n175\n00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,925\nTo build those things.\n\n176\n00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:51,158\nSo as we think about a system architecture\nand a system design and securing that,\n\n177\n00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:54,971\nwe're thinking about the people that\nare stakeholders in that system.\n\n178\n00:07:54,971 --> 00:07:56,139\nWe have to identify them.\n\n179\n00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:58,425\nAnd understand their needs,\ntheir concerns.\n\n180\n00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:02,050\nWhat they bring to the table, so\nwe can better address security, and\n\n181\n00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,560\nsecure design,\nfrom all those perspectives.\n\n182\n00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,324\nAnd that's really going\nto be a very important,\n\n183\n00:08:06,324 --> 00:08:09,133\ncentral thought process to all the\nconversations we're going to have here.\n\n184\n00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:09,920\nAll right, very good.\n\n185\n00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,362\nSo having said that, lets think about\nthis idea of architecture, right?\n\n186\n00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:14,640\nWhat is architecture?\n\n187\n00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,990\nThe idea specifically of a computer\narchitecture, this encompasses,\n\n188\n00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,660\nreally covers if you will.\n\n189\n00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:23,100\nAll of the various parts of a computer and\nall the things that are necessary for\n\n190\n00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,280\nit to function, and this will include\nlogical as well as physical stuff.\n\n191\n00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,530\nSo the operating system\nis a logical component.\n\n192\n00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,570\nWe install it on top of physical hardware.\n\n193\n00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,420\nBut things like memory chip,\nlogic circuits, storage devices,\n\n194\n00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,630\nthose are the things like hard drives,\nmemory sticks, things of that nature.\n\n195\n00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,460\nLike USB devices, input and\noutput devices, what we call IO devices.\n\n196\n00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,330\nThis would be security components.\n\n197\n00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,600\nSo whatever we may do there.\n\n198\n00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,830\nA TPM, for instance,\nwould fall into this category.\n\n199\n00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:54,460\nMaybe a smart card reader,\nwriter, or something like that.\n\n200\n00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,070\nOr some sort of scanner.\n\n201\n00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,740\nBusses, so the actual architectural\ninput and output elements are there.\n\n202\n00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,410\nBut the interface, the front side bus\nis there as well which is part of\n\n203\n00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:05,850\nthe architecture of the actual\nmotherboard itself.\n\n204\n00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,880\nSo we'll take a look at that.\n\n205\n00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,720\nWe'll kinda point some of that out\nas we do some show and tell here.\n\n206\n00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,090\nAnd I used to love show and\ntell by the way.\n\n207\n00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,500\nWhen I was a kid I don't know.\n\n208\n00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,040\nIf you, if you're listening to us or\nwatching us perhaps recorded.\n\n209\n00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,097\nBut back when I went to school\nwhen I was in grade school so\n\n210\n00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:24,250\nI was even back I can remember as\nfar back probably as kindergarten.\n\n211\n00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,070\nAnd certainly in elementary school\nwe used to do show and tell.\n\n212\n00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,270\nAt least here in the United States\nback in the day.\n\n213\n00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,090\nBut that's what you did.\n\n214\n00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,390\nYou brought in something.\n\n215\n00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,060\nEverybody kinda sat around the duck, duck,\ngoose circle and you showed whatever you\n\n216\n00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,470\nhad and you talked about it and\nyou and your friends played with it.\n\n217\n00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,460\nI used to love show and tell.\n\n218\n00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,240\nThat was just such a cool time.\n\n219\n00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,650\nIf only we did that today.\n\n220\n00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,780\nIt would be kind of cool.\n\n221\n00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,870\nBring something in, talk about it.\n\n222\n00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,860\nSo this idea of show and\ntell actually is kinda central.\n\n223\n00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,210\nYeah, all reminiscing and kidding aside.\n\n224\n00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,050\nIt's kind of central to what we're talking\nout if you think about it because if you\n\n225\n00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,480\nhave architecture, secure design and\narchitectures that are well documented,\n\n226\n00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480\nthat are well understood, and\nthat people can understand and see.\n\n227\n00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,700\nYou're probably gonna designs\nsystems that are more secure.\n\n228\n00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,285\nSo that's the pro, right?\n\n229\n00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:10,570\nBut the con is then, you're also\nexposing those systems potentially,\n\n230\n00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,140\nto people that wanna do harm.\n\n231\n00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,780\nAnd so we have to strike this balance,\nright?\n\n232\n00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,630\nBecause if we tell everybody everything\nthere's no security there, no secrets.\n\n233\n00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,690\nIt's very hard to keep things secure\nif everything is transparent.\n\n234\n00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,510\nBut if everything is not transparent,\nif it's this idea of generic what we call\n\n235\n00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,690\na black box, it's very hard to understand\nsometimes where the holes are.\n\n236\n00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,480\nWe may not be building securely\njust because we're missing the most\n\n237\n00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,090\nobvious things that are going on.\n\n238\n00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,550\nSo, just be thinking about that as we\ngo through this conversation as well.\n\n239\n00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,680\nAnd things like networking\ninterfaces we were talking about,\n\n240\n00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,380\njust the things that make up and\npart of the architecture.\n\n241\n00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,470\nAnd I left off at buses.\n\n242\n00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,060\nSo things like networking\ninterfaces would be there as well.\n\n243\n00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,970\nSo when we talk about this idea of\nyou're just getting this right and\n\n244\n00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:51,790\nbuilding it out.\n\n245\n00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,810\nThere is actually an ISO standard,\nas there are for many,\n\n246\n00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,510\nmany of the things we talk about.\n\n247\n00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,920\nThere is an ISO standard\nthat may be helpful here.\n\n248\n00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,670\nISO 42010, so 42,010, first promulgated,\nfirst put out there in 2007.\n\n249\n00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,030\nThis is an international\nstandard as you can see.\n\n250\n00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,920\nProvides guidelines in how to create and\nmaintain system architecture.\n\n251\n00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,980\nSo this is kind of the reference\ndocument most people refer to and\n\n252\n00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,030\nsay if you're gonna build a secure\nsystem here is where you start.\n\n253\n00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:19,680\nYou start with the guidelines and\nthe best practices in this ISO standard.\n\n254\n00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,550\nSo just to remind you as we have with some\nof the other ISO standards we've talked\n\n255\n00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,490\nabout in some of our prior shows, the idea\nhere is that certainly encourage you to go\n\n256\n00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,548\nout, take a look, always important\nto be aware of this stuff.\n\n257\n00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:32,780\nWould not spend a huge amount of time\non understanding the ISO standard\n\n258\n00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,530\nprior to actually sitting for\nan exam like the CISSP.\n\n259\n00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,980\nThis is not the 'everything you want\nto know about ISO standards exam,' it\n\n260\n00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,670\nis just a point of reference.\n\n261\n00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,010\nIt's more for you, as a professional for\nafter the fact to really better understand\n\n262\n00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,680\nthat there are reference points and\nthings out there that you may want to\n\n263\n00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,980\nprofessionally develop your career around\nand really have a better understanding of.\n\n264\n00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,930\nAnd remember, as we've shown you with\na lot of these other ISO standards as we\n\n265\n00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,000\ntalk about them,\nthere typically is a charge.\n\n266\n00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,660\nThere's some sort of a financial fee for\nthat.\n\n267\n00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,140\nThey're usually not free.\n\n268\n00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,050\nAnd so you just want to make sure\nyou're aware of that as well.\n\n269\n00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,450\nAll right.\n\n270\n00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,280\nSo let's get into some of our vocabulary,\nour building blocks.\n\n271\n00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,420\nI often frame this in my conversations\nwith my students as the Lego\n\n272\n00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,295\nportion of our program or\nLincoln Log portion of our program.\n\n273\n00:12:14,295 --> 00:12:16,365\nWe're gonna throw a bunch\nof blocks on the table and\n\n274\n00:12:16,365 --> 00:12:19,435\nfigure out what we can build out of them\nonce we're done explaining what they are.\n\n275\n00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:23,175\nSo this is gonna be a run-through of\nthe vocabulary of system architecture.\n\n276\n00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,955\nA fairly long laundry\nlist of vocabulary terms.\n\n277\n00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:30,493\nGood flash card material we've\nmentioned in some other areas for you.\n\n278\n00:12:30,493 --> 00:12:32,435\nDefinitely going be things you're\ngoing to want to understand,\n\n279\n00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:35,670\nso you're going to want to master\nthese definitions if you will.\n\n280\n00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,100\nAnd rote memorization,\n\n281\n00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,330\nlearning, putting some effort into\nunderstanding them will be helpful.\n\n282\n00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,940\nWe'll give you some\nvisuals on a few of these.\n\n283\n00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,102\nWe're not gonna put everything up on\nthe screen, but we'll show you just\n\n284\n00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:49,160\nthe association of some of these\ntogether as we work through them.\n\n285\n00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,110\nSo, we often talk about CPUs,\ncentral processing units,\n\n286\n00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,590\nthe CPU is simply that\nplace inside the computer.\n\n287\n00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,550\nIt's commonly referred to as\njust the chip or the brain.\n\n288\n00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,930\nIt's the CPU chip.\n\n289\n00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:00,930\nOr the brain of the computer,\n\n290\n00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,760\ncarries out the execution of\ninstructions within a computer.\n\n291\n00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,390\nUsed to be back in the day, you had\na single CPU, depending on the size\n\n292\n00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,320\nat certain points and time they were\nmassive by comparison to today's CPUs.\n\n293\n00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,450\nBut it was simply just\na single piece of hardware.\n\n294\n00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,400\nA chip that would plug\ninto the motherboard,\n\n295\n00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,980\ndepending on the configuration.\n\n296\n00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,330\nSo many pins, it might slot in at\ncertain points, depending what it was.\n\n297\n00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,190\nWe don't have virtual CPU's\nin physical machines,\n\n298\n00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,880\nwe do have them in virtual machines.\n\n299\n00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,660\nSo today we do have virtual CPU's but\nthey are based off of a physical CPU and\n\n300\n00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,950\nbasically just effectively\ntaking that physical CPU and\n\n301\n00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,800\nlogically allocating it out.\n\n302\n00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,520\nBut in effect we're still\nusing the physical CPU.\n\n303\n00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,200\nBut the idea is that basically this\njust becomes the place where we do all\n\n304\n00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,630\nthe heavy lifting in the computer.\n\n305\n00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,230\nWhether it's a single CPU,\nor what we call multi-proc,\n\n306\n00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,730\nor multiprocessor CPU solution.\n\n307\n00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,640\nToday we stack CPUs up and\nwe have multiple CPUs.\n\n308\n00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,990\nMay have a quad-core, and 8-way-core,\nsomething like that, whatever it may be.\n\n309\n00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,020\nThe idea is still the same.\n\n310\n00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,890\nEvery one of those CPU cores is\nsimply carrying out executions and\n\n311\n00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,710\ninstructing them within the computer or\ncarrying out instruction sets and\n\n312\n00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,680\nexecuting them within the computer.\n\n313\n00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,050\nThe arithmetic logic unit, what's known\nas the ALU, this is gonna be a component,\n\n314\n00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,180\na subcomponent of the CPU itself.\n\n315\n00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,290\nThis is actually where\nall the mathematical and\n\n316\n00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,670\nlogic functions within\nthe computer are carried out,\n\n317\n00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,910\nso this is a set of instructions\nthat are inside of the CPU itself.\n\n318\n00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:24,230\nThat are used to carry out and\nbasically lay out the mathematical and\n\n319\n00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,450\nlogical operations of the computer.\n\n320\n00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:31,200\nThe register is gonna be typically a small\ntemporary memory storage area there,\n\n321\n00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,160\nunits that are integrated and used by\nthe CPU during it's processing functions.\n\n322\n00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,870\nMeaning this is going to be where\nwe can effectively go out and\n\n323\n00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,760\nstore certain information in real\ntime to pull it back into the CPU.\n\n324\n00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,260\nIt's just temporary storage,\nsometimes refered to caches.\n\n325\n00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,950\nYou know, they're also referred\nto simply as a memory cache,\n\n326\n00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,230\nan onboard cache, you know,\non ship cache for different things.\n\n327\n00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,730\nVideo cards have them today,\nyou know, this kind of thing.\n\n328\n00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,120\nSo this is just the actual caching area,\nso to speak.\n\n329\n00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,050\nThe control unit.\n\n330\n00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,055\nAgain, part of the CPU, right?\n\n331\n00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:02,738\nSo, within the CPU architecture,\n\n332\n00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:05,570\nthis oversees the collection of\ninstructions and data from memory,\n\n333\n00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,708\nand basically how they are passed in to\nthe processing components of the CPU.\n\n334\n00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,715\nSo, this is almost like\nthe traffic cop inside the CPU,\n\n335\n00:15:12,715 --> 00:15:16,590\nit controls all the movement of\ninformation, pulling things in and\n\n336\n00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,900\nthen moving it from\nplace to place as we go.\n\n337\n00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,810\nSo this is what the control unit does.\n\n338\n00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,760\nWhen you look at the CPU overall,\n\n339\n00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,100\nyou don't see these things\nas individual areas.\n\n340\n00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,240\nYou simply see the The CPU.\n\n341\n00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,750\nWhat we then would have to do is\nactually look at the architectural\n\n342\n00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,960\nrendering of the CPU.\n\n343\n00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,140\nSo, in effect, go to somebody like Intel,\nthis is intellectual property by the way,\n\n344\n00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,890\nso you won't see these typically.\n\n345\n00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,020\nBut, you would go to Intel or AMD,\nand if you were able to see the actual\n\n346\n00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,710\narchitectural renderings,\nthe design drawings of the chip, and\n\n347\n00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,720\nunderstand the architecture of it,\nyou would see these individual parts.\n\n348\n00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,160\nThey're laid out in the schematics.\n\n349\n00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,178\nBut you don't see them when\nwe look at it physically.\n\n350\n00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:54,994\nYou just see kind of a box or like a piece\nof silicon with some little spindles\n\n351\n00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:57,359\ncoming out of the bottom\nwhere we connect up and\n\n352\n00:15:57,359 --> 00:16:00,168\nsomething on the top that's\nprobably a darker color.\n\n353\n00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,216\nA black or something like that,\nthat sits on the green silicone.\n\n354\n00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:04,709\nA backgrounder is just soldered on.\n\n355\n00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:09,020\nThat's what you see as a CPU typically\nwhen you open up a system today.\n\n356\n00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:14,360\nGeneral registers, as we move down, and\nspecial registers, two kinds of registers.\n\n357\n00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,740\nMaybe we could just quickly,\njust scroll up a little bit that way,\n\n358\n00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,190\nso we can kinda compare both\ntogether simultaneously.\n\n359\n00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,290\nSo general and special registers.\n\n360\n00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,570\nGeneral registers and special registers\nboth You'll see temporary memory location.\n\n361\n00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:31,280\nSo, again, the idea of a registers, like\na cache register where we store things.\n\n362\n00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,240\nThe general register is gonna\nbe where we basically set up and\n\n363\n00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,120\nsee processing of executing\ninstructions taking place.\n\n364\n00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,530\nSo, It's almost like what\nwe call our scratch memory.\n\n365\n00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,180\nRefer to it there as a scratch pad for\nthe ALU.\n\n366\n00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,860\nIt's used while we're carrying\nout logic and math functions.\n\n367\n00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,060\nSo if you remember when you were maybe\nin school doing, some of your homework,\n\n368\n00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,470\nyou'd have a little piece of scratch\npaper there, figuring stuff out,\n\n369\n00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,400\nwriting stuff down.\n\n370\n00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,590\nGet the answer,\nyou kinda push it off to the side.\n\n371\n00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,040\nWrite the answer down and bring it back\ninto the main body where you're working.\n\n372\n00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,440\nThat's kind of what\nthe general register is,\n\n373\n00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,690\njust that throwaway piece of memory\nthat we do our scratch work in and\n\n374\n00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,440\nthen we process and take the output and\nput it somewhere else.\n\n375\n00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,500\nSpecial registers are gonna be those\nthat are gonna hold very specific,\n\n376\n00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,352\nkind of critical processing parameters.\n\n377\n00:17:12,352 --> 00:17:15,960\nThey're gonna be the ones that for\ninstance do things like program counters,\n\n378\n00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,000\nstack pointers, and what's called the PSW,\nor the Program Status Word,\n\n379\n00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,090\nwhich we'll see down here nn\nthese three terms are defined.\n\n380\n00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:27,250\nBut they are specifically designed\nwith a certain activity in mind and\n\n381\n00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,340\nthey're dedicated to special registers,\nto one of these three things.\n\n382\n00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,780\nProgram counting, stacking,\nor program status word value,\n\n383\n00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,490\ndepending on what we're talking about.\n\n384\n00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,010\nSo a program counter, Is gonna be where we\nhold the memory address for the following\n\n385\n00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,940\ninstruction that the CPU is gonna be\ncalling up or acting on in just a minute.\n\n386\n00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,070\nSo, imagine this almost like being\nthe on-deck circle at a baseball game.\n\n387\n00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,375\nRight?\nIf you have a familiarity with baseball,\n\n388\n00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,363\nyou're kind of sitting\nthere as a baseball player.\n\n389\n00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:54,005\nRight?\nIf you're next to bat\n\n390\n00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:56,595\nyou're in the on deck\ncircle kinda warming up.\n\n391\n00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:59,985\nAnd so you're the next one up, and\nwe know where to go get you immediately.\n\n392\n00:17:59,985 --> 00:18:01,332\nSo this is that ready room area.\n\n393\n00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:04,405\nRight?\nOr the green room in TV or whatever it is.\n\n394\n00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:07,055\nBut it's that place where we go\nwhere we're gonna tee up in effect\n\n395\n00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:08,405\nwhat's coming next for the CPU.\n\n396\n00:18:08,405 --> 00:18:11,405\nIf you think about the logic of\nthis the reason we do this is\n\n397\n00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:12,615\nit speeds up processing.\n\n398\n00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:13,575\nRight?\nBecause we already have it\n\n399\n00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:17,050\nkind of loaded in memory, ready to go,\nsitting at the program counter.\n\n400\n00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,740\nAll the CPU has to do, the ALU,\nthe Algorithmic Logic Unit,\n\n401\n00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,640\nhas to just reach in there and go okay,\nwhat's next and bring it right up.\n\n402\n00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,940\nAnd if we keep feeding it this way, we're\ngonna process a lot quicker than if we\n\n403\n00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,060\ngotta go out and kinda recreate everything\nand get it set up on the fly in real time.\n\n404\n00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,560\nSo this speeds up the ultimate processing.\n\n405\n00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,980\nThe stack is gonna be with the memory\nsegment that used by the processes\n\n406\n00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,940\nto communicate instructions to each other.\n\n407\n00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,110\nSo this is what we talk about, like\na buffer overflow, or a memory overflow.\n\n408\n00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,550\nWe generically are talking\nabout stack overflows.\n\n409\n00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:49,450\nMemory overflows take place inside\nof memory not in the CPU, but\n\n410\n00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,780\ngenerically we're talking about a stack,\n\n411\n00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,270\na section of memory that's dedicated to\nsomething that is overrunning the buffer.\n\n412\n00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,010\nHowever big it's supposed to be, we put\nmore in and it's supposed to be there.\n\n413\n00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,510\nIn fact,\nas a result we kinda run out of room and\n\n414\n00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,260\nthings start spilling out of the edges.\n\n415\n00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,320\nSo this is what a stack represents.\n\n416\n00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,050\nWhen we talked about the OSI\nmodel in our networking segment,\n\n417\n00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,330\nwe talk about this idea\nof a network stack.\n\n418\n00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,910\nRight?\nWe talked about, or TCP stack,\n\n419\n00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,660\nkind of combining everything together.\n\n420\n00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,000\nSo we see stack terminology\nused all over systems today.\n\n421\n00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,170\nBut it's this idea of memory segments\nthat are used to basically pass and\n\n422\n00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,630\ncommunicate information back and forth,\ninstructions back and forth to each other.\n\n423\n00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,880\nAnd we have program status word there.\n\n424\n00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,250\nOur PSW, Program Status Word, this is\nthe condition variable, as you can see.\n\n425\n00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,650\nIndicating to the CPU what mode.\n\n426\n00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,200\nThis is an important concept.\n\n427\n00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,560\nThe mode is either kernel mode or\n\n428\n00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,650\nuser mode, sometimes referred\nto as high mode, low mode.\n\n429\n00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,500\nJust depends on who you read and\nwhat you're looking at.\n\n430\n00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,230\nWhether you're looking at architecture or\ndesign versus development on top of it,\n\n431\n00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,650\nwe talk about it different ways.\n\n432\n00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,030\nBut, this idea of kernel or user mode\ninstructions that need to be carried out.\n\n433\n00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,560\nSo, we define user mode and kernel mode\ndown there also as problem state, or\n\n434\n00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,040\nwhat's called supervisory state or\nprivilege mode.\n\n435\n00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,830\nBut the idea is that user\nmode is basically where\n\n436\n00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,550\nthe interaction takes place above\nthe hardware where the user and\n\n437\n00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,480\nthe software can kind of interact and\nsee each other.\n\n438\n00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,700\nIt's like the GUI if you will,\nthat graphical portion of our interaction.\n\n439\n00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,780\nThat kernel mode is that protected,\nkinda core of the operating system,\n\n440\n00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,150\nprotect the core in this case the kernel,\nis in the CPU.\n\n441\n00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,780\nSo CPU area,\nwe're talking about in memory.\n\n442\n00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,480\nThis is really where,\nwhere executing the very,\n\n443\n00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,410\nvery compact base level of\ninstructions and make the OS, or\n\n444\n00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,690\nmake the system itself operate,\nwe don't tend to let you in there.\n\n445\n00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,480\nYou can't really interact directly.\n\n446\n00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,400\nYour interactions have to be\nbuffered through some sort\n\n447\n00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,560\nof mechanism to get in there.\n\n448\n00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,740\nThey have to be structured a certain way.\n\n449\n00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,410\nAnd so this idea is really, almost the,\nkernel mode is really almost like\n\n450\n00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,085\nhaving what we refer to as\nroot level access, really.\n\n451\n00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:47,920\nAll right.\nFull access to what's going on,\n\n452\n00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,980\nyou can interact with hardware,\ndo a bunch of stuff.\n\n453\n00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,048\nAnd when we represent this typically\ngraphically, we almost, not almost, we do,\n\n454\n00:20:55,048 --> 00:20:56,542\nwe draw this imaginary line.\n\n455\n00:20:56,542 --> 00:20:59,820\nAnd kinda see everything above\nthe line on the top as user mode\n\n456\n00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,730\nwhere we can interact and\nmaybe have direct and\n\n457\n00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,600\nindirect conversations through\nintermediaries like software.\n\n458\n00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,250\nAnd then, down below in the kernel mode,\nis where we tend to see protected access.\n\n459\n00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,480\nThat's why we talk about it as\nsupervisory or privilege mode down below.\n\n460\n00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,200\nSo you often see this in diagrams\nwhen we take a look at these.\n\n461\n00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,310\nSo User Mode.\n\n462\n00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,810\nRight?\nIs the protection mode there\n\n463\n00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:21,830\nthat CPU works at when carrying out\nless trusted process instructions.\n\n464\n00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,490\nIf you go in and ask it to add two plus\ntwo, that's gonna be done in user mode.\n\n465\n00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,170\nSomething like that will happen there.\n\n466\n00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:31,020\nBut if you go in let's say and\nexecute a command, such as in Windows for\n\n467\n00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,422\ninstance, you do something\nwith User Access Control, UAC.\n\n468\n00:21:34,422 --> 00:21:38,590\nAnd you then you maybe take\non a system function, like,\n\n469\n00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:44,955\nperhaps you're clearing a cache, or\nyou are trying to edit the registry.\n\n470\n00:21:44,955 --> 00:21:46,970\nRight?\nThat is something that would be\n\n471\n00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,370\nlike kernel mode activity.\n\n472\n00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,990\nSomething that requires special access,\n\n473\n00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,412\nadditional permissions, is really\ncarried out in a more trusted way.\n\n474\n00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:59,240\nSo anytime you up that access and\nuse UAC to run as administrator,\n\n475\n00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,360\nthat's an example of something that\nmight be like a kernel mode activity.\n\n476\n00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,370\nJust to give you a reference to\na modern day operating system that you\n\n477\n00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:06,935\nprobably have some familiarity with.\n\n478\n00:22:06,935 --> 00:22:08,260\nRight?\n\n479\n00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,380\nSo the idea that the mode of the CPU that\nworks basically carrying out these more\n\n480\n00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,280\ntrusted processing instructions is what we\ntalk about there and what we're seeing.\n\n481\n00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,620\nSo then we have the idea\nof the address BUS.\n\n482\n00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,600\nThe address BUS is gonna be the place\nwhere we connect the physical connections\n\n483\n00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,590\nbetween all the different\ncomponents together.\n\n484\n00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,555\nSo we plug things in to\nthe address BUS there.\n\n485\n00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:27,860\nRight?\nPhysical connections between\n\n486\n00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,690\nprocessing components and memory segments,\nthat are basically used to address memory.\n\n487\n00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,870\nSo when the CPU wants to talk to memory,\n\n488\n00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,800\nwe have to cross a connection\npoint in the system to do so.\n\n489\n00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,840\nWe talked about it being either an address\nbus or a data bus, one or the other.\n\n490\n00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,310\nIt depends on the kind of information\nthat we're looking to send or receive.\n\n491\n00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:46,100\nThe data bus is going to be that area,\nthat physical connection\n\n492\n00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,180\nbetween processing components and\nmemory segments as well.\n\n493\n00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,057\nBut this, as you'll see here,\nis used to transmit data,\n\n494\n00:22:52,057 --> 00:22:56,010\nas opposed to communicate the addressing\nthat will be used during processing.\n\n495\n00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,270\nSo the address bus is about\nsetting up the address spaces and\n\n496\n00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,960\nunderstanding how to get to them.\n\n497\n00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,640\nThe data bus is about sending and\n\n498\n00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,368\ntransmitting data between the two to\nreally understand how to manipulate them.\n\n499\n00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:07,170\nAll right.\n\n500\n00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:07,810\nSo we have those.\n\n501\n00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,150\nAnd maybe a good point for us,\nmaybe we'll throw just a couple more.\n\n502\n00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:15,820\nWe'll do the actual symmetric and\nmulti or asymmetric and process.\n\n503\n00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,350\nThen maybe we can take a look\nat some of the hardware,\n\n504\n00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,912\ncuz probably a good place to wrap.\n\n505\n00:23:18,912 --> 00:23:20,540\nYou kinda put that all together and\nwrap it up.\n\n506\n00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,430\n>> Sure.\n>> I'm just getting Don to kind of\n\n507\n00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,820\nnod yes to me, here, so.\n\n508\n00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,780\nCuz he's gonna be our magical hands\nthat do the demonstration for us.\n\n509\n00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,770\n>> I'll be the Vanna White.\n\n510\n00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,950\n>> You're gonna be Vanna White, exactly.\n\n511\n00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,980\n>> Tell me when it's over.\n>> So, we're gonna see Don just throwing\n\n512\n00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,470\na bunch of hardware up on the podium here,\nfor us in just a couple minutes.\n\n513\n00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,773\n>> All right, so, symmetric mode\nmulti-processing sometimes referred to as\n\n514\n00:23:38,773 --> 00:23:40,860\nSMP Symmetric Multi-Processing.\n\n515\n00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,890\nSo, this idea when a computer has,\n\n516\n00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,706\nas I mentioned in our introduction,\nmultiple CPU's, two or more.\n\n517\n00:23:46,706 --> 00:23:48,415\nRight?\nAnd each CPU is being used in what's\n\n518\n00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:50,239\nreferred to as a load balance mode, and\n\n519\n00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:54,057\nthis is all done internally within the\nsystem itself, through the motherboard,\n\n520\n00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,295\nthrough the processing,\nand how it's set up.\n\n521\n00:23:56,295 --> 00:23:59,048\nWe refer to this as symmetric\nmode multi-processing.\n\n522\n00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:03,275\nNot a term we often throw around much\noutside of architectural circles, but\n\n523\n00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:07,437\nyou hear it sometimes in virtualization\nbecause we talk about either hyper\n\n524\n00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:10,670\nthreading, or SMP,\nsymmetric multiprocessing.\n\n525\n00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:11,780\nWe often confuse the two.\n\n526\n00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,620\nThey are different, but\n\n527\n00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,660\nwe'll get into that conversation\nat some point in the future.\n\n528\n00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,920\nAsymmetric mode multiprocessing.\n\n529\n00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,520\nThis is when a computer has two or\nmore CPUs, but one CPU is dedicated to\n\n530\n00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,580\na specific program, while other CPUs\nare just carrying out general functions.\n\n531\n00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,260\nSo, we refer to this as CPU affinity\n\n532\n00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,690\nwhen we talk about it inside\nof an operating system.\n\n533\n00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,640\nWe hard code or peg certain processes or\nsoftware or services or\n\n534\n00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,980\nwhatever it may be, to run on that CPU or\non that core of that CPU.\n\n535\n00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,550\nBut generically architecturally\nwe refer to this as\n\n536\n00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,770\nasymmetric mode multiprocessing.\n\n537\n00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,960\nWhere we dedicate one of the CPUs\njust to that function, exclusively.\n\n538\n00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,120\nIt sits and does nothing but that.\n\n539\n00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,880\nAnd then overall, a process is simply\na program that's loaded into memory or\n\n540\n00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,670\nin memory within an operating system.\n\n541\n00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:02,530\nSo, when we run Microsoft Office and we\nrun Word, we would refer to the word.exe,\n\n542\n00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:08,000\nor winword is the actual executable, so we\nrefer to winword.exe as being the process.\n\n543\n00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,160\nWhich is the actual program\nload that's done and\n\n544\n00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,180\nthen the execution of that in memory.\n\n545\n00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,602\nSo I just want to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n546\n00:25:13,602 --> 00:25:17,495\nAll right, so maybe now we can\njust take a look at some software.\n\n547\n00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:18,520\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, software.\n\n548\n00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,470\nLet's take a look at software.\n\n549\n00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,270\nLet's take a look at some hardware maybe\nand just throw a couple of things up.\n\n550\n00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,670\n>> Where do we want to start, CPUs?\n\n551\n00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,200\n>> Yeah,\nwhy don't we start with some CPUs?\n\n552\n00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,400\nThat'll be cool, right?\n\n553\n00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,350\nGot the monster over there.\n\n554\n00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:33,320\nAll right, so through the magic\nof modern camera techniques,\n\n555\n00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,020\nI'm gonna snap my fingers,\nand there we are.\n\n556\n00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,990\nSo, as soon as Don is set, we're just\ngonna take a look at some of these CPUs.\n\n557\n00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,610\n>> Do we wanna start out modern or old?\n\n558\n00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,280\n>> Let's go modern to old.\n\n559\n00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,550\nRight, let's do modern to old.\n\n560\n00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,540\nSo we have what looks there\nlike an Intel CPU, I think.\n\n561\n00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,350\nMaybe even a mobile\nprocessor it looks like?\n\n562\n00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,760\n>> Yeah, this one I don't\nbelieve it came out of a laptop.\n\n563\n00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,893\nI think a lot of the newer CPUs-\n>> Or maybe a desktop?\n\n564\n00:25:58,893 --> 00:26:02,650\n>> The die sizes are so small these\ndays because the smaller the hardware,\n\n565\n00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,270\nthe more energy efficient it is.\n\n566\n00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:08,060\nSo you'll hear them talking about\nmeasuring the die size in nanometers and\n\n567\n00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,480\nhow small they get, so\nthis is just a really small one.\n\n568\n00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,330\nYou'll see, it's probably hard\nto see on the camera there,\n\n569\n00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:19,620\nbut it's got hundreds of little\ncopper pins on the bottom of it,\n\n570\n00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,020\nand that's how the system is able to\nreach out and communicate to this.\n\n571\n00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,470\nIn a laptop a lot of times, instead\nof pins, you'll see little balls or\n\n572\n00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,990\nthey'll solder it directly onto the board.\n\n573\n00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,140\nThe removable ones like this\nare a little more common in desktops.\n\n574\n00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,720\n>> Okay, so we have a more modern one.\n\n575\n00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,050\nThat is an Intel chip,\n>> Yes.\n\n576\n00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,850\n>> At least from what it looks like,\nit's an Intel chip.\n\n577\n00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,970\nI know we had an AMD chip that we could\nkind of show the difference between\n\n578\n00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,790\nthe interim step there before\nwe get to the monster.\n\n579\n00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:45,510\nSo the AMD chip,\nthat's what, a K6 probably?\n\n580\n00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,190\nLooks like?\n\n581\n00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,940\n>> It's a K62.\nIt's kind of hard to,\n\n582\n00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,125\nI'm trying to get the studio\nlights to hit it just right.\n\n583\n00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:52,460\n>> Yeah, there, yeah,\nwe had it for a second.\n\n584\n00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,740\n>> Almost.\n>> There we go right there.\n\n585\n00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,730\nIt's almost like an Etch-a-Sketch,\n\n586\n00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,070\nyou see it right from the right view and\nit appears.\n\n587\n00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,350\nSo it's an AMD,\nobviously the main, Intel and\n\n588\n00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:04,730\nAMD, the two mega monster competitors\nin the chip space, have been for years.\n\n589\n00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:09,000\nSo kinda the equivalent processing\npower and thought process.\n\n590\n00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,800\nDifferent architectural approach, so\n\n591\n00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,830\ndifferent structure,\nover arching structure.\n\n592\n00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,990\nIt is still square, it does have pins, but\n\n593\n00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,550\nthe architecture underlying it is\ngonna be a little bit different.\n\n594\n00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,030\nThis is also an older chipset, so it\nwill be bigger just because it is older,\n\n595\n00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:25,862\neven though if we had two that are modern\nand kinda compared the two side by side,\n\n596\n00:27:25,862 --> 00:27:27,940\nthey would look very similar\nfrom a size perspective.\n\n597\n00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,280\n>> But the thing I like about this one is\nyou can really see that silicon wafer.\n\n598\n00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:36,630\nI mean there are literally millions of\ntransistors embedded inside of this,\n\n599\n00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,650\nand it's all inside of this silicon wafer.\n\n600\n00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,920\nSo there's a lot of neat stuff in there.\n\n601\n00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,850\nOn your modern processors,\nyour newer ones,\n\n602\n00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:47,280\nbecause they're working in that smaller\nform factor, it's harder to see that.\n\n603\n00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,320\nYou can see some of the traces\ninside of this board.\n\n604\n00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,090\nAnd if you flip it over,\n\n605\n00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,220\nyou'll see where there's actually\nadditional circuitry on the backside.\n\n606\n00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,920\nThey're just trying to make\nthe best use they can out of that\n\n607\n00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,260\nsmall amount of space.\n\n608\n00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,820\nIt's tough to get all that kind of\njammed into that small form factor.\n\n609\n00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,815\n>> So, speaking of small form factors.\n\n610\n00:28:04,815 --> 00:28:07,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Going back in time.\n\n611\n00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,089\nSo, we have a paperweight that also\ndoubled as a processor at one point in\n\n612\n00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:11,770\nits life.\n\n613\n00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,300\n>> Yeah, this guy.\n\n614\n00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,330\nIf I were to crack this plastic\ncase open down in here,\n\n615\n00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,940\nyou can kinda see the-\n>> Kinda see the circuit board there.\n\n616\n00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,152\n>> So, it's big, and\nthe deal with these old slot processors,\n\n617\n00:28:24,152 --> 00:28:28,280\nthese were popular,\nI don't know fourteen years ago now.\n\n618\n00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,807\nThe deal with these is you had the\nprocessor on this circuit board in here.\n\n619\n00:28:31,807 --> 00:28:35,989\nAnd the cache, the memory that's\ndedicated to the processor.\n\n620\n00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:38,590\nThe processor has L1, L2, L3 cache, and\n\n621\n00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:43,590\nthat cache was located on this board also\nbut physically outside of the processor,\n\n622\n00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,860\nand what they found later on was that\nyou could really improve performance\n\n623\n00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,370\nif you took that cache and\nput it on the same die as the processor.\n\n624\n00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:55,640\nSo slot processors like these, these big\ngigantic ones, they didn't last very long.\n\n625\n00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,840\nThere's a period of about three or\nfour years that you saw a lot of these.\n\n626\n00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,080\nAnd then after that they started switching\nto these smaller, single-die processors,\n\n627\n00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,020\nwhere you had the L1, L2, and\n\n628\n00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:10,845\nL3 cache all right here on the same wafer,\nall together, and it improved performance.\n\n629\n00:29:10,845 --> 00:29:14,540\n>> But it was just so\ncool for the sheer look and\n\n630\n00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,370\nthe fact that it doubled as\na self-defense weapon, and\n\n631\n00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,560\nalso a small hibachi stove because\nthe heat sink, which is this metal area\n\n632\n00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,600\nthat you're looking at right here,\nwas used and was needed, by the way.\n\n633\n00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,930\nBecause if you didn't have it,\nthe chip would burn up pretty quickly\n\n634\n00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:32,260\nbecause the chips ran much\nhotter than they do today.\n\n635\n00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,110\nAnd that metal cage is basically used to\nsuck heat out of the processor, along with\n\n636\n00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,361\nthe huge, we didn't bring a big fan,\nwe should have had one of the big fans.\n\n637\n00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:42,740\nSo you had a box fan that\nwas roughly just about,\n\n638\n00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,930\nit was very close to this size, right?\n\n639\n00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:50,250\nTo our 5-1/4 floppy that would basically\nsit somewhere in the case like this,\n\n640\n00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,670\nblowing air across this thing, so\n\n641\n00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,730\nyou can imagine just how hot\nthese things got, right?\n\n642\n00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,510\nAnd how much of an issue this was.\n\n643\n00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,330\nYou don't see heat sinks on\nthe modern chips in the same way.\n\n644\n00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:03,250\nThe modern chip, when you look at it,\nis so small, and\n\n645\n00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,880\nit draws such little energy by comparison\nthat we don't have these dedicated\n\n646\n00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,160\npieces of metal that suck\nheat out of the systems.\n\n647\n00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,450\n>> Now, a lot of times what you'll see is\nsome copper tubing laid across the top,\n\n648\n00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,090\nand the copper tubing will run off and\nthen have a heat sink attached to that.\n\n649\n00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,920\nAnd that's just cuz there isn't\nenough room, these are so small.\n\n650\n00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,430\nSo you have something called Moore's law,\nwhere processors are supposed\n\n651\n00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:30,360\nto double in speed and half in size\nevery year, and that's been fairly true.\n\n652\n00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,140\nThey get smaller.\n\n653\n00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:31,950\n>> Yep.\nGordon Moore,\n\n654\n00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,220\nthe gentleman who invented or was the\nprincipal behind Intel, the company that\n\n655\n00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,035\nactually you're holding the intellectual\nproperty of in your hand there.\n\n656\n00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:39,060\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right, so\n\n657\n00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,930\njust a quick idea to show\nyou what some of these\n\n658\n00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,330\ncomponents that we've been\ntalking about look like.\n\n659\n00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,050\nSo, when we do talk about these things,\n\n660\n00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,070\nit's obviously helpful to\nhave a point of reference.\n\n661\n00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,220\nA little visual sometimes helps us to\nget a better sense of what they are and\n\n662\n00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,650\nunderstand more about them.\n\n663\n00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,580\nAnd obviously as a result,\n\n664\n00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,805\nhopefully become a little bit\nmore knowledgeable about them.\n\n665\n00:30:56,805 --> 00:30:58,955\nSo probably a good place to\ntake a break for a few minutes.\n\n666\n00:30:58,955 --> 00:30:59,565\n>> Sure.\n\n667\n00:30:59,565 --> 00:31:00,865\nLet's stop here, we'll take a break.\n\n668\n00:31:00,865 --> 00:31:03,725\nWe do have a lot more hardware to get\nthrough, and then some other things\n\n669\n00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:08,105\nwe'll throw up on the SkyCam for\nour show and tell that'll continue.\n\n670\n00:31:08,105 --> 00:31:10,355\nSo definitely stay tuned for that.\n\n671\n00:31:10,355 --> 00:31:12,285\nIt is one of the bigger\nsections of the exam, so\n\n672\n00:31:12,285 --> 00:31:14,820\nwe do need to spend a good bit\nof time on it, so stay tuned.\n\n673\n00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,206\nWe will be back with more after this.\n\n674\n00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:24,328\n>> See you in a few.\n>> [SOUND]\n\n675\n00:31:24,328 --> 00:31:25,831\n>> All right, welcome back everybody.\n\n676\n00:31:25,831 --> 00:31:27,290\nSo let's dive back in.\n\n677\n00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,905\nWe're gonna take a look at\nsome really neat stuff now,\n\n678\n00:31:28,905 --> 00:31:31,555\nwhich is multitasking and\nmulti-programming,\n\n679\n00:31:31,555 --> 00:31:35,265\nsomething that every computer does and\nwe take for granted today.\n\n680\n00:31:35,265 --> 00:31:37,125\nBut in the past,\nwe didn't always have it, so\n\n681\n00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:39,015\nit's kind of a neat\nthing to take a look at.\n\n682\n00:31:39,015 --> 00:31:42,520\n>> Absolutely, so you saw my little\njuggling attempt there, right?\n\n683\n00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,840\nAir juggling, you didn't see all\nthe balls going up and down?\n\n684\n00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,440\n>> It's all the rage.\n\n685\n00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,680\nEverybody's doing it.\n>> It is, everybody's doing it.\n\n686\n00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,690\nYou should do it too.\n\n687\n00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:48,670\nAir juggling is cool.\n\n688\n00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:52,506\nSo this idea of multi-programming,\nmulti-tasking, co-operative, preemptive,\n\n689\n00:31:52,506 --> 00:31:55,381\nmaybe we do, maybe we don't,\nmaybe one will go before the other.\n\n690\n00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:58,276\nBut this is generally the idea,\nas Tom was saying, of,\n\n691\n00:31:58,276 --> 00:32:01,110\nlet's get as much going on\nas we can simultaneously and\n\n692\n00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:05,560\nas a result really improve performance and\nget as many things happening As possible.\n\n693\n00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,117\nWhether we have that idea, a focus on what\nthose things are, is not as important,\n\n694\n00:32:10,117 --> 00:32:13,702\nmeaning we, the end user,\nwe're not really in charge of that.\n\n695\n00:32:13,702 --> 00:32:16,184\nRemember, it's the hardware,\nit's the CPU and the memory, and\n\n696\n00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,570\nall that stuff that's managing it.\n\n697\n00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,322\nBecause if we had to manage it all, I\ndon't know about you, but I would be like,\n\n698\n00:32:21,322 --> 00:32:24,710\ntwo, three, four things,\nI would just, I'd be done.\n\n699\n00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,415\nI need take a break.\n\n700\n00:32:25,415 --> 00:32:29,240\nSo the computer can do hundreds,\nthousands, millions, depending on what we\n\n701\n00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,610\nare talking about, perhaps even\nbillions of things simultaneously.\n\n702\n00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,450\nIn the sense that it processes all these\ninstructions, accesses information,\n\n703\n00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:39,110\ndoes all these things at once much,\nmuch quicker,\n\n704\n00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,860\nmuch more efficient, much better than\nany human being could ever hope to do.\n\n705\n00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,242\nAnd so as a result, it's going to be,\nobviously, a scale of improvement.\n\n706\n00:32:47,242 --> 00:32:50,619\nSo multiprogramming,\nthis idea of executions of one or more,\n\n707\n00:32:50,619 --> 00:32:53,676\nof more than one, excuse me,\nI should say more than one,\n\n708\n00:32:53,676 --> 00:32:55,796\nnot of more than one, whatever I said.\n\n709\n00:32:55,796 --> 00:32:58,495\nExecution of more than\none program process, or\n\n710\n00:32:58,495 --> 00:33:00,525\ntask by a single operating system.\n\n711\n00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:04,494\nIn other words, this idea of being able\nto simultaneously execute multiple\n\n712\n00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:07,350\nthings inside of an operating\nsystem at one time.\n\n713\n00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,620\nSo we boot up the OS, and\nwe're gonna be able to go in and\n\n714\n00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,850\nrun the GUI if it is a GUI based OS.\n\n715\n00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,000\nAnd we're gonna be able to\nlaunch a command line, and\n\n716\n00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,610\nhave both things running simultaneously.\n\n717\n00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:20,880\nOur desktop and our command line,\nthat's a multiprogramming solution.\n\n718\n00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,090\nMultitasking, simultaneous execution\nof more than one program, or tasks,\n\n719\n00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:26,740\nby a single operating system.\n\n720\n00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:30,900\nThis idea of doing it at\nthe same time is multitasking,\n\n721\n00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,190\nwhere it's all running at\nthe same exact moment.\n\n722\n00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:37,280\nThe interleaved execution is this idea\nof one thing, and then the next, right?\n\n723\n00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,760\nSo kind of finish one, do the next one.\n\n724\n00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,150\nLike I said, load the desktop then\nload the command line, as opposed to,\n\n725\n00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,370\nlet's have the desktop, the command line,\nand lets open up Internet Explorer, and\n\n726\n00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:50,780\nlet's do three things all at once,\nin the same exact execution spread.\n\n727\n00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,110\nSo that's the difference there,\nsubtly, between the two.\n\n728\n00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:58,190\nCooperative multi tasking, correct\ninterleave in effect versus simultaneous.\n\n729\n00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:04,590\nCooperative multitasking, the idea there\nof scheduling this solution, right,\n\n730\n00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:08,670\nor multitasking solution, to be able\nto be used in older operating systems.\n\n731\n00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,750\nThis is what old OSs would have done.\n\n732\n00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,490\nThis allowed for the, basically,\nidea of time slicing.\n\n733\n00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:16,340\nSo imagine, if you will,\nlike a Windows 9x.\n\n734\n00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:22,270\nMaybe a Windows 95, Windows 98,\nwould've used cooperative multitasking,\n\n735\n00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:26,170\nwhere we basically had too much\ncontrol of what the processes did.\n\n736\n00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:30,060\nAnd as a result,\nwe would see a lot of system hangs, and\n\n737\n00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,530\nunfortunately a need for reboots.\n\n738\n00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:36,040\nSo if you think back to the glory\ndays of computing, where Windows 9x,\n\n739\n00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,700\n95 and 98,\nwould effectively be running, and\n\n740\n00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,620\nthen you may do something,\nyou would get a memory exception error,\n\n741\n00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:46,530\nsome sort of error, typically a DLL\nerror would hang up on the screen.\n\n742\n00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,230\nAnd you would have to effectively,\nprobably,\n\n743\n00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,360\nrestart the system more often\nthan not to clear that.\n\n744\n00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,590\nThat was a cooperative\nmulti tasking error.\n\n745\n00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,750\nAnd what would happen was, we didn't\nreally have what was known as a hardware\n\n746\n00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:00,830\nabstraction layer, a proper HAL, or a way\nto break the association of the software.\n\n747\n00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:05,580\nThe process lock from user mode into\nthe kernel mode, into the hardware.\n\n748\n00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,910\nWe didn't have an abstraction layer,\n\n749\n00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:10,040\nthat would prevent the two from\ntalking directly to each other.\n\n750\n00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,440\nAnd so as a result, what would happen\nin cooperative multitasking systems,\n\n751\n00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,520\nwas that the software, or\nthe processes running in user mode,\n\n752\n00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,960\nwould directly attach to and\nbind to hardware in kernel mode processes.\n\n753\n00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,870\nAnd they would not let go, because\nthe architecture was not well constructed.\n\n754\n00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,640\nThe process code, the services, and\n\n755\n00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,110\nthe applications weren't\nvery well written, you know.\n\n756\n00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,870\nSo, as a result,\nbecause everybody kinda did\n\n757\n00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:36,740\na less than adequate job of doing\ntheir piece of the puzzle, and\n\n758\n00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:39,520\ndoing it the right way,\nthings would just get stuck.\n\n759\n00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,110\nAnd there was no border guard, no,\neffectively, control between the two.\n\n760\n00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,280\nAnd so when we switched over into\nwhat's known as preemptive multitasking\n\n761\n00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,180\nsolutions, modern\noperating systems use this.\n\n762\n00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,329\nAnd as a result of that,\n\n763\n00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:54,495\nwhat we see now is an abstraction\nlayer that's been put in place.\n\n764\n00:35:54,495 --> 00:35:58,786\nWe see this in virtualization, they\nhypervisor, among the many things it does,\n\n765\n00:35:58,786 --> 00:36:02,393\nacts as an abstraction layer to\nabstract the physical hardware, and\n\n766\n00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:06,400\ncreate a virtual representation of it,\nto allow virtualized operations.\n\n767\n00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,270\nIt is a type of abstraction layer,\nbut a very specific one.\n\n768\n00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:14,235\nHowever, generically, we have a hardware\nabstraction layer, what's called a HAL,\n\n769\n00:36:14,235 --> 00:36:16,004\nrunning on modern operation systems,\n\n770\n00:36:16,004 --> 00:36:20,090\nthat effectively prevents cooperative\nmultitasking problems from taking place.\n\n771\n00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,945\nBut we could still lock up the system,\ndon't get me wrong,\n\n772\n00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:23,160\nwe could still blue screen it.\n\n773\n00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,816\nWe could still get DLL errors, but\n\n774\n00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:27,870\nthey don't tend to happen for\nthis particular reason.\n\n775\n00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,512\nAt least, not if we've implemented\nthe OS the right way, and\n\n776\n00:36:30,512 --> 00:36:33,560\nit hasn't been modified, or maybe for\nsome reason maybe there's malware,\n\n777\n00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:37,460\nsomething's been obviously affected,\nwe've rewritten DLLs, things like that.\n\n778\n00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,860\nAssuming the HAL is loaded properly,\nyou use the proper HAL,\n\n779\n00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,800\nit's loaded the right way,\nit's not modified or in anyway corrupted,\n\n780\n00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,510\nthe preemptive multitasking solution\nprevents those kind of systems,\n\n781\n00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:50,170\nfrom behaving the way\nthey did back in the day.\n\n782\n00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:53,575\nSo the good news is, right, more stable\nOSs, and the even better news is,\n\n783\n00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:54,494\nas a result of that,\n\n784\n00:36:54,494 --> 00:36:57,472\nwe're able to effectively do\nmultiple things simultaneously,\n\n785\n00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,605\nbecause we do still do time slicing,\nbut we just do it differently.\n\n786\n00:37:00,605 --> 00:37:03,550\nAnd we effectively let go when\nwe're told to, because the HAL,\n\n787\n00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,550\nthe abstraction layer, slams down on\ntop of our connection, in effect.\n\n788\n00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,570\nif you think of it this way, and breaks\nthe connection, and forces the software,\n\n789\n00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:11,730\nthe user mode, to let go.\n\n790\n00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,550\nEven though, it may not want to.\n\n791\n00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:16,900\nAnd so, in effect, it's almost like,\nprying the fingers off the toy, right?\n\n792\n00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,685\nIf you have kids, pry the fingers off\nthe toy, and give it to somebody else.\n\n793\n00:37:19,685 --> 00:37:21,655\nThat's kinda the concept\nthat we're going for there.\n\n794\n00:37:21,655 --> 00:37:25,678\nAll right, so process states, we have\nthree process states that are available to\n\n795\n00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,790\nus here, ready, running, and blocked.\n\n796\n00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,330\nSo what are they?\n\n797\n00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:29,490\nHow do we define them?\n\n798\n00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,320\nThe idea is that processes can\nbe in various activity levels.\n\n799\n00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,320\nWhen we're talking about ready,\nwe are waiting for input to happen, so\n\n800\n00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,760\nwe're effectively waiting for something\nto fall out of the sky into the CPU, and\n\n801\n00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,030\ngo ahead and kick it off.\n\n802\n00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,800\nRunning is we're actually doing something,\nso\n\n803\n00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,760\nthere's actually something actively\nbeing executed in the CPU.\n\n804\n00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:51,030\nAnd blocked means that the process is\neffectively suspended, it's paused.\n\n805\n00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,340\nDoesn't mean it's not gonna happen.\n\n806\n00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,030\nIt just means that right now, it's\neffectively not running for some reason.\n\n807\n00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,710\nAnd we may then change from block to\nrunning, if we are waiting on input and\n\n808\n00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,990\nsomething has to happen.\n\n809\n00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:04,800\nSo for instance, if you are watching\nmaybe a movie, like Netflix, or\n\n810\n00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,800\nstreaming media, or something, and\nyou pause it, you're effectively in\n\n811\n00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,530\nthe language of process states,\nyou are blocking the process.\n\n812\n00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,400\nWhen you unblock it by unpausing it,\n\n813\n00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,915\nyou are then changing that\nstatus state to running.\n\n814\n00:38:15,915 --> 00:38:18,155\nAnd when you're waiting on\nsomething you are ready, and\n\n815\n00:38:18,155 --> 00:38:22,105\nthat's the language of how we think\nabout process state or process status.\n\n816\n00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:26,565\nInterrupts, or the idea here of being\nable to assign a value to a component.\n\n817\n00:38:26,565 --> 00:38:30,150\nWe used to call these IRQs, generically,\nit's how we referred to them.\n\n818\n00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:35,380\nAnd the IRQ is then gonna be allowed\nto basically represent the hardware,\n\n819\n00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,330\nor the interaction of the hardware, for\nthe computer component, back into the CPU,\n\n820\n00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,230\nand back across the motherboard,\nto allow us to access it.\n\n821\n00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,300\nSo it is basically a uniquely\naddressable value,\n\n822\n00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,710\nrepresentation of how\nto talk to that device.\n\n823\n00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,240\nBack in the day,\nwhen we did cooperative multitasking,\n\n824\n00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,070\nwe would have to set IRQs by hand,\nright, manually set them.\n\n825\n00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,410\nYou might remember this, depending\non how long you've been doing this.\n\n826\n00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:00,780\nSo you would have to go into\nControl Panel, typically, in Windows.\n\n827\n00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,630\nAnd you would have to assign an IRQ\nto a piece of hardware once it had\n\n828\n00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,760\nbeen added to the system.\n\n829\n00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,530\nWe did not have what is referred to now,\ngenerically, as plug and play technology.\n\n830\n00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,145\nInitially, in it's first iteration,\nwe used to call it plug and pray,\n\n831\n00:39:12,145 --> 00:39:15,140\ncuz you ever knew whether it would or\nwould not work.\n\n832\n00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,940\nAs it got better over time, so Windows 98,\n\n833\n00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,770\nwe start to see the emergence of that\ntechnology on the timeline there.\n\n834\n00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:24,020\nWindows kind of,\nMicrosoft kind of deployed that concept\n\n835\n00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:28,770\nhaltingly in the beginning, but started it\nthere, really picked it up with XP, and\n\n836\n00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:31,990\nthen moved it forward into Vista,\nWindows 7, Windows 8, etc.\n\n837\n00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,560\nObviously now it's a lot more mature,\nyou basically plug in almost any device on\n\n838\n00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:40,085\nthe planet today, and with very few\nexceptions, on the Windows side anyway,\n\n839\n00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:43,020\nright, they tend to work pretty well for\nthe most part.\n\n840\n00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,222\nSo drivers are already preloaded,\nand the idea is that we assign\n\n841\n00:39:46,222 --> 00:39:50,554\nthe interrupts automatically, the system\nbrokers that, and through time slicing,\n\n842\n00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:54,057\nthrough effectively sharing these\nIRQ channels with microseconds,\n\n843\n00:39:54,057 --> 00:39:56,751\nwe're able to then assign\nthem to multiple devices.\n\n844\n00:39:56,751 --> 00:40:00,615\nSo I can't remember the last time, other\nthan just as a kind of a knowledge element\n\n845\n00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:03,471\nin a class, or just out of curiosity,\nThat I ever had to go and\n\n846\n00:40:03,471 --> 00:40:06,215\neven look at what an IRQ was,\nlet alone twiddle with one and\n\n847\n00:40:06,215 --> 00:40:08,850\ntry to figure out what's\ngoing on with it and set it.\n\n848\n00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,740\nYou just don't do that anymore, it's just\nnot one of those things you ever do,\n\n849\n00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,100\nunless you run older operating systems for\nsome reason.\n\n850\n00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,560\nYou don't even see them exposed anymore,\nright?\n\n851\n00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,400\nYou'd have to dig to try to find them,\nand it's not even really available.\n\n852\n00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,909\nMaskable interrupts versus\nnonmaskable interrupts.\n\n853\n00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,560\nA mask will interrupt, this is the value\nthat's assigned to a non-critical\n\n854\n00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,252\noperating system activity,\nsomething that is non-critical.\n\n855\n00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:33,435\nSo, you may think solitaire is the most\ncritical thing in the world, right.\n\n856\n00:40:33,435 --> 00:40:35,023\n[LAUGHS] Or pinball, right?\n\n857\n00:40:35,023 --> 00:40:38,160\nBut, the computer says no,\nnot really, not that critical.\n\n858\n00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,065\nIt's got a maskable interrupt,\none that effectively is going to represent\n\n859\n00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:46,038\nnon-criticality where as a non-maskable\ninterrupt is one that is critical.\n\n860\n00:40:46,038 --> 00:40:50,300\nSo a non-maskable is one we can't ignore\nin effect, if you think of it that way,\n\n861\n00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,910\ncan't be hidden, can't just be pushed\noff to the side and ignored and\n\n862\n00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,920\nas a result the system has\nto pay attention to it.\n\n863\n00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,730\nSo, it's just a way of ranking or\nprioritizing which system calls,\n\n864\n00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,030\nwhich services,\nwhich things we have to pay attention to,\n\n865\n00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,170\nwhich ones we can ignore in effect, right.\n\n866\n00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,350\nI happen to be the one who votes for\n\n867\n00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,600\npinball being brought back\nevery time it comes up.\n\n868\n00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,000\nI think it was the most incredible\ngame and just the best thing ever.\n\n869\n00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:14,160\nIf I could just go back, and\nget that out of Windows 95 or 98 and\n\n870\n00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,680\nput that on the modern day and\nthat would be it that right there.\n\n871\n00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,900\nThat would be cool.\n\n872\n00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,860\n>> That was the unsung hero.\n\n873\n00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,170\nLike everyone thinks of solitaire,\nno one thinks of pinball.\n\n874\n00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,560\n>> They do.\nThey don't, right?\n\n875\n00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,350\nOr Minesweeper.\n\n876\n00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,510\n>> That's the other big one.\n\n877\n00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,870\n>> I just happen to like pinball\na lot more than Minesweeper.\n\n878\n00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:31,210\nI used to beat on those, you remember\nthe arrow keys, where the flippers.\n\n879\n00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,870\nYou were there trying to do this and\ntrying to play and\n\n880\n00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,260\nit was usually pretty cool.\n\n881\n00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,064\nYou can tell I spent a lot of my youth\nin very self guided and productive ways,\n\n882\n00:41:38,064 --> 00:41:41,200\ntrying to figure out how to\nplay pinball on computers.\n\n883\n00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,770\nAll right, so\nlet's go back to where we were.\n\n884\n00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,400\nSo we have threads, this idea of\ninstruction sets that are generated and\n\n885\n00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,270\nthen as a result lead to us carrying\nout some sort of instructions.\n\n886\n00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,340\nWe refer to them as threads,\n\n887\n00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,800\nsingle threads, when we are a single\nthread processing solution.\n\n888\n00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,150\nThese days pretty much\neverything is multi-threaded, so\n\n889\n00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,520\nwe do multiple threads simultaneously.\n\n890\n00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,670\nA thread represents our ability\nto basically go through and\n\n891\n00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:03,430\nprocess one cycle through,\nwhatever that is.\n\n892\n00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:06,270\nWe have multi-threads,\nwe do multiple ones simultaneously.\n\n893\n00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,278\nThreads are destroyed as soon as they\nare processed, as you can see there.\n\n894\n00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:11,890\nAnd so, multi-threading is\nsimply carrying out multiple or\n\n895\n00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:14,390\nsimultaneous activities all at once.\n\n896\n00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:18,360\nThis idea of multi-threading is pretty\ncommon today in most architectures.\n\n897\n00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,789\nYou don't really see systems running\nsingle thread systems unless they're\n\n898\n00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:22,155\ndedicated for something specifically.\n\n899\n00:42:22,155 --> 00:42:24,995\nLike with some off in the corner\nkind of business case.\n\n900\n00:42:24,995 --> 00:42:27,475\n>> Yeah, and the software developers\nreally motivated to do this,\n\n901\n00:42:27,475 --> 00:42:31,705\nbecause if a software developer writes\na single threaded application, they're\n\n902\n00:42:31,705 --> 00:42:35,250\nbasically leaving it up to the operating\nsystem to handle the multitasking.\n\n903\n00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,670\nBut if they can make it\nmulti-threaded from the beginning,\n\n904\n00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:41,020\nit makes it where the operating system\ncan better handle saying all right hey,\n\n905\n00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,620\nI've got a quad core processor, so let\nme send some threads to this core, some\n\n906\n00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:48,530\nthreads to that core and the applications\nwill run at a higher performance level.\n\n907\n00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,610\nSo the developers are really\nencouraged to do that.\n\n908\n00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,450\nAnd you see most of them adopting it, so\n\n909\n00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,230\nit is rare to see a single\nthread of that anymore.\n\n910\n00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:55,870\n>> Very true.\n\n911\n00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:56,440\nVery true.\n\n912\n00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,100\nExcept for pinball.\n\n913\n00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,135\n>> It probably is.\n\n914\n00:42:59,135 --> 00:43:01,730\n[LAUGHS]\n>> All right, so software deadlock, right,\n\n915\n00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:05,150\ntwo processes not able to complete their\nactivities because basically they're both\n\n916\n00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,720\nwaiting for\nthe system resource to be released.\n\n917\n00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,125\nWe refer to that as a deadlock.\n\n918\n00:43:09,125 --> 00:43:12,410\nEffectively it's like a Mexican standoff,\nthey're there waiting on each other.\n\n919\n00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,660\nWho's gonna blink first, nobody can go,\n\n920\n00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,080\nbecause they're both stuck in neutral\nin effect, they're both paused,\n\n921\n00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,220\nright, because we just don't know what's\ngoing to happen, we're waiting on input.\n\n922\n00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,854\nThis doesn't happen very often, but\n\n923\n00:43:21,854 --> 00:43:24,160\nit happens often enough that\nwe want to be aware of it.\n\n924\n00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,170\nProcess isolation,\n\n925\n00:43:26,725 --> 00:43:30,895\nthis idea of being able to see this as a\nprotection mechanism, first and foremost.\n\n926\n00:43:30,895 --> 00:43:34,895\nSo, think of this as things running inside\nof a magical kind of bubble, right?\n\n927\n00:43:34,895 --> 00:43:39,465\nAlmost like a sandbox where we can run\na process separate from any others.\n\n928\n00:43:39,465 --> 00:43:42,515\nSo, number one, there's no way to see it,\nthere's no time bleed.\n\n929\n00:43:42,515 --> 00:43:46,045\nWe don't really have any resource bleed,\ncan't get access to it.\n\n930\n00:43:46,045 --> 00:43:49,605\nWe're encapsulating it and\nmultiplexing it, time multiplexing it or\n\n931\n00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:51,840\nslicing it so that way it runs,\n\n932\n00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:55,420\nalmost in its own little isolated shell,\naside from everything else.\n\n933\n00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,620\nSo that way nobody can\ninteract with it in any way.\n\n934\n00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,680\nIt's really what process\nisolation is all about.\n\n935\n00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,240\nThe idea of encapsulation here,\nis important because by encapsulating\n\n936\n00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,738\nthe process, we're encapsulating,\nwe're providing data hiding.\n\n937\n00:44:07,738 --> 00:44:10,440\nWe are effectively securing\nthe input output and\n\n938\n00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,830\nthe process itself of that particular run.\n\n939\n00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:15,640\nSo nobody, no thing,\nno service, no malware,\n\n940\n00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,825\nno nothing can get in there play around\nwith it and really get access to it.\n\n941\n00:44:18,825 --> 00:44:22,115\nThis idea of encapsulation is very\nimportant from a security standpoint.\n\n942\n00:44:22,115 --> 00:44:25,125\nThis is what provides\nthe data hiding mechanism.\n\n943\n00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:26,465\nNobody else knows what's going on.\n\n944\n00:44:26,465 --> 00:44:28,905\nIn fact, it's inside a black box.\n\n945\n00:44:28,905 --> 00:44:30,415\nSo, understand time multiplexing,\n\n946\n00:44:30,415 --> 00:44:34,207\nthis technology that allows us, as we\nsaid, right to this idea of allowing us to\n\n947\n00:44:34,207 --> 00:44:37,667\nprocess multiple things\nusing the same resource.\n\n948\n00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:40,157\nSlicing, I've been referring\nto it as time slicing.\n\n949\n00:44:40,157 --> 00:44:43,607\nJust the fact that we take a second,\ndivide it up into milliseconds,\n\n950\n00:44:43,607 --> 00:44:47,027\nmicroseconds, assign two\nmilliseconds to this process,\n\n951\n00:44:47,027 --> 00:44:50,037\nthree to this one, four to that one.\n\n952\n00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:53,837\nEverything operates in the same system,\njust at a different timing value.\n\n953\n00:44:53,837 --> 00:44:56,835\nAnd as a result, everything's able to\nshare one common pool of resource very,\n\n954\n00:44:56,835 --> 00:44:57,790\nvery easy to do that way.\n\n955\n00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:00,640\nAll right,\nthen we have this idea of address or\n\n956\n00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,220\nvirtual memory mapping and just\nthe idea of memory management overall.\n\n957\n00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:08,526\nSo this idea of virtual address mapping,\nvirtual address mapping allows\n\n958\n00:45:08,526 --> 00:45:13,117\nthe different processes inside of a\ncomputer to have their own memory spaces.\n\n959\n00:45:13,117 --> 00:45:17,175\nSo we talk about thinking about how,\nlet's say maybe, Adobe Acrobat and\n\n960\n00:45:17,175 --> 00:45:20,844\nperhaps Microsoft Word and also,\nperhaps, Internet Explorer or\n\n961\n00:45:20,844 --> 00:45:25,186\nGoogle Chrome would run, each of them\nrequire dedicated resources, right?\n\n962\n00:45:25,186 --> 00:45:28,207\nThey require their own memory,\ntheir own processing cycles,\n\n963\n00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:31,100\ntheir own dedicated access\nto the network interface.\n\n964\n00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,710\nSo they work up and down in various\nplaces across the hardware stack.\n\n965\n00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,188\nBut the idea of memory is very important,\nbecause memory is a finite resource.\n\n966\n00:45:38,188 --> 00:45:40,450\nEverything that's hardware-based\nis a finite resource,\n\n967\n00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:43,590\nbut memory in particular,\nyou only have so much of it.\n\n968\n00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:47,520\nAnd although we virtualize it, we try\nto offset the memory in the physical\n\n969\n00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,420\nallocation area by using\nthings like swap files, and\n\n970\n00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,010\nwe use a lot of different methods and\n\n971\n00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:56,510\nmechanisms to increase the overall amount\nof memory that's physically in the system.\n\n972\n00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:58,160\nAt the end of the day,\nit's a finite resource.\n\n973\n00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,260\nNo matter how we get there,\nthere's only so much of it.\n\n974\n00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:04,860\nAnd so if we can map it out,\nassign it to individual processes, and\n\n975\n00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:08,720\nas a result of that dedicate that memory\nat that moment in time when they need it\n\n976\n00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,920\nto that execution and\neffectively do that, right?\n\n977\n00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,200\nMove things in and out quickly,\ndo time slicing, say, okay,\n\n978\n00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,060\nshow up, tee up in here, so you're gonna\nbe in that on deck circle waiting to go.\n\n979\n00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,940\nRight, we're gonna call you in,\ndo your stuff, leave, so\n\n980\n00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,580\nthe straddle executor will get destroyed,\nwe'll create new ones.\n\n981\n00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:28,100\nAll this stuff leads us to this idea\nthat we're gonna more efficiently,\n\n982\n00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,550\nmore effectively allocate and\nmanage these resources.\n\n983\n00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:35,790\nSo, virtual address mapping is all about\nmaking sure that all processes that\n\n984\n00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:40,400\nexecute get their own memory spaces and\nhave dedicated resources to manage that.\n\n985\n00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,310\nThe memory manager is\nreally what does that.\n\n986\n00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:45,030\nThe memory manager says\noverarching process.\n\n987\n00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:47,820\nWe talk about the responsibilities there\nin just a minute, we'll come down to it.\n\n988\n00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,060\nThat effectively manages this\nvirtualized address spacing we do.\n\n989\n00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,940\nHey, you're gonna go over there,\nyou're gonna be over there.\n\n990\n00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,360\nThink of it like a stage manager,\nif you ever done any theater, or\n\n991\n00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,860\nyou see these behind the scenes things\nwhere they have the stage manager telling\n\n992\n00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,270\neverybody where to go and what to do.\n\n993\n00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,700\nThat's really what the memory manager is.\n\n994\n00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:09,110\nIt's the stage manager for the internal\nprocesses inside of the system.\n\n995\n00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:12,730\nSo the goals of the memory manager are to,\nas you can see there, provide for\n\n996\n00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:14,470\nan extraction level for programmers.\n\n997\n00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:17,990\nThis allows programmers to be able to\ncreate software, like Don was saying,\n\n998\n00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:20,960\nthat will do this multi-threading,\nthis multi-processing.\n\n999\n00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,060\nBut also as a result of this,\n\n1000\n00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:26,650\ntells them how to effectively write code\nin such a way that when they connect it\n\n1001\n00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:29,530\nup, the memory manager is going\nto be able to work with it.\n\n1002\n00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:32,470\nAs you were indicating, more effectively,\nand more efficiently manage that.\n\n1003\n00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:35,460\nMaximize performance with the limited\namount of memory there is available.\n\n1004\n00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,310\nGet every last little percentage\npoint of performance squeezed\n\n1005\n00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,160\nout that we possibly can.\n\n1006\n00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,580\nAnd protect the operating system and\n\n1007\n00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:44,520\napplications that are loaded in to\nmemory from becoming corrupted,\n\n1008\n00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,410\nfrom some how being modified, or\nin any way being tinkered with.\n\n1009\n00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,683\nSo the memory manager creates this bubble,\nI like to think of it as\n\n1010\n00:47:50,683 --> 00:47:54,491\na force field around all all the stuff\nhappening in memory, and locks access\n\n1011\n00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:58,378\nout from things that are not in kernel\nmode, that don't have direct access.\n\n1012\n00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:02,380\nIt really brokers that conversation,\nprevents corruption from taking place.\n\n1013\n00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:05,418\nSo, what are the five basic\nresponsibilities in memory manager?\n\n1014\n00:48:05,418 --> 00:48:08,425\nWe've detailed them out here for you.\n\n1015\n00:48:08,425 --> 00:48:09,556\nWe have relocation, so\n\n1016\n00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:12,820\nwe have swapping contents from\nRAM to the hard drive as needed.\n\n1017\n00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,540\nThis, effectively,\nis where we get our slop solution from.\n\n1018\n00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:19,630\nSo this is our virtual memory that's\nadded in as swap, or what we call paging.\n\n1019\n00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,201\nYou hear it referred to\nas different things.\n\n1020\n00:48:21,201 --> 00:48:25,060\nProvide pointers, so we kinda have\npointers that point to the applications,\n\n1021\n00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,570\nif their segments have been\nmoved to a different location.\n\n1022\n00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:31,410\nSo if we say, normally we're over here\nexecuting, but because we had to relocate\n\n1023\n00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:34,370\nyou quickly, we've put you over\nhere in memory, there's a pointer,\n\n1024\n00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:38,850\na virtual locator that effectively proxy's\nand points you to where you've gone to.\n\n1025\n00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,430\nThat relocation function,\n\n1026\n00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:44,290\nthe readdressing function is part of the\nmemory manager job, that's what it does.\n\n1027\n00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:47,480\nIt relocates and is constantly is\nmoving around things in memory\n\n1028\n00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,280\ncuz we want contiguous blocks of\nmemory for process execution, and\n\n1029\n00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,990\nfor prioritization,\noptimization of information management.\n\n1030\n00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:58,420\nAnd if we're scattered through the memory,\njust like scattered on a hard drive,\n\n1031\n00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:04,030\ndiscontiguous blocks but storage access\nslows down file access discontiguous,\n\n1032\n00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:08,620\nnot close together not sequential\nrandom access memory reads are going\n\n1033\n00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:11,650\nto be slower than sequential\nrandom access or RAM reads.\n\n1034\n00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,620\nSo as a result relocation is taking place\non the fly in real time all the time.\n\n1035\n00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:19,330\nProtection limit the processes\nhere really are we\n\n1036\n00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:22,430\nallowing them to interact with memory\nsegments that's they've been assigned to.\n\n1037\n00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,330\nSo, we have access control in effect.\n\n1038\n00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,160\nWe think about that from memory segments.\n\n1039\n00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,830\nSharing, we use basically complex\ncontrols to ensure integrity and\n\n1040\n00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,230\nconfidentiality that are going\nto be assigned there.\n\n1041\n00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,320\nSo, we specify this process\ncan share memory here but\n\n1042\n00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,160\nnot there, that kind of thing.\n\n1043\n00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,510\nA logical organization we\nsegment all the memory out and\n\n1044\n00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:43,430\nmemory types out and provide address and\nschemes for each of them.\n\n1045\n00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:46,510\nSo as a result things\nare going to be shared out and\n\n1046\n00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:50,280\nused by certain kinds of memory or for\ncertain kinds of memory in a certain way.\n\n1047\n00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,160\nSo I mention things like\nsoftware modules and DLLs etc.\n\n1048\n00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,660\nThey're gonna get assigned to certain\nkinds of memory in certain areas because\n\n1049\n00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,210\nthat's optimized for their performance and\nthat's what logical organization does.\n\n1050\n00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:04,230\nAnd then physical organization segments\nout the physical memory space for\n\n1051\n00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,000\nthe application on the operating system.\n\n1052\n00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,070\nRemember logical and\nphysical organization right, all memory\n\n1053\n00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:12,860\ntypes are logically addressed but\nalso physically are actually segmented.\n\n1054\n00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,900\nAnd we'll show you that when we actually\nshow you a RAM chip here in just a minute.\n\n1055\n00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,250\nAll right so probably a good place for\nus to do a little show and tell right.\n\n1056\n00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,080\n>> Sure absolutely.\n\n1057\n00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,710\nAlright, so.\n\n1058\n00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:22,482\n>> What do we got?\n\n1059\n00:50:22,482 --> 00:50:26,010\n>> Let's see.\n>> Throw some of those up there first?\n\n1060\n00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:28,420\n>> Sure.\nDo you wanna do ROM, or?\n\n1061\n00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,370\n>> No, let's leave that for\na little bit later,\n\n1062\n00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:35,800\nlet's do the RAM,\nmaybe look at the interface there.\n\n1063\n00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:36,470\n>> Yeah, cool.\n\n1064\n00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,430\nSo we just got a couple\nof ram sticks here and\n\n1065\n00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:42,810\nkeep in mind there are a ton\nof varieties of these.\n\n1066\n00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:46,950\nThese are the ones we've got right\nhere just to show you on screen but\n\n1067\n00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:51,440\nthere's probably at\nmarket right now at least\n\n1068\n00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,930\n20 different varieties of RAM that your\nPC or laptop or whatever you might use.\n\n1069\n00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:59,880\nSo these are just some examples here and\nyou'll see varieties.\n\n1070\n00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,910\nThey all work basically the same.\n\n1071\n00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:06,749\nYou'll have a row of copper leads\nthat allow the memory to plug\n\n1072\n00:51:06,749 --> 00:51:11,589\ninto the motherboard,\nwhich is basically extending the data\n\n1073\n00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:15,608\nbus from the motherboard\ninto the chip [CROSSTALK].\n\n1074\n00:51:15,608 --> 00:51:18,932\nAnd then on it you actually\nhave the RAM chips,\n\n1075\n00:51:18,932 --> 00:51:23,370\nthese little black circuits or\nwhat do we want to call those?\n\n1076\n00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:24,940\n>> Chips, memory chips, just chips.\n\n1077\n00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:28,570\n>> Yeah chips that is where the memory is\nall of the addressable space is right in\n\n1078\n00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:30,520\nthere that we write to\nelectromagnetically.\n\n1079\n00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,860\nWe put in positive and negative charges\non various fields and it's storing and\n\n1080\n00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,180\nable to recall that data when we need it.\n\n1081\n00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,580\nIt's all being stored in there.\n\n1082\n00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,150\nSometimes it's really visible\nlike on this memory stick.\n\n1083\n00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:44,580\nAnd you'll see it has chips on\nboth sides and that's because it's\n\n1084\n00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,610\nwell effectively getting twice\nthe amount of storage because of that.\n\n1085\n00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:51,060\nSometimes it's not very visible like\non this one where they might have\n\n1086\n00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,820\na heat spreader or\nsome other kind of shield attached to it.\n\n1087\n00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,590\nI don't know why they call them heat\nspreaders, instead of heat sinks,\n\n1088\n00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:58,340\non a memory stick.\n\n1089\n00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,750\nBut they seem to always do that.\n\n1090\n00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,290\nLet's come up with a new name for it.\n\n1091\n00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:07,180\nIf we were to rip this off of the top, and\nsomehow not completely damage the chip.\n\n1092\n00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,760\nIt's probably impossible,\nbut if we were to do that,\n\n1093\n00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,260\nunderneath this we would just see\nmore of these same chips again.\n\n1094\n00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,460\n>> But only as you showed already,\nonly single sided,\n\n1095\n00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,610\nbecause in this particular chip, right,\nwe don't see any memory on the back.\n\n1096\n00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:19,910\nAnd you know,\nI often think of these when I see,\n\n1097\n00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:22,150\nI used to love seeing these because\nthey're like, you know, so cool.\n\n1098\n00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:26,210\nLike, we have the normal out of the box\nram, we have the stealth ram, right?\n\n1099\n00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,498\nIt was kind of a hidden ram, right?\n\n1100\n00:52:27,498 --> 00:52:31,030\nWe don't wanna see what's going on inside,\nso we have the pretty cover\n\n1101\n00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:34,580\nthat effect as you said really was just\nfor heat distribution as opposed to\n\n1102\n00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,950\nanything else but again this\ndidn't really last for very long.\n\n1103\n00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:38,760\nYou don't tend to see rims these days.\n\n1104\n00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,540\nYou don't tend to see a lot of it\nwith this kind of stuff on it,\n\n1105\n00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:43,600\nit's an older stick and\nits single sided which is also\n\n1106\n00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,610\nindicative of being an older\ntechnology by today's standards.\n\n1107\n00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:50,740\nBut the idea was that you have these RAM\nchips and you know you would slot them and\n\n1108\n00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:54,530\nmaybe we can just show\nthe the motherboard in one form or\n\n1109\n00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:56,540\nanother kind of a newer motherboard.\n\n1110\n00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:01,760\nBut the idea would be that we would\nplug these in typically in this area.\n\n1111\n00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,344\n>> If its the right kind [CROSSTALK]\n>> And it may not fit but\n\n1112\n00:53:04,344 --> 00:53:05,510\njust generically.\n\n1113\n00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:09,450\nWe basically just plugged them in and\nthis part of the motherboard here so\n\n1114\n00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:12,930\nin this area and we'll, yeah I didn't\npress it in so I just wanted to do that.\n\n1115\n00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:14,870\nBut you know you could see it\nwould lock in place right, so\n\n1116\n00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:18,070\nwe would kinda press that down and\nnotch it so it would go like that.\n\n1117\n00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,430\nIt looks like it might actually fit.\n\n1118\n00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:22,170\nAnd then you know we would have,\nin this case, up to three slots for\n\n1119\n00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:27,000\nthe memory on the mother board and so we\ncould plug the different RAM chips in and\n\n1120\n00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:31,830\nbasically build up our allocation\nof memory there side by side.\n\n1121\n00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:35,360\nAnd if you have the patriotic one, you\ncould do the red white blue heat shield,\n\n1122\n00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:39,290\nand form the American flag, or\nwhatever colors you may want in there.\n\n1123\n00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:42,230\nBut that would be the idea for\nthe memory and so it would sit there, and\n\n1124\n00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,660\nthat's where you would\neffectively read it from.\n\n1125\n00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,460\nThis is the interactive area, so\nthis is where we make the connection to\n\n1126\n00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:50,170\nthe motherboard, the bus in other words,\nright, is what we're talking about here.\n\n1127\n00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:53,040\nAnd then we would have,\ntypically in this case anyway, our chip.\n\n1128\n00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:57,760\nIn this case our CPU would have gone here,\nit's a socket, so\n\n1129\n00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,750\nwe would plug it in there.\n\n1130\n00:53:58,750 --> 00:53:59,810\nThis is an older one right?\n\n1131\n00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:01,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> Then we would have that.\n\n1132\n00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:05,288\n>> And you know, you can really see it,\non the backside, if you flip over,\n\n1133\n00:54:05,288 --> 00:54:07,360\nyou can see all the circuit traces.\n\n1134\n00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,930\nAnd so you can see over here where.\n\n1135\n00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:10,065\n>> This is the right here.\n\n1136\n00:54:10,065 --> 00:54:11,530\n>> Exactly.\nAnd see the CPU.\n\n1137\n00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:15,080\nAnd notice the hundreds\nof little copper lines.\n\n1138\n00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,150\nThey don't look copper because\nthis is all coated in some red.\n\n1139\n00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:21,400\n>> Goo.\n>> But basically there is a ton of these\n\n1140\n00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,140\nlines that are running through.\n\n1141\n00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,340\nFrom the CPU over to memory.\n\n1142\n00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:28,320\nAnd you'll see from the CPU\nrunning back to here, and\n\n1143\n00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,230\nthose are gonna be part of our inner ups,\nyou know,\n\n1144\n00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:33,280\nthat's allowing these cards to\nphysically call on to the processor.\n\n1145\n00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,240\nBut the majority of them\nwill run right through here.\n\n1146\n00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,810\nIf we were to flip this over, that's\ngonna be the chip set for the board.\n\n1147\n00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:42,100\nThat's that central heart of the mother\nboard that's allowing all these\n\n1148\n00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,530\ncomponents to communicate.\n\n1149\n00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:48,022\nSo you get a neater perspective when\nyou look at the back side of the board.\n\n1150\n00:54:48,022 --> 00:54:52,980\n>> So for those of you that are sci-fi\nfans, or are in to that whole genre,\n\n1151\n00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:56,030\nyou will hopefully be thinking\nabout something like Tron, right.\n\n1152\n00:54:56,030 --> 00:55:00,270\nSo the original and the new, updated one,\nI prefer the original one myself,\n\n1153\n00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,590\nthought it was a little bit cooler.\n\n1154\n00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:04,670\nBut the idea of the movie Tron where\nthey basically take you inside Computer.\n\n1155\n00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:09,630\nIn effect you're seeing it from eye level\ninside that point of view perspective\n\n1156\n00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:13,280\nwhere you're actually inside the system\nand you're effectively running through all\n\n1157\n00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,790\nthese activities as you go through the\nmovie down in the microprocessing level,\n\n1158\n00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:18,300\nyou down in the circuit so to speak.\n\n1159\n00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,960\nSo kinda interesting stuff.\n\n1160\n00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,720\nThe CMOS battery would have been,\nI don't know if you can see it over there,\n\n1161\n00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,890\nwould have been like sitting here, so\n\n1162\n00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:25,410\nthis obviously would have\npowered this whole thing.\n\n1163\n00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:28,270\nBecause some of the stuff\nthat we put into the system\n\n1164\n00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:31,450\ndid require power even though\nwe would power off the computer,\n\n1165\n00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:33,485\nwould still require power\nto still maintain itself.\n\n1166\n00:55:33,485 --> 00:55:34,780\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So that would have been like,\n\n1167\n00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,220\nalmost like a\n>> Watch battery?\n\n1168\n00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:39,610\n>> Probably like a nickel-sized battery,\nsitting in there.\n\n1169\n00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,580\nGood for about five years on average.\n\n1170\n00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:44,490\nThat would have powered certain other\nfunctions on the motherboard even though\n\n1171\n00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,180\nwe would power off, physically,\n\n1172\n00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:49,750\nthe computer itself would still\nmaintain certain amount of power there.\n\n1173\n00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,138\nSo that's just something to point out.\n\n1174\n00:55:51,138 --> 00:55:52,865\nThen we had other connection points,\nright, for\n\n1175\n00:55:52,865 --> 00:55:54,724\nsome other stuff in here,\nkind of what we're doing.\n\n1176\n00:55:54,724 --> 00:55:57,918\nBut just thought it would be\ninteresting for you to take a look at,\n\n1177\n00:55:57,918 --> 00:55:59,092\nkinda see some of this.\n\n1178\n00:55:59,092 --> 00:56:02,008\nAnd, their will be a quiz\nat the end of this.\n\n1179\n00:56:02,008 --> 00:56:06,285\nAnybody who can rightly identify what\nthis particular little item right over\n\n1180\n00:56:06,285 --> 00:56:06,975\nhere does.\n\n1181\n00:56:06,975 --> 00:56:11,150\nBut we just wanted to show you exactly\nwhat we were talking about as we talk\n\n1182\n00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:15,280\nthrough some of this hardware, to give you\na visual representation of some of this.\n\n1183\n00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,592\nBecause most of us have probably\nlooked inside of a computer before,\n\n1184\n00:56:19,592 --> 00:56:22,190\nmay have even taken one apart and\nput it back together.\n\n1185\n00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:25,000\nBut you may not have, and\nit's never good to assume these things.\n\n1186\n00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,970\nA lot of CISSPs come up through the ranks,\nso to speak, and have a background with\n\n1187\n00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:32,510\nthis and probably have done some of\nthe physical hands-on stuff like\n\n1188\n00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:36,110\nbuilding computers or perhaps just having\nto tinker at home and serviced them.\n\n1189\n00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:40,030\nBut you know today, laptops are a lot more\nprevalent, tablets a lot more prevalent.\n\n1190\n00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,690\nYou may not actually have a desktop.\n\n1191\n00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,180\nYou may just be one of those people\nthat just really doesn't have an office,\n\n1192\n00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:45,880\ndoesn't have a desktop.\n\n1193\n00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,360\nAnd you may never have\nlooked inside a computer and\n\n1194\n00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,900\njust seen what one looked like,\nat least not up close.\n\n1195\n00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:54,320\nMaybe off YouTube or something, but\nyou're not seeing it really up close, so\n\n1196\n00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,970\nyou may never have really understood\nwhat those connections were and\n\n1197\n00:56:56,970 --> 00:56:58,300\nhow they worked and what they were for.\n\n1198\n00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,172\nSo we just thought it might be\nhelpful to show them to you.\n\n1199\n00:57:01,172 --> 00:57:04,900\nAll right, very good, so\nI think that's a little cool piece there.\n\n1200\n00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,782\n>> And you know, that's probably\na good spot for us to stop.\n\n1201\n00:57:07,782 --> 00:57:09,340\nWe've talked about processes and memory.\n\n1202\n00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,210\nWe have a lot of other\ncomponents to get to,\n\n1203\n00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:14,060\nbut I think what we're going to\ndo is we're gonna wrap up here.\n\n1204\n00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:17,270\nThen we'll do a part two,\nand probably a part three,\n\n1205\n00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:19,430\nwith the amount of information we've got.\n\n1206\n00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:22,250\nAdam, did you have any other pearls of\nwisdom we wanted to throw out before we\n\n1207\n00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:23,210\nwrapped up?\n\n1208\n00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,320\n>> Just to remember, and\n\n1209\n00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:28,000\nthis is one of those areas inside of\nthe body of knowledge, that really\n\n1210\n00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,730\nI think it's very appropriate to say this,\nwhich is there's so much material.\n\n1211\n00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:35,150\nYou've heard me and Don, but especially\nDon, referring to this idea that\n\n1212\n00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:39,720\nthere's more to come, building that\nsuspense for future discussions.\n\n1213\n00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,560\nThere's so much stuff here,\nyou could get lost in the details.\n\n1214\n00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,690\nAnd what we want you to really understand\nas you look to be preparing and\n\n1215\n00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:49,050\nbe successful around this is,\nkeep that right level of focus.\n\n1216\n00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:52,510\nWe're throwing a lot of vocabulary at you,\nshowing you a lot of things, but\n\n1217\n00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,790\nput it in perspective.\n\n1218\n00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:56,740\nIt's part of an overarching system,\na holistic approach.\n\n1219\n00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,530\nYou don't have to know\nthe individual nuts and\n\n1220\n00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:01,810\nbolts of something specific like\nexactly what kinda register.\n\n1221\n00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:05,860\nBut just generically for example, what the\nidea of a register represents overall is\n\n1222\n00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:09,430\nprobably the right level of knowledge\nto take away from our discussions.\n\n1223\n00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:12,030\n>> All right, well, ladies and gentleman,\nlet me just remind everybody

of ITProTV, my name is Mike, and\n\n4\n00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:39,158\nwith me is today is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n5\n00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:40,190\nHow you doing Adam?\n\n6\n00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,880\n>> I'm famously, famously well.\n\n7\n00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,260\n>> Famously well, I like it.\n\n8\n00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,250\nYou are a famous person, too.\n\n9\n00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,125\n>> You know, that's the rumor and\nthe threat I hear from time to time.\n\n10\n00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,960\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well glad to\nhave had everybody with us today.\n\n11\n00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,600\nWe are heading into part two of security,\narchitecture and design.\n\n12\n00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,570\nSecurity, architecture and design.\n\n13\n00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,420\nSo, sit back, relax and let's dive into\nsome of this wonderful world of CISSP.\n\n14\n00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,680\n>> Get out your Etch A Sketches,\nwe're going to create some designs.\n\n15\n00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,580\nThat was the original\nVizio concept by the way,\n\n16\n00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,130\nbefore we had Vizio you\nhad an Etch A Sketch.\n\n17\n00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,740\n>> I wonder if I still\nhave my Etch A Sketch.\n\n18\n00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,880\n>> Diagram didn't last for too long,\nbut at least you caught it.\n\n19\n00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,850\n>> As long as you didn't shake it.\n\n20\n00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,080\n>> As long as you didn't shake it,\nyou were okay.\n\n21\n00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,842\nExactly.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n22\n00:01:18,842 --> 00:01:20,570\n>> All right, so we're going to spend some\n\n23\n00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,010\ntime continuing to move through our\n\n24\n00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,130\nvocabulary around security\narchitecture and design.\n\n25\n00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,520\n>> Do you have some notes for us?\n\n26\n00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,231\n>> Yeah we do have absolutely\nwe'll take a look at those.\n\n27\n00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:30,463\n>> [CROSSTALK] Say that yeah this time I\nwould give you the credit where credit\n\n28\n00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:31,882\nis due because-\n>> I appreciate that.\n\n29\n00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:35,340\n>> Adam took the pleasure,\ntook the time to type these all up for us.\n\n30\n00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,100\n>> I did, I did.\n\n31\n00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,884\n>> He got tired of watching me make\nmy mistakes [LAUGH] and my typos.\n\n32\n00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:39,495\n>> I did.\n\n33\n00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:42,080\nNow, we probably need to,\nit looks like we need to deal with\n\n34\n00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,640\nthe screen resolution on\nthe truncation on some of those.\n\n35\n00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,670\nCuz we're getting cut off.\n\n36\n00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,540\n>> Yeah we are doing a little wrapping,\naren't we?\n\n37\n00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,220\n>> Yeah, do you want to do word wrap, or\n\n38\n00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,870\njust set that up real\nquick while we're talking?\n\n39\n00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,420\n>> We can try and\nsee if I can find word wrap.\n\n40\n00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,750\n>> Mikes just going to fix that up\nreal quick while we're talking, so\n\n41\n00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,190\nyeah, we'll just talk in the meantime,\nwe'll just come back to that.\n\n42\n00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,102\nNo big deal.\n>> Very good.\n\n43\n00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:03,730\n>> So what we wanted to do is figure out,\nor excuse me,\n\n44\n00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,820\ntalk a bit more about some of\nthe building blocks, right?\n\n45\n00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,175\nComponents that are going to help\nus make up the building blocks, and\n\n46\n00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:11,625\nultimately the secure systems,\n\n47\n00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:15,715\nthe architectures that will be secure,\nbased on these foundational elements.\n\n48\n00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:19,665\nIn our last discussions,\nwe had been talking about the processors.\n\n49\n00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:21,045\nWe talked about the registers.\n\n50\n00:02:21,045 --> 00:02:21,905\nWe talked about memory.\n\n51\n00:02:21,905 --> 00:02:24,215\nWe talked about all this\ndifferent kind of stuff.\n\n52\n00:02:24,215 --> 00:02:26,765\nSo DLL is Dynamic Link Libraries,\n\n53\n00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:30,200\nare going to be the things we really\nwant to spend some time talking about.\n\n54\n00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,420\nSo this idea of basically, DLL,\nis you know, instead of files.\n\n55\n00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,400\nRight?\nUltimately, one or\n\n56\n00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,690\nmore file,\nthat are gonna to be digitally signed,\n\n57\n00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,740\ntypically we talked about digital\nsignatures as being important.\n\n58\n00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,110\nBut, the idea here,\nbasically at a rock bottom level,\n\n59\n00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,490\nis that they're ultimately\ngoing to be these common files.\n\n60\n00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,654\nThese files that we share,\nthat we have available.\n\n61\n00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:52,936\nAnd they're used by more or\none application, or service.\n\n62\n00:02:52,936 --> 00:02:54,550\nAnd they are going to be interacting.\n\n63\n00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,730\nAnd so we have common DLLs\nin the operating system for\n\n64\n00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,960\ninstance that allow us\nto create functionality.\n\n65\n00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,480\nThings like print drivers,\nvideo drivers, things of that nature.\n\n66\n00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,790\nAnd then they're used by a multitude\nof programs so if we need for\n\n67\n00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,190\ninstance to do maybe a display, a video\ndisplay of something on the screen in\n\n68\n00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,150\ndifferent resolutions with different\nfonts or things of that nature.\n\n69\n00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,030\nThen maybe a common set of DLLs that\nare going to allow us to do that,\n\n70\n00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,540\nacross multiple software platforms.\n\n71\n00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,160\n>> Yeah.\nAnd that way I don't have to rewrite them\n\n72\n00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,490\nevery time I write a new application or\nsomething like that.\n\n73\n00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,000\nAlthough it can give us\na little bit of trouble now and\n\n74\n00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,680\nagain when applications fight over.\n\n75\n00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,240\nTry to update on there.\n\n76\n00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,580\n>> There could be an issue,\nyou swap one out,\n\n77\n00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,340\nit's one of the big things we used to\nhave with Windows 95 and Windows 98.\n\n78\n00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,160\nWhere you would take out the original\nWindows 95 A, version B,\n\n79\n00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,050\nor version C DLLs that came with the OS,\nyou effectively would swap them out and\n\n80\n00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,090\nupdate them when you did\nsoftware installs or patches.\n\n81\n00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,630\nYou know Microsoft Office, for instance,\nwould share DLLs, and as a result if you\n\n82\n00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,750\nremoved one version, added another,\nyou sometimes left behind certain things.\n\n83\n00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,280\nYou always get those prompts, are you\nsure you want to remove everything?\n\n84\n00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,630\nIt doesn't look like you're using it,\nwe're not real sure.\n\n85\n00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,160\nSo, as a result,\ndepending on what you did, you may or\n\n86\n00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,370\nmay not run into a problem there.\n\n87\n00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,370\nA little bit better these days,\nwe don't tend to see as much of that.\n\n88\n00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,530\nA lot of those libraries are digitally\nsigned and protected it now.\n\n89\n00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,830\nThe systems are self-healing, so we have\nhidden driver caches where we can restore\n\n90\n00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,870\nthe DLLs from basically\na hidden compressed cache.\n\n91\n00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,850\nThat's in the root of the OS in real time,\nso even if you destroy one, or remove one,\n\n92\n00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,720\nit's put back.\n\n93\n00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,843\nSo it's a lot of self-healing,\n\n94\n00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:25,150\nself-protection mechanisms that\nweren't available back in the day.\n\n95\n00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,260\nBase registers, this idea of the beginning\naddress space that we assign to a process.\n\n96\n00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,890\nWe make sure that as a result\nof using a base register,\n\n97\n00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,820\nwe don't allow processes to make requests\noutside of their memory boundary.\n\n98\n00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,280\nThe idea there is basically\nas a result of that.\n\n99\n00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,730\nThat ultimately we give the amount of\nmemory that we assign to a system.\n\n100\n00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,630\nAnd then within that system the physical\nmemory, we carve that up, we give certain\n\n101\n00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,380\namount of that logical memory or\nthe address space that create to programs.\n\n102\n00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,210\nTo services, the things as they execute.\n\n103\n00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,990\nWe want to keep them boxed in there,\nwe don't want them bleeding out and\n\n104\n00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,360\ngetting into other areas.\n\n105\n00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,600\nCuz that causes conflicts,\n\n106\n00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,650\nthings happen, all sorts of\nbad things happen as a result.\n\n107\n00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:05,280\nIf you grew up with brothers and sisters,\nyou know that whole idea of having dinner\n\n108\n00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,320\nat the dinner table and if you're\nthe scrawny little last one that gets to\n\n109\n00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,820\nthe table, you always wind up\nhaving to share with everybody.\n\n110\n00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,990\nYou don't get anything you want.\n\n111\n00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,830\nAnd so this idea of base registers is\nreally like dedicating resources to\n\n112\n00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,760\neach individual solution as we go.\n\n113\n00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,970\nVery important from\nan architecture perspective,\n\n114\n00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,900\nbecause again think about the security\nelements we're talking about here.\n\n115\n00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,860\nWe have to be able to isolate process,\nisolate memory in order to ensure\n\n116\n00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,850\nthat one thing cannot get into\nthe memory space with another, and\n\n117\n00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,150\npotentially suck the information out of\nit, manipulate it, inject things into it.\n\n118\n00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,060\nAll sorts of bad things can happen here.\n\n119\n00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,950\nAnd so base registers and\nlimit registers as well.\n\n120\n00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,840\nThe base registers the beginning\nof the address page,\n\n121\n00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,060\nthe limit registers the end\nof the address space.\n\n122\n00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,240\nSame idea,\nthey're basically going to work together.\n\n123\n00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,220\nThey're just book ends, right?\n\n124\n00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,120\nOne is the starting point,\none's the ending point.\n\n125\n00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,310\nJust the boundary, exactly.\n\n126\n00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,480\nAnd so we need those because that's\ngoing to block off that memory space and\n\n127\n00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,500\ndedicate it ultimately to that\nparticular solution that we're running.\n\n128\n00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,640\nSo, very important as a construct as well.\n\n129\n00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,219\nAll right, so\nwe have our memory protection issues.\n\n130\n00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,710\nWhat are some of the concerns that we\nhave to really address when we talk\n\n131\n00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,320\nmemory protection is what\nwe are talking about here.\n\n132\n00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,830\nEvery address reference is validated\nin order to create protection so\n\n133\n00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,600\nwe don't allow things to address memory.\n\n134\n00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,206\nIf it's coming from an invalid or\na not proper point of reference.\n\n135\n00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:22,560\nSo we constantly are boundary checking,\nwe're constantly logically checking and\n\n136\n00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,090\nphysically checking to make sure\nthis memory address is correct.\n\n137\n00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,830\nTwo or more processes can\nshare access to same segment\n\n138\n00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,910\nwith potentially different access rights\nso we allow different access levels.\n\n139\n00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,940\nYou know some have have full control,\nread, write.\n\n140\n00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,200\nOthers may be read only,\nwrite to that level only so they can see.\n\n141\n00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,420\nCan't make changes to the memory space or\nthe data in real time,\n\n142\n00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,960\nand if you think about the logic of that,\nit makes a lot of sense.\n\n143\n00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,790\nThere may be a core process,\ntypically an unattended network process\n\n144\n00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,710\nthat will create a lot of\nstuff in that memory space.\n\n145\n00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,270\nBut then there's a lot of other\nprocesses that will simply output and\n\n146\n00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,660\nconsume that content.\n\n147\n00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,800\nAnd so\nas a result they need read access but\n\n148\n00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,020\nthey don't need write\naccess to memory space.\n\n149\n00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,160\nDifferent instructions and\n\n150\n00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,510\ndata types can be assigned\ndifferent levels of protection.\n\n151\n00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:07,450\nWe can core isolate certain things\nin our kernel process, versus other\n\n152\n00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,260\nisolation mechanisms like user modes,\nwhere we allow different levels of access.\n\n153\n00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,420\nSo, this is the fundamental construct we\nsee, and then processes can not generate\n\n154\n00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,820\nan unpermitted address or\ngain access to an unpermitted segment.\n\n155\n00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,740\nMeaning we can't go in and\nget into that area,\n\n156\n00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,340\nremember it's marked basically off limits,\ninaccessible.\n\n157\n00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,270\nRight.\nAnd as a result,\n\n158\n00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,055\nif we think about that, the idea there is\nthat we mark certain ideas of the memory\n\n159\n00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:31,200\nits effect would be unwritable.\n\n160\n00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,540\nWe can't write to them,\nwe can't access them.\n\n161\n00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,510\nWe can safe guard certain functionalities,\ncertain things we have to put in there,\n\n162\n00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,380\nor hard code them and\nnot let them be modified in any way.\n\n163\n00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,020\nAnd as a result, we create these special\nisolation zones that are totally like,\n\n164\n00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,765\nheavily armored, totally protected, right?\n\n165\n00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:50,035\nCan't be modified, so this is what we're\nthinking about with memory protection.\n\n166\n00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:52,537\nThese are the issues that memory\nprotection helps us to address.\n\n167\n00:07:52,537 --> 00:07:55,138\nSo when we talk about memory,\nwe're talking about RAM.\n\n168\n00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:57,860\nTwo kinds of memory, we're talking\nabout RAM, Random Access Memory.\n\n169\n00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,404\nWe'll talk about ROM in a little bit.\n\n170\n00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:02,899\nRead only memory, different kinds of RAM,\ndifferent kinds of ROM.\n\n171\n00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,700\nEPROM, PROM, et cetera,\nflash, different kinds.\n\n172\n00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,210\nBut with RAM we're talking about memory\nsticks that are basically plugged in\n\n173\n00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,400\nto our motherboard, and\nin one of our last discussions in part one\n\n174\n00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,810\nwe actually had the motherboard\nup here if you remember.\n\n175\n00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,900\nKind of focused on it, we had the RAM\nchips out, we showed you what the memory\n\n176\n00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,960\nlooked like, showed you where it\nwould plug into the motherboard.\n\n177\n00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,340\nSo we plug those in,and they create\na volatile memory system, or memory space,\n\n178\n00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,630\nrather that the operating\nsystem can interact with.\n\n179\n00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,820\nSo there are some additional types of\nRAM that we want to be familiar with.\n\n180\n00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,300\nHolding up a RAM stick generically,\nyou may or may not be able to identify\n\n181\n00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,670\nexactly what this particular kind of RAM\nis because a lot of RAM will look similar.\n\n182\n00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:42,640\nSo you have to really not just look at\nit but, have to actually understand,\n\n183\n00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,250\nusually it is labeled, although\nsometimes it's hard to read what it is.\n\n184\n00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,900\nYou need the decoder\nring to figure it out.\n\n185\n00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,230\n>> But you're looking at that notch,\nwhere it's sitting and\n\n186\n00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,520\nhow many pins you've got overall and\nthings like that.\n\n187\n00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,260\n>> Right.\nYeah, absolutely.\n\n188\n00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,380\nSo you get little tweezers and\nyou start counting.\n\n189\n00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,730\nOne, oh darn, I gotta restart.\n\n190\n00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,230\n>> I just hold it up\nto the motherboard and\n\n191\n00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,060\nsay alright, does that notch line\nup with the pin on the motherboard?\n\n192\n00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,970\nThat must be the right one.\n\n193\n00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,610\n>> Exactly.\n\n194\n00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,453\nAnd the notch we're talking about,\njust so you know, and\n\n195\n00:09:07,453 --> 00:09:11,830\nmaybe If we could quickly do\noverhead again for just a second.\n\n196\n00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:13,710\nThe notch we're talking about there,\n\n197\n00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,680\nis going to be this notch\nthat's down at the bottom here.\n\n198\n00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,045\nAnd so, what we're seeing is, right here,\nis a notch In the memory, right there.\n\n199\n00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:23,218\nI know it's kind of hard to see.\n\n200\n00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:25,240\nI'm going to turn it up,\nit's probably not much better.\n\n201\n00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,900\nBut you can almost kinda\nsee it right here.\n\n202\n00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,370\nThis little notch right here,\nand then on this one.\n\n203\n00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,020\n>> Put it on that green surface.\n\n204\n00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,900\n>> Yeah I think we can kinda see it there,\nright yeah kinda at the bottom there.\n\n205\n00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,300\nRight there that's a notch, that's good.\n\n206\n00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,220\nAnd then these two right here,\nMike's kinda pointing too,\n\n207\n00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,100\nthose two notches right there,\nthis is obviously is different and so\n\n208\n00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,430\nthey fit in different types of slots on\nthe motherboard as a result are going mean\n\n209\n00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,020\nthat they are effectively different\narchitectures, different kinds of RAMs.\n\n210\n00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,210\nSo it's obviously important\nto be thinking about, right,\n\n211\n00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,450\nand just be aware of, so\nthat's what we're talking about there.\n\n212\n00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,680\nThe wonder of modern video transmission.\n\n213\n00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,230\n>> I know, Sky Cam.\n\n214\n00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,360\n>> All right, very cool\n>> So, we have different types.\n\n215\n00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,260\nLet's talk about what they are.\n\n216\n00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,370\nSo, synchronous DRAM,\nwhat we call SDRAM, you can see here,\n\n217\n00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:07,220\nsynchronizes itself with CPU and the\nsignal input and output on the RAM chip.\n\n218\n00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,690\nSo, they're kind of running\nside-by-side effect.\n\n219\n00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,480\nSo all the activities are basically\nset up according to the CPU clock.\n\n220\n00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,120\nSo the timing is basically gonna...\n\n221\n00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,040\nSynchronize up with the memory,\nand the CPU and\n\n222\n00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,780\nthe memory are in sync with one another.\n\n223\n00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,660\nThis obviously then will allow us to\nspeed up the transmission of data and\n\n224\n00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,970\nexecution of data to and from the RAM.\n\n225\n00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,270\nHowever, if you overclock your CPUs,\n\n226\n00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,930\nthen you run into issues where\nmaybe the RAM isn't gonna keep up.\n\n227\n00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,560\nThere's all these crazy\nthings that start happening.\n\n228\n00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,630\nYou gotta over clock the RAM,\n\n229\n00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,340\nyou burn the RAM out cuz it's\nnot meant to run that way.\n\n230\n00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,950\n>> You a big over clocker?\n\n231\n00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,590\n>> No, no I'm not.\n\n232\n00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,230\nNot really.\n\n233\n00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,260\n>> Just buy a new CPU when it's time.\n\n234\n00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:44,800\nIt's fun.\n\n235\n00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,650\n>> I firmly believe...\n\n236\n00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,780\nI mean, it is fun.\nI firmly believe,\n\n237\n00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,220\nI was never a big gamer,\nlet me put it that way.\n\n238\n00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,825\nI mean, I was but never like the kind\nof hardcore where I'd go out and\n\n239\n00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:52,170\nbuy a rig and do all that stuff.\n\n240\n00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,520\n>> You needed ten more frames per second.\n\n241\n00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,720\n>> Yeah, it just wasn't me.\n\n242\n00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,133\nIf I needed that, I was just willing\nto go to somebody who had it and\n\n243\n00:10:58,133 --> 00:11:00,820\njust kinda say this is what I need and\ncan borrow it?\n\n244\n00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,590\nIt was never me, but\n\n245\n00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,080\nI had a lot of friends growing\nup that did that kind of stuff.\n\n246\n00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,110\nBuilt their own computers.\n\n247\n00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,800\nI built my own computers when I was young.\n\n248\n00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,660\nI built a TRS-80.\n\n249\n00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,490\nYou remember the Trash 80s?\n\n250\n00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,900\nI built a Trash 80 and\nI still have my own original Atari.\n\n251\n00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,860\nI was talking about this with Don.\n\n252\n00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,090\n>> The old 2600?\n\n253\n00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,060\n>> Yeah, well I have one of those.\n\n254\n00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,840\nHave the original Play Stations and\nstuff so you know I had those.\n\n255\n00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,720\nI still do.\n\n256\n00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,350\nStill have all my original like\ndownhill skiing on the Atari.\n\n257\n00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:25,905\n>> Heck yeah.\n\n258\n00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:28,345\nLittle stick guy with a bear that\nwill come out and get you and so.\n\n259\n00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:28,895\n>> Battle Tanks.\n\n260\n00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,775\n>> All that kind of oh and the Asteroids,\nBattle Tank and Asteroids were cool.\n\n261\n00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,615\nSo that's the kind of stuff I grew up on.\n\n262\n00:11:33,615 --> 00:11:36,475\nSo it wasn't so\nmuch overclocking it was more like,\n\n263\n00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:39,735\nyou take that stuff apart and see what was\nrattling around inside the game cartridge.\n\n264\n00:11:39,735 --> 00:11:42,855\nAnd that's when you started seeing stuff\nlike silicone boards because that's some\n\n265\n00:11:42,855 --> 00:11:45,175\nof the first chips were in those things so\nI mean I remember Pong.\n\n266\n00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:45,795\n>> Oh yes.\n\n267\n00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:47,764\n>> First video game when it came\nout like the original [CROSSTALK].\n\n268\n00:11:47,764 --> 00:11:49,436\n>> Hooked it up to the UFH and\nyou had Tennis.\n\n269\n00:11:49,436 --> 00:11:50,156\n>> The original.\n\n270\n00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:52,970\n>> Or you had racquetball\nwith a paddle on one side.\n\n271\n00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,310\n>> Absolutely, I remember that\nthe first time it came around.\n\n272\n00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:00,060\nBefore I came back with the new ROMs\nthat you can now download and just do.\n\n273\n00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,520\nI remember Pong 1.0 as\nopposed to Pong 2.0.\n\n274\n00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,110\nYeah, I never did that stuff.\n\n275\n00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,022\nBut I do know, obviously,\na lot of people that do it.\n\n276\n00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:07,830\n[INAUDIBLE] It's good,\n\n277\n00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,370\nbut the idea is that at the end of\nthe day, you're basically burning out that\n\n278\n00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,070\nequipment much quicker\nthan it's meant to run.\n\n279\n00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,176\nBecause the heat is really the most\nimportant element there, and\n\n280\n00:12:14,176 --> 00:12:15,988\nyour overclocking is basically\nrunning it [CROSSTALK].\n\n281\n00:12:15,988 --> 00:12:16,882\n>> Sending more voltage.\n\n282\n00:12:16,882 --> 00:12:18,869\n>> More voltage,\nyou're creating more heat, and\n\n283\n00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:22,454\nultimately unless you have the super duper\nhigh end cooling system, you're just going\n\n284\n00:12:22,454 --> 00:12:25,950\nto fry those electronics and over time\nyou're going to blow that system up.\n\n285\n00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,650\nSo extend the data out DRAM.\n\n286\n00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,150\n>> Sorry,\ndidn't mean to side track us there.\n\n287\n00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,435\n>> No that's okay,\nsome of it's good stuff.\n\n288\n00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:31,880\nIt's part of the conversation.\n\n289\n00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,960\nSo extend the data out DRAM, or\nwhat we call EDO DRAM, right?\n\n290\n00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,500\nYou know, pretty popular thing.\n\n291\n00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,785\nFaster than normal DRAM because\nthe DRAM can access only one\n\n292\n00:12:40,785 --> 00:12:43,555\nblock of data as a time standard DRAM,\nthe SDRAM.\n\n293\n00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:47,154\nWhereas EDO DRAM can capture the next\nblock while the first block's being sent\n\n294\n00:12:47,154 --> 00:12:49,620\nout, so\nit's almost like we're doing one of these.\n\n295\n00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,400\nWe're sending one out and\nwe're reaching back to get the next one.\n\n296\n00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,880\nNow we're doing one of these as we go and\n\n297\n00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,890\nwe're constantly bringing in\nnew frames in, in effect.\n\n298\n00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,270\nSo we're doing one of these really quickly\nwhere we're constantly feeding, so\n\n299\n00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,220\nthat extended EDO Ram is\nactually much quicker.\n\n300\n00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,580\nAnd so it has kind of a,\nalmost a look ahead buffer.\n\n301\n00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,880\nWhich is kind of interesting.\n\n302\n00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,020\nBurst EDO RAM, or\nwhat we call BETO, or BEDO, right?\n\n303\n00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,185\nSo this idea of works basically\nlike the EDO RAM concept here but\n\n304\n00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:16,764\nit basically goes out.\n\n305\n00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:18,366\nWe have a little spacing issue there,\nmaybe.\n\n306\n00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:19,527\nFix number four there, yeah.\n\n307\n00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:23,067\nSo, you could just transmit data to\nCPU as it carries that read option,\n\n308\n00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:26,360\nbut it bursts so it actually\nsends more data out in real time.\n\n309\n00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,680\nSo it's not just reaching back and\nbuffering but\n\n310\n00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,170\nit's actually bursting\na lot of data forward.\n\n311\n00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:35,250\nSo, it's basically able to do, as we see\nhere, up to four memory addresses and\n\n312\n00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,140\na very small number of clock cycles,\nso it's almost,\n\n313\n00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,710\nlike, double the speed of normal vEDO RAM,\nso it's actually faster.\n\n314\n00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,889\nAnd then there's double raked SDRAM or\nwhat we call a DDR.\n\n315\n00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,854\nSD RAM, or just DDR often for short.\n\n316\n00:13:45,854 --> 00:13:49,869\nPeople just say DDR and DDR3, and there's\nall these different kinds of RAM now.\n\n317\n00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:53,158\nBut it basically carries out the read and\nrise, or read excuse me,\n\n318\n00:13:53,158 --> 00:13:56,174\nread operations on the rise and\nfall cycles of a clock pulse.\n\n319\n00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:59,765\nSo we have this wave that's going up like\nthis, [CROSSTALK] that's twice per clock\n\n320\n00:13:59,765 --> 00:14:03,058\nright, so it doubles it effectively up and\ndown on the wave and the trough.\n\n321\n00:14:03,058 --> 00:14:05,170\nOr the trough and the peak,\nrather, on the wave.\n\n322\n00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,340\nSo that's what it does.\n\n323\n00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,266\nSo it's just going out, and\nit does it basically twice, right,\n\n324\n00:14:08,266 --> 00:14:09,740\nit doubles the carrying\ncapacity of the RAM.\n\n325\n00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,580\nSo lots of different opportunities there.\n\n326\n00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,710\nWhat I would make sure I'm focused on and\nfamiliar with here\n\n327\n00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:19,500\nis I'd want to generally know that there\nare several different kinds of RAM.\n\n328\n00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,650\nI'd want to be passingly familiar\n\n329\n00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,420\nwith the fact that there are different\ntechnologies at play here.\n\n330\n00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,964\nI would not invest a huge amount of time\nin becoming the RAM master if I was you.\n\n331\n00:14:31,964 --> 00:14:33,010\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n332\n00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,870\n>> But I would want to know that it's not\njust a matter of if I take a chip and\n\n333\n00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,340\nplug it into the motherboard, and I think\nit's called RAM and that about all I know.\n\n334\n00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,480\nI'd wanna know that there's SDRAM,\nDD RAM, and you know, DDR RAM rather.\n\n335\n00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,130\nAnd I'd wanna know the main difference,\nwhich is how we basically read ahead and,\n\n336\n00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,990\nor cycle by synchronization through\ncarrying out the exchange or\n\n337\n00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,290\nthe processing of information.\n\n338\n00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,030\nThat would be important for me to know,\n\n339\n00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,240\nif I was getting ready to prepare in order\nto answer some questions in this area.\n\n340\n00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,254\nSo we have thrashing, this idea of\nthrashing is where your computer goes out\n\n341\n00:15:04,254 --> 00:15:06,590\nand it listens to a lot\nof heavy metal music.\n\n342\n00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,000\n>> I was just gonna say,\nis this a mosh pit?\n\n343\n00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,670\nIs that what this is?\n\n344\n00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,510\n>> This is a mosh pit,\nyour computer's jumping in.\n\n345\n00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,780\nAnd got your little devices, mobile\ndevices in there fighting to be seen.\n\n346\n00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,550\nThey get up on top,\nriding the wave, right.\n\n347\n00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,380\nNo, so what we've got here is\nthe computer spends more time moving data\n\n348\n00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,630\nfrom one portion of memory to\nanother than actually processing.\n\n349\n00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,960\nSo, this is literally where\nyou have a hard drive light,\n\n350\n00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,520\npretty much never goes off.\n\n351\n00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,030\nAnd if the hard drive is bad,\nwe often say it's thrashing as well,\n\n352\n00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:33,220\nor knocking, because you hear that riding\nclick, that racket going back and forth.\n\n353\n00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:36,055\nBut basically it's the,\nidea that we have so much going on and\n\n354\n00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:39,425\nsuch a little amount of memory processing\ncapability for whatever reason,\n\n355\n00:15:39,425 --> 00:15:41,795\nthat we're basically just all we're\ndoing is copying we're not really.\n\n356\n00:15:41,795 --> 00:15:43,826\n>> Swapping and [CROSSTALK]\n>> We're not actually processing anything.\n\n357\n00:15:43,826 --> 00:15:47,764\nSo when we have to rely almost exclusively\non swap because we're out of physical\n\n358\n00:15:47,764 --> 00:15:51,584\nmemory and we're in the virtual memory\nside, we tend to talk about thrashing\n\n359\n00:15:51,584 --> 00:15:54,970\nhappening a great deal, so\nthat's something to be aware of there.\n\n360\n00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,030\nROM, read only memory,\nis considered non-volatile.\n\n361\n00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,060\nRAM, random access memory,\nis considered volatile.\n\n362\n00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,760\nIt will be losing, it loses whatever\nis stored in RAM when you power down.\n\n363\n00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,450\nSo if you turn off the machine,\n\n364\n00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,270\nthen we lose all the capabilities\nto understand what was there.\n\n365\n00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,050\nBut ROM is not going to lose\nwhat is stored in the ROM\n\n366\n00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,710\nwhen we power down because\nit is burned in as we say.\n\n367\n00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,504\nMeaning we manipulate the data\nstorage of that chip and,\n\n368\n00:16:20,504 --> 00:16:24,160\nin fact, we freeze it by burning it in\nwith voltage or whatever we will do.\n\n369\n00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,730\nThere's ultraviolet light that\ncould be used to do rewrites and\n\n370\n00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,598\nthings like that depending\non the kind of ROM.\n\n371\n00:16:28,598 --> 00:16:31,165\nAnd we talked about the different\nkinds of ROM that are down there.\n\n372\n00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:33,615\nEP-ROM, or erasable programmable ROM,\n\n373\n00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:37,570\nuses a ultraviolet light reader to\nbe able to through it and reset it.\n\n374\n00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,710\n>> Be able to peel back, and flash.\n\n375\n00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,640\nIt's where the term flashing came from.\n\n376\n00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,490\n>> Flash the ultraviolet light, right,\n\n377\n00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,150\nthe little wand at it so when you're in\nthe club doing all the black light stuff.\n\n378\n00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,760\nFlashing your ROM back and forth.\n\n379\n00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,915\n>> Nate's got the glow\nstick swinging around.\n\n380\n00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:52,700\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, good times, good times.\n\n381\n00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,540\nAll right, so\nwe have different kinds of ROM.\n\n382\n00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,340\nSo ROM chips are gonna be ROM chips.\n\n383\n00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,540\nAnd, if we could just quickly\ndo the overhead again.\n\n384\n00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,500\nMaybe, just show everybody what a ROM\nchip looks like by comparison, there.\n\n385\n00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,980\nSo maybe, throw a RAM chip out\nthere as well, just so we can see.\n\n386\n00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,920\nThe big one, as we had talked about\nhere early on is the RAM, right here.\n\n387\n00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,970\nSo this is RAM.\n\n388\n00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,890\n>> And could we see here,\nby comparison, this is a ROM chip.\n\n389\n00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,000\nAnd, you know what, we can see,\nif I can manipulate this thing properly,\n\n390\n00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,210\nif I put it over here\nnext to the RAM chip.\n\n391\n00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,220\nIt's roughly the same width, and\n\n392\n00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,390\nalmost is identical to just one\nof the individual RAM chips.\n\n393\n00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,290\nBut, it's an individual chip.\n\n394\n00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,860\nIt effectively get's slotted\ninto the motherboard.\n\n395\n00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,080\nIt's got the little prongs on the bottom\nwhere we actually will put it in and\n\n396\n00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,490\nyou plug this thing in and\nthen it basically is there.\n\n397\n00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,915\n>> Right.\n>> And so this is self programmed,\n\n398\n00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:39,760\nmeaning it's burned in ahead of time.\n\n399\n00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,050\nAnd so somebody programs this thing,\nand effectively sends it out.\n\n400\n00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,570\nAnd then, you may or may not rewrite it,\nit really just depends on what we're doing\n\n401\n00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,980\nbut the ROM chip is used to\nbasically store information or\n\n402\n00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,970\nthings that have to go into memory that\nare no longer going to a change, but\n\n403\n00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,840\nare rather going to be hard coded.\n\n404\n00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,000\nWe often think of things like\nflash memory this way, so for\n\n405\n00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,580\ninstance, our micro SD cards, right,\nthat we may put in our phones today.\n\n406\n00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,030\nThings like that are going\nto be usable and reusable so\n\n407\n00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,255\nthose are flash memory, but\nwe also have just generic ROM chips.\n\n408\n00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,263\nSo we have a little bit\nof difference there.\n\n409\n00:18:13,263 --> 00:18:15,025\nSo programmable, read-only memory,\n\n410\n00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:18,437\nwe call PROM, is basically a form\nof ROM that can be modified.\n\n411\n00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:21,805\nYou typically flash the BIOS with\na software upgrade to do that.\n\n412\n00:18:21,805 --> 00:18:25,710\nYou download the BIOS utility, right,\nor something like that, you flash it.\n\n413\n00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,000\nNot that same thing as flashing with\nthe ultraviolet light, different kind, but\n\n414\n00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,670\nthe name kind of stuck generically.\n\n415\n00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,340\n>> Electronically now.\n\n416\n00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,685\n>> Yeah, electronically, but\n\n417\n00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:35,278\njust just generically refers\nto any of updating the ROM.\n\n418\n00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:38,559\nAnd then erasable, programmable\nread-only memory we call EPROM.\n\n419\n00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,030\nCould be erased, modified, upgraded.\n\n420\n00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,070\nThis is typically going to be done again\nwith an ultra violet light source of some\n\n421\n00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,795\nkind or electrical source, depends on the\nnature of the EPROM and how it's set up.\n\n422\n00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,010\nBut you can basically reprogram,\n\n423\n00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,630\nit's like a rewritable CDROM or\nrewritable DVD media.\n\n424\n00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,240\nAnd then flash memory,\nas we talked about special kind of memory.\n\n425\n00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240\nYou can go in, things like the BIOS chips,\nfor instance, can be flashed,\n\n426\n00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,630\nthat's why we talked\nabout them being flashed.\n\n427\n00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,160\nWe also talk about the idea that memory\ncards are there, video game consoles,\n\n428\n00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,070\nany of that kind of stuff you can rewrite\nover time, will fall into this area.\n\n429\n00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,110\nSo that's it.\n\n430\n00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,050\nSo those are the different kinds of ROMs.\n\n431\n00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,980\nRight, the hard coded ones\nthat are not rewritable, and\n\n432\n00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,070\nthen the ones that are ultimately.\n\n433\n00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,580\nAll right, so hardware segmentation.\n\n434\n00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,450\nLet's talk about hardware segmentation.\n\n435\n00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,450\nThis idea of physically mapping software\ninto an individual memory segment is what\n\n436\n00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,370\nthey call hardware segmentation.\n\n437\n00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,095\nSo this idea of being able to say\nthis particular application or\n\n438\n00:19:31,095 --> 00:19:35,959\npiece of software is going to run in that\narea, is the idea of physically mapping.\n\n439\n00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,897\nSo we just want to be aware of that.\n\n440\n00:19:38,897 --> 00:19:41,913\nA cache memory or a cache,\ndepending on where you're from and\n\n441\n00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:45,390\nhow you to choose to pronounce things,\n>> Cache.\n\n442\n00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,272\n>> So fast and\nexpensive memory, and fast and\n\n443\n00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:50,827\ninexpensive memory types are not really\nvery expensive by today's standards,\n\n444\n00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:52,769\nthey actually should just be inexpensive.\n\n445\n00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:56,680\nBut cache memory is really just this\nmemory that is built-in typically.\n\n446\n00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,200\nSo we have cache in different areas\nto use by a CPU to increase read and\n\n447\n00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,310\nwrite operations.\n\n448\n00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,755\nSo I think Don, in some of our earlier\ndiscussions in part one was talking about\n\n449\n00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:09,845\nL1, L2, L3 caches being built into\nthe chip these days in the CPU.\n\n450\n00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:12,705\n>> Remember they all started migrating\nfurther and further into that chip...\n\n451\n00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:14,285\n>> Externally outside.\n\n452\n00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:17,073\nBack in the day we talked about\nthe old Pentium chips, and\n\n453\n00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:19,902\nthis big monster [LAUGH] that\nwe had shown you, right?\n\n454\n00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,092\nWe were talking about this thing, right?\n\n455\n00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:25,252\nThis is the, do you remember those pin\nthings you could put your face up against,\n\n456\n00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:25,813\ncreates a picture?\n\n457\n00:20:25,813 --> 00:20:27,003\n[LAUGH] You don't want\nto do that with this.\n\n458\n00:20:27,003 --> 00:20:27,692\nThis is not that same thing.\n\n459\n00:20:27,692 --> 00:20:28,475\n>> Like Hellraiser or something?\n\n460\n00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:29,392\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah, it is.\n\n461\n00:20:29,392 --> 00:20:30,142\nRight.\nExactly.\n\n462\n00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:32,878\nBut we talked about\nthe fact that in this older\n\n463\n00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:36,842\nplugable chip set which was the slot\nthat the cache was separate.\n\n464\n00:20:36,842 --> 00:20:39,702\nDon was saying that the cache\nwas actually separate chips.\n\n465\n00:20:39,702 --> 00:20:40,322\n>> Out on the board, yep.\n\n466\n00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,220\n>> Outside, as opposed to everything now,\n\n467\n00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,840\nwhich is just going to be\nintegrated all in one.\n\n468\n00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,138\nAnd so as an idea,\nwe're moving those caches in,\n\n469\n00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:49,886\nand as a result we get a lot better,\nwe get an economy scale.\n\n470\n00:20:49,886 --> 00:20:52,637\n>> It's kind of amazing, yeah,\nto think about the fact,\n\n471\n00:20:52,637 --> 00:20:55,386\njust that distance that it has\nto go to get to that cache,\n\n472\n00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:58,475\nas fast as computers are nowadays,\nmakes a huge difference.\n\n473\n00:20:58,475 --> 00:21:01,575\nAnd the closer we can get that into\nthe processor, the faster it's gonna be.\n\n474\n00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:02,575\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n475\n00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:04,425\nSo that's what we're talking about there.\n\n476\n00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:08,275\nAbsolute addresses, hardware address\nused by the CPU, and absolute addresses,\n\n477\n00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:11,885\nreferencable address that never changes\nis absolute, so is gonna be there.\n\n478\n00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:14,915\nVersus the logical address,\nit's indirect, as we can see there.\n\n479\n00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:17,840\nThat's used by processes\nwithin the OS itself.\n\n480\n00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,550\nThe memory manager is going to effectively\ncarry out the logical-to-absolute\n\n481\n00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,520\naddress mapping.\n\n482\n00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,240\nSo the absolute address is,\nif you think of it basically happening\n\n483\n00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,210\nat the kernel layer, where we have\ndirect access to the hardware.\n\n484\n00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,360\nIt goes direct, and it has an address.\n\n485\n00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,740\nThat's the thing that we think about.\n\n486\n00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:37,350\nThe logical address happens at the user\nmode layer, and that's basically and\n\n487\n00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:41,270\nIRQ that effectively gets translated\nby the memory manager into that\n\n488\n00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,600\nphysical address that is absolute, that\nthe hardware is using to be referenced.\n\n489\n00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,740\nSo, we see a back and forth and\na effectively, a buffering or\n\n490\n00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,460\nan abstraction between these two.\n\n491\n00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,520\nAnd the memory manager,\n\n492\n00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,200\namong the many things it does, handles\nthis particular conversation as well.\n\n493\n00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,130\nSo then we have the stack.\n\n494\n00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,390\nThe stack we talked about\nthis already a little bit.\n\n495\n00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,710\nIt's memory construct that is effectively\nindividually addressable buffers,\n\n496\n00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,415\nso imagine making a sandwich in effect and\nwe're adding all the layers on, and\n\n497\n00:22:08,415 --> 00:22:09,900\nthis is the stack we're building.\n\n498\n00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,085\nAnd when we stop,\nwhenever we put it together.\n\n499\n00:22:12,085 --> 00:22:13,805\nRemember the old Blondie cartoons?\n\n500\n00:22:13,805 --> 00:22:15,585\n>> I was gonna say,\nthey old Dagwood sandwich.\n\n501\n00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:16,614\n>> Dagwood sandwich, exactly.\nI think of Dagwood,\n\n502\n00:22:16,614 --> 00:22:20,188\nwhen I think of this and when I teach\nthis, I always use that as a reference.\n\n503\n00:22:20,188 --> 00:22:23,210\nAgain, it's a kind of an old school thing,\na point in time, because if you're not\n\n504\n00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,910\na certain age you won't,\nyou don't have any clue who Blondie is.\n\n505\n00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:28,480\n>> Do they still read\nthe comics on Sundays?\n\n506\n00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,630\n>> I do.\nThey are still available,\n\n507\n00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,220\nbut that's again,\nthat's probably a generational thing.\n\n508\n00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:36,250\nMost people of a younger age group on a\nSunday are probably sleeping off Saturday\n\n509\n00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,290\nnight's revelry.\n\n510\n00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,615\nSo they may not be up reading\nthe comics first thing.\n\n511\n00:22:39,615 --> 00:22:42,720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But the idea is that we have this\n\n512\n00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,910\nconcept of building logically,\nfoundational, up, up, up, up.\n\n513\n00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,280\nAnd so this entire package,\n\n514\n00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,300\nthis entire cylinder in effective we\nwould build, is the memory stack.\n\n515\n00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,550\nAnd so, literally something like this.\n\n516\n00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,630\nCould be the stack of memory.\n\n517\n00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:57,000\nThis is the water bottle stack or\nwhatever we call it.\n\n518\n00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,120\nAnd so this space defined right here,\nis gonna be the stack.\n\n519\n00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,578\nAnd so\neverything takes place inside of here,\n\n520\n00:23:02,578 --> 00:23:05,390\nas part of this stack\nversus another stack.\n\n521\n00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:10,300\nSo the buffer overflow, I'm gonna borrow\nyour cup, so two visual references in one.\n\n522\n00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,940\nHey, pour yourself a drink, right?\n\n523\n00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,670\nSo the idea would be, before I do\nthe visual, make sure we don't actually\n\n524\n00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,370\nhave a real overflow taking place on\nthe podium, with all the electronics.\n\n525\n00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:18,980\n>> Hey, this is live TV.\n\n526\n00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,040\nLet's do it.\n>> This is live.\n\n527\n00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,710\nNo safety net.\n\n528\n00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,280\n>> Right on the laptop, yeah,\nthat's not a good place to do it.\n\n529\n00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,325\n>> And no paper towels either.\n\n530\n00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:27,700\nSo the idea with the buffer is,\nit's basically a confined memory space.\n\n531\n00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,310\nIt's an amount of space.\n\n532\n00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:32,390\nSo a buffer overflow would be literally\npouring the water into the glass.\n\n533\n00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,780\nAnd this is the buffer, this is the stack.\n\n534\n00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,420\nIf I overflow because I put to much water\nin here, effectively it flows out or\n\n535\n00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,830\nover the sides,\nthat becomes a buffer overflow.\n\n536\n00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,905\nAnd so that's what we're talking about\nwhen we talk about buffers there.\n\n537\n00:23:44,905 --> 00:23:48,439\nWe're talking about this idea\nof effectively going in and\n\n538\n00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:52,706\ntrying to prevent the stack from\noverflowing with a buffer overflow.\n\n539\n00:23:52,706 --> 00:23:56,770\nToo much data coming out, not enough\nspace, and that is ultimately what we see.\n\n540\n00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,350\nCommon attack vector,\na lot of hackers use this.\n\n541\n00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:03,638\nIf we don't do boundary checking, we\ndon't do the proper set up and management\n\n542\n00:24:03,638 --> 00:24:08,246\nof that address space, that memory space,\nthen we can effectively find a weakness,\n\n543\n00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:11,894\nget in, burrow in from the user mode\narea down into the kernel mode,\n\n544\n00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:16,260\naccess that memory and as a result of\nthat effect we take over the machine.\n\n545\n00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,220\nBecause what will often happen\nwhen buffer overflows is\n\n546\n00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,080\nthat if we can overflow the stack,\nget the buffer to basically dump,\n\n547\n00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,694\nwe often get a command prompt with root\nlevel access or in the Windows world,\n\n548\n00:24:26,694 --> 00:24:28,225\nthe administrative access,\nwhatever you prefer.\n\n549\n00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:31,309\n>> [CROSSTALK] Fill it up with just junk\nbecause they know how big that buffer is,\n\n550\n00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:34,585\nthey know how much it's going to take to\noverflow that, so they can fill it up with\n\n551\n00:24:34,585 --> 00:24:37,545\nfiller and then their code gets spilled\nover into the next memory block.\n\n552\n00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:40,599\nAnd if they can figure out where that is,\nyou're right they get system level access.\n\n553\n00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:42,700\n>> They effectively have, right,\nthey have that root, or admin access.\n\n554\n00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,490\nWhich is what you want, right, when you're\ndoing these things you want to get that.\n\n555\n00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:48,750\nBecause now all of a sudden you basically\nbroke the machine, so it's like a CTRL+C\n\n556\n00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,860\nin a command line, you basically break the\nprocess, and now it's waiting for input.\n\n557\n00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,660\nIt kind of resets and says okay,\nhello, do you want to play a game.\n\n558\n00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,300\n>> Right.\n\n559\n00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,320\n>> And then you're ready to go and\nyou can do whatever you want.\n\n560\n00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,650\nSo this is how we actually are able,\nat a very base level, to get in,\n\n561\n00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,240\nmanipulate this hardware and hack.\n\n562\n00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,380\nAnd this is one of the things that is\nvery common when we look at code and\n\n563\n00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,350\nmalicious code running,\nit's because of bad architecture.\n\n564\n00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,690\nNot so much on the physical side,\nit's bad boundary checking,\n\n565\n00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:16,360\nbad implementation of logic checking,\nand bad software.\n\n566\n00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,850\n>> Yeah,\na lot of times it's out of our control.\n\n567\n00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,460\nIf we have to purchase that program,\n\n568\n00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,940\nthey're not going to let\nus look at the code.\n\n569\n00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,380\nIt's proprietary stuff, so we're not sure\nif it has vulnerabilities in that area.\n\n570\n00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,030\nSo, but it does,\nit comes back to bad programming.\n\n571\n00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,500\n>> Yeah, it's unfortunate,\nI don't mean in any way, shape or\n\n572\n00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,620\nform to knock software engineers and\n\n573\n00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,560\ndevelopers because they do an incredible\namount of work that's excellent.\n\n574\n00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,900\nBut, if you take shortcuts, and\nlet's be honest, certain people do.\n\n575\n00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,780\nIf you take a shortcut,\nyou don't do the right thing,\n\n576\n00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,020\ndon't write the code, do the error\nchecking and boundary checking and\n\n577\n00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,700\nyou don't provide the proper\nstructure to set up your\n\n578\n00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,060\nbuffers in such a way that they're well\ndefined, this is what happens right?\n\n579\n00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,270\nGarbage in,\ngarbage out at the end of the day.\n\n580\n00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,910\nSo don't be one of those\ngarbage guys all right?\n\n581\n00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,650\nMake sure you do the right thing.\n\n582\n00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,900\nAll right, so\nwe talked about boundary checking.\n\n583\n00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,710\nThis is just ensuring the acceptable\namount of inputted data\n\n584\n00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:03,120\nis going to meet the criteria\nat the acceptable length, right?\n\n585\n00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,790\nSo if you only allow five characters,\nif you only want five characters I should\n\n586\n00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:12,725\nsay, don't allow a buffer\nto be unstructured and say,\n\n587\n00:26:12,725 --> 00:26:15,195\nmaximum 255 when you\nare only expecting five.\n\n588\n00:26:15,195 --> 00:26:18,310\n>> Do you need 255 characters for\nthem to input their last name on a form?\n\n589\n00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,115\n>> Right.\n>> Something like that.\n\n590\n00:26:19,115 --> 00:26:22,492\n>> So take that down to the lowest common\ndenominator and say we are only going to\n\n591\n00:26:22,492 --> 00:26:26,042\naccept maximum of say, 30 or\nwhatever, just think through it.\n\n592\n00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,992\nAnd that way you don't have\nthat randomness that can occur,\n\n593\n00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,492\nbecause that's really begins the problems.\n\n594\n00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:34,692\nAll right, so address space layout\nrandomization, what is known as ASLR.\n\n595\n00:26:34,692 --> 00:26:37,982\nThis idea of memory protections that\nare used by some operating systems,\n\n596\n00:26:37,982 --> 00:26:38,722\nnot all of them.\n\n597\n00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,132\nSome use this, some don't.\n\n598\n00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:41,400\nThey will actually map out the memory but\n\n599\n00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,820\nthen it's almost like\nthe Wheel of Fortune.\n\n600\n00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:47,687\nIt's randomized [LAUGH] The memory manager\nis then gonna go and have to manage that,\n\n601\n00:26:47,687 --> 00:26:50,882\nand as a result,\nwe actually can make it much harder for\n\n602\n00:26:50,882 --> 00:26:52,565\nan attack surface to exist.\n\n603\n00:26:52,565 --> 00:26:56,395\nBecause it's harder for the buffer\noverflows to happen, it's harder for\n\n604\n00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:58,580\ncertain kind of malware to gain hold.\n\n605\n00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,220\nBecause they don't go to the traditional\nplaces they think the memory is.\n\n606\n00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,560\nThe memory's scattered around on the map.\n\n607\n00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,400\nThe down side is because it's not\ncontiguous there's a hit to performance\n\n608\n00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,030\nwith ASLR and so\nas a result it takes longer to do things,\n\n609\n00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,300\nand systems run slower but you know it\nis more secure at the end of the day.\n\n610\n00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,120\nSo we also have depth\ndata execution prevention\n\n611\n00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,090\nthis is going to be used again by\nsome operating systems not by all.\n\n612\n00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,970\nBut memory segments may be\nmarked as non-executable.\n\n613\n00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,710\nSo in effect, almost like a bad sector\nin a hard drive, we can't use it.\n\n614\n00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,521\nAnd so because we're boxing off, and\nblocking off certain areas of the memory,\n\n615\n00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:34,874\nwe don't allow malware to\nget in there again, and\n\n616\n00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:37,450\nhave a propensity to be in\ncertain areas of memory.\n\n617\n00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,970\nHigh memory where there's\ncertain activities and functions\n\n618\n00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,600\nthat will take place in the kernel,\nthat is protected, will mark that so\n\n619\n00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,760\nit cannot be effectively read to,\nrather written to supposed to read from.\n\n620\n00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,440\nThat kind of thing.\n\n621\n00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,848\nSo this is the kind of thing we do here.\n\n622\n00:27:49,848 --> 00:27:52,090\nWindows uses DEP by the way.\n\n623\n00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:56,150\nSo the Windows security kernel\ncurrently has DEP in it.\n\n624\n00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,980\nThere is some use of\nASLR by Windows as well.\n\n625\n00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,440\nSo you do see some of this technology,\n\n626\n00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,790\nit just depends on the kinda\nthings you're doing.\n\n627\n00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,910\n>> Isn't it Intel has their what,\nno-execute, I think, or\n\n628\n00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,190\nthe no-execute bit, or something?\n\n629\n00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:07,560\nIt has something similar to that.\n\n630\n00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,120\n>> They do, yeah, it's the NX bit, but\nit's used primarily in the virtualization\n\n631\n00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,930\narea to deal with basically smoothing\nover certain constructs around\n\n632\n00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:18,330\ncertain processor architectures\nthat are smoothed away so\n\n633\n00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:22,280\nwe could do V-motion or live migration\non the virtualization platform.\n\n634\n00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,140\nIt’s not much of a security thing but\nit does have some of that overlay.\n\n635\n00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,570\nIt can get rid of some of those things and\nnot allow them to occur.\n\n636\n00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,050\nSo, it is kind of a similar thing.\n\n637\n00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,590\nIt's called the MX bit.\n>> You're absolutely right.\n\n638\n00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,580\nThat's what it's called.\n\n639\n00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,040\n>> So we have garbage collector.\n\n640\n00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,230\nThe garbage collector.\n\n641\n00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,460\nSo actual real role.\n\n642\n00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,790\nReal thing we talk about.\n\n643\n00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,330\nRight?\nSo in the real world the garbage collector\n\n644\n00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:39,830\ncomes around.\n\n645\n00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,120\nRight?\nUsually on Wednesdays and\n\n646\n00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,150\nSundays or whatever.\n\n647\n00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,640\nThey come around,\ntake all the garbage away.\n\n648\n00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,660\nPut it in the truck.\n\n649\n00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,480\nTake it out to a landfill.\n\n650\n00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,500\nSo they're removing\nstuff we no longer want.\n\n651\n00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,870\nWe have a very similar\nconcept running here.\n\n652\n00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:54,220\nSo, this is the idea that we basically\nmark any unused memory segments as usable.\n\n653\n00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,137\nSo, we're constantly going through and\ncleaning up, in effect.\n\n654\n00:28:56,137 --> 00:29:00,057\nBecause what we know is that software is\nnot real good at cleaning up after itself\n\n655\n00:29:00,057 --> 00:29:02,569\nand so it may get out of\nthe execution of the CPU, but\n\n656\n00:29:02,569 --> 00:29:06,453\nit may have left behind some remnants\nin memory, may have said oh, I'm done.\n\n657\n00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,933\nBut you get up from the table,\nyou leave your plate, is he coming back,\n\n658\n00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:10,766\nI don't know.\n\n659\n00:29:10,766 --> 00:29:13,960\nYou know and then every body's waiting,\nand it's not working real well,\n\n660\n00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,340\ndon't know if your coming back.\n\n661\n00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,720\nSo the garbage collector goes in and\ncleans all that up.\n\n662\n00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,980\nSo that way we don't run out of memory.\n\n663\n00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,910\nIt's basically recycling the memory.\n\n664\n00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:23,080\nIt's constantly running in\nthe background and doing that.\n\n665\n00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,090\nThat's what the garbage collector does.\n\n666\n00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:29,300\nSo virtual memory, it's a combination\nof your physical memory and\n\n667\n00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,760\nthen the secondary memory, we call\nthe main memory and secondary memory.\n\n668\n00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,570\nBut basically the secondary memory is\ngonna be basically your paging file,\n\n669\n00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,160\nwe call it swap, call it different things.\n\n670\n00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:42,010\nIt's typically using the hard drive or\nsome sort of storage mechanism, right,\n\n671\n00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,110\nin order to be able to\ncreate additional space.\n\n672\n00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,980\nThat's the upside.\n\n673\n00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,790\nSo we get more space.\n\n674\n00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,470\nThe downside is unfortunately\nit is very slow.\n\n675\n00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,100\n>> It's slow, yes.\n\n676\n00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,120\n>> Very slow.\n\n677\n00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,500\nIt is, let me say that slowly.\n\n678\n00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,990\nIt is slow.\n\n679\n00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,010\nRight?\nSo, by comparison.\n\n680\n00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,350\n>> Yes.\n>> Yes.\n\n681\n00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:01,170\nGiven the price of memory today,\nback several years ago, when we're talking\n\n682\n00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,640\nabout memory being dollars per megabyte,\nyou know, swapping made sense.\n\n683\n00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,590\nRight?\nWe can see this.\n\n684\n00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,140\nBut, today, memory is to the megabyte.\n\n685\n00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,340\nI mean, it's just, it's nothing.\n\n686\n00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,290\nAnd so today people tell me,\noh, I'm having a problem,\n\n687\n00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,610\nI'm running out of memory.\n\n688\n00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:14,910\nWhy aren't you buying more?\n\n689\n00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,780\n>> Why do you have four gigs\nof memory in your computer?\n\n690\n00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,450\n>> Yeah.\n\n691\n00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,950\nYou should be running a thousand gigs,\nit's so cheap.\n\n692\n00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:21,930\n>> At least 16, come on.\n\n693\n00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,950\n>> Yeah, absolutely, so at a minimum.\n\n694\n00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:26,550\nYou're so yesterday if you're\nonly running four gigs.\n\n695\n00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,190\nYou have to be today, right.\n\n696\n00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,670\nYou're so yesterday.\n\n697\n00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,770\nSo typically what we will tell people,\n\n698\n00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:34,370\nwhen we troubleshoot these issues is,\nhey, listen.\n\n699\n00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:37,240\nWe get it's a fall back in\na pinch when you have a problem.\n\n700\n00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,820\nDefinitely set up swap,\nuse swap, we get that.\n\n701\n00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,720\nLet it grow dynamically but\nremember it's second tier memory.\n\n702\n00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,840\nYou're reading and writing.\n\n703\n00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,120\nIt's only going to be as fast as the IO,\n\n704\n00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,400\nthe input output buffer which\nis effectively a front side bus.\n\n705\n00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,960\nAnd more specifically the actual\ninteraction point, so the cable and\n\n706\n00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,410\nthe RPM rate for the drive.\n\n707\n00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:56,260\nAnd the IOPS for the drive.\n\n708\n00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,960\n>> And that's never going to be as fast\nas reading something from flash memory.\n\n709\n00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,770\n>> No.\nAnd especially with flash memory today\n\n710\n00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,970\nwhere flash is basically storage\nthat runs at the speed of RAM.\n\n711\n00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,530\nRight?\nSo there's really no good reason not to\n\n712\n00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:12,140\ndo that if you have to use virtual\nmemory today, use flash as\n\n713\n00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,740\nopposed to a third party drive that's\ngoing to be you know EID SADA whatever.\n\n714\n00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,159\n>> Windows is supposed to do that now,\nthrow in a thumb drive [CROSSTALK]\n\n715\n00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:19,740\n>> Absolutely write it to\n\n716\n00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,448\nthere, write it to flash.\n\n717\n00:31:20,448 --> 00:31:22,840\nWe do that with virtual\nmachines all the time.\n\n718\n00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,620\nNow we're putting our swap files\nout on flash drives as the best,\n\n719\n00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,880\nor on flash memory rather,\nas the best practice.\n\n720\n00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,970\n>> Isn't this temporary style so we're not\nreally worried about keeping it safe or\n\n721\n00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,080\nbacking it up or anything like that.\n\n722\n00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,340\n>> Yeah, no, absolutely.\nMy Windows 8 tablet for\n\n723\n00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,660\ninstance I have a flash drive.\n\n724\n00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,240\n128 gig solid state drive in there so\nI everything is.\n\n725\n00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,570\nI can actually swap and it's fine.\n\n726\n00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,570\nBecause I use that for\nmy virtual machines.\n\n727\n00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,770\nBecause it's basically extra RAM.\n\n728\n00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:43,770\n>> Yeah, I agree.\n>> So, I have 132 gigs of RAM in\n\n729\n00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,850\nmy machine if you think of it that way.\n\n730\n00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,030\n>> That's what I'm talking about.\n\n731\n00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:48,920\n>> Now, that's today.\n\n732\n00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,150\nThat's not yesterday.\n\n733\n00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,330\nThat's actually tomorrow.\n\n734\n00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,590\nThat's how cool that is.\n\n735\n00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,820\n>> He's so cool he's in tomorrow.\n\n736\n00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,090\n>> I am, I'm just.\n>> Already today.\n\n737\n00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:55,956\n>> I'm ahead of being cool.\n\n738\n00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,353\nI'm gaining on it, so\nI can get ready for tomorrow.\n\n739\n00:31:58,353 --> 00:32:01,143\nAll right, so, I think we've gone\nahead and Gone through a whole\n\n740\n00:32:01,143 --> 00:32:04,164\nbunch of material but probably good\nplace for us to take a small break.\n\n741\n00:32:04,164 --> 00:32:05,017\n>> All right, sounds like a plan.\n\n742\n00:32:05,017 --> 00:32:07,116\nWe're gonna step away then and\nlet you guys get up and\n\n743\n00:32:07,116 --> 00:32:10,430\nrefill the beverage of your choice and\nwe will see you back here in a few.\n\n744\n00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,600\n>> Hey, but don't overfill that buffer.\n\n745\n00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,550\n>> That's right.\n\n746\n00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,939\n>> We'll see you in a few.\n\n747\n00:32:14,939 --> 00:32:21,089\n>> [NOISE]\n>> All right,\n\n748\n00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:24,457\nwelcome back to our\nSecurity Architecture & Design Episode,\n\n749\n00:32:24,457 --> 00:32:27,200\nwhere we left off going\nover a bunch of vocabulary.\n\n750\n00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,210\nI think we finished up\ntalking about some memory and\n\n751\n00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:30,910\nvirtual memory and some other things.\n\n752\n00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,824\n>> I don't remember that.\n\n753\n00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:32,983\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Little vague on that.\n\n754\n00:32:32,983 --> 00:32:34,253\n>> [CROSSTALK] Come on Johnny Mnemonic.\n\n755\n00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:35,860\nPlug it back in!\n\n756\n00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,110\n>> All right,\nyou're absolutely right, we did.\n\n757\n00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,350\nSo where are we getting back to?\n\n758\n00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,330\nSo we have some additional stuff\nwe want to go through with you.\n\n759\n00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,735\nWe'll turn back to our magical\nlist of terminology here.\n\n760\n00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:46,900\n>> Yes.\n>> So pick back up where we left off,\n\n761\n00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,028\nwe're talking about memory.\n\n762\n00:32:48,028 --> 00:32:51,844\nSo, no memory conversation would be\ncorrect, and really formal and finished.\n\n763\n00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,160\nUnless you talk about interrupts, right?\n\n764\n00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:56,540\nBecause we have to now talk about how we\nare effectively going to be able to access\n\n765\n00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,620\ninformation and\nmove it through the system.\n\n766\n00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,770\nSo we have different kinds of IO,\ndifferent kinds of input, output, and\n\n767\n00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,410\ninterrupt driven,\nprogrammable driven, etcetera.\n\n768\n00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:07,410\nSo, an interrupt generically here is\na signal software, hardware base,\n\n769\n00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,820\nthat indicates the system\nresources are needed.\n\n770\n00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,910\nSo, kind of knocking on the door, ringing\nthe bell trying to get your attention.\n\n771\n00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,481\n>> And it's cheesy but\nI always used when I was learning A+ for\n\n772\n00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:17,830\nthe first time 15 years ago.\n\n773\n00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,187\nI thought about the bus systems, and\nyou've got to pull the little rope to.\n\n774\n00:33:21,187 --> 00:33:22,350\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Yeah exactly.\n\n775\n00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:22,870\n>> Right, right.\n\n776\n00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,770\n>> You know send that\ndriver an interrupt and\n\n777\n00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,310\nsay oop, we got to stop and do something.\n\n778\n00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,453\n>> Absolutely, absolutely, so that works.\n\n779\n00:33:30,453 --> 00:33:31,460\nI like that.\n\n780\n00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:36,660\nSo programmable IO, right programmable,\nthe CP will send data to the IO device.\n\n781\n00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,950\nAnd polls the device,\nseeing if it is ready to accept more data.\n\n782\n00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,890\nHey, Mike, here's some stuff, and\noh by the way, are you ready for more?\n\n783\n00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:44,920\nRight?\nSo, constantly checking to see if you have\n\n784\n00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,062\ncleaned that out and\nwere able to give you some more there.\n\n785\n00:33:47,062 --> 00:33:50,870\nInterrupt-driven I/O,\nCPU sends a character over to the device,\n\n786\n00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,940\nthe printer or whatever it is.\n\n787\n00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,650\nAnd then goes and\nworks on another processes' request.\n\n788\n00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,710\nSo the idea is we kind of send one\ncharacter to do something else,\n\n789\n00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,460\nsend another character to do something\nelse, but the problem is it's kind of\n\n790\n00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,710\nslow because, you know, we're feeding\nit like, one thing at a time.\n\n791\n00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,670\nIO using direct memory access\nwill be called DMA or IO DMA.\n\n792\n00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,110\nIt's transferred out\nbetween the IO devices and\n\n793\n00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,740\nthe system's memory,\nkinda bypassing the CPU.\n\n794\n00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,420\nWe don't go through the CPU.\n\n795\n00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,700\nWe go direct, in effect,\ninto the memory stack.\n\n796\n00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,340\nIt'll be quicker.\n\n797\n00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:19,970\n>> Yeah, little faster.\n\n798\n00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:20,910\n>> Frees things up.\n\n799\n00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,300\nGives us more flexibility.\n\n800\n00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,482\nWe have pre-mapped IO and\nwhat's called fully mapped IO.\n\n801\n00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:31,219\nSo pre-mapped IO is basically the CPU\nsending the physical memory address.\n\n802\n00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,640\nExcuse me.\nSending the physical memory address\n\n803\n00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,190\nof the requesting process\nto the IO device.\n\n804\n00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,390\nAnd then basically we trust the IO device.\n\n805\n00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,440\n>> Mm hm.\n>> Enough to let it access directly.\n\n806\n00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,690\n>> Right.\n>> So we're giving it that path.\n\n807\n00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,300\nWe're kind of saying okay,\nMike, here you go.\n\n808\n00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,430\nHere's the address.\n\n809\n00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,630\nI'm trusting you to show up and\ndo what you have to do.\n\n810\n00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:50,490\nIt's like handing someone the keys\nto your house and going on vacation.\n\n811\n00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:53,110\nSo as a result of that,\nthe CPU gets out of the way and\n\n812\n00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,240\nwe don't control the interactions\nthat are going on.\n\n813\n00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,840\nWe just let the two things talk\ndirectly in pre-mapped IO.\n\n814\n00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,170\nVery fast as long as we have\nthat level of trust but\n\n815\n00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,540\nonly certain devices are going\nto operate at that level, right?\n\n816\n00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,750\nSo not everything gets to do that.\n\n817\n00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,810\nWhereas fully mapped IO is going to be\nwhere we do not trust the IO device, and\n\n818\n00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,610\nso we don't allow affect\nwe let direct interaction.\n\n819\n00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,090\nWe buffer it through one or\nmore of these solutions.\n\n820\n00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:19,300\nSo pre mapped versus fully mapped,\nwe effectively hide, right, the address.\n\n821\n00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,790\nWe're don't allow it to\ntalk directly fully mapped.\n\n822\n00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,190\nSo instructions set there,\n\n823\n00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,030\nset of operations commands being\nimplemented within the CPU,\n\n824\n00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,800\njust the operating instructions\nthat are in the CPU in effect.\n\n825\n00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,450\nMicro architecture is the specific\ndesign of the processor.\n\n826\n00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,200\nThis is going to include all the physical\ncomponents we've talked about.\n\n827\n00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,860\nIt registers gates, ALUS, cash hits,\netcetera for a certain set.\n\n828\n00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,810\nWe talked about a chip.\n\n829\n00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:43,240\nWe talked about the micro-architecture.\n\n830\n00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,910\nWe looked at the AMD chip for instance.\n\n831\n00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:49,600\nWe had the AMD one there,\nwas a K62, or whatever it was.\n\n832\n00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,885\nThat AMD, whatever micro-architecture\nof an AMD case six version two or\n\n833\n00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,235\nwhatever it would have been.\n\n834\n00:35:55,235 --> 00:35:56,685\nSo this is just how we define it.\n\n835\n00:35:56,685 --> 00:36:00,055\nNow do we have the ring\nprotection map graphic?\n\n836\n00:36:00,055 --> 00:36:01,485\nWe may have to bring that up.\n\n837\n00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:05,415\nSo I know it's in there and\nI know that I forgot to mention it to you.\n\n838\n00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:09,895\nI apologize but it was the graphic\nthat Don had put together for\n\n839\n00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:12,185\nus on the protection rings.\n\n840\n00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:13,275\nYeah, trusted processes.\n\n841\n00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:14,295\nThere we go.\nPerfect.\n\n842\n00:36:14,295 --> 00:36:17,430\nSo wanted to talk briefly\njust about this idea.\n\n843\n00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:22,460\nOf what we call the ring, the protection\nrings or this idea of how we\n\n844\n00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:28,520\ncreate these protection zones inside of\nthe CPU and ultimately inside the system.\n\n845\n00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,180\nAnd so\nyou'll see there we have three layers.\n\n846\n00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,930\nRing zero, one, two, outer ring,\nactually four rings total, ring four.\n\n847\n00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,720\nBut let's just focus on the first\nthree for just a minute.\n\n848\n00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,460\nRing zero, ring one, ring two.\n\n849\n00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,930\nSo with each of these as we go, and\nlet's maybe start with ring zero.\n\n850\n00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,280\nRing zero in the middle there,\nconcentrically.\n\n851\n00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,310\nAnd we have the operating\nsystem kernel itself.\n\n852\n00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,730\nSo what we're seeing there is\nthe most trusted information.\n\n853\n00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:55,190\nThe most trusted things that are going\non inside of an operating system,\n\n854\n00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:57,700\nin the hardware itself, in the CPU.\n\n855\n00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,370\nIt's happening at ring level protection\nzero or ring zero, if you will.\n\n856\n00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:06,120\nAnd so there we are gonna only see\nthings that are in kernel mode,\n\n857\n00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,660\nthe OS kernel itself operating there.\n\n858\n00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,620\nNothing else.\n\n859\n00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,190\nSo nothing else gets into ring zero.\n\n860\n00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,530\nIt is kind of this isolated bastion.\n\n861\n00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:17,150\nIt's like the fortress of solitude,\nif you think of it that way.\n\n862\n00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,980\nAnd then we have ring level one.\n\n863\n00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,760\nRing level one is the operating system.\n\n864\n00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,760\nSo you can see the OS itself.\n\n865\n00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,720\nRing level 1 is where Windows, let's say\nif it's Windows 8, would be loaded and so\n\n866\n00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,605\nring level one is where the actual\noperating system resides.\n\n867\n00:37:29,605 --> 00:37:30,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n868\n00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:34,490\n>> The OS is able to interact and\ntalk with things, passes through, certain\n\n869\n00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:38,350\ncommands pass through into the kernel, but\nbasically only if they're given access.\n\n870\n00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,590\nMost things do not get\ndirectly into the kernel.\n\n871\n00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:44,940\nAnd then Ring level 2, file system there,\nso go inside the operating system Ring\n\n872\n00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,540\nlevel 2 is gonna give us this additional\nlayer of isolation and protection so\n\n873\n00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,010\nour file systems where all of\nthe directory permission are located.\n\n874\n00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,220\nIt's where all the DLL's are,\nthings of that nature.\n\n875\n00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,290\nWe store all our data there, etcetera.\n\n876\n00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,040\nAll that is there.\n\n877\n00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,980\nSo I say let's stop at layer two,\nor ring level two, for\n\n878\n00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:05,340\njust a minute to talk about\nthis just one distinction.\n\n879\n00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:10,310\nIt's really where we get to ring level\nthree, the outer ring, right, that we see.\n\n880\n00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:13,430\nAnd word processor is just\na placeholder in the example for\n\n881\n00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,390\na base of user-mode software.\n\n882\n00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:17,508\nAnd so any application user interaction.\n\n883\n00:38:17,508 --> 00:38:21,185\n>> So it's at the outer most ring,\nthe outer most protection layer\n\n884\n00:38:21,185 --> 00:38:25,025\nthat we see the interaction with\nthe user taking place directly.\n\n885\n00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:27,745\nIt's not until we get there\nthat we really see that so\n\n886\n00:38:27,745 --> 00:38:31,865\nthose other rings are going to\nprocess isolate the software\n\n887\n00:38:31,865 --> 00:38:37,055\nthat underlies the operating system the OS\nitself and the file system sitting on top.\n\n888\n00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:40,060\nBut it's really until we get to\nthe outer ring, and ring level three,\n\n889\n00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,280\nthat we really do not see\nthe interaction with the user.\n\n890\n00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,580\nSo we have a total of four ring levels,\nring zero, one, two and three.\n\n891\n00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,590\nYou'll want to make sure\nyou are familiar with them.\n\n892\n00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,800\nKnow what happens what\nhappens in each ring layer,\n\n893\n00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,320\nmake sure you have a sense of\nhow these rings are working.\n\n894\n00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,200\nThey are concentric obviously,\nthey wrap around each other.\n\n895\n00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,450\nIn order to get to ring level zero,\nyou must go through three, two and one.\n\n896\n00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:02,180\nThere's really no way to get directly\nto zero unless you go through\n\n897\n00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,430\nthe other layers.\n\n898\n00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,430\nAnd this is going to\nbe what is known as or\n\n899\n00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,700\nwhat we refer to as\na defense in depth process.\n\n900\n00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,640\nOr a defense in depth solution.\n\n901\n00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,630\nMultiple layers,\neach well defined, isolating and\n\n902\n00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,875\ndoing something specific to that\nrole is what we're looking at here.\n\n903\n00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,715\nI just want to make sure\nwe're comfortable with that.\n\n904\n00:39:18,715 --> 00:39:20,255\nAll right, very good, so\nI appreciate you bringing that up.\n\n905\n00:39:20,255 --> 00:39:21,355\nI should have actually mentioned that,\n\n906\n00:39:21,355 --> 00:39:24,625\nand I had the note where I set protection\nrings, and web-based architecture,\n\n907\n00:39:24,625 --> 00:39:28,555\nand I just forgot we're going to come up\nwith that in this particular segment.\n\n908\n00:39:28,555 --> 00:39:29,165\nAll right.\n\n909\n00:39:29,165 --> 00:39:33,755\nSo application programming interfaces,\nwhat are called APIs.\n\n910\n00:39:33,755 --> 00:39:36,405\nGenerically, it's the acronym\nis what we often see.\n\n911\n00:39:36,405 --> 00:39:38,440\nThis is going to be basically a hook.\n\n912\n00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:42,140\nWe often refer to it as the software\ninterface that enables the interaction\n\n913\n00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,500\nbetween processes.\n\n914\n00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,582\nSo an API is called by\na piece of software,\n\n915\n00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:48,150\nto access functionality\nthat is exposed that way.\n\n916\n00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,840\nIt allows basically programmers to\nwrite hooks, or create hooks for\n\n917\n00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,093\nfunctionality that other pieces\nof software can plug into.\n\n918\n00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:58,495\nWe have what are called monolithic\noperating system architecture, so\n\n919\n00:39:58,495 --> 00:40:02,521\nthis idea of a monolithic operating system\narchitecture verses a layered operating\n\n920\n00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:03,667\nsystem architecture.\n\n921\n00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,277\nMonolithic is where all of\nthe code in the OS works in\n\n922\n00:40:06,277 --> 00:40:09,616\nkernel mode in an ad hoc manner,\nmeaning, if you think about it,\n\n923\n00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:13,689\nit's everything running in kernel mode\nmeans there's really no direct way for\n\n924\n00:40:13,689 --> 00:40:16,380\nthe users to interact with\nit through user mode.\n\n925\n00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,235\nEverything is brokered.\n\n926\n00:40:17,235 --> 00:40:19,650\nSo, a monolithic OS,\n\n927\n00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:25,125\na little bit different than a layered\noperating system where architecture is\n\n928\n00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:29,250\ngonna be separating system functionality\ninto these hierarchical layers.\n\n929\n00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,080\nSo, a little bit of a different approach,\n\n930\n00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,860\nyou know we're not running everything\nkernel mode, obviously in monolithic OSs,\n\n931\n00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,100\nolder OSs we think like a mainframe OS for\ninstance, would've been monolithic.\n\n932\n00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,830\nYou know,\nyou can think of any of the modern OSs,\n\n933\n00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:45,480\nthe Windows OS as being\na layered approach where we have\n\n934\n00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,110\nseparating into hierarchical\nlayers based on functionality.\n\n935\n00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,870\nLittle bit of a different approach\nthere but you know the modern GUI's,\n\n936\n00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:54,220\nthe modern things we think of today\nthat we use are really based on this\n\n937\n00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,130\nconcept of being able to create\ndifferent areas of functionality.\n\n938\n00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,120\nAnd allowing users a user mode\nwhile in the kernel, kernel mode,\n\n939\n00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,790\nbrokering the conversation\nbetween the two.\n\n940\n00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:03,570\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Absolutely.\n\n941\n00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:06,560\nAll right, so data hiding,\nlet's talk about data hiding.\n\n942\n00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,382\nData hiding is this idea of being able\nto go in and segment our systems in\n\n943\n00:41:11,382 --> 00:41:15,965\nsuch a way that we are able to safeguard\ncertain data, keep it hidden from others,\n\n944\n00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:20,965\nreally, either process, isolate, or\nsomehow physically isolate our data.\n\n945\n00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:24,785\nBut, segregation and design decisions\nbasically protecting components from\n\n946\n00:41:24,785 --> 00:41:27,035\ninteraction with each\nother in a negative way.\n\n947\n00:41:27,035 --> 00:41:30,285\nIn english, we just make sure that\nsoftware that executes over here,\n\n948\n00:41:30,285 --> 00:41:32,186\ndoesn't really get to do with\nanything that's executing over here.\n\n949\n00:41:32,186 --> 00:41:33,451\n>> Doesn't interfere with this\nother application, right.\n\n950\n00:41:33,451 --> 00:41:34,309\n>> Yeah, in effect, right.\n\n951\n00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:38,830\nSo, if for instance, hypothetically,\na piece of software was executing\n\n952\n00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:43,063\nperhaps caused some sort of an error\nof some kind and either got stuck or\n\n953\n00:41:43,063 --> 00:41:44,740\nsomething went wrong.\n\n954\n00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,860\nWe'd want to use data hiding in\nsuch a way that that error and\n\n955\n00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,550\nthat output issue is not going to affect\nall the other software that's running.\n\n956\n00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,440\n>> It's going to crash the entire\nmachine or the operating system.\n\n957\n00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,060\n>> Absolutely.\nThat's what we're looking for,\n\n958\n00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,118\nthat's really what we're\ntalking about there.\n\n959\n00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:01,160\nAlso some additional terminology of\nwhat's called a microkernel architecture.\n\n960\n00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,470\nWe are reducing the amount of\ncode running in the kernel.\n\n961\n00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,985\nReally just down to the bare essence to\ncarry out the most critical OS functions.\n\n962\n00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:10,460\nThat's what microkernel is about,\nit's a subset of really, really small,\n\n963\n00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,330\nrefined, very, very focused,\nand very concentrated kernel.\n\n964\n00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:17,260\nOnly absolutely necessary code\nrunning there in the kernel mode,\n\n965\n00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,270\neverything else is pushed up to user mode.\n\n966\n00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,160\nSo the kernel shrinks dramatically.\n\n967\n00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,600\nThe hybrid microkernel is a combination\nof what we call monolithic and\n\n968\n00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,700\na microkernel solution.\n\n969\n00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,200\nThe monolithic being you know the thing\nwhere everything is running in kernel mode\n\n970\n00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,250\nand so microkernel carries out\nthe critical OS functions, and\n\n971\n00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,930\nthe remaining functionality is carried\nout in a client's server model.\n\n972\n00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,685\nThis is actually more along the lines\nof what we see today, where we see this\n\n973\n00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:40,335\nmicrokernel hybrid, where we're\ndoing a little bit of both, right.\n\n974\n00:42:40,335 --> 00:42:40,857\n>> Right.\n\n975\n00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:43,223\n>> All right, so\nthen we have mode transition,\n\n976\n00:42:43,223 --> 00:42:46,587\nit's when the CPU chain is from\na processing code in user mode and\n\n977\n00:42:46,587 --> 00:42:49,158\nit's kernel mode, so\nwe switch back and forth.\n\n978\n00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:52,029\nThis is gonna be caused by\na performance hit, for instance,\n\n979\n00:42:52,029 --> 00:42:53,690\nit's a protection measure.\n\n980\n00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,690\nSo if for some reason we hit a transition\npoint where maybe the system has to\n\n981\n00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:02,430\nstart swapping, or there's a memory buffer\nor memory leak issue, we may see this mode\n\n982\n00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:07,050\ntransition effectively trying to safeguard\nourselves and what's executing from any\n\n983\n00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:12,010\nsort of either execution error or\nin general just\n\n984\n00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:15,430\na performance issue that may ultimately,\nlead to a downing of the system.\n\n985\n00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,970\nSomething like that can happen.\n\n986\n00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,800\nSo we see this is almost like\na security and a protection issue.\n\n987\n00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,190\nWe talked a little bit about\nvirtualization before,\n\n988\n00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,380\njust general reminder there.\n\n989\n00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:27,840\nA general idea that virtualization allows\nus to basically take the hardware and\n\n990\n00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,880\nall the stuff that's in the physical\nmachine and create, basically,\n\n991\n00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,560\na representation of that,\nthat has broken through the Hypervisor\n\n992\n00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,320\nto allow virtualized instances\nof a lot of this resource.\n\n993\n00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:43,280\nThe Hypervisor itself is the program\nthat manages the guest operating system,\n\n994\n00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,180\nwe call the virtual machines or\nguest OS's within a simulated environment,\n\n995\n00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,400\nthe host is gonna be the physical aspect\nof that providing the resources, and\n\n996\n00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,614\nthe Hypervisor acts like\nthe abstraction layer.\n\n997\n00:43:54,614 --> 00:43:55,720\n>> Right.\n>> So it performs that\n\n998\n00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,870\nfunction among several others and\nit brokers the conversation back and\n\n999\n00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,060\nforth between the host of the physical\nresource the host provides, and\n\n1000\n00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:06,080\nthe logical guest operating\nsystems running in the memory\n\n1001\n00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,415\nof the physical host and the CPU of\nthe physical host that are logical.\n\n1002\n00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,230\nSecurity policy.\n\n1003\n00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:16,700\nSecurity policy is gonna be basically\nallowing us to dictate how information is\n\n1004\n00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,650\ngonna be managed and resources are used.\n\n1005\n00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:22,050\nWe talk a lot about different kinds of\npolicies, security policies generically,\n\n1006\n00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:24,590\njust simply one of those\nones that we wanna have.\n\n1007\n00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:28,375\nThe TCB, a trusted computing base,\nis as you can see here,\n\n1008\n00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:31,165\na collection of all the hardware,\nsoftware, firmware.\n\n1009\n00:44:31,165 --> 00:44:33,515\nAll those things together, so\nbasically all the component parts,\n\n1010\n00:44:33,515 --> 00:44:36,585\nall the constituent parts\nthat make up a system and\n\n1011\n00:44:36,585 --> 00:44:39,715\nhave to be thought about and\narchitected properly,\n\n1012\n00:44:39,715 --> 00:44:43,135\ndocumented, and secured in order\nto create a secure architecture.\n\n1013\n00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,445\nThis is what TCB is.\n\n1014\n00:44:44,445 --> 00:44:47,845\nSo it's all the components within\na system that provide security and\n\n1015\n00:44:47,845 --> 00:44:50,020\nenforce the system's security policy.\n\n1016\n00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,490\nIt's what a definition of a TCB is.\n\n1017\n00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,320\nOne of those things you definitely\nwant to make sure you're familiar\n\n1018\n00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,530\nwith and you know.\n\n1019\n00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:58,620\nAlong with the TCB we\nhave the trusted path.\n\n1020\n00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,100\nTrusted path is that trustworthy or\ntrusted software channel\n\n1021\n00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,090\nused to communicate between two\nprocesses that cannot be circumvented.\n\n1022\n00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:11,530\nSo in other words, if we instantiate\na logon process that allows us\n\n1023\n00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:15,930\nto authenticate from a dedicated\nworkstation over some sort of wire,\n\n1024\n00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,435\nsome sort of transmission,\nout to a directory server and back.\n\n1025\n00:45:19,435 --> 00:45:21,070\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And we cannot get around that,\n\n1026\n00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,860\nit must do that in order to be able\nto effectively get on to that system,\n\n1027\n00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,940\nyou must do it and\ncan only do it that way.\n\n1028\n00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,390\nThat's an example of a trusted path,\nright.\n\n1029\n00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,835\nInside the system we have trusted paths.\n\n1030\n00:45:31,835 --> 00:45:37,560\nThe path that for instance, takes us\nfrom maybe the smart card reader or\n\n1031\n00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,210\nthe biometric reader if it's built in,\ninto the TPM,\n\n1032\n00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:44,070\nthe trusted platform module, for\nprocessing and storage of keys.\n\n1033\n00:45:44,070 --> 00:45:45,760\nThat is a trusted path.\n\n1034\n00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,870\nThat cannot be circumvented,\nand it's hard wired in effect.\n\n1035\n00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:50,410\nThat's what we're talking about there.\n\n1036\n00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:54,160\nThe security perimeter is a mechanism,\nas we can see there, used to delineate\n\n1037\n00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,180\nbetween the components within and\noutside of the trusted computing base.\n\n1038\n00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,880\nThis, in other words,\nis gonna tell us what is inside the TCB,\n\n1039\n00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,370\ninside the secure architecture and what\nis outside of the secure architecture.\n\n1040\n00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:09,570\n>> Is the component part of my\ntrusted computing base, or is it not?\n\n1041\n00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:12,600\n>> In effect, it's the boundary or\nthe boarder, absolutely correct.\n\n1042\n00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:18,200\nSo, there's a Simpson's episode,\nif you're a Simpsons fan,\n\n1043\n00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,280\nthere's a Simpsons episode for\neverything, by the way.\n\n1044\n00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,350\nSo, if you look hard enough,\n\n1045\n00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,480\nyou can tell your entire life\nstory through the Simpsons.\n\n1046\n00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,350\nBut there's one I remember, in particular,\n\n1047\n00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,170\nthey go down to Australia, and\nHomer's there with the family.\n\n1048\n00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:33,680\nAnd they're at the American Embassy,\nand they're standing outside.\n\n1049\n00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,760\nYeah yeah, I'm in the U.S.\n\n1050\n00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,780\nI'm out of the U.S.\n>> I'm in the U.S.\n\n1051\n00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,420\nand he's jumping across the gate\n>> Right.\n\n1052\n00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:42,080\n>> Right, between, so he jumps into the\nyard of the U.S. embassy, there's a guard,\n\n1053\n00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,660\na big, serious marine standing there,\nand so he's jumping across the fence.\n\n1054\n00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,390\nIt's like open, right,\nit's like a driveway.\n\n1055\n00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:51,860\nSo he's jumping over the line,\njumping back, while Marge and\n\n1056\n00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,130\nthe kids are standing there watching.\n\n1057\n00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:54,960\nHe's like, look, I'm in the U.S.,\nI'm in Australia.\n\n1058\n00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,035\nI'm in the U.S., I'm in Australia.\n\n1059\n00:46:56,035 --> 00:46:58,852\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So that whole idea is really what\n\n1060\n00:46:58,852 --> 00:46:59,890\nthe security-\n>> That's a security perimeter.\n\n1061\n00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,650\n>> That's a security perimeter,\nexactly that.\n\n1062\n00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,170\nThat's exactly what it is because it's\nthe demarcation point, the boundary,\n\n1063\n00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:09,800\nright, between what some system is,\nwherever that definition point ends, and\n\n1064\n00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,290\nthe next system begins,\nwhatever it is outside.\n\n1065\n00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:15,120\nAnd so this is what we're talking\nabout with security perimeters, so,\n\n1066\n00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,560\nwe can tell the whole networking security\nstory just by watching the Simpsons.\n\n1067\n00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,580\n>> You're going to have\nto write another book,\n\n1068\n00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,620\nI wonder if you can get permission\nfrom the Simpsons guys.\n\n1069\n00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,090\n>> You know, I'm just wondering if I can\njust work all that stuff in to my next\n\n1070\n00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:28,070\nbook where I can write\nthe book of just movie and\n\n1071\n00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,640\nTV references to tell\nthe security stories.\n\n1072\n00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,034\n>> Well I think you should, I really do.\n\n1073\n00:47:31,034 --> 00:47:33,403\n>> That might be a good way to go.\n\n1074\n00:47:33,403 --> 00:47:34,440\n>> Yeah, you know what,\nthat might be cool.\n\n1075\n00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,930\nBe almost like a Far Side book, right,\nbut with some real information between.\n\n1076\n00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,970\n>> Right.\n>> Right, or do you remember Bloom County?\n\n1077\n00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:40,470\n>> Yes.\n\n1078\n00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:41,370\n>> Right, or Doonesbury.\n\n1079\n00:47:41,370 --> 00:47:42,093\nLike some of those.\n\n1080\n00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:43,983\n[CROSSTALK] Doonesbury.\n\n1081\n00:47:43,983 --> 00:47:47,090\nSo I could do that, just the strips\nwould be a little bit more involved.\n\n1082\n00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:48,240\nAll right, so\n\n1083\n00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,170\ndefinitely an idea that we'll have to\nexplore at some point in the future.\n\n1084\n00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,128\nAll right, so the reference monitor.\n\n1085\n00:47:53,128 --> 00:47:55,940\nLet's talk about the reference monitor,\nthe security kernel,\n\n1086\n00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,507\nwhat the requirements and\nmain issues are with the kernel.\n\n1087\n00:47:58,507 --> 00:48:02,473\nSo the reference monitor concept, really\nimportant concept here, goes with the TCB,\n\n1088\n00:48:02,473 --> 00:48:04,947\nthinking about this whole thing and\nhow we architect.\n\n1089\n00:48:04,947 --> 00:48:07,873\nWe're starting to now build secure\nsystems out of all these component parts.\n\n1090\n00:48:07,873 --> 00:48:08,746\n>> Right.\n\n1091\n00:48:08,746 --> 00:48:12,377\n>> So the reference monitor,\nthis is what designs or rather, excuse me,\n\n1092\n00:48:12,377 --> 00:48:16,129\ndefines the design requirements of\nwhat we call the reference validation\n\n1093\n00:48:16,129 --> 00:48:18,260\nmechanism which is the security kernel.\n\n1094\n00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:22,383\nEnforces an access control\npolicy over subjects.\n\n1095\n00:48:22,383 --> 00:48:25,165\nSubjects are gonna be users and\nprocesses, and\n\n1096\n00:48:25,165 --> 00:48:27,785\nthen ability to perform operations, right?\n\n1097\n00:48:27,785 --> 00:48:30,095\nRead, write, execute,\nwe define there, on objects.\n\n1098\n00:48:30,095 --> 00:48:32,085\nObjects are going to be\nthe data typically, the files,\n\n1099\n00:48:32,085 --> 00:48:33,730\nthe resources we want to go after.\n\n1100\n00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:38,740\nSo the idea is that this reference\nmonitor sets up and builds this design.\n\n1101\n00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,010\nAll the requirements of the design and\n\n1102\n00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:44,190\nactually helps us to understand architect\nit that explains and basically brokers and\n\n1103\n00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:50,890\noutlines for us, the interaction in a\nsecure, right, way between users and data\n\n1104\n00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:54,930\nright within a system, and what access and\nwhat level of permission we have for that.\n\n1105\n00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:57,590\nThat's what the reference monitor is,\nsubjects or users,\n\n1106\n00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:02,150\nthat could be services or processes but\ntypically we refer to them as users.\n\n1107\n00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,948\nThe ability to perform operations\nis all about permissions,\n\n1108\n00:49:04,948 --> 00:49:08,290\naccess control, rewrite,\nexecute, full control, whatever.\n\n1109\n00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:12,330\nAnd then objects are always referred\nto as resources so data, generically.\n\n1110\n00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:15,120\nSo subjects access objects in other words.\n\n1111\n00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,860\nAnd they do so\nthrough a set of permissions, or\n\n1112\n00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:19,140\nyou know, operational criteria.\n\n1113\n00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:22,370\nSo the reference modern helps us to put\nall this together, very important concept.\n\n1114\n00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:23,895\nDefinitely wanna understand the reference.\n\n1115\n00:49:23,895 --> 00:49:26,540\nModern, the security kernel\nis one aspect of that,\n\n1116\n00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,487\nit is the reference\nvalidation solution there.\n\n1117\n00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:33,620\nSo it is going to be as we can see,\nthe hardware, software and\n\n1118\n00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:38,750\nfirmware components all together that fall\nwithin the TCB, the trusted computing base\n\n1119\n00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:42,160\nand implement it and\nenforce the reference monitor concept.\n\n1120\n00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:46,230\nSo the reference monitor is this\nconceptual idea, the security kernel is\n\n1121\n00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:51,500\nwhat actually builds and implements and\nenforces the reference monitor.\n\n1122\n00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,110\nSo, you cannot have a reference\nmonitor without the security kernel,\n\n1123\n00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:57,220\nin other words, what we wanna understand.\n\n1124\n00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,940\nAnd so, what does the security kernel\nreally, at the end of the day, do?\n\n1125\n00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,060\nWhat are the main requirements and\nwhat is the importance of it?\n\n1126\n00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:07,690\nWe can see here, it must provide\nisolation, process isolation, so\n\n1127\n00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:10,950\nthat anything that's carried out\ninside the reference monitor\n\n1128\n00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:12,190\nis gonna be tamper-proof.\n\n1129\n00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,600\nCan't get into it, can't mess\nwith it anyway, total black box.\n\n1130\n00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,060\n>> Right.\n\n1131\n00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,640\n>> It must be invoked for every access\nattempt, and you cannot circumvent it.\n\n1132\n00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:24,650\nSo as result of this, no matter what\nwe do, if we try to access something\n\n1133\n00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,660\nwe must always go through this\nsecurity kernel, no way get around it.\n\n1134\n00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,740\nAnd it must be small enough to be\ntested and verified in a complete and\n\n1135\n00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:32,030\ncomprehensive manner.\n\n1136\n00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,135\nSo it has to be portable.\n\n1137\n00:50:33,135 --> 00:50:37,385\nSmall enough and comprehensive in\nits totality that we can test it and\n\n1138\n00:50:37,385 --> 00:50:38,715\ntest the entire thing all at once.\n\n1139\n00:50:38,715 --> 00:50:40,515\n>> Right.\n>> It has to be implemented that way.\n\n1140\n00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:41,725\nSo, you can never get around it.\n\n1141\n00:50:41,725 --> 00:50:45,832\nIt must always be there all the time, just\nalways on, always there, always watching.\n\n1142\n00:50:45,832 --> 00:50:47,692\nCan never circumvent,\nand never get around it.\n\n1143\n00:50:47,692 --> 00:50:51,232\nWe have to be able to test it in its\ntotality and verify it as being complete.\n\n1144\n00:50:51,232 --> 00:50:52,482\n>> Very good.\n\n1145\n00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:55,382\n>> So it is omnipotent, as we would say.\n\n1146\n00:50:55,382 --> 00:50:56,772\nRight?\n\n1147\n00:50:56,772 --> 00:50:58,520\nAs we often refer to it as.\n\n1148\n00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,270\nAll right.\nSo then we have this idea of multi-level\n\n1149\n00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:02,140\nsecurity policy.\n\n1150\n00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,800\nIf we have a single policy, multi-level\nsecurity policy is multiple policies for\n\n1151\n00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,110\ndifferent levels of access,\nhow simultaneous processing\n\n1152\n00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:12,580\nof information could occur at different\nlevels in a system with different focuses,\n\n1153\n00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,790\ndifferent clearance levels.\n\n1154\n00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:17,487\n>> This gets imported for things like some\nof our architectural models like Byba,\n\n1155\n00:51:17,487 --> 00:51:22,680\nBell-LaPadula, Graham, Nash Brewer,\nClark Wilson that we'll talk about.\n\n1156\n00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,442\nWe'll have some upcoming\nconversations about those.\n\n1157\n00:51:24,442 --> 00:51:26,590\nWe can start those see some\nof them right down there.\n\n1158\n00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:30,420\nBut these security models that we think of\nwhere we have different levels of access\n\n1159\n00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,840\nbased on what we're doing and\nas a result multiple processing system\n\n1160\n00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,910\nour multi-level security policy system\nwill access or allow access for.\n\n1161\n00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:40,250\nPerhaps let's say you and\n\n1162\n00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:43,620\nI at the same time accessing the same\npiece of data with different rights.\n\n1163\n00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:46,460\nWe could both do that simultaneously\nbecause we have different policies in\n\n1164\n00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:47,510\nplace that can be applied.\n\n1165\n00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,250\nThat's what a multi-level\nsecurity policy is.\n\n1166\n00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:51,265\nSo state machine model.\n\n1167\n00:51:52,715 --> 00:51:57,085\nThe state machine model allows us to\nverify the security of a system, the state\n\n1168\n00:51:57,085 --> 00:52:00,395\nis used in other words which means that\nany and all permissions are available.\n\n1169\n00:52:00,395 --> 00:52:03,805\nWe have to understand what's there and\nknow what's being used, capture that, make\n\n1170\n00:52:03,805 --> 00:52:08,045\nsure the subjects are being accessed by\nthe objects in the appropriate fashion or,\n\n1171\n00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:10,705\nexcuse me, the objects are being\naccessed by the subjects.\n\n1172\n00:52:10,705 --> 00:52:12,300\nWe don't have data accessing users.\n\n1173\n00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,060\nWe have users accessing data so that we\nhave objects being accessed by subjects.\n\n1174\n00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,560\nWe're recording that so\nwe understand what's going on there.\n\n1175\n00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,940\nWe keep track of it.\n\n1176\n00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,410\nAnd a system that basically employs\nthe state machine model is secure.\n\n1177\n00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:28,055\nIt's always considered to be in a secure\nstate because each and every instance of\n\n1178\n00:52:28,055 --> 00:52:32,235\nits existence is being monitored, is being\ncaptured, is being recorded, is set up.\n\n1179\n00:52:32,235 --> 00:52:33,715\nThere's policies that govern it.\n\n1180\n00:52:33,715 --> 00:52:37,055\nWe have the TCB, we have the reference\nmonitor, we have the security kernel.\n\n1181\n00:52:37,055 --> 00:52:38,667\nSo as all these things\nare brought to bear and\n\n1182\n00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:41,707\nimplemented, the system is always\nsaid to be in a secure state.\n\n1183\n00:52:41,707 --> 00:52:44,937\nSo, state machine models always\nexist in a secure state.\n\n1184\n00:52:44,937 --> 00:52:46,507\nSo, that's important to think about.\n\n1185\n00:52:46,507 --> 00:52:48,937\nSo we've kind of talked through\nup until this point, and\n\n1186\n00:52:48,937 --> 00:52:50,057\nwe can roll with it a little bit.\n\n1187\n00:52:50,057 --> 00:52:54,350\nWe've talked through up until this point,\nboth in this conversation and\n\n1188\n00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,210\nsome of the others that we've\nbeen having in part one.\n\n1189\n00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:59,930\nTalked about all of the architecture\nelements, right, all the things.\n\n1190\n00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,080\n>> Right.\n>> That go into making this up.\n\n1191\n00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:01,960\nWe talked about the memory.\n\n1192\n00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,720\nWe talked about the processors.\n\n1193\n00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,550\nWe talked about some of the other stuff,\nfor instance the circuit boards,\n\n1194\n00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:08,670\nyour motherboards, all that.\n\n1195\n00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:10,720\nWell we talked about all\nthe building blocks in effect.\n\n1196\n00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,280\nSo now we start to take those building\nblocks, and we're combining them together.\n\n1197\n00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,540\nRight, we're stitching together things and\nbuilding some models.\n\n1198\n00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,070\nWe've got a TCB, trust computing base.\n\n1199\n00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:23,440\nWe've got a security reference monitor,\nor reference monitor.\n\n1200\n00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,070\nWe've got security kernel.\n\n1201\n00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:29,240\nAnd we've got this idea of this\nintegrity where we have to have it in\n\n1202\n00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,860\nplace at all times, can't do anything,\ncan't circumvent it.\n\n1203\n00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,690\nIf we do, it's not secure.\n\n1204\n00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,930\nSo we have to have a secure state,\nso hence the secure state model.\n\n1205\n00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:40,000\nSo we've done all this stuff,\nwe've stitched this all together.\n\n1206\n00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,760\nNow what we need to do is apply this,\nkind of go from the theoretical.\n\n1207\n00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,430\n>> Right.\n>> The high level kind of logical design,\n\n1208\n00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:47,830\npie in the sky stuff.\n\n1209\n00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:49,790\nDown to the actual tactical stuff.\n\n1210\n00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:52,660\nHow are we going to start applying this,\nwhat are some of the models that we're\n\n1211\n00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,550\nactually going to build and use,\nwhat are they going to look like?\n\n1212\n00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:58,170\nAnd how are we then going to\nstart processing information\n\n1213\n00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:01,660\nin such a way that we're going to be\nable to apply these models, right?\n\n1214\n00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:04,600\nWhether again it's something\nlike Bell-LaPadula, Byba.\n\n1215\n00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,540\nGraham Brewer Nash.\n\n1216\n00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,900\nWhether it's gonna be Clark Wilson.\n\n1217\n00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,440\nIt doesn't really matter,\nthese are all models.\n\n1218\n00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,330\nSome of them are also\nsinging groups by the way.\n\n1219\n00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:11,940\nNo, they're not that.\n\n1220\n00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,590\nI'm only kidding.\n\n1221\n00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:15,360\n>> I was gonna say I thought that-\n>> I was thinking, like, Wilson Phillips.\n\n1222\n00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:17,420\nI just had that whole image in my mind.\n\n1223\n00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,500\nYou know, oh, Crosby, Stills, Nash and\nYoung, you know that whole thing.\n\n1224\n00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,870\nSo they're not singing groups, please\ndisregard that I was only kidding, but\n\n1225\n00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,140\nthey are security models.\n\n1226\n00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,700\nThey are information security models\nthat deal either with integrity or\n\n1227\n00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,900\nconfidentiality, very important, want to\nmake sure we're thinking about those.\n\n1228\n00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,100\n>> And most importantly, we want to make\nsure that if you start to talk about them,\n\n1229\n00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,830\nwe're gonna start talking about them.\n\n1230\n00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:39,940\nYou want to make sure that we\nunderstand that as we look at them and\n\n1231\n00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,080\nunderstand how we're beginning\nto manipulate information\n\n1232\n00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,660\nas a result of using them and\nfocusing on is it just confidentiality.\n\n1233\n00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:49,700\nIs it confidentiality integrity,\nwe may be doing in some cases.\n\n1234\n00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,870\nWhat's the goal there?\n\n1235\n00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:52,950\nWe want to then be thinking\nbackwards a little bit and say,\n\n1236\n00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:56,960\nokay, so we can access information in\nthis way, and we can get to it either\n\n1237\n00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,290\nbecause of what we're doing or we can't\nget to it because of where we are.\n\n1238\n00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:04,235\nSo we have the idea of\nthe multi-level policy taking place.\n\n1239\n00:55:04,235 --> 00:55:06,010\nMulti-level security policies coming in.\n\n1240\n00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,840\nSo we really want to see some\nof these parts coming together.\n\n1241\n00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,270\nAnd try to look under the hood\na little bit, of these architectures.\n\n1242\n00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:15,140\nAnd what I often try to get my\nstudents to think about in this area,\n\n1243\n00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:18,420\njust by way of talking through it is,\nwe've spent all this time,\n\n1244\n00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:20,730\nprobably a couple hours at this point,\nof content.\n\n1245\n00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,150\nBut time to think about it, right?\n\n1246\n00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:26,270\nWe've had four discussions up until now,\nso\n\n1247\n00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:30,700\na couple hours of time, in effect,\nspent just building up to this point.\n\n1248\n00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,670\nSo we want you to be thinking\nabout what does that mean,\n\n1249\n00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:37,820\nand how do we take all that stuff,\nand how do we put in into this box?\n\n1250\n00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:40,360\nAnd on the back end of it,\nso mix it all together.\n\n1251\n00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,360\nHow do we begin to not get these\nmodels to become very central?\n\n1252\n00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:47,290\nIncredibly important to how we\nprocess information securely\n\n1253\n00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,410\nin these secure architectures\nthat we're looking to build.\n\n1254\n00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:50,490\nIf it's not for this stuff,\n\n1255\n00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:53,740\nyou know if we don't have these\narchitectures, we effectively got nothing.\n\n1256\n00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:54,910\nWe've got a bunch of parts.\n\n1257\n00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:56,595\nWe brought all the parts up and\nshowed you.\n\n1258\n00:55:56,595 --> 00:56:00,008\nSo you've got a bunch of parts there,\nand they're gonna be laid out.\n\n1259\n00:56:00,008 --> 00:56:01,512\nWe're gonna talk about how they work.\n\n1260\n00:56:01,512 --> 00:56:04,011\nMemory is over here and\nprocessor is over there.\n\n1261\n00:56:04,011 --> 00:56:06,672\nAnd there's some sort of this thing\ncalled a path that we got to follow.\n\n1262\n00:56:06,672 --> 00:56:10,400\nMaybe some RAM or some ROM or\nsomething, but none of it's secure.\n\n1263\n00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,560\nJust because we use those terms,\n\n1264\n00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,240\nwe put a bunch of stuff in a board,\nthat has nothing to do with being secure.\n\n1265\n00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,590\nAnd unless we overlay it,\nunless we bring in\n\n1266\n00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:22,760\nthis idea of these secure architectures,\nwe're unfortunately gonna be stuck.\n\n1267\n00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,908\nWe're not gonna have a way of making the\ndesign really functional from a security\n\n1268\n00:56:26,908 --> 00:56:27,642\nstandpoint.\n\n1269\n00:56:27,642 --> 00:56:30,207\nSo this is the importance,\nand, yeah, the potential.\n\n1270\n00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:31,890\nSo this is the importance of that.\n\n1271\n00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,214\nSo, we're gonna take a break,\nbut when we come back and\n\n1272\n00:56:34,214 --> 00:56:37,479\nwe start talking about those, hopefully,\nobviously, you'll come back and\n\n1273\n00:56:37,479 --> 00:56:39,770\njoin us for that little\ncliffhanger as Don likes to do.\n\n1274\n00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,040\n>> I was gonna say they\ngot to now don't they?\n\n1275\n00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,490\nI mean, you gotta be on the edge of your\nseat right now, security models, come on.\n\n1276\n00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,240\n>> We did that whole set up, absolutely.\n\n1277\n00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,720\nBut, we wanna make sure you do obviously\nget the chance to see these and\n\n1278\n00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:49,530\nmost importantly.\n\n1279\n00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:51,340\nYou'll want to put it in\nthe right context for you.\n\n1280\n00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:53,080\nWant to be able to do them\nall together as a block and\n\n1281\n00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,236\nreally compare them all together.\n\n1282\n00:56:54,236 --> 00:56:56,400\nSo we're gonna do that\non our next discussion.\n\n1283\n00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,770\nSo hopefully you'll be back to join\nus in just a couple of minutes.\n\n1284\n00:56:58,770 --> 00:56:59,914\n>> See you back here in a few.\n\n1285\n00:56:59,914 --> 00:57:02,934\n[MUSIC]\n\n1286\n00:57:02,934 --> 00:57:07,741\n[NOISE].\n\n1287\n00:57:07,741 --> 00:57:08,280\nAll right.\n\n1288\n00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,290\nWelcome back everybody.\n\n1289\n00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:11,990\nI hope you did not fall off\nthe edge of your couch.\n\n1290\n00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:14,380\nI know you were getting pretty close\nthere, waiting for us to get back.\n\n1291\n00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,530\nAnd we're gonna get right back\ninto our security models.\n\n1292\n00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:17,890\nSo lets.\n>> That would be a security hole,\n\n1293\n00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:18,470\nif they did.\n\n1294\n00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:19,590\nRight?\nThere would be a hole.\n\n1295\n00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:22,570\n>> It would be a, definitely a little\nbit of a vulnerability there.\n\n1296\n00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:25,158\n>> It would be, and\na little bit of an ouchie as well.\n\n1297\n00:57:25,158 --> 00:57:28,850\n[LAUGH] All right so,\nwe're going to continue our conversations.\n\n1298\n00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:30,630\nI want to spend some time,\n\n1299\n00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:34,095\nnow that we've kind of built all of\nthe super structure, if you will.\n\n1300\n00:57:34,095 --> 00:57:37,095\nWant to start filling in some of\nthe stuff that goes inside, which are,\n\n1301\n00:57:37,095 --> 00:57:41,545\nwhat are the models, the security models\nthat we should start to put together and\n\n1302\n00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:42,755\nhow they work.\n\n1303\n00:57:42,755 --> 00:57:44,715\nAnd so what I'm going to do is\nfocus first on Bell-LaPadula.\n\n1304\n00:57:44,715 --> 00:57:48,545\nMaybe we could just move up one or\ntwo clicks.\n\n1305\n00:57:48,545 --> 00:57:50,135\nOh, not quite that much.\n\n1306\n00:57:50,135 --> 00:57:52,785\nAnd we may have to actually\nre-indent just a little bit.\n\n1307\n00:57:52,785 --> 00:57:55,560\nI'm thinking, that's actually good\nright there, they can see it.\n\n1308\n00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,960\nIt was just the edge of the screen\nwas kind of blocking off that area.\n\n1309\n00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,731\nAll right, very good, so\nBell-LaPadula, right,\n\n1310\n00:58:01,731 --> 00:58:05,350\nthis is a model that you can see here\nkind of setting the stage for us.\n\n1311\n00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:09,310\nFirst mathematical model that is going to\ndeal with multi level security policies.\n\n1312\n00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:13,350\nDefining this idea of secure state and\nnecessary modes of access.\n\n1313\n00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:16,290\nFocusing really on information flows and\n\n1314\n00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:20,720\nnot violating system policy, and\nis focused on confidentiality.\n\n1315\n00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,560\nSo we want to make sure we know\nis Bell-LaPadula is focused on\n\n1316\n00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,430\nthe confidentiality aspect.\n\n1317\n00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:27,090\nKeeping information secure.\n\n1318\n00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,420\nMay actually want to kind of pull that\na little bit out of that bullet there\n\n1319\n00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,410\nright above simple star security rule, but\n\n1320\n00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,570\nmaybe just right next to\nBell-LaPadula up at the top.\n\n1321\n00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:36,080\nMaybe we can just write in brackets,\n\n1322\n00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,570\nsorry should have done that\nwhen I made the notes.\n\n1323\n00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:41,090\nJust write confidentiality,\ncuz that's really the focus of this model.\n\n1324\n00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:44,740\nIs the confidentiality item that's gonna\nbe important cuz we go through some of\n\n1325\n00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,660\nthe others.\n\n1326\n00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,820\nBiba, for instance,\nfocuses just on integrity.\n\n1327\n00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:48,620\n>> Which pillar are we working on.\n\n1328\n00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:51,200\n>> Wanna be able to differentiate and\nreally compare the two, absolutely.\n\n1329\n00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:55,070\nSo with Bell-LaPadula, we have some rules.\n\n1330\n00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:57,250\nThere are three of them there,\nas you can see.\n\n1331\n00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:58,710\nAnd we want to know the rules.\n\n1332\n00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:01,560\nAnd so I'm going to let you in on\na little secret while we're doing this.\n\n1333\n00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:04,590\nWhether you learn Bell-LaPadula,\nor you learn Biba,\n\n1334\n00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:07,630\nwe just happen to be doing it in this\norder so Bell-LaPadula comes first.\n\n1335\n00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,720\nBut whichever one you learn,\nthey're the exact opposites of each other.\n\n1336\n00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,640\n>> All right.\n>> And we're going to talk\n\n1337\n00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:15,970\nabout that in just a minute, so as a\nresult, all you got to do is learn one and\n\n1338\n00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:17,090\nyou kind of already know the other.\n\n1339\n00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:17,670\nAll right?\n\n1340\n00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:18,990\nSo it's like a two for.\n\n1341\n00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:21,410\nIt's a BOGO, it's a buy one get one free.\n\n1342\n00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:22,560\n>> Yes, we're back at public school.\n\n1343\n00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,430\n>> Absolutely correct.\n\n1344\n00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:26,830\nSo as a result of that, or\nit's like Double Shot Tuesday, right?\n\n1345\n00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:27,470\n>> There you go.\n\n1346\n00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:28,600\n>> That kind of thing.\n\n1347\n00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,790\nSo, as a result, we're gonna really focus\non just understanding the rules for\n\n1348\n00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:34,490\none, we're just simply\ninvert the rules for other.\n\n1349\n00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:38,660\nBut, as you go to master this and prepare\nfor it, in terms of answering questions,\n\n1350\n00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,020\nyou're gonna wanna know both,\nclearly very important.\n\n1351\n00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:42,787\nThe key difference will\nbe that Bell-LaPadula\n\n1352\n00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:44,520\nis focused on confidentiality.\n\n1353\n00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:45,780\nBiba's focused on integrity.\n\n1354\n00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,420\nWe'll address that and\nthen we'll talk about that model.\n\n1355\n00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:51,470\nBut you're gonna want to learn\nthe rules and then simply invert them.\n\n1356\n00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:55,060\nSo just remember which model we're talking\nabout, so you know which rules it is.\n\n1357\n00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:59,210\nSo with Bell-LaPadula, we have what's\nknown as the simple security rule.\n\n1358\n00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:03,580\nThis says, first rule, a subject cannot\nread data at a higher security level.\n\n1359\n01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,280\nIn other words,\nwhat we say is you cannot read up.\n\n1360\n01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:08,850\nSo in other words,\nyou can't go ahead and if you're at,\n\n1361\n01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:12,460\nyou know we think of layer one, layer two,\nlayer three, one being the lowest,\n\n1362\n01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:14,400\ntwo being the middle,\nthree being the highest.\n\n1363\n01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,950\nIf you're at layer one, you can't see\nstuff at layer two or layer three.\n\n1364\n01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:19,870\nRight, you can't read above your level.\n\n1365\n01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:20,740\nIt's not allowed.\n\n1366\n01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:24,820\nSo if you're layer two, you could see\nwhat is in layer one and at layer two but\n\n1367\n01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:25,910\nyou can't see layer three.\n\n1368\n01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:27,395\nThat's kind of what we're thinking there.\n\n1369\n01:00:27,395 --> 01:00:28,500\nDid I go way high?\n\n1370\n01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,150\nIt was like, it's the only time by the\nway, you know I'm a relatively short guy,\n\n1371\n01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,475\nyou may or\nmay not realize this just watching us.\n\n1372\n01:00:34,475 --> 01:00:35,590\nAnd kind of seeing us stand here.\n\n1373\n01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,310\nBut, you know, Mike and\nI are roughly the same height.\n\n1374\n01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:38,789\nBut Mike's a little bit taller than I am.\n\n1375\n01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:41,140\nBut, I'm only like 5'7\".\n\n1376\n01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:41,870\nRight?\nAnd you are, 5'8\"?\n\n1377\n01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:42,920\n5'9\", maybe?\nSomething like that.\n\n1378\n01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,720\n5'10\".\nSo, I'm not that tall.\n\n1379\n01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,835\nSo, when we do this in\na split screen like this,\n\n1380\n01:00:46,835 --> 01:00:49,560\nthis is the only time I can actually\nreach the top of the frame and\n\n1381\n01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,823\nactually get to the top of the board,\nwhen I'm teaching.\n\n1382\n01:00:51,823 --> 01:00:52,852\n>> Actually leave the board, yeah.\n\n1383\n01:00:52,852 --> 01:00:56,000\n>> Because normally I'm teaching, there's\na whole segment of the board up top\n\n1384\n01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,220\nthat just never gets touched because I\ncannot reach it, no matter how hard I try.\n\n1385\n01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,680\nI gotta actually get up on a chair if I\nwant to write at the top of the board.\n\n1386\n01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,740\nSo I am a short person, right?\n\n1387\n01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,780\nSo this is great for me,\nbecause when I do this and\n\n1388\n01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,400\nI see my arm disappears,\nI'm thinking, wow this is so cool.\n\n1389\n01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:09,970\nI grew.\n\n1390\n01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,320\nThis is so awesome.\n\n1391\n01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,420\nSo that's just, that's me,\njust so you know.\n\n1392\n01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,000\nSo, all right, now let's get\nback to being serious, right.\n\n1393\n01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,570\nSo, we have the simple security rule,\nright?\n\n1394\n01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:18,640\nWe cannot read up.\n\n1395\n01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,530\nVery important.\n\n1396\n01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:20,340\nNo reading up in Bell-LaPadula.\n\n1397\n01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,870\nThink about the logic of this.\n\n1398\n01:01:21,870 --> 01:01:23,780\nWe're focused on confidentiality.\n\n1399\n01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:27,330\nYou cannot expose data at\na higher level because if you do,\n\n1400\n01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:29,330\nwe've just blown confidentiality\nout of the water.\n\n1401\n01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:30,393\nRight?\nSo this is why we don't read up.\n\n1402\n01:01:30,393 --> 01:01:31,340\n>> Shouldn't see what you're\nnot authorized to see.\n\n1403\n01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,034\n>> Not supposed to see, exactly right.\n\n1404\n01:01:32,034 --> 01:01:33,270\n>> Right.\n>> So the star,\n\n1405\n01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:35,820\nwe read that second one as\nthe star property rule.\n\n1406\n01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:37,890\nLittle star, little asterisk.\n\n1407\n01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:39,260\nSo, star property.\n\n1408\n01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:42,820\nA subject, remember, subject is the user.\n\n1409\n01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,810\nUser cannot write to an object.\n\n1410\n01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:46,280\nObject is data.\n\n1411\n01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,380\nSo a subject cannot write to an object.\n\n1412\n01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:51,650\nUser cannot write to data\nat a lower security level.\n\n1413\n01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,065\nIn other words, no write down.\n\n1414\n01:01:53,065 --> 01:01:54,370\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1415\n01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:55,000\n>> Same idea.\n\n1416\n01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,690\nLayer one, layer two, layer three.\n\n1417\n01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:57,280\nTwo's in the middle.\n\n1418\n01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,320\nWe're at layer two.\n\n1419\n01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,880\nYou can't take data from layer two and\nwrite it down to layer one.\n\n1420\n01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,130\nThat's exposing higher-level\ndata to lower-level people\n\n1421\n01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:06,955\nthat can't read up to see\nit in the first place.\n\n1422\n01:02:06,955 --> 01:02:09,685\nIf you can't read up,\nyou definitely can't write down.\n\n1423\n01:02:09,685 --> 01:02:11,455\n>> Yep.\n>> Because if you read up, you expose it.\n\n1424\n01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:14,455\nYou take it from a higher level and\nbring it down, it's just like you read up,\n\n1425\n01:02:14,455 --> 01:02:16,065\nit's effectively exposing it.\n\n1426\n01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:18,765\nSo, this is why we focus\non confidentiality and so\n\n1427\n01:02:18,765 --> 01:02:21,797\nwe say no read up, no write down.\n\n1428\n01:02:21,797 --> 01:02:26,697\nNow, no read up, no write down\nare summary little condensed mnemonics,\n\n1429\n01:02:26,697 --> 01:02:28,947\nmemory things we want you to remember.\n\n1430\n01:02:28,947 --> 01:02:32,888\nYou don't remember it for the exam, right?\n\n1431\n01:02:32,888 --> 01:02:34,868\nBy saying, oh, no read up, no write down.\n\n1432\n01:02:34,868 --> 01:02:38,172\nYes remember that, but on the exam,\nyou're not going to see, no read up,\n\n1433\n01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:38,868\nno write down.\n\n1434\n01:02:38,868 --> 01:02:40,298\nLet me put it that way, right?\n\n1435\n01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:44,398\nSo, if it was that simple, well, then\nwe wouldn't have to spend an entire 20\n\n1436\n01:02:44,398 --> 01:02:47,268\nminutes of our discussion helping\nyou to understand how to do this.\n\n1437\n01:02:47,268 --> 01:02:49,370\nWe could simply say, here it is.\n\n1438\n01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:52,970\nSo what you need to make sure you're\nfocused on is the formal rule,\n\n1439\n01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:54,690\nas opposed to the informal summary.\n\n1440\n01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:57,442\nSo you need to understand\nthe simple security rule.\n\n1441\n01:02:57,442 --> 01:03:00,144\nThe star property rule,\nand what that means.\n\n1442\n01:03:00,144 --> 01:03:01,410\nSimple security means no read up.\n\n1443\n01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:05,120\nBut you have to equate the two,\nin other words what I'm saying, right?\n\n1444\n01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:08,160\nStar property means no write down,\nbut you have to equate the two.\n\n1445\n01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,330\nAnd then the last one, strong star.\n\n1446\n01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:11,930\nSubjects can perform read and\n\n1447\n01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:15,540\nwrite functions only to the objects\nat their security level.\n\n1448\n01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:17,470\nSo if we're at layer two\nyou can only read and\n\n1449\n01:03:17,470 --> 01:03:19,390\nwrite with objects at layer two, right?\n\n1450\n01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:24,040\nWe can interact with objects down below\nour level, but can't go above, right?\n\n1451\n01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:26,160\nBut, when we're talking about reading and\n\n1452\n01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,120\nwriting, we can only\ndo both at that level.\n\n1453\n01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:33,550\nWe could see objects that are below us,\nand read them, right?\n\n1454\n01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:36,220\nBut we're not allowed to write down,\nright?\n\n1455\n01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:37,190\nAnd we can't read up.\n\n1456\n01:03:37,190 --> 01:03:39,960\nSo the only way we do both together in\nthe same place is at our own level.\n\n1457\n01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:42,600\nSo want to make sure we\nunderstand the strong star.\n\n1458\n01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,472\nSo these three rules brought together\nare what we talked about with with\n\n1459\n01:03:45,472 --> 01:03:46,930\nBell-LaPadula, okay?\n\n1460\n01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:51,910\nSo that's Bell-LaPadula, one of our first\nmodels, focuses on confidentiality.\n\n1461\n01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:53,489\nNow Biba, as I already said,\n\n1462\n01:03:53,489 --> 01:03:57,734\nI kind of gave you the hint to let the cat\nout of the proverbial sack, if you will.\n\n1463\n01:03:57,734 --> 01:04:01,515\nAnd so Biba focuses on integrity,\nprobably want to just make a note,\n\n1464\n01:04:01,515 --> 01:04:04,723\nMike's going to do that for\nus here, thank you very much.\n\n1465\n01:04:04,723 --> 01:04:07,446\nSo focuses on integrity.\n\n1466\n01:04:07,446 --> 01:04:11,382\nSo, as a result we're gonna be focused,\nnot on keeping information secure,\n\n1467\n01:04:11,382 --> 01:04:14,184\nnot allowing it to be seen by\npeople at a lower level, but\n\n1468\n01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:17,190\nrather making sure information\ndoes not change in any way.\n\n1469\n01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:18,610\nHas not modified, right?\n\n1470\n01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:21,280\nSo, that's what we're\nfocused on with this model.\n\n1471\n01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,373\nAnd so, as a result,\nagain we have rules, but\n\n1472\n01:04:23,373 --> 01:04:26,110\nremember they're the exact\nopposite of Bell-LaPadula.\n\n1473\n01:04:26,110 --> 01:04:29,020\nSo, it says here the simple\nintegrity axiom.\n\n1474\n01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:31,010\nSimple integrity axiom.\n\n1475\n01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:35,240\nWe probably wanna, just maybe make a space\nbetween axiom and A or dash or something.\n\n1476\n01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,340\nYeah, just so we can tell.\n\n1477\n01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,830\nDo the same thing with the other one.\n\n1478\n01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:38,560\nYeah, just yeah, whatever.\n\n1479\n01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:40,750\nJust do the same thing down below for\nthe star integrity axiom.\n\n1480\n01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,330\nI probably forgot to do that or\n\n1481\n01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:43,770\nmaybe just when we did the clean\nup we didn't catch it.\n\n1482\n01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:44,740\n>> Kinda lost it?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1483\n01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,520\nSo, simple integrity axiom.\n\n1484\n01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,350\nA subject, remember subject is user,\ncannot read data.\n\n1485\n01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:53,760\nData is the object, cannot read\ndata at a lower integrity level.\n\n1486\n01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,850\nIn other words, because of integrity, now\ninstead of no read up, it's no read down.\n\n1487\n01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:00,790\nRight?\n\n1488\n01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:03,490\nSo, we don't want you reading\ndata at a lower level,\n\n1489\n01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:05,435\nbecause you could modify it inadvertently.\n\n1490\n01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:06,370\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n1491\n01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:07,895\n>> Or on purpose I suppose.\n\n1492\n01:05:07,895 --> 01:05:09,790\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Then the star integrity axiom,\n\n1493\n01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:13,600\nremember the star, the asterisk is\njust read star, star integrity.\n\n1494\n01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,600\n>> A subject cannot modify an object.\n\n1495\n01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,780\nUsers cannot modify data.\n\n1496\n01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:20,430\nIn a higher integrity level\nwe're not allowed to write up.\n\n1497\n01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:24,780\nIf we write up we could modify\ndata as a result of writing up.\n\n1498\n01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,735\nSo, the exact opposite right,\n\n1499\n01:05:26,735 --> 01:05:30,435\nBell-LaPadula says no\nread up no write down.\n\n1500\n01:05:30,435 --> 01:05:33,420\nBibba says no read down no write up.\n\n1501\n01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,880\nMake sure you know\nthe difference between them.\n\n1502\n01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,570\nIt would be very, very important for\nyou to be able to specify those.\n\n1503\n01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:43,070\nAnd also that Bell-LaPadula\nfocuses on confidentiality.\n\n1504\n01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:45,280\nBibba focuses on integrity.\n\n1505\n01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,540\nThat is integrative capitalized.\n\n1506\n01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:47,230\nThat's very important.\n\n1507\n01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:48,280\nAll right, very good.\n\n1508\n01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,740\nAll right, so then Clark Wilson.\n\n1509\n01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:52,650\nThe Clark Wilson model is going to\n\n1510\n01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:57,920\nallow us to focus on, and by the way\nthis is also an integrity model.\n\n1511\n01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,984\nAs you can see there.\n\n1512\n01:06:04,258 --> 01:06:09,190\nBut it is the, or the, Itegrity model,\nthe new version of integrity.\n\n1513\n01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:13,920\nSo, it is the only integrity model\nClark-Wilson that focuses on all\n\n1514\n01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,770\nthree goals of integrity.\n\n1515\n01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:18,850\nSo, Biba only focuses on one\nof the goals of Integrity,\n\n1516\n01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:21,970\nwhereas Clark-Wilson focuses on all three.\n\n1517\n01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:24,370\nSo, this is an important distinction for\nyou.\n\n1518\n01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:27,190\nWe're not really worried about write-up,\nread down, whatever.\n\n1519\n01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:29,380\nThis is really just more a matter of\nwhat are the three goals of integrity.\n\n1520\n01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:32,430\nIt's what the Clark-Wilson\nmodel represents.\n\n1521\n01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:34,060\nThree goals are listed here.\n\n1522\n01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:37,310\nSubjects can access objects only\nthrough an authorized program.\n\n1523\n01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:39,410\nWe call this an access triple.\n\n1524\n01:06:39,410 --> 01:06:41,390\nSeparation of duties is enforced.\n\n1525\n01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:43,890\nThis is the second of\nthree goals of integrity.\n\n1526\n01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:45,360\nThird one, auditing is required.\n\n1527\n01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:50,470\nSo Clark-Wilson addresses all three,\nBibba only addresses one of the three.\n\n1528\n01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:53,060\nSo, you just wanna make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n1529\n01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:58,570\nAnd then for Brewer and Nash,\nthis is commonly referred to,\n\n1530\n01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:01,460\nI think I have it there in the note,\nalso known as the Chinese Wall Model.\n\n1531\n01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:04,160\nThis is commonly referred\nto as the Chinese Wall.\n\n1532\n01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,180\nThe idea there is that, as you can see,\n\n1533\n01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:10,050\ndynamically changing access controls to\nprotect against conflicts of interest.\n\n1534\n01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:11,560\nSo, this is the classic example.\n\n1535\n01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:15,130\nIt's like a law firm where you\nmight be both doing the defense and\n\n1536\n01:07:15,130 --> 01:07:16,920\nthe prosecution of the case.\n\n1537\n01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:20,560\nSome of these large cases, where they have\nseparate legal teams that deal with both.\n\n1538\n01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:24,710\nThey literally put logical walls in place\nto prevent any information sharing.\n\n1539\n01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:26,330\nTeams are totally separate.\n\n1540\n01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:29,600\nYou know, physical infrastructure\nseparate, separate computers,\n\n1541\n01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:33,920\nseparate offices, separate staffs of\nindividuals, separate file storage.\n\n1542\n01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:34,910\nWhole nine yards.\n\n1543\n01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:36,330\nThat is the Brewer and Nash model.\n\n1544\n01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:40,890\nSo, you know our addressing idea of no\npotential for information conflict or\n\n1545\n01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,180\nconflict of interest by effectively\ncreating safeguards to prevent that\n\n1546\n01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:45,220\nfrom happening.\n\n1547\n01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:47,640\nSo, we want to make sure we have\na sense of these four models.\n\n1548\n01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:52,170\nThere are some others,\nthey are obviously available too.\n\n1549\n01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:54,730\nYou can do a little bit of digging and\nfind out about more of them.\n\n1550\n01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:58,320\nBut these are the four main ones\nthat we often hear spoken about,\n\n1551\n01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:01,280\nthat we talk about especially\nBell-Lapadula and Bibba.\n\n1552\n01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,140\nReally, really focusing on those and\nunderstanding those.\n\n1553\n01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:06,155\nBrewer Nash is more of a footnote really.\n\n1554\n01:08:06,155 --> 01:08:09,670\nJust understanding the idea of\nconflict of interest prevention in\n\n1555\n01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:12,530\nreference to the Chinese firewall,\nthe Chinese Wall rather.\n\n1556\n01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:17,910\nAnd then the fact that Clark Wilson\nis going to address all three\n\n1557\n01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:22,390\nof the integrity goals as opposed to Bibba\nwhich only addresses the one of them.\n\n1558\n01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:23,850\nSo, these are going to\nbe important points.\n\n1559\n01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:27,120\nThe important summary points\naround these security models.\n\n1560\n01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:30,120\nSo, now we've talked about models, let's\ntalk about security modes a little bit.\n\n1561\n01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,070\nSo, how are these models implemented.\n\n1562\n01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:34,840\nWhat are the security modes\nthat we operate under, and\n\n1563\n01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,740\nkind of the ways in which these work.\n\n1564\n01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:40,090\nAnd so we have several different\nsecurity modes as you can see here.\n\n1565\n01:08:40,090 --> 01:08:42,220\nGoing to have a total of four of them.\n\n1566\n01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:44,150\nAnd so, we have Dedicated Security Mode.\n\n1567\n01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:46,120\nWe have System High Security Mode.\n\n1568\n01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:47,750\nThose are the first two you can see fully.\n\n1569\n01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:49,700\nThere's Compartmented down at the bottom.\n\n1570\n01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,030\nBelow that there's\nMultilevel Security Mode.\n\n1571\n01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:54,160\nAll four of these, as you can see.\n\n1572\n01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:56,470\nSo, let's go through and\nlet's talk quickly about they are.\n\n1573\n01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:59,930\nSo, in Dedicated Security Mode, all,\ncapitalized or highlighted the word all\n\n1574\n01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:03,890\nthere, so All users, meaning no\nexceptions, right, for all of these modes.\n\n1575\n01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,710\nAll users have to be able\nto meet these criteria.\n\n1576\n01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:09,570\nThere's a hash list of five items there.\n\n1577\n01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:13,130\nProper clearance for\nall information on or in the system.\n\n1578\n01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:16,190\nFormal access approval for\nall information on the system.\n\n1579\n01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:20,490\nA signed NDA,\nNDA is a non-disclosure agreement,\n\n1580\n01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:23,638\nso for all information in the system or\non the system.\n\n1581\n01:09:23,638 --> 01:09:27,060\nA valid need-to-know for\nall information on the system.\n\n1582\n01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:30,520\nAnd all users can access all data,\nmeaning a Dedicated Security Mode.\n\n1583\n01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:33,130\nIf you get in,\nanything in the system you can see,\n\n1584\n01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:36,480\nall the way up to the most\nsensitive information.\n\n1585\n01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,440\nSo, we often see these really\nbizarre stories, hear not see.\n\n1586\n01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,410\nYou see them if you work in\nthe military or the government, but\n\n1587\n01:09:43,410 --> 01:09:46,510\nyou hear about them in the private\nworld if you're not in that world.\n\n1588\n01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:48,170\nBut you know I have a lot of\nfriends that do this kind of work.\n\n1589\n01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:49,090\nA lot of friends in the military.\n\n1590\n01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:50,920\nA lot of friends in government service.\n\n1591\n01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,630\nI do a lot of work for these entities\nfrom time to time on the training side,\n\n1592\n01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:55,450\nthe consulting side.\n\n1593\n01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:57,980\nIt's not very often that you come\nacross one of the bizarre stories.\n\n1594\n01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:01,460\nI remember several years back, I have\na couple of you know very good friends,\n\n1595\n01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:04,650\nvery old friends, known them for\na long time, that are in service.\n\n1596\n01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:08,150\nOne of them is in the, a couple of\nthem are in the J Directorate, so,\n\n1597\n01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:11,770\nthey're in information intelligence,\nthings like that, information insurance.\n\n1598\n01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:15,808\nOne of them is in the navy, fairly high\nup in the naval intelligence branch.\n\n1599\n01:10:15,808 --> 01:10:19,860\nAnd so, she does a lot of work.\n\n1600\n01:10:19,860 --> 01:10:21,180\nDoes a lot of really interesting stuff.\n\n1601\n01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,770\nAnd then a lot of stuff that, you know,\n\n1602\n01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:25,160\nif you could talk about it would actually\nbe pretty cool, I suppose, right?\n\n1603\n01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,620\nA lot of really interesting things.\n\n1604\n01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:29,840\nBut she told me a story, we were out\nhaving dinner one night when I was up\n\n1605\n01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,600\nnorth and I was, you know, in D.C.\non business, and so I got to see her.\n\n1606\n01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,780\nWe went out to dinner.\n\n1607\n01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:37,360\nAnd she was telling me this story\n\n1608\n01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,130\nabout a weapons system she was\ninvolved with that she was working on.\n\n1609\n01:10:40,130 --> 01:10:41,600\nThis was not like top-secret stuff.\n\n1610\n01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,630\nThis was weapons systems\nalready out at the time and\n\n1611\n01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:46,120\nit was widely talked about and\neverybody knew about it.\n\n1612\n01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:49,140\nBut she had done work on it during\nthe testing phases out in the Gulf.\n\n1613\n01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:52,340\nAnd been on some of the ships that were\nworking on it, that kind of thing,\n\n1614\n01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,780\nbeing involved in the testing.\n\n1615\n01:10:53,780 --> 01:10:57,440\nSo, some of the early design concepts,\nright, where they get these high\n\n1616\n01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,770\nlevel engineers, mathematicians\npeople come do this design work.\n\n1617\n01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:02,060\n>> Right.\n>> So, they write up these\n\n1618\n01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,060\nplans and stuff right.\n\n1619\n01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,080\nThe papers that are going\nto document the stuff.\n\n1620\n01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:08,720\nSo, she was saying, there was this case\nwere a lot of this stuff was done,\n\n1621\n01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,240\nthere were like maybe three or four people\nin the world that understood some of\n\n1622\n01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,750\nthe stuff that was being done,\n>> Right.\n\n1623\n01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:15,370\n>> So, one of these guys\nwrote this big paper on it\n\n1624\n01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:16,360\n>> Submitted the paper.\n\n1625\n01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:20,230\nAnd it was classified, went into\nthis system, this dedicated system,\n\n1626\n01:11:20,230 --> 01:11:21,790\nthis dedicated security-run system.\n\n1627\n01:11:21,790 --> 01:11:24,740\nAnd the problem was that if you\ndidn't have right clearance,\n\n1628\n01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:27,060\nyou couldn't see the stuff because\nyou couldn't get in the system.\n\n1629\n01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:28,590\nSo, he wrote the paper.\n\n1630\n01:11:28,590 --> 01:11:32,340\n>> But then they had to submit it into\nthe system as part of the overall\n\n1631\n01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:33,830\nfiling that they were doing.\n\n1632\n01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:34,910\nAnd once it went in,\n\n1633\n01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:37,830\nthere was nobody who had clearance to\nget into the system to see this thing.\n\n1634\n01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:39,480\nAnd so they had to make changes to it.\n\n1635\n01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,850\n>> Wow.\n>> And so the only person that,\n\n1636\n01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:45,110\non the team, that had clearance to get in,\nwas not the guy who wrote the paper.\n\n1637\n01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:46,820\nNot any of the guys who understood it.\n\n1638\n01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:49,440\nBut basically, it was like and\nadministrative assistant\n\n1639\n01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:53,320\nto one of the generals or whatever that\nran this weapons procurement program.\n\n1640\n01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,650\nSo, she was the only one who actually was\ncleared on this system that could get in\n\n1641\n01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:00,090\nto actually see this document\nthat had been submitted.\n\n1642\n01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:01,960\nBecause nobody else had\nthe right security clearance,\n\n1643\n01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,440\nthey weren't read into the system.\n\n1644\n01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,454\nAnd so, she had no clue,\nI mean absolutely like none.\n\n1645\n01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:07,273\nThis would be like you or\nme reading this paper,\n\n1646\n01:12:07,273 --> 01:12:08,827\nwe have no clue what's going on with it.\n\n1647\n01:12:08,827 --> 01:12:11,070\nYou can look at it and you know,\nif they took you away and said, okay,\n\n1648\n01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:12,910\nwe're going to torture you,\ntell us what's in there.\n\n1649\n01:12:12,910 --> 01:12:15,389\nYou're like shoot me now because\nI saw it but I couldn't tell you.\n\n1650\n01:12:15,389 --> 01:12:16,588\nI don't even know.\n\n1651\n01:12:16,588 --> 01:12:19,158\nRight, and so\nshe had know clue what she was doing but\n\n1652\n01:12:19,158 --> 01:12:22,550\nthe only way they could edit it and\nmake the changes.\n\n1653\n01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:24,300\nThey couldn't get out of\nthe system to see the whole thing.\n\n1654\n01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:25,910\nYou put it in, you can't get it out.\n\n1655\n01:12:25,910 --> 01:12:27,930\nIt goes into a black hole,\nyou never see it again.\n\n1656\n01:12:27,930 --> 01:12:32,010\nSo the only way you update the thing was\nbasically there to get the guy who wrote\n\n1657\n01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:34,430\nit to write up all the changes,\nall the notes, all the edits.\n\n1658\n01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:37,670\nThis poor lady who knew nothing about\nwhat was going on had to sit there and\n\n1659\n01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:39,190\nactually edit this scientific paper.\n\n1660\n01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:41,720\n>> Wow.\n>> To make it make sense with detailed\n\n1661\n01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:43,190\ninstructions about basically what to do.\n\n1662\n01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:46,370\nBut because of the nature of the security\nof the system it's not like this guy can\n\n1663\n01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:48,560\nsit with her over her shoulder and\ntell her to do this.\n\n1664\n01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:49,081\n>> Right.\n\n1665\n01:12:49,081 --> 01:12:50,150\n>> He couldn't be in the room.\n\n1666\n01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:53,480\nShe had to be in a room by herself,\nnobody could be around when she did this.\n\n1667\n01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,830\nSo they had to write all this stuff up,\ngive it to this poor lady, and\n\n1668\n01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:57,870\nthen hope she got it right.\n\n1669\n01:12:57,870 --> 01:13:01,760\nAnd this was a multi-billion dollar\nweapons system that they were building.\n\n1670\n01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,840\n>> And we wonder why\n>> And\n\n1671\n01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,600\nyou wonder why some things don't\nwork the way they're suppose to.\n\n1672\n01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,790\nI think it's a three but,\nyou know, I'm not sure.\n\n1673\n01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:09,080\nLooks like a three I'll put a three there.\n\n1674\n01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,110\nWhat could it possibly be?\n\n1675\n01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:13,870\n>> It's just warheads.\n\n1676\n01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:18,090\n>> It's only nuclear weapons yields\nhow far off could we possibly be?\n\n1677\n01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:22,580\nThis is the kind of strange thing\nthat happens with these systems is\n\n1678\n01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:24,820\nif you're not really setting them up and\n\n1679\n01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:28,370\nthinking about the kind of stuff that goes\nin there, you get this all the time where\n\n1680\n01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:31,070\nstuff just disappears into these\nsystems and it never comes out again.\n\n1681\n01:13:31,070 --> 01:13:32,480\nYou just never can see it.\n\n1682\n01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:34,150\nThis is a dedicated security mode.\n\n1683\n01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:35,510\nThis is what these systems are.\n\n1684\n01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:36,100\nAnd they exist.\n\n1685\n01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:37,630\nThey are real.\nThey exist in government.\n\n1686\n01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:42,240\nPrimarily in the military at\nhigh level government entities.\n\n1687\n01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:47,290\nA lot of the government offices where\nthey deal with information insurance and\n\n1688\n01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:48,020\ndeal with intelligence.\n\n1689\n01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:50,760\n>> I can see it in one way where it\nwould make things a little bit easier.\n\n1690\n01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,840\nIf you only had to give\naccess to that machine, and\n\n1691\n01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,100\nnot to every resource on there.\n\n1692\n01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:56,780\nI mean, that makes life a little easier.\n\n1693\n01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:59,350\n>> Anybody who gets access,\neffectively is clear to see everything,\n\n1694\n01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:00,520\nregardless of what it is.\n\n1695\n01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,390\nWhether it's the recipe for\nbrownies or it's the launch codes and\n\n1696\n01:14:03,390 --> 01:14:04,390\neverything in between.\n\n1697\n01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:06,620\nYou're cleared for it all,\nso just go in there.\n\n1698\n01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:09,680\nBut it's a very small, select group\nof people at the end of the day.\n\n1699\n01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,440\nThat's what we have their\nsystem high security mode.\n\n1700\n01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,995\nSo any user, again all users, right?\n\n1701\n01:14:15,995 --> 01:14:16,820\nWant be clear about this.\n\n1702\n01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:20,410\nAny users that is in the system\nmust meet these criteria.\n\n1703\n01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:21,955\nProper clearance for all

NDA.\n\n1707\n01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:27,470\nThis is kind of a common thing.\n\n1708\n01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:28,840\nYou see this on almost every one.\n\n1709\n01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:31,340\nRight?\nA valid need to know for some information.\n\n1710\n01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:33,120\nThis is where we differ.\n\n1711\n01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:33,930\n>> Not all.\n\n1712\n01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:34,890\n>> Not all.\nRight.\n\n1713\n01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:39,280\nSo a valid need to know for some, and\nthen all users can access some data.\n\n1714\n01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:40,170\nNot all data.\n\n1715\n01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,610\nBased on their need to know.\n\n1716\n01:14:41,610 --> 01:14:43,930\nSo there's data in the system\nyou won't get to see, and\n\n1717\n01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,350\nthere's data you do get to see.\n\n1718\n01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:48,720\nObviously would have been a better choice\nin my little story had they gone that\n\n1719\n01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:52,420\nroute and said, oh, you're the guy,\nlet's turn on that part of the menu for\n\n1720\n01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:55,350\nyou let's you see your thing but whatever\nyou don't know that's just how this is\n\n1721\n01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:56,640\nset up, you know this is what it is.\n\n1722\n01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,710\nSo system high, right system high make\nsure you know the difference there,\n\n1723\n01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:04,670\ncompartmented, security node,\nproper clearance again for highest for\n\n1724\n01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:08,620\nthe highest level of data on that system,\nso even though you may not see.\n\n1725\n01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:12,270\nThat level of data, in other words, you\nhave a need to know if it's built in here.\n\n1726\n01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:15,830\nSo, it's kind of like combining\nthe system high, right?\n\n1727\n01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:18,430\nWe're dedicated, in the sense that,\nyou have access to,\n\n1728\n01:15:18,430 --> 01:15:21,810\npotentially, there is access\nto all the data on the system.\n\n1729\n01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:23,380\nBut, you have a need-to-know factor.\n\n1730\n01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:25,880\nAnd so,\nthe need-to-know limits the data access.\n\n1731\n01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,870\nBut you have to be cleared for\nthe highest level.\n\n1732\n01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:31,350\nBecause you may inadvertently be\nexposed to the highest level of data or\n\n1733\n01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:33,050\non purpose be able to see it.\n\n1734\n01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:34,560\nBut we can't take the chance.\n\n1735\n01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,120\nAnd so you have yo be cleared for\nthe highest level of data in the system,\n\n1736\n01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,150\neven though you may only be\nrestricted to a lower level.\n\n1737\n01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:40,390\n>> Your clearance doesn't\ngive you the access.\n\n1738\n01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:42,560\nThe need yo know is going\nto give you the access.\n\n1739\n01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,610\n>> The need to know filters the access.\n\n1740\n01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:47,760\nAnd in fact it grants it for you, but\nyour clearance you must be

01:17:34,130\nthe formal access approval.\n\n1788\n01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:36,920\nA signed NDA for\nall information on the system.\n\n1789\n01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,270\nValid need-to-know for some information.\n\n1790\n01:17:39,270 --> 01:17:41,280\nAll users can access again some data.\n\n1791\n01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,090\nIt's based on need-to-know.\n\n1792\n01:17:43,090 --> 01:17:45,100\nBased on clearance.\n\n1793\n01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,040\nAnd formal access.\n\n1794\n01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:48,815\nSo we've added clearance into\nthe mix there, with multi-level.\n\n1795\n01:17:48,815 --> 01:17:51,050\nBecause now you have to\nhave proper clearance.\n\n1796\n01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:51,960\nFormal approval.\n\n1797\n01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:52,950\nFormal access approval.\n\n1798\n01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:53,740\nAnd need-to-know.\n\n1799\n01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:56,440\nWe have three things,\nthat effectively filter, and\n\n1800\n01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:59,070\nbroker, the ability to see data here.\n\n1801\n01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:02,210\nSo I want to make sure we're aware\nof this, we're focused on this and\n\n1802\n01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:03,680\nwe understand this, right?\n\n1803\n01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,280\nSo, very important to understand\nthe different levels here, right?\n\n1804\n01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,990\nI want to make sure, remember we\nhave four of them as we go through.\n\n1805\n01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:12,520\nMulti level, compartmented, system, high.\n\n1806\n01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:16,090\nKind of talked about dedicated being\nthe most restricted in the sense that\n\n1807\n01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,900\nyou have to be cleared for everything.\n\n1808\n01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:21,530\nAnd really it's going to be the most limit\nin the sense the number of people because\n\n1809\n01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,300\nunless you're cleared at\nthat highest level for\n\n1810\n01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:26,940\neverything you're not really going to see\nthe system because it's a very small group\n\n1811\n01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:28,020\nof people who get in there.\n\n1812\n01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:30,910\nAnd then multi level down at the bottom\nas we work our way down you know is\n\n1813\n01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:34,450\ngoing to be very finely controlled and\nfiltered into that level you're in but\n\n1814\n01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:37,380\nthere's a lot of people in the system\nbecause it exists at different levels.\n\n1815\n01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:40,360\nIt's almost like in star trek\nin the original star trek if\n\n1816\n01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,610\nyou remember when Spock every so\noften he played chess.\n\n1817\n01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:45,100\nHe had that.\nThree-dimensional multi-level chess board,\n\n1818\n01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:48,060\nif you remember, or\nthe little floating chess thing.\n\n1819\n01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:52,550\n>> I probably shouldn't say I have one\nof those at the house, but you know.\n\n1820\n01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:54,270\n>> I wouldn't say that in\npublic if I was you, no.\n\n1821\n01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:57,130\nNot if you're looking to remain the cool,\nchic hipster that you are.\n\n1822\n01:18:57,130 --> 01:18:57,710\n>> Jimmy, can we rewind?\n>> Yes.\n\n1823\n01:18:57,710 --> 01:18:58,340\n>> Cut this.\n\n1824\n01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:59,150\nCan you edit that out.\n\n1825\n01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:00,500\nSo yeah but he had that so\n\n1826\n01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,150\nthe idea was you have basically\nmulti level solution right.\n\n1827\n01:19:03,150 --> 01:19:04,660\nYou existed and\nplayed on different levels.\n\n1828\n01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:05,840\nSame concept right.\n\n1829\n01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:08,850\nBut it's cool now if you think about it\nbecause you know now in Big Bang Theory.\n\n1830\n01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:10,060\nKind of leap forward 25 years.\n\n1831\n01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:12,380\nSheldon made it cool\nbecause Sheldon had that.\n\n1832\n01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:13,130\n>> He did.\nHe pulled it out.\n\n1833\n01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:14,440\n>> He pulled it out so\nit's kind of the same thing.\n\n1834\n01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:16,170\nSo now it's kind of hip and cool.\n\n1835\n01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:16,720\n>> Bazinga.\n\n1836\n01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,080\n>> In a bazinga nerdy kind of way,\nabsolutely right..\n\n1837\n01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:23,230\nAll right so we have a, all of our\ndifferent levels right if you will and\n\n1838\n01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:26,100\nour ways in which we can go through.\n\n1839\n01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:29,200\nAnd really just think about\nthese different models.\n\n1840\n01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:30,510\nRight or the way in which we I guess,\n\n1841\n01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:34,030\nwe want to think about the way in which we\nactually produce them and put them to use.\n\n1842\n01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:36,950\nSo what we want to do know is we want to\ntalk about, this whole idea of system\n\n1843\n01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:41,180\nevaluation methods and so we are talking\nabout system evaluation methods.\n\n1844\n01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:44,110\nWe are talking about the ways in which\nwe examine all the stuff we just\n\n1845\n01:19:44,110 --> 01:19:45,310\ntalked about building.\n\n1846\n01:19:45,310 --> 01:19:47,450\nThe TCB, the trust computing base,\n\n1847\n01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:51,160\nright this idea of the different\nmodels that are implemented,\n\n1848\n01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:54,470\nwhether it's multi level or\nit's dedicated or it's anything like that.\n\n1849\n01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:56,110\nSo now how are we going to evaluate these?\n\n1850\n01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:58,360\nHow do we really know they are doing\nthe things they are suppose to do?\n\n1851\n01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,650\nMore importantly,\nwhat kind of criteria do we use?\n\n1852\n01:20:00,650 --> 01:20:01,307\nHow do we measure them?\n\n1853\n01:20:01,307 --> 01:20:03,623\nHow do we figure out whether or\nnot they're what we need.\n\n1854\n01:20:03,623 --> 01:20:06,000\nSo there's been several attempts\nat this over the years.\n\n1855\n01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,702\nWant to walk you through some\nof the history around this.\n\n1856\n01:20:08,702 --> 01:20:10,925\nAnd then we'll obviously take\na look at some of the levels and\n\n1857\n01:20:10,925 --> 01:20:12,156\nhow we actually implement them.\n\n1858\n01:20:12,156 --> 01:20:16,730\nSo one of the first attempts to figure\nout how to start evaluating all of this\n\n1859\n01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:18,570\nwas known as the TCSEC.\n\n1860\n01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:22,670\nTCSEC stands for Trusted Computer\nSystem Evaluation Criteria.\n\n1861\n01:20:22,670 --> 01:20:26,820\nIt was created by the Department of\nDefense, so it's a U.S. centric thing.\n\n1862\n01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,360\nIt's commonly referred to\nsimply as the Orange Book.\n\n1863\n01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,650\nThe Orange Book is a reference to\nthe color of the cover of the book.\n\n1864\n01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:34,730\nIt was part of what was known\nas the Rainbow Series of books.\n\n1865\n01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:38,960\nAnd the Rainbow Series of books,\nIBM played a hand in this.\n\n1866\n01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,990\nThey were going to actually\nhelp to put out and\n\n1867\n01:20:40,990 --> 01:20:42,660\nkind of publish jointly, these books.\n\n1868\n01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:46,600\nBut, the Rainbow Series we had a Green\nBook, a Brown Book, Yellow Book, Red Book,\n\n1869\n01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,860\nanother one we'll talk about.\n\n1870\n01:20:47,860 --> 01:20:51,430\nThe Red book was know as the TNI,\nthe Trusted Network Infrastructure.\n\n1871\n01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:52,770\nThat was what the Red Book was called.\n\n1872\n01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:56,330\nBut the two most famous ones,\nbecause there were a whole bunch of them,\n\n1873\n01:20:56,330 --> 01:20:59,340\nmost of them really fell by the wayside,\nnot all that critical.\n\n1874\n01:20:59,340 --> 01:20:59,970\nThe Orange Book and\n\n1875\n01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:02,440\nthe Red Book kind of became\nthe famous ones everybody refers to.\n\n1876\n01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:05,240\nAnd they are the original\nstandards that were created\n\n1877\n01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:07,510\nto really figure out how to\nstart doing some of this stuff.\n\n1878\n01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:10,570\nPromulgate and really internalize and\n\n1879\n01:21:10,570 --> 01:21:14,700\nstandardize how we're going to\ncreate these models, assess them,\n\n1880\n01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:18,650\nmanage them, implement them, monitor them,\nmaintain them through a life cycle.\n\n1881\n01:21:18,650 --> 01:21:21,450\nSo that's what the TCSEC starts to do for\nus.\n\n1882\n01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:25,920\nIt is going to focus on this\noverarching idea of this framework.\n\n1883\n01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:30,130\nHelps us to understand how to look\nat system design, all the things\n\n1884\n01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:34,950\ngo into system design, and building the\nsystem overall from a secure standpoint.\n\n1885\n01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:37,510\nThat's with the TCSEC,\nwhich is the Orange Book.\n\n1886\n01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:42,010\nPlease make that connection in your head,\nTCSEC equals Orange Book.\n\n1887\n01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:43,180\nThat is what this is.\n\n1888\n01:21:43,180 --> 01:21:45,600\nAnd so,\nthe TCSEC is the first attempt at this.\n\n1889\n01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,400\nAnd what the TCSEC does, if we could\njust scroll down there for a moment.\n\n1890\n01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:54,020\nYou'll see we talk about this idea of\nwhat's known as an assurance evaluation.\n\n1891\n01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:58,715\nSo, the assurance evaluation examines,\nas you can see here,\n\n1892\n01:21:58,715 --> 01:22:01,640\nsecurity-relevant parts of a system,\nmeaning what's known as the TCB.\n\n1893\n01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:02,795\nWe've talked about this.\n\n1894\n01:22:02,795 --> 01:22:06,030\nTrust the computing base,\naccess control mechanisms,\n\n1895\n01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:08,400\nreference monitor kernel and\nprotection mechanisms.\n\n1896\n01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,270\nAll the things in other words,\n\n1897\n01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:15,450\nall around that make up our secure\nsystem are evaluated and examined.\n\n1898\n01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:18,357\nThe relationship interaction between\nall these components is also evaluated.\n\n1899\n01:22:18,357 --> 01:22:22,993\nSo, the Orange Book was used to evaluate\nwhether this system overall contained\n\n1900\n01:22:22,993 --> 01:22:26,741\nthe proper security properties\nthat the vendor claimed it did.\n\n1901\n01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:29,148\nAnd whether or not, as a result,\nwas appropriate for\n\n1902\n01:22:29,148 --> 01:22:31,356\nsome sort of specific application or\nfunction.\n\n1903\n01:22:31,356 --> 01:22:35,190\nProbably wanna tab that over\nspecific application or function.\n\n1904\n01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:37,570\nNo, yeah, or just delete up from a.\n\n1905\n01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:39,850\nGo to a, at the end of a there,\nand just delete.\n\n1906\n01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:43,140\nDelete or backspace so we can get, oh, no.\n\n1907\n01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:43,950\nPut that back, I'm sorry.\n\n1908\n01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:44,466\nYou fixed it anyway.\n\n1909\n01:22:44,466 --> 01:22:48,173\nFor a, just pull that up, the hash mark\nthere belongs being removed there.\n\n1910\n01:22:48,173 --> 01:22:49,320\nAnd just take that hash out.\n\n1911\n01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:51,790\nI think it did it on\nthe other one up there too.\n\n1912\n01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:52,830\n>> Okay.\n>> So anyway, we have that.\n\n1913\n01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:58,305\nSo the idea then is the TCSEC Is\ngonna allow us to be able to,\n\n1914\n01:22:58,305 --> 01:23:00,625\nyeah, should just be moved up there,\nperfect.\n\n1915\n01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:03,845\nBut TCSEC allows us, or\nreally helps us to, down below now.\n\n1916\n01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:04,965\nRight there, perfect.\n\n1917\n01:23:04,965 --> 01:23:08,527\nSo allows us to address confidentiality,\nvery important to think think about this,\n\n1918\n01:23:08,527 --> 01:23:11,157\naddresses confidentiality,\nbut not integrity.\n\n1919\n01:23:11,157 --> 01:23:14,767\nSo we want to make sure we understand\nTCSEC is focused on confidentiality.\n\n1920\n01:23:14,767 --> 01:23:16,327\nNo mention of integrity.\n\n1921\n01:23:16,327 --> 01:23:20,447\nAll of the security mechanisms and\nthe assurance of those mechanisms\n\n1922\n01:23:20,447 --> 01:23:24,267\nare not evaluated separately but\nwe rate them and evaluate them as a whole.\n\n1923\n01:23:24,267 --> 01:23:26,207\nIn other words we look\nat the entire system.\n\n1924\n01:23:26,207 --> 01:23:29,610\nAgain, that should also be,\nI don't know why it was doing that.\n\n1925\n01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:30,830\nSo as a whole, and\n\n1926\n01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:35,020\nthe TCSEC provides a classification system\nas a result of this that is going to be\n\n1927\n01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:38,580\ndivided up hierarchically into what\nare known as assurance levels.\n\n1928\n01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:39,670\nAssurance levels.\n\n1929\n01:23:39,670 --> 01:23:41,990\nAnd so we have multiple levels here.\n\n1930\n01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:44,730\nWe have, starting at the bottom,\nlet's actually go down.\n\n1931\n01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:46,970\nLet's go down to D and\nwe'll work our way back up.\n\n1932\n01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:50,130\nSo we have D for minimal security.\n\n1933\n01:23:50,130 --> 01:23:54,380\nWhich is going to be basically the higher\nup we go, the more secure we are.\n\n1934\n01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:58,340\nSo starting at D, bottom ground level,\nminimal security, really nothing.\n\n1935\n01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:02,500\nThis is like you turning on\na Windows system, no patches,\n\n1936\n01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:06,380\nno software of any kind to do malware or\nvirus scanning or anything.\n\n1937\n01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:08,560\nJust out of the box,\nthat's like minimal security.\n\n1938\n01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,950\nIt's like basically, you know,\nabsolutely not secure at all.\n\n1939\n01:24:10,950 --> 01:24:15,270\nSo from D we go up, and what we do\nis we go up and we go from C2 to C1.\n\n1940\n01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:17,180\nAnd we'll kind of scroll up.\n\n1941\n01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:20,240\nAnd so, as we go up the chain, right?\n\n1942\n01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:25,050\nWe go from low to high,\nC2 is not as secure as C1.\n\n1943\n01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:31,200\nC2 is right above D, C1 is going to\nbe considered more secure than C2 is.\n\n1944\n01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:34,400\nAnd then, we have B3, B2,\nB1, kind of go up that way.\n\n1945\n01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:38,280\nRight, so just being aware of this and\nthinking about this.\n\n1946\n01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:43,410\nSo the idea as we go up is that\n[COUGH] we ultimately get up to A.\n\n1947\n01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:49,160\nAnd so when we get to A, verified\nprotection, this is like an A1 system.\n\n1948\n01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:51,990\nA1 is the most secure.\n\n1949\n01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:54,410\nSo go from C2 to C1, C1 being more secure.\n\n1950\n01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:56,760\nA1 being the most secure\nas we go up kind of thing.\n\n1951\n01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:01,250\nSo, the idea there is that A1 Verified\nprotection is the most secure level,\n\n1952\n01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,550\nthe most secure system.\n\n1953\n01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:06,130\nWe consider these systems to be totally\nsecure, verify every aspect of them, and\n\n1954\n01:25:06,130 --> 01:25:06,890\nhow they're built, and\n\n1955\n01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:09,760\nreally all the architectural\nelements associated with them.\n\n1956\n01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,840\nSo I want to make sure\nwe have a sense of this.\n\n1957\n01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:14,030\nSo what I did is I laid\nout the sub ratings,\n\n1958\n01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:18,010\nnot just A is verified protection,\nB is mandatory, but within it B3, B2, B1.\n\n1959\n01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:20,430\nI kind of gave you all\nthese elements there.\n\n1960\n01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:23,550\nSo what we're gonna do is kind of walk\nthrough these, just talk about them.\n\n1961\n01:25:23,550 --> 01:25:26,400\nSo let's go down and start with,\nif we could go all the way down to C2.\n\n1962\n01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,100\nSo let's just start with C2.\n\n1963\n01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:30,170\nSo we have Controlled Access Protection.\n\n1964\n01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:33,220\nSo you'll see here,\nyou got to kind of step it up from D.\n\n1965\n01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:35,490\nUsers need to be identified individually.\n\n1966\n01:25:35,490 --> 01:25:38,260\nLogical access control mechanisms\nare gonna be enforced, or\n\n1967\n01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:40,400\nused to enforce authentication.\n\n1968\n01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:44,050\nSo we have individual user logons in other\nwords going to identify individual users.\n\n1969\n01:25:44,050 --> 01:25:46,260\nThat's what we call\nControlled Access Protection.\n\n1970\n01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:47,990\nThen C1 as we move up.\n\n1971\n01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:51,380\nDiscretionary access control is\nbased on individuals and or groups.\n\n1972\n01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:54,230\nRequires a separation of user and\ninformation, so\n\n1973\n01:25:54,230 --> 01:25:55,740\nnow we're getting a little\nbit more granular.\n\n1974\n01:25:55,740 --> 01:25:59,180\nWe're saying we're gonna separate\nthe users and the information and\n\n1975\n01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:02,130\nkind of broker and make sure we have\na conversation going on between both.\n\n1976\n01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:05,760\nSo, that's what we call discretionary\nprotection as a category.\n\n1977\n01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:07,230\nThen we move up to the B area, so\n\n1978\n01:26:07,230 --> 01:26:09,410\nagain we're going up and\ngetting more secure as we go.\n\n1979\n01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:11,869\nWe have security domains in B3.\n\n1980\n01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:16,900\nMore granularity provided here,\nand all the protection mechanisms.\n\n1981\n01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:18,820\nThe programming code\nthat is not necessary.\n\n1982\n01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:20,570\nSupport security policy is excluded,\n\n1983\n01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:22,790\nmeaning strip away all\nthe unnecessary stuff.\n\n1984\n01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:25,230\nGet rid of the services,\nget rid of the software.\n\n1985\n01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:28,230\nAnything that's not core to security,\nwe strip out of the system,\n\n1986\n01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:30,140\ntry to remove it if at all possible.\n\n1987\n01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:32,565\nSo that's B3.\nB2, structured protection.\n\n1988\n01:26:32,565 --> 01:26:35,660\nWe're again moving up\ntowards more secure as we go.\n\n1989\n01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:38,150\nSecurity policy is clearly defined and\ndocumented.\n\n1990\n01:26:38,150 --> 01:26:41,330\nSystem design and implementation\nare subjected to more thorough,\n\n1991\n01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:43,130\nrigorous review and testing.\n\n1992\n01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:46,430\nWe have the idea here that subjects and\ndevices have to be labeled,\n\n1993\n01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:50,470\nand there must be no allowance of\na covert channel, somehow skirting\n\n1994\n01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:53,620\nthe security system by going through\nan outside channel in some way.\n\n1995\n01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:57,310\nThis is what we call structured\nprotection, getting more secure as we go.\n\n1996\n01:26:57,310 --> 01:27:00,850\nThen we have B1, move up again,\nlabeled security.\n\n1997\n01:27:00,850 --> 01:27:04,210\nEach data object must contain\na classification label and\n\n1998\n01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:05,840\neach subject must have a clearance label.\n\n1999\n01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,790\nSo, now we're labeling users and\ndata, and we have to match the two\n\n2000\n01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:12,780\nin order to be able to allow for\nthe two to talk to each other.\n\n2001\n01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:16,700\nWhen a subject attempts access to\nan object, user attempts to access data,\n\n2002\n01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:20,260\nsystem must compare the two and make\nsure the labels are gonna be acceptable.\n\n2003\n01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:23,230\nData leaving the system has\nto have an accurate label.\n\n2004\n01:27:23,230 --> 01:27:25,605\nAnd security policies based\non an informal statement and\n\n2005\n01:27:25,605 --> 01:27:28,570\nthe design specifications are reviewed and\nverified.\n\n2006\n01:27:28,570 --> 01:27:29,830\nSo everything is verified.\n\n2007\n01:27:29,830 --> 01:27:30,990\nIt cannot do anything\nunless it's verified.\n\n2008\n01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:35,730\nIt says labeled security B1 so under\nthe category mandatory protection, and\n\n2009\n01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:39,550\nthen A verified protection there's only\none level there it's just called A1 System\n\n2010\n01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:43,220\ndesign which is verified, every aspect\nof the system is verified as we go.\n\n2011\n01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:50,210\nSo all of these together make up\nthe TCSEC evaluation criteria.\n\n2012\n01:27:50,210 --> 01:27:51,430\nThis is all in the Orange Book.\n\n2013\n01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:54,833\nThis is the first historical\nreference point for these systems and\n\n2014\n01:27:54,833 --> 01:27:56,725\nthe verification of these systems.\n\n2015\n01:27:56,725 --> 01:28:00,565\nThe Orange Book, the TCSEC, does this from\nthe United States government perspective.\n\n2016\n01:28:00,565 --> 01:28:01,831\nWe're going to come back after the break,\n\n2017\n01:28:01,831 --> 01:28:03,531\nbecause we're at the point\nwhere we want to take a break.\n\n2018\n01:28:03,531 --> 01:28:07,059\nWhen we come back from that We're going\nto talk about kind of the next step,\n\n2019\n01:28:07,059 --> 01:28:09,355\nhow we did this again or\nin a next iteration of it,\n\n2020\n01:28:09,355 --> 01:28:13,110\nwhich will be something known as the IT\nSec, which is the European take on that.\n\n2021\n01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:16,037\nAnd then ultimately where we wind up\ntoday, which is kind of combining those\n\n2022\n01:28:16,037 --> 01:28:18,463\ntwo over time because they're\nboth historical at this point,\n\n2023\n01:28:18,463 --> 01:28:20,496\ngetting into what's known\nas the common criteria.\n\n2024\n01:28:20,496 --> 01:28:23,386\nWhich is the most recent version\nof how we do this evaluation,\n\n2025\n01:28:23,386 --> 01:28:26,286\nthat everybody hopefully,\nmost of us anyway, can agree on.\n\n2026\n01:28:26,286 --> 01:28:29,863\nSo we'll take a look at that little\npreview of our next upcoming conversation\n\n2027\n01:28:29,863 --> 01:28:31,910\nhere just a couple\nminutes after the break.\n\n2028\n01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:35,430\nWe're gonna hopefully see you back for\nthat and, as soon as we're back,\n\n2029\n01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:36,500\nwe'll continue our conversation.\n\n2030\n01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,740\nSo we'll see you in just a few.\n\n2031\n01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:38,886\n>> Sounds good.\nSee you soon.\n\n2032\n01:28:38,886 --> 01:28:46,115\n[SOUND]\nAll right,\n\n2033\n01:28:46,115 --> 01:28:50,670\nwelcome back everybody to our episode\non security architecture and design.\n\n2034\n01:28:50,670 --> 01:28:53,870\nWe left off talking about some\nof our security models and\n\n2035\n01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,160\nwe were talking about the Rainbow Books,\n\n2036\n01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:59,210\nthe Orange Books all kinds of fun\nthings so let's get back into it.\n\n2037\n01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:00,950\n>> Fuzzy dancing purple unicorns.\n\n2038\n01:29:00,950 --> 01:29:01,730\n>> Yes.\n>> That's what we were\n\n2039\n01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:03,060\ntalking about right.\n\n2040\n01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:03,680\nSo.\n\n2041\n01:29:03,680 --> 01:29:04,998\n>> Sixties were good weren't they?\n\n2042\n01:29:04,998 --> 01:29:06,576\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah.\n\n2043\n01:29:06,576 --> 01:29:09,014\nAll right so we were talking\nabout systems evaluation methods,\n\n2044\n01:29:09,014 --> 01:29:10,605\nthat's what we were just talking about.\n\n2045\n01:29:10,605 --> 01:29:12,363\nWe were talking about the The TCSEC,\n\n2046\n01:29:12,363 --> 01:29:15,664\nthe orange book evaluation methods\nfrom D all the way up through A1.\n\n2047\n01:29:15,664 --> 01:29:17,248\nWe just gone through that.\n\n2048\n01:29:17,248 --> 01:29:20,438\nSo we want to talk about the criteria\nthat were basically being used for that.\n\n2049\n01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:24,385\nThere are seven different areas we focus\non around the criteria used to drive that\n\n2050\n01:29:24,385 --> 01:29:25,558\nevaluation solution.\n\n2051\n01:29:25,558 --> 01:29:26,472\n>> Right.\n\n2052\n01:29:26,472 --> 01:29:27,204\n>> You can see them listed here.\n\n2053\n01:29:27,204 --> 01:29:28,830\nWe have security policy.\n\n2054\n01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:31,430\nOf the idea, the policy has to\nbe explicit and well defined and\n\n2055\n01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:34,890\nenforced within the system,\nby the security mechanisms.\n\n2056\n01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:40,314\nThe TCB, the security monitor,\nthe reference monitor, kernel etc.\n\n2057\n01:29:40,314 --> 01:29:41,669\nIdentification.\n\n2058\n01:29:41,669 --> 01:29:47,160\nIndividual subjects, meaning, individual\nusers must be uniquely identified,\n\n2059\n01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:50,790\nlabels, access control labels must\nbe associated properly with objects,\n\n2060\n01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:52,450\nremember objects are data.\n\n2061\n01:29:52,450 --> 01:29:56,380\nSo, documentation must be provided,\ndocumentation is item four,\n\n2062\n01:29:56,380 --> 01:29:57,600\nit must be provided.\n\n2063\n01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:01,100\nIncluding test design and\nspecification documents, user guides and\n\n2064\n01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:03,890\nmanuals, in other words anything that\nwould be traditionally considered to be\n\n2065\n01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:08,160\ndocumentation has to be available and\nkept up to date, although it's not said,\n\n2066\n01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:08,700\nso there.\n\n2067\n01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,070\nIt has to be kept up to date.\n\n2068\n01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:11,010\nAccountability.\n\n2069\n01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:11,940\nWe have to audit data,\n\n2070\n01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:15,660\nor the audit data must be captured and\nprotected to enforce accountability.\n\n2071\n01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:18,840\nIt's not enough just to say we're doing\nit, we have to actually capture it and\n\n2072\n01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:19,420\nhave it available.\n\n2073\n01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:20,320\n>> Protect it, yeah.\n\n2074\n01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:20,845\n>> Protect it.\n\n2075\n01:30:20,845 --> 01:30:23,010\nLife-cycle assurance.\n\n2076\n01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:27,610\nSo software, hardware, and firmware must\nbe able to be tested individually ensuring\n\n2077\n01:30:27,610 --> 01:30:30,590\nthat each enforces the policies\nin an effective manner\n\n2078\n01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:33,310\nthroughout the life cycle or\nthe lifetime that they're in the system.\n\n2079\n01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:34,570\nWe have to roll up there, I think, for\n\n2080\n01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:37,010\nnumber seven,\njust a little bit if we could.\n\n2081\n01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:39,310\nBecause I didn't bring my\ninvisibility frame with me today.\n\n2082\n01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:43,040\nSo that portion of the screen\nis unfortunately not available.\n\n2083\n01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,660\nSo continuous protection.\n\n2084\n01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:50,300\nSecurity mechanisms and the system as\na whole must perform predictably and\n\n2085\n01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:52,400\nacceptably in different situations.\n\n2086\n01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:56,130\nSo as a result in that, we never want\nanything to happen that is random.\n\n2087\n01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:59,743\nWe always want predictability, we want to\nknow what's going to happen this way, for\n\n2088\n01:30:59,743 --> 01:31:03,360\nthese reasons, what the expectation is,\nand no deviation from that.\n\n2089\n01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,610\nIt's kind of boring if\nyou think about that.\n\n2090\n01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:08,380\n>> Yeah but, it makes for\na more stable, secure system.\n\n2091\n01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:13,260\n>> It does, so boring is good,\nat least in this context anyway.\n\n2092\n01:31:13,260 --> 01:31:17,130\nSo, I did mention the Red Book\nin our last discussion.\n\n2093\n01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:19,570\nSo, right before we took a break and\ncame back\n\n2094\n01:31:19,570 --> 01:31:23,290\nwe mentioned the Red Book along with The\nOrange Book is part of The Rainbow Series.\n\n2095\n01:31:23,290 --> 01:31:26,330\nThe Red Book is also referred\nto as what's know as the TNI,\n\n2096\n01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:28,030\nTrusted Network Interpretation.\n\n2097\n01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:30,260\nAnd that is just that formal name for\nThe Red Book.\n\n2098\n01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:32,040\nIt's what it's actually called.\n\n2099\n01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,300\nAnd so the following here as we\nlist is basically just a brief\n\n2100\n01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:39,290\noverview of all the security items\nin The Red Book that are covered.\n\n2101\n01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:42,870\nWe have communication integrity,\nwe have authentication,\n\n2102\n01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:47,160\nwe have message integrity,\nwe have non-repudiation.\n\n2103\n01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:51,310\nThese are topical areas that are going\nto be covered through the TNI.\n\n2104\n01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:55,240\nWe have denial of service prevention, how\ndo we prevent denial of service attacks.\n\n2105\n01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:58,770\nContinuity of operations,\nhow do we maintain continuity.\n\n2106\n01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:00,130\nNetwork management.\n\n2107\n01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:01,360\nHow do we actually do that?\n\n2108\n01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,240\nHow do we monitor?\n\n2109\n01:32:02,240 --> 01:32:03,390\nThings of that nature.\n\n2110\n01:32:03,390 --> 01:32:04,670\nCompromised protection.\n\n2111\n01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:08,680\nHow do we ensure that we\nare protected against compromises.\n\n2112\n01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:09,550\nCompromises, for\n\n2113\n01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:13,470\ninstance would be things like,\nperhaps being taken over with malware.\n\n2114\n01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:17,710\nHaving some sort of backdoor\nremote access trojan installed.\n\n2115\n01:32:17,710 --> 01:32:18,860\nSomething like that.\n\n2116\n01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:23,710\nData confidentiality, so we're focused on\nconfidentiality there of data as well as\n\n2117\n01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:27,970\ntraffic flow, traffic flow confidentiality\nand then selective routing.\n\n2118\n01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:30,670\nSo if we just scroll up a little bit so\neverybody can kind of see that.\n\n2119\n01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:33,084\nYeah, we were at selective routing there.\n\n2120\n01:32:33,084 --> 01:32:34,320\nSo [COUGH] excuse me.\n\n2121\n01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:38,640\nSelective routing you know how are we\ngoing to make sure that we're focused on\n\n2122\n01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:42,450\nthe ability to route not only properly\nto the right place, the right time.\n\n2123\n01:32:42,450 --> 01:32:43,270\nBut selectively.\n\n2124\n01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:46,100\nYou know best path,\nleast cost route, things like that.\n\n2125\n01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:49,790\nSo all this stuff is part of\nwhat is known as the TNI.\n\n2126\n01:32:49,790 --> 01:32:52,790\nAgain, this is from of\nthe original thought process.\n\n2127\n01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:56,790\nBack in the day if you will,\nof the Rainbow Series.\n\n2128\n01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:57,920\nThe Orange Book, the Red Book.\n\n2129\n01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,400\nThe Red Book dealt with the network and\nthe structure of the network.\n\n2130\n01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,930\nThe Orange Book dealt with\nthe system architecture, and\n\n2131\n01:33:02,930 --> 01:33:04,640\nbasically the way we secure data.\n\n2132\n01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:08,360\nBoth of those were going to\nbe the initial constructs,\n\n2133\n01:33:08,360 --> 01:33:12,680\nthe initial thought processes around this\nthe Orange Book specifically was referred\n\n2134\n01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:17,475\nto, something in my eye there, the Orange\nBook was referred to as the TCSEC.\n\n2135\n01:33:18,990 --> 01:33:23,380\nWhat then happens is, because this is\nthe U.S. government centric approach, U.S.\n\n2136\n01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:27,860\ngovernment centric model, We then see the\nemergence of something known as the ITSEC.\n\n2137\n01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:31,470\nThe ITSEC is gonna be an attempt\nat establishing the standard\n\n2138\n01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:34,420\nto evaluate security by\nmany European countries.\n\n2139\n01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:37,270\nSo, kind of,\ntheir take on what the TCSEC was.\n\n2140\n01:33:37,270 --> 01:33:39,760\nThey looked at it and\nsaid yeah the TCSEC's good but\n\n2141\n01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,050\nwe want something a little bit\nmore in line of what we are.\n\n2142\n01:33:42,050 --> 01:33:43,410\nWe're thinking what we're doing.\n\n2143\n01:33:43,410 --> 01:33:46,290\nBecause from that perspective\nperhaps it hasn't\n\n2144\n01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:48,090\naddressed certain things\nthat are important to us.\n\n2145\n01:33:48,090 --> 01:33:50,720\nSo they come out with their standard,\nthe ITSEC.\n\n2146\n01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:55,080\nAnd the ITSEC is gonna focus on two\nmain attributes of system protection,\n\n2147\n01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,840\nfunctionality and assurance.\n\n2148\n01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,660\nSo we have a functionality level.\n\n2149\n01:33:58,660 --> 01:34:00,180\nAnd we have an assurance level.\n\n2150\n01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:03,950\nThis becomes important because, probably\ntake a period out of assurance there.\n\n2151\n01:34:03,950 --> 01:34:06,630\nThis becomes important because then\nwhat we're going to see in a minute,\n\n2152\n01:34:06,630 --> 01:34:08,090\nwe can see the chart here,\n\n2153\n01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:12,360\nis that the ITSEC evaluation solution\nis going to have two ratings.\n\n2154\n01:34:12,360 --> 01:34:17,570\nIt's going to have a functionality rating\nas well as an evaluation criteria or\n\n2155\n01:34:17,570 --> 01:34:19,190\nan assurance rating.\n\n2156\n01:34:19,190 --> 01:34:22,660\nAnd then, together,\nthose are gonna basically be totalled up\n\n2157\n01:34:22,660 --> 01:34:25,140\nto ultimately equal something,\nwhatever that equals.\n\n2158\n01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:27,750\nWe cross-reference that with the TCSEC, so\n\n2159\n01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:32,520\nthat's how we see them in the table that\nwe put together here for you down below.\n\n2160\n01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:35,890\nSo notice just the highlight, yeah,\nlet's highlight that real quick.\n\n2161\n01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:39,170\nSo, the difference between ITSEC and\nTCSEC is, as we said,\n\n2162\n01:34:39,170 --> 01:34:44,930\nthat basically we're bundling on\nthe ITSEC side, two attributes together.\n\n2163\n01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:47,280\nThey are separate, and\nwe're combing them, but\n\n2164\n01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,790\nyou could see them as\nindividual assessments.\n\n2165\n01:34:49,790 --> 01:34:53,310\nWhereas with the TCSEC,\nWe bundle assurance and\n\n2166\n01:34:53,310 --> 01:34:56,070\nwe bundle functionality together\ninto simply one rating.\n\n2167\n01:34:56,070 --> 01:35:01,950\nSo a A1 rating, right, an A1 rating is\ngoing to be bundled up with assurance and\n\n2168\n01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:05,560\nfunctionality, whereas\nthe equivalent on the ITSEC side,\n\n2169\n01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:09,400\nwhich is an F5 Functionality\nlevel 5 at an E6.\n\n2170\n01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:14,240\nAn evaluation, assurance evaluation level\nof 6 are going to be separate ratings.\n\n2171\n01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:17,170\nWe can see them independently of one\nanother and they are the component parts\n\n2172\n01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:19,990\nthat make up the equivalent of\nthe A1 rating, in the TCSEC side.\n\n2173\n01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:22,590\nSo, it's nice to see this side-by-side.\n\n2174\n01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:27,700\nYou can see E0 on the ITSEC side\nis the equivalent of D on TC sect.\n\n2175\n01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:31,617\nE1, we tend to look at the E ratings,\nbecause we notice F2, E2, F3, E3,\n\n2176\n01:35:31,617 --> 01:35:35,550\nit's the same level all the way way down\nuntil you go, right, so you get, yes.\n\n2177\n01:35:35,550 --> 01:35:37,277\nYou kind of see those four or five.\n\n2178\n01:35:37,277 --> 01:35:42,190\nThat should be E5, E6.\n\n2179\n01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:45,610\nThat should be F6, by the way.\n\n2180\n01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:48,050\nNo F, no I'm sorry F5 plus C6,\nno that's right, sorry.\n\n2181\n01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:51,535\nI saw it twice, I was trying to figure\nout what was there, okay that's good.\n\n2182\n01:35:51,535 --> 01:35:55,848\nSo then we see those, so\nwe basically just think of E1, E2, E3,\n\n2183\n01:35:55,848 --> 01:35:59,499\nwe do the comparison and so\nwhat we see there, excuse me.\n\n2184\n01:35:59,499 --> 01:36:03,370\nWhat we see there is D is equal to E zero.\n\n2185\n01:36:03,370 --> 01:36:05,400\nBasically, E1 is equal to C1.\n\n2186\n01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:06,840\nE2 equal to C2.\n\n2187\n01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,060\nE3, B1, etc.\n\n2188\n01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:11,553\nIf you just line up one,\nif you kinda write down E0 thru E6.\n\n2189\n01:36:11,553 --> 01:36:16,026\nAnd you know to go D, C1, C2, B1,\nB2, B3, and then A1, the idea,\n\n2190\n01:36:16,026 --> 01:36:19,579\nso basically, you can create\nthe comparison in your head.\n\n2191\n01:36:19,579 --> 01:36:22,936\nOr if you're asked questions about it,\nhave it at your, kinda,\n\n2192\n01:36:22,936 --> 01:36:25,269\nyour fingertips, between ITSEC AND TCSEC.\n\n2193\n01:36:25,269 --> 01:36:27,730\nYou can go back and forth, and-\n>> Very easy way to look at that\n\n2194\n01:36:27,730 --> 01:36:29,210\n>> Very easy way to look at that.\n\n2195\n01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:32,780\nI would, if I was you,\nI would be thinking about\n\n2196\n01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:36,770\nthe idea of being able to compare and\ncontrast between ITSEC and TCSEC.\n\n2197\n01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:40,771\nAnd I would be thinking about being\nable to contrast between the numbered\n\n2198\n01:36:40,771 --> 01:36:43,280\ncomparisons of E0 thru E6, and D thru A1.\n\n2199\n01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:46,430\nI would be more concerned\nabout knowing that list and\n\n2200\n01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:49,580\nmaking sure I have that down in\nmy head than I was, perhaps,\n\n2201\n01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:54,620\nbeing able to compare and contrast F9 or\nF10 against the TCSEC ratings.\n\n2202\n01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:58,110\nBecause there's functionality, but\nnotice there's not evaluation criteria.\n\n2203\n01:36:58,110 --> 01:37:00,210\nWe only have half of the rating.\n\n2204\n01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:03,680\nI would be more concerned about doing\nthat at the bottom end of the scale,\n\n2205\n01:37:03,680 --> 01:37:04,620\nif I was you.\n\n2206\n01:37:04,620 --> 01:37:06,450\nBut that's just if I was you.\n\n2207\n01:37:06,450 --> 01:37:09,920\nBut then again if I was Mike,\nI'd be wearing a blue shirt and\n\n2208\n01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,090\nI wouldn't be standing here with\nthe ability to do the comparison.\n\n2209\n01:37:13,090 --> 01:37:16,240\nI'd be over there asking somebody\nto walk through for me and show me.\n\n2210\n01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:17,300\n>> Be famous and an author.\n\n2211\n01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:17,800\n>> You'd be famous.\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n\n2212\n01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:18,823\n>> You would be doing that,\n\n2213\n01:37:18,823 --> 01:37:21,008\nand you would be good at it.\nYou'd be good at it.\n\n2214\n01:37:21,008 --> 01:37:21,654\n>> Well, thank you.\n\n2215\n01:37:21,654 --> 01:37:22,300\nI appreciate it.\n\n2216\n01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:23,131\n>> You're shorter than I am,\n\n2217\n01:37:23,131 --> 01:37:24,070\nif you're me.\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n\n2218\n01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:25,462\n>> And I'd be taller than I am,\n\n2219\n01:37:25,462 --> 01:37:26,930\nif I was you.\n>> If you were a little taller,\n\n2220\n01:37:26,930 --> 01:37:29,450\nyou could really reach up to\nthe top of that whiteboard there.\n\n2221\n01:37:29,450 --> 01:37:29,986\n>> I could reach, I would,\n\n2222\n01:37:29,986 --> 01:37:31,040\nit's a whole new world for me.\n\n2223\n01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,660\nThat's three more inches of space\nI could use everywhere I go.\n\n2224\n01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:35,633\nThink of all the things\nI could accomplish.\n\n2225\n01:37:35,633 --> 01:37:37,970\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Let's go back to where we were.\n\n2226\n01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:39,793\n>> Do you wanna go back up or-\n>> No, I just wanna yeah,\n\n2227\n01:37:39,793 --> 01:37:41,490\nwell basically back right, so from there.\n\n2228\n01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:45,150\nI wanna make sure we understand the\ncomparison between the ITSEC and TCSEC.\n\n2229\n01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:49,400\nITSEC is equivalent, it's basically the\nEuropean take, on what the rainbow series,\n\n2230\n01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:51,990\nthe orange book, the TCSEC standard was.\n\n2231\n01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:54,030\nSo now we've got these two\ncompetitive standards.\n\n2232\n01:37:54,030 --> 01:37:55,870\nWe've got the European view of the world.\n\n2233\n01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:58,670\nWe've got the United States\ncentric view of the world.\n\n2234\n01:37:58,670 --> 01:38:02,104\nBoth are competitive in the sense that\nthey're both competing to be a valuation\n\n2235\n01:38:02,104 --> 01:38:04,216\ncriteria for system,\nsecurity and assurance.\n\n2236\n01:38:04,216 --> 01:38:07,520\nThat people are gonna use and\nbuild and architect against.\n\n2237\n01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:10,995\nYou're very difficult when you have\ncompetitive standards because your vendor\n\n2238\n01:38:10,995 --> 01:38:13,153\nbuilding systems, and\nselling to both parties.\n\n2239\n01:38:13,153 --> 01:38:16,201\nYou have to cross certify,\na lot of expense, a lot of time.\n\n2240\n01:38:16,201 --> 01:38:18,218\nIt's really not very,\nfrom your perspective,\n\n2241\n01:38:18,218 --> 01:38:20,047\nnot the most efficient\nway of doing things.\n\n2242\n01:38:20,047 --> 01:38:24,006\nWhat we ultimately see is a movement\nover time to combine these two.\n\n2243\n01:38:24,006 --> 01:38:26,798\nNow we come up with what's\nknown as the common criteria.\n\n2244\n01:38:26,798 --> 01:38:31,095\nThe common criteria model is\ngonna allow us to do evaluations,\n\n2245\n01:38:31,095 --> 01:38:33,636\nkinda blending the best of\nboth worlds on a product.\n\n2246\n01:38:33,636 --> 01:38:38,110\nAnd it's gonna, the evaluation rating\ncomes out as what's known as an EAL,\n\n2247\n01:38:38,110 --> 01:38:39,910\nEvaluation Assurance Level.\n\n2248\n01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:44,360\nAnd we have EAL one through EAL seven,\nas you can see.\n\n2249\n01:38:44,360 --> 01:38:48,020\nAnd we use what are known as protection\nprofiles to do the evaluation.\n\n2250\n01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:52,165\nAnd so you can line this up and say,\nin effect, EAL 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\n\n2251\n01:38:52,165 --> 01:38:59,820\nkinda lines up with E0 thru E6 or\nD thru A1.\n\n2252\n01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:03,770\nAn A1 system in a TCSEC is in EAL7.\n\n2253\n01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:07,802\nA formally verified designed and\ntested system here in the common criteria.\n\n2254\n01:39:07,802 --> 01:39:11,308\nOur E6 system in the ITSEC\nis kinda the same thing.\n\n2255\n01:39:11,308 --> 01:39:16,540\nWe do wanna understand yet the third\nsystem, and this is the most current one.\n\n2256\n01:39:16,540 --> 01:39:20,020\nThe one we now use primarily,\nwhich is the common criteria.\n\n2257\n01:39:20,020 --> 01:39:22,310\nWe want to know the EAL levels.\n\n2258\n01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:23,790\nWe do want to know levels\none through seven,\n\n2259\n01:39:23,790 --> 01:39:26,360\nwhich is why we've put them\nin the notes there for you.\n\n2260\n01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,170\nLot of information.\n\n2261\n01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:29,600\nLot of what we call minutiae.\n\n2262\n01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:34,080\nFine granular detail here,\nthat we have to really be focused on,\n\n2263\n01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:35,700\nreally be thinking about.\n\n2264\n01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:38,410\nThere's a lot of stuff to study in\nthis area, in this section, Very,\n\n2265\n01:39:38,410 --> 01:39:42,000\nvery big one, although in size,\nin terms of just the sheer volume.\n\n2266\n01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,040\nThe amount of material that we cover,\nit is not as big and\n\n2267\n01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:49,810\nperhaps as broad as network and\ntelecommunication security is.\n\n2268\n01:39:49,810 --> 01:39:54,770\nThere is probably actually more depth in\nthe sense of just the sheer volume and\n\n2269\n01:39:54,770 --> 01:39:58,800\nthe detail level, in some cases,\nin this area, in this particular body of\n\n2270\n01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,660\nknowledge domain,\nthen there is in something like Telecom.\n\n2271\n01:40:01,660 --> 01:40:03,070\n>> I like that little matrix you made.\n\n2272\n01:40:03,070 --> 01:40:04,580\nI think we could even go back maybe and\n\n2273\n01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:07,278\nadd this to that matrix, and\nget that straight over comparison.\n\n2274\n01:40:07,278 --> 01:40:09,043\nIt's an easy way to remember this stuff.\n\n2275\n01:40:09,043 --> 01:40:10,959\n>> Well, we could.\nWe could, absolutely.\n\n2276\n01:40:10,959 --> 01:40:12,100\nWe could and credit where credit's due.\n\n2277\n01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:13,810\nI did not make that matrix.\n\n2278\n01:40:13,810 --> 01:40:15,820\nOn our graphic designer.\n\n2279\n01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:18,380\n>> Oh, is that Mr. [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Shorty Goldstein was the one who put\n\n2280\n01:40:18,380 --> 01:40:19,804\nthat together for us.\n\n2281\n01:40:19,804 --> 01:40:21,630\n>> Shorty Goldstein.\n>> [LAUGH] Toiling away in the back,\n\n2282\n01:40:21,630 -->

that.\n\n2285\n01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:29,410\nI asked Don to kinda put that together,\nand he did.\n\n2286\n01:40:29,410 --> 01:40:31,780\nIf there are questions,\ncomments, concerns, or\n\n2287\n01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:34,090\ndownright gripes with it,\nplease address them.\n\n2288\n01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:36,720\n>> [LAUGH] Don at-\n>> Don at, right, exactly.\n\n2289\n01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,310\nBut Don did do that, all kidding aside,\nand he did a great job with it.\n\n2290\n01:40:39,310 --> 01:40:41,281\nAnd you're right,\nwe could actually add the EAL levels to it\n\n2291\n01:40:41,281 --> 01:40:42,450\n>> We'll do that before we put them up on\n\n2292\n01:40:42,450 --> 01:40:44,136\nthe website\n>> Would be a great way of kinda seeing\n\n2293\n01:40:44,136 --> 01:40:44,858\nthat comparison.\n\n2294\n01:40:44,858 --> 01:40:45,620\nIt's a good idea.\n\n2295\n01:40:45,620 --> 01:40:47,370\nIt's a very good idea.\n\n2296\n01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:49,940\nLet's continue our conversations,\nif you will.\n\n2297\n01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:53,450\nWe know that the common criteria,\nas we said, uses protection profiles.\n\n2298\n01:40:53,450 --> 01:40:55,460\nLet's talk about what\na protection profile is, right?\n\n2299\n01:40:55,460 --> 01:40:57,790\nIt has five sections, or five areas,\n\n2300\n01:40:57,790 --> 01:41:00,150\nthat we focus on when we create\nthis protection profile.\n\n2301\n01:41:00,150 --> 01:41:01,950\nI thought it was good to list them for\nyou.\n\n2302\n01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:04,620\nYet more material,\nmore stuff to delve into.\n\n2303\n01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:06,530\nProbably have people out there and\nall they do is go home and,\n\n2304\n01:41:06,530 --> 01:41:08,070\nGod, you've got to be kidding me,\nmore stuff?\n\n2305\n01:41:08,070 --> 01:41:10,460\nCan't you just shut up and\nstop talking already, right,\n\n2306\n01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:11,640\nwe're almost out of stuff, right?\n\n2307\n01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,390\nWe've actually got a few\nthings left to go there, so-\n\n2308\n01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:14,150\n>> We're close, yeah.\n\n2309\n01:41:14,150 --> 01:41:14,760\n>> We are close.\n\n2310\n01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:16,980\nWe're all gonna torture you for\na few more items.\n\n2311\n01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:21,180\nWe have five sections that make\nup the protection profile.\n\n2312\n01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:24,040\nDescriptive elements,\nyou can see them here.\n\n2313\n01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:25,910\nThis is basically just window dressing.\n\n2314\n01:41:25,910 --> 01:41:29,750\nYou have the name of the profile, it's\ngonna be called protection profile X and\n\n2315\n01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:31,360\nthe description of what it is.\n\n2316\n01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:34,460\nIt's just the high-level overview,\nthen the rational.\n\n2317\n01:41:34,460 --> 01:41:37,910\nWhat justifies this profile,\nkinda drilling down to the next level.\n\n2318\n01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:39,350\nThinking about what it is.\n\n2319\n01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:40,110\nThe environment.\n\n2320\n01:41:40,110 --> 01:41:42,000\nThe assumptions around usage.\n\n2321\n01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,390\nHow it's gonna be setup.\n\n2322\n01:41:43,390 --> 01:41:44,600\nWhat is gonna be supported by.\n\n2323\n01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:46,450\nThis is the rationale.\n\n2324\n01:41:46,450 --> 01:41:50,480\nFunctional requirements we call functional\nreqs in project management speak.\n\n2325\n01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:53,900\nThis is gonna establish a protection\nboundary, meaning all the threats\n\n2326\n01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:57,100\nare compromises within this boundary,\nhave to be addressed and countered.\n\n2327\n01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:01,010\nEverything outside the boundary,\nwe're choosing to ignore, not take on.\n\n2328\n01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:03,300\nThe product, or system,\nmust enforce this boundary.\n\n2329\n01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:05,710\nIn other words, functional\nrequirements have to be built in and\n\n2330\n01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:08,260\naddressed in the system as defined.\n\n2331\n01:42:08,260 --> 01:42:11,130\nIf we want to change that,\nwe have to change the protection profile.\n\n2332\n01:42:11,130 --> 01:42:12,620\nWe have interchangeable profiles.\n\n2333\n01:42:12,620 --> 01:42:14,760\nWe may have a profile for a mobile device.\n\n2334\n01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:16,460\nWe may have one for a fixed asset.\n\n2335\n01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:17,990\nThat may address different requirements.\n\n2336\n01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:18,940\n>> Different requirements, yeah.\n\n2337\n01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:21,120\n>> Therefore, they will be\ndifferent profiles as a result.\n\n2338\n01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:24,140\nYeah, we think about this a lot,\nwhen we think about this in, for instance,\n\n2339\n01:42:24,140 --> 01:42:28,880\na Windows environment where we may have\na desktop, or maybe a home computer, and\n\n2340\n01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:32,250\nyou have multiple people logging in,\nso you tend to have user profiles.\n\n2341\n01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:33,130\nWe have that all the time.\n\n2342\n01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:36,210\nYou have hardware profiles, docked,\nundocked maybe for a laptop or\n\n2343\n01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:37,590\nsomething like that.\n\n2344\n01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:39,490\nIt's the same concept, different profiles,\n\n2345\n01:42:39,490 --> 01:42:42,730\ndifferent settings,\ndifferent requirements, based on uses.\n\n2346\n01:42:42,730 --> 01:42:46,900\nDevelopment assurance requirements,\nyou identify the different requirements\n\n2347\n01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:51,190\nthe product or system has to meet,\nduring all the phases from design\n\n2348\n01:42:51,190 --> 01:42:54,260\nto implementation, kind of the gates\nthat we measure success by.\n\n2349\n01:42:54,260 --> 01:42:57,710\nAnd then evaluation assurance\nrequirements, we establish the type and\n\n2350\n01:42:57,710 --> 01:42:58,980\nintensity of the evaluation,\n\n2351\n01:42:58,980 --> 01:43:02,410\nwhat level of evaluation will\nthis profile be satisfied at.\n\n2352\n01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:03,900\nIs it an EAL2?\n\n2353\n01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:05,120\nIs it an EAL6?\n\n2354\n01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:06,280\nIs it verified design?\n\n2355\n01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:08,360\nIs it just not verified but logical?\n\n2356\n01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:10,290\nThere's all these different\nways to look at it.\n\n2357\n01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:12,822\nThis is really whet we're talking\nabout here is the evaluation assurance\n\n2358\n01:43:12,822 --> 01:43:15,935\nrequirements, very\nimportant to note those.\n\n2359\n01:43:15,935 --> 01:43:18,005\nThose are the five areas that\nmake up the protection profile.\n\n2360\n01:43:19,615 --> 01:43:21,985\nJust wanna make sure,\nkind of awareness of them.\n\n2361\n01:43:21,985 --> 01:43:24,735\nImportant to understand the concept and\nknow what's there.\n\n2362\n01:43:24,735 --> 01:43:28,130\nWe have this idea of certification\nversus accreditation.\n\n2363\n01:43:28,130 --> 01:43:31,700\nPopular in military government circles\ncertainly, although we're moving away from\n\n2364\n01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:34,830\nthis slowly, but surely, but\ncertification, accreditation.\n\n2365\n01:43:34,830 --> 01:43:38,080\nWe must always certify,\nfirst thing's first, before we define.\n\n2366\n01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:40,995\nMust always certify, before we accredit.\n\n2367\n01:43:40,995 --> 01:43:44,827\nIn other words, we can never,\never, never, ever,\n\n2368\n01:43:44,827 --> 01:43:48,576\nin a well structured system,\nnever, ever, ever,\n\n2369\n01:43:48,576 --> 01:43:54,059\ncan we have a system that is accredited,\nif it has not been certified first.\n\n2370\n01:43:54,059 --> 01:43:59,670\nWe may choose to certify a system and\nnever accred it.\n\n2371\n01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:04,290\nWe may never choose to accredit\nthe system, but we must always certify\n\n2372\n01:44:04,290 --> 01:44:06,840\nit even though we may not choose\nto ultimately accredit the system.\n\n2373\n01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:10,543\nSo the idea is that certification\nis the overall, as we say there,\n\n2374\n01:44:10,543 --> 01:44:14,290\ncomprehensive technical\nevaluation of the entire system.\n\n2375\n01:44:14,290 --> 01:44:19,100\nAnd the goal is ultimately to ensure\nthe is built basically to spec, right.\n\n2376\n01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:21,770\nWhatever those functional requirements\nare, that it's built to spec.\n\n2377\n01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:25,960\nSo, we certify in affect, that the system\nis built as it was supposed to be built.\n\n2378\n01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:28,205\nWe hand that certification over somebody.\n\n2379\n01:44:28,205 --> 01:44:30,875\nSomebody is typically\nthe accrediting officer.\n\n2380\n01:44:30,875 --> 01:44:31,615\nIn the military, or\n\n2381\n01:44:31,615 --> 01:44:34,295\nin the government procurement,\nwe have people who do nothing but this,\n\n2382\n01:44:34,295 --> 01:44:38,215\nthey are accrediting officers, and we\nhand them this certification, vendors do.\n\n2383\n01:44:39,515 --> 01:44:42,590\nThey come in and if we can scroll up just\na little bit so it can catch the word\n\n2384\n01:44:42,590 --> 01:44:46,310\nthat's kind of stuck there, just scroll\nup like one or two clicks of the mouse.\n\n2385\n01:44:47,570 --> 01:44:48,530\nAnd there we go.\n\n2386\n01:44:48,530 --> 01:44:52,870\nAccreditation, formal acceptance of the\nadequacy of a system's overall security\n\n2387\n01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:53,600\nand functionality.\n\n2388\n01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:54,750\nHere's the important part.\n\n2389\n01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:59,470\nBy management, meaning once we certify,\nwe then can go back and\n\n2390\n01:44:59,470 --> 01:45:02,480\neffectively say to management,\nthe system is built to spec.\n\n2391\n01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:05,040\nIt will run as basically advertised.\n\n2392\n01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,520\nDo you now want it?\n\n2393\n01:45:06,520 --> 01:45:11,370\nAnd accreditation is this idea of\naccepting the system as certified and\n\n2394\n01:45:11,370 --> 01:45:13,050\nagreeing to run the system.\n\n2395\n01:45:13,050 --> 01:45:16,942\nSo we can never turn the system on\nunless we accredit the system first.\n\n2396\n01:45:16,942 --> 01:45:20,250\nSo we have these stories of systems\nthat are built in the government and\n\n2397\n01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:23,890\nprocurement circles and the military over\nthe years where they either languish and\n\n2398\n01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:28,180\nnever get certified, or they get certified\nbut never get accredited cuz by the time\n\n2399\n01:45:28,180 --> 01:45:30,750\nthey're built the requirements\nare no longer valid.\n\n2400\n01:45:30,750 --> 01:45:34,425\nAnd so, the customer basically says sorry,\nI'm not accrediting that thing there's no\n\n2401\n01:45:34,425 --> 01:45:37,320\nway I'm taking responsibility for\nit, we don't need it.\n\n2402\n01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:39,740\nAnd so, as a result,\nthey never actually get turned on.\n\n2403\n01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:41,010\nSo they affect we sit on the shelf.\n\n2404\n01:45:42,490 --> 01:45:47,350\nSo just be aware of that, but we always\ncertify, we just may not accredit\n\n2405\n01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:51,110\nas part of that process, but\nif we don't certify we can never accredit,\n\n2406\n01:45:51,110 --> 01:45:55,950\nvery important, and accreditation is\nbasically acceptance of responsibility for\n\n2407\n01:45:55,950 --> 01:45:59,305\nthe system by senior management,\nwhatever that means.\n\n2408\n01:45:59,305 --> 01:46:01,954\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> All right just sign this piece of\n\n2409\n01:46:01,954 --> 01:46:04,231\npaper, you don't need to know\nwhat's on it, just sign it.\n\n2410\n01:46:04,231 --> 01:46:05,426\nYou remember M.A.S.H.,\nthe old M.A.S.H. episodes.\n\n2411\n01:46:05,426 --> 01:46:08,970\nRadar would always get\nColonel Blake to sign something.\n\n2412\n01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:09,560\nWhat am I signing?\n\n2413\n01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:10,150\nIt's not important.\n\n2414\n01:46:10,150 --> 01:46:11,340\nJust sign it.\n\n2415\n01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:12,330\nNeed a three day pass.\n\n2416\n01:46:12,330 --> 01:46:13,930\n>> Here comes a case of wine,\nyeah, or something.\n\n2417\n01:46:13,930 --> 01:46:15,057\n>> Exactly, all right, so\n\n2418\n01:46:15,057 --> 01:46:18,800\nlet's get back to where we're gonna\ntalk about some threats to systems.\n\n2419\n01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:21,360\nSo these are some threats\nthat we may see out there.\n\n2420\n01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:24,600\nObviously I just listed bunch a threats\nfor you that you may want to know about.\n\n2421\n01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:28,050\nSome of these are old time threats you may\nor may not have heard of, some of them\n\n2422\n01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:30,800\nare threats you may know about,\nyou want to know how to deal with them so\n\n2423\n01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,190\nwe talked about some preventive\nmeasures there as well.\n\n2424\n01:46:33,190 --> 01:46:36,040\nSo a maintenance hook is basically\nthis idea of a back door.\n\n2425\n01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:40,520\nThis idea that a developer will build in\nsome code and allow themselves to get back\n\n2426\n01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:44,230\nin with some keystroke or\nsome combination or something like that.\n\n2427\n01:46:44,230 --> 01:46:46,957\nWe used to talk about these\na lot in old PBX analog and\n\n2428\n01:46:46,957 --> 01:46:50,893\nolder PBX systems where the maintenance\nhooks were basically the default\n\n2429\n01:46:50,893 --> 01:46:55,336\npassword combination you could plug in and\nyou could remotely connect to the system\n\n2430\n01:46:55,336 --> 01:46:59,424\neither through a console port or\nsomething like that, and do maintenance.\n\n2431\n01:46:59,424 --> 01:47:01,171\nInstead they were called\nmaintenance hooks.\n\n2432\n01:47:01,171 --> 01:47:02,650\nBut preventative measures here.\n\n2433\n01:47:02,650 --> 01:47:04,820\nRight.\nWe have to use maybe host intrusion\n\n2434\n01:47:04,820 --> 01:47:05,670\ndetection systems.\n\n2435\n01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:10,425\nWhat are called HIDS, to watch for\nattacks on backdoors in systems locally.\n\n2436\n01:47:10,425 --> 01:47:13,405\nWe could also use file encryption\nto protect sensitive information.\n\n2437\n01:47:13,405 --> 01:47:16,345\nAnd we may implement auditing to\ndetect the use of any back doors.\n\n2438\n01:47:16,345 --> 01:47:17,935\nSo we could do that.\n\n2439\n01:47:17,935 --> 01:47:22,930\nIn the movie War Games, if you remember,\nDr. Falken builds in the back door.\n\n2440\n01:47:22,930 --> 01:47:27,050\nGets back into the system right\nbecause he's able to get in and\n\n2441\n01:47:27,050 --> 01:47:27,960\neffectively talk to it.\n\n2442\n01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:30,160\nAnd ultimately that's how\nMatthew Broderick hacks in.\n\n2443\n01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:33,130\nHe finds the back door and this is\nobviously why it's a very bad thing right\n\n2444\n01:47:33,130 --> 01:47:36,300\nbecause it's not the only person that\nknows about is you, it's okay, but\n\n2445\n01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:37,080\nother people know about it.\n\n2446\n01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:41,250\nIt's like hiding the extra\nkey to the house right.\n\n2447\n01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:42,260\n>> Remember the floor mat.\n\n2448\n01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:43,540\n>> Yeah I remember the floor mat or\n\n2449\n01:47:43,540 --> 01:47:46,170\nin the fake rock I mean like\nnobody else knows about them.\n\n2450\n01:47:46,170 --> 01:47:50,630\nNobody else saw the after late night\nTV buy it at the mall only for\n\n2451\n01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:52,550\nyou special on outdoor\nfake rock key holders.\n\n2452\n01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:56,110\n>> I love the little seems\nsort of pseudo cement\n\n2453\n01:47:56,110 --> 01:47:58,470\nthat has all the colored\njewels all over it.\n\n2454\n01:47:58,470 --> 01:48:00,110\nDoesn't fit with anything\nelse in your landscape.\n\n2455\n01:48:00,110 --> 01:48:01,500\n>> Yeah you're not going\nto think that's unusual.\n\n2456\n01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:02,146\n>> Yeah that's not the key.\n\n2457\n01:48:02,146 --> 01:48:04,844\n>> Or under the front bumper of the car\nbecause you have the magnetic key.\n\n2458\n01:48:04,844 --> 01:48:06,320\nYou know the magnetic key.\n\n2459\n01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:09,970\nI used to love those things because you\nknew when you were growing up a kid,\n\n2460\n01:48:09,970 --> 01:48:12,910\nyou knew your neighbors did this, so you\ncould always get into somebody's house.\n\n2461\n01:48:12,910 --> 01:48:15,090\nIt's like the big unkept secret.\n\n2462\n01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:17,200\nEverybody knew about it,\nbut nobody said anything.\n\n2463\n01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:19,080\nIt was a whole different time back then.\n\n2464\n01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:20,326\nNobody broke into houses.\n\n2465\n01:48:20,326 --> 01:48:21,512\nI mean, where I grew up,\n\n2466\n01:48:21,512 --> 01:48:24,902\nnot that you would wanna leave your\ndoor open necessarily, but I mean,\n\n2467\n01:48:24,902 --> 01:48:28,764\nI grew up in a time and a place where you\nactually could leave your front door open.\n\n2468\n01:48:28,764 --> 01:48:30,745\n>> Yes, absolutely.\n\n2469\n01:48:30,745 --> 01:48:34,600\n>> And nothing bad would happen, I mean,\npeople didn't come in and try to kill you.\n\n2470\n01:48:34,600 --> 01:48:38,370\nToday you do that and forget about it,\nright, I mean, it's Armageddon.\n\n2471\n01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:39,590\nRight?\nI mean it's just horrible.\n\n2472\n01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:42,530\nBut I grew up in a time where actually\nyou could leave your front open.\n\n2473\n01:48:42,530 --> 01:48:43,510\nWe would come and go all day.\n\n2474\n01:48:43,510 --> 01:48:44,610\nThe front door was open.\n\n2475\n01:48:44,610 --> 01:48:45,990\nI mean not wide open, open but unlocked.\n\n2476\n01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:47,330\n>> Unlocked.\nYeah, you were secure.\n\n2477\n01:48:47,330 --> 01:48:49,100\n>> Because you didn't want\nthe critters in the house.\n\n2478\n01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:50,600\nYou wanted the people to come and go.\n\n2479\n01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:51,730\nBut it was unsecure.\n\n2480\n01:48:51,730 --> 01:48:56,320\nAnd I actually have friends that I know\nthat live out in kind of remoter areas,\n\n2481\n01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,290\nto this day, still do,\nthey leave they're doors open.\n\n2482\n01:48:58,290 --> 01:49:01,610\nThey don't lock their houses,\neven at night, they just don't so,\n\n2483\n01:49:01,610 --> 01:49:02,798\nit's kind of interesting.\n\n2484\n01:49:02,798 --> 01:49:06,041\nBut, all right, we do want to lock up our\nnetworks though so just beware of that.\n\n2485\n01:49:06,041 --> 01:49:08,420\n[LAUGH] So, time of check,\ntime of use, we call TOC TOU,\n\n2486\n01:49:08,420 --> 01:49:10,226\nthat's how we pronounce this, TOC TOU.\n\n2487\n01:49:10,226 --> 01:49:13,140\nSo a TOC/TOO attack is\nbasically a sequencing attack\n\n2488\n01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:17,170\nthat deals with the sequence of steps\nthat a system may use to complete a task.\n\n2489\n01:49:17,170 --> 01:49:21,630\nIf we're able to go in and basically get\nthem out of sequence, in other words,\n\n2490\n01:49:21,630 --> 01:49:25,320\nwe take advantage of what's known as the\ndependency on the timing of these events,\n\n2491\n01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:27,840\none of that if forced to\ncomplete before the other\n\n2492\n01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,160\nas a result it can through\na system out of whack.\n\n2493\n01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:33,860\nWe can effectively jump in there and\nmodify the flow, as a result,\n\n2494\n01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:35,220\nkinda taking over control.\n\n2495\n01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:37,340\nThen this is known as a TOC/TOU attack.\n\n2496\n01:49:37,340 --> 01:49:41,086\nAnd so they way we protect against this\nis by applying what are known as software\n\n2497\n01:49:41,086 --> 01:49:44,039\nlocks which basically means that\nwe are checking the tasks and\n\n2498\n01:49:44,039 --> 01:49:47,580\nvalidating they finish before we\nallow something else to continue.\n\n2499\n01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:50,268\nSo it's like a sanity check,\nsometimes they're referred to that way.\n\n2500\n01:49:50,268 --> 01:49:52,320\nThat's a TOC/TOU attack, and\n\n2501\n01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:56,100\nwe can prevent that by using these\nsoftware checks or these gates.\n\n2502\n01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:56,890\nRace condition.\n\n2503\n01:49:56,890 --> 01:49:59,620\n>> I lost my scrolling.\n\n2504\n01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:00,760\nThat's because we're at the end.\n\n2505\n01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,550\nLet me just give you guys some space here.\n\n2506\n01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:04,220\n>> Oh, do you want to,\nyeah just give Mike a second.\n\n2507\n01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:04,950\nHe'll fix that, it's fine.\n\n2508\n01:50:04,950 --> 01:50:06,050\nCome back as soon as you're ready.\n\n2509\n01:50:06,050 --> 01:50:08,720\nSo when we have race conditions,\nright, good, so bringing that back up.\n\n2510\n01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:10,260\nSo we have race conditions.\n\n2511\n01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:13,470\nThe idea here is, and all of a sudden\nwe're like there, we raced and\n\n2512\n01:50:13,470 --> 01:50:15,750\nwe went to the bottom, look at that,\nit's a race condition.\n\n2513\n01:50:15,750 --> 01:50:17,090\nAll right, so the race condition.\n\n2514\n01:50:17,090 --> 01:50:19,430\nWe got to the bottom,\nthere's nothing left.\n\n2515\n01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:21,060\nForgot to hit those character terms.\n\n2516\n01:50:21,060 --> 01:50:22,520\nDon did a great job of fixing those.\n\n2517\n01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:24,510\nDid such a great job he took them all out,\nso\n\n2518\n01:50:24,510 --> 01:50:26,130\nwe got right to the bottom,\nhad nothing left.\n\n2519\n01:50:26,130 --> 01:50:29,250\nSo the race condition there is when two\ndifferent processes need to carry out\n\n2520\n01:50:29,250 --> 01:50:30,460\ntheir tasks on one resource.\n\n2521\n01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:33,097\nSo they're kind of racing to complete\nif you think of it this way.\n\n2522\n01:50:33,097 --> 01:50:34,992\nAnd as a result the race\ncondition is gonna be,\n\n2523\n01:50:34,992 --> 01:50:38,309\nyou have this idea of who's going to get\nthere first, how are we going to finish?\n\n2524\n01:50:38,309 --> 01:50:42,299\nSo the attack Is when an attacker makes\nthe processes execute out of sequence,\n\n2525\n01:50:42,299 --> 01:50:45,685\nalmost like a TOC/TOU solution,\nthey execute out of sequence and\n\n2526\n01:50:45,685 --> 01:50:48,889\nas a result of doing that,\nsomehow we get unexpected results,\n\n2527\n01:50:48,889 --> 01:50:51,680\nthe system is left in an undefined or\nunknown state.\n\n2528\n01:50:51,680 --> 01:50:54,330\n>> And that one that was gonna to finish\nthat was supposed to finish second relies\n\n2529\n01:50:54,330 --> 01:50:56,190\non the output from that first one,\nnow it's not there.\n\n2530\n01:50:56,190 --> 01:50:57,140\n>> And we substitute the output.\n\n2531\n01:50:57,140 --> 01:50:59,590\n>> And something else happens or\nwe put something in there, exactly.\n\n2532\n01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:02,800\n>> So you know it is obviously\ngonna be a potential issue right?\n\n2533\n01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:06,570\nBecause if that happens then the system\nmay be left in an unprotected or\n\n2534\n01:51:06,570 --> 01:51:08,750\nunstructured, somehow unknown state.\n\n2535\n01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:10,800\nSo obviously to protect against this,\n\n2536\n01:51:10,800 --> 01:51:13,850\ndon't split up critical tasks that\ncould have their sequences altered.\n\n2537\n01:51:13,850 --> 01:51:16,690\nWanna make sure we protect against\nthat and don't allow that to occur.\n\n2538\n01:51:16,690 --> 01:51:19,350\nIt's very important to\nthink about that as well.\n\n2539\n01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:22,800\nAll right.\nSo boy, I feel like we just ran a race.\n\n2540\n01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:23,740\n>> I know right, right.\n\n2541\n01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:24,720\nI feel like we need a drink of water.\n\n2542\n01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:25,980\n>> We covered a lot of ground.\n\n2543\n01:51:25,980 --> 01:51:29,910\nI do yeah, I do so, we've covered\na lot of ground, we've talked about\n\n2544\n01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:31,990\nall of the different elements,\nall the different building blocks,\n\n2545\n01:51:31,990 --> 01:51:33,960\ncomponents of security architecture and\ndesign.\n\n2546\n01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:36,890\nIt's one of the biggest areas in\nterms of just the sheer volume,\n\n2547\n01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:40,925\nsheer amount of stuff we talk about in\nthe bodies of knowledge in the ten domains\n\n2548\n01:51:40,925 --> 01:51:41,915\nthat make up CISSP.\n\n2549\n01:51:41,915 --> 01:51:44,530\nYou can see it's a very\nhighly technical area.\n\n2550\n01:51:44,530 --> 01:51:46,135\nIt's a lot of detail.\n\n2551\n01:51:46,135 --> 01:51:47,200\nA lot of minutia here.\n\n2552\n01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,988\nNot unmasterable by any means.\n\n2553\n01:51:48,988 --> 01:51:51,385\nJust a lot of vocabulary,\na lot of terminology.\n\n2554\n01:51:51,385 --> 01:51:54,766\nA lot of Phraseology, things we have\nto think about and understand and\n\n2555\n01:51:54,766 --> 01:51:58,680\nput in context, but it is certainly stuff\nthat you may have to spend some time on.\n\n2556\n01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:02,280\nSo if you want to think about that as\nwe're wrapping up this discussion,\n\n2557\n01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:04,450\nthere's a lot of material you\nwant to go back and reference,\n\n2558\n01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:07,920\nprobably a good place as we've\nindicated for some flash card activity.\n\n2559\n01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:10,820\nRight, maybe one of the biggest places\nwhere you see flash card activity\n\n2560\n01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:11,920\nin all of the domains.\n\n2561\n01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:15,500\nWe'll see it, as well,\nin the system development life cycle era,\n\n2562\n01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:18,700\nwhere we talked about development life\ncycles, having to spec those out,\n\n2563\n01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:20,700\nand remember things in certain orders.\n\n2564\n01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:23,260\nBut, in general, this is gonna be one\nof those areas where you really need to\n\n2565\n01:52:23,260 --> 01:52:25,760\ndig in and really get the vocabulary down.\n\n2566\n01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:27,770\nRemember we're talking about\nlearning how to speak a language.\n\n2567\n01:52:27,770 --> 01:52:28,560\n>> Yep.\n>> And\n\n2568\n01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:31,060\nwhen we talk about the language\nof information security,\n\n2569\n01:52:31,060 --> 01:52:32,870\nwe really have to become\nfluent in that language.\n\n2570\n01:52:32,870 --> 01:52:34,310\n>> And\nif you want to effectively communicate.\n\n2571\n01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:38,400\n>> This is like instead of beginning\nFrench, this is like French two.\n\n2572\n01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:39,840\nRight?\nThis is what we're talking about here.\n\n2573\n01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,180\nThis is the French for advanced speakers.\n\n2574\n01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:41,707\n>> This is the advanced version.\n\n2575\n01:52:41,707 --> 01:52:44,592\n>> So you gotta definitely spend a little\ntime here, but the good news is,\n\n2576\n01:52:44,592 --> 01:52:47,960\nat the end of the day, right, remember,\nit's 250 questions ultimately, and\n\n2577\n01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:51,209\nit's going to be spread across all ten\ndomains, and it's not spread equally.\n\n2578\n01:52:51,209 --> 01:52:54,240\nDon't wanna give you that impression,\nbut it is spread out, right?\n\n2579\n01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:58,049\nAnd so the reality is, that while there's\ngoing to be a focus in each domain and\n\n2580\n01:52:58,049 --> 01:53:01,820\neach area, some areas are gonna be much\nmore heavily focused on than others.\n\n2581\n01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:03,430\n>> Right.\n>> And as a result,\n\n2582\n01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:06,700\nyou really have to play with\nthat knowledge base and\n\n2583\n01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:09,172\nunderstand how to manipulate it\nacross the different domains,\n\n2584\n01:53:09,172 --> 01:53:12,230\nb ut you have to put the right level\nof emphasis, right level of focus\n\n2585\n01:53:12,230 --> 01:53:14,970\non each of these areas to understand\nhow to truly operate within them.\n\n2586\n01:53:14,970 --> 01:53:17,030\nSo hopefully these conversations\nhave been helpful for you.\n\n2587\n01:53:18,070 --> 01:53:20,790\nWe'll always want to throw that\ninformation out there, and\n\n2588\n01:53:20,790 --> 01:53:23,530\nmake sure it's in a usable form,\nand make sure, that ultimately,\n\n2589\n01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:26,610\nas we work through these discussions we\ntry to bring up the most relevant things,\n\n2590\n01:53:26,610 --> 01:53:29,820\nand the most relevant way of linking\nthose things together for you,\n\n2591\n01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:31,106\nto get the right level of focus.\n\n2592\n01:53:31,106 --> 01:53:33,955\n>> The right level detail\non this material, right,\n\n2593\n01:53:33,955 --> 01:53:37,195\nwe don't want to be too deep, don't want\nto go down too deep in any one area, but\n\n2594\n01:53:37,195 --> 01:53:39,175\nwe don't want to be too shallow\nin any one area either.\n\n2595\n01:53:39,175 --> 01:53:43,745\nWe want to strike that balance, you often\nhear this discussion about the CISSP,\n\n2596\n01:53:43,745 --> 01:53:47,580\na lot of people talk about it this way,\nas being a mile wide, right, as an exam,\n\n2597\n01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:50,440\nthe amount of material, it's very,\nvery broad but an inch deep.\n\n2598\n01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:53,150\nMeaning, ultimately,\nwhile it's a lot of material,\n\n2599\n01:53:53,150 --> 01:53:56,710\nin any one area you are not going to go\nvery deep on the level of that knowledge.\n\n2600\n01:53:56,710 --> 01:53:59,640\nYou're gonna be below the surface,\nbut we're not gonna be a mile down.\n\n2601\n01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:01,710\nI prefer to think of it really,\nalthough a mile down and\n\n2602\n01:54:01,710 --> 01:54:05,130\none inch deep is one way to think about\nit, I really do prefer to think about it\n\n2603\n01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:10,020\nas being, of having the ability or being\nin the mindset that we have to really,\n\n2604\n01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:13,760\ntruly understand information security from\nall these areas, and we have to bring that\n\n2605\n01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:16,460\nunderstanding to the table, and\nwe have to be able to be flexible.\n\n2606\n01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:20,740\nWe have to flex our ability to apply that\nlevel of detail, that level of knowledge,\n\n2607\n01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:24,180\nbased on the questions, whether they're\nscenarios or just simple multiple\n\n2608\n01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:27,720\nchoice answers, you potentially will\nget both on the exam these days, so\n\n2609\n01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:31,450\nwe really have to understand how to\napply that in those situations, but\n\n2610\n01:54:31,450 --> 01:54:34,360\nbe confident that we know\nwhat the right answer is.\n\n2611\n01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:34,911\nThat's the most important thing.\nAnd\n\n2612\n01:54:34,911 --> 01:54:37,469\nif we're confident then we're gonna be\nable to draw on that amount of knowledge\n\n2613\n01:54:37,469 --> 01:54:38,423\nwe already bring with us, and\n\n2614\n01:54:38,423 --> 01:54:41,038\nwe're gonna make the right choices when\nwe actually go and we approach the exam.\n\n2615\n01:54:41,038 --> 01:54:42,810\n>> Very good.\n\n2616\n01:54:42,810 --> 01:54:43,710\n>> Very well.\n\n2617\n01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:44,730\n>> All right, ladies and gentlemen.\n\n2618\n01:54:44,730 --> 01:54:49,320\nI hope you guys enjoyed the episode today\non our security architecture and design.\n\n2619\n01:54:49,320 --> 01:54:50,670\n>> Security architecture

going through this information so\n\n2630\n01:55:15,210 --> 01:55:17,900\ngo back and watch those recordings, but\nif you're watching the recording and\n\n2631\n01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:20,420\nyou come up with a question like, oh I\ndidn’t see that when I watched it live,\n\n2632\n01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:21,605\nI wonder what the heck\nthey're talking about.\n\n2633\n01:55:21,605 --> 01:55:24,780\nAt

00:00:39,750\nMy name is Mike Rodrick and\nwith me is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n4\n00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,710\nHow are you doing, Adam?\n\n5\n00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:41,220\nI'm good.\n\n6\n00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,850\nI'm good.\n\n7\n00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,020\nHowdy everybody.\n\n8\n00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,640\n>> All right.\n\n9\n00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,480\nWe are still working\nthrough our CISSP track and\n\n10\n00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,250\ntoday's episode is going to\nbe on operational security.\n\n11\n00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,410\nExciting stuff here.\n\n12\n00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,890\nShoot.\nLet's just get right into it shall we.\n\n13\n00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,400\n>> Okay, and away we go as they say.\n\n14\n00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,970\nSo, let's talk a bit about how we\nhave a rather long vocabulary list we\n\n15\n00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,560\nput together for you,\nas I trip over my tongue here and\n\n16\n00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,120\nlose control of my command of\nthe English language momentarily.\n\n17\n00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,240\nBut before we get into that, let's just\nremind everybody as we're working through\n\n18\n00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,320\nthe CISSP material, we're focused on\nthe three pillars, kind of the underlying\n\n19\n00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,390\narchitecture elements that build\ninformation security for us.\n\n20\n00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,410\nSo we're thinking about confidentiality,\nwe're thinking about integrity and\n\n21\n00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,532\nwe're thinking about availability\nwhen we relate to data.\n\n22\n00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:28,820\nAnd so those concepts of availability,\nintegrity,\n\n23\n00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,470\nconfidentiality, all\ncome back together here\n\n24\n00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,305\nin this area of the body of knowledge\nin the operational security area.\n\n25\n00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:36,240\nWe're gonna be focusing\non elements of all three.\n\n26\n00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,130\nWe're gonna be reviewing in\nrespects to a lot of content\n\n27\n00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,030\nthat we may have discussed in\none of other shows around CISSP.\n\n28\n00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,970\nSome of the cryptography stuff,\nalgorithms for instance, things like that.\n\n29\n00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,280\nSome of the network related stuff where we\ntalk about some of the structure elements.\n\n30\n00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,000\nMay talk a little bit about things\nlike backup and full tolerance.\n\n31\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,570\nWe've talked about some\nof those things before.\n\n32\n00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,350\nSo we'll see a lot of things that we're\nused to, probably a lot of the things that\n\n33\n00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,320\nwe're comfortable with, a lot of the areas\nthat we probably spent a lot time on in\n\n34\n00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,840\nour practices in terms of being security\nprofessionals, IT professionals every day.\n\n35\n00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,340\nIt's one of those sections where you may\nnot need to spend quite as much time\n\n36\n00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,800\nas you're reviewing, you probably have\na background with some of this already.\n\n37\n00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,780\nBut it's good, in general,\n\n38\n00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,410\nto hear about this more than once,\nhave a general sense of it.\n\n39\n00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,750\nAnd it's always fun to talk about.\n\n40\n00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,000\nIt's a great way for\nus to spend the afternoon,\n\n41\n00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,595\nand if we weren't doing this\nwe'd probably be eating cookies.\n\n42\n00:02:26,595 --> 00:02:28,841\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's get back in,\n\n43\n00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:29,913\nlet's take a look at our.\n\n44\n00:02:29,913 --> 00:02:32,330\nLet's take a look at our\nvocabulary list there.\n\n45\n00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,450\nThese are terms we're gonna review for\nyou, give you some definition around.\n\n46\n00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:38,660\nAgain, probably flash card material for\nyou to be aware of.\n\n47\n00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,450\nThings that you may wanna know,\ndefinitions you may wanna have at\n\n48\n00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,500\nthe ready, so to speak,\nif you're asked to answer questions.\n\n49\n00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,510\nJob rotation is this idea of being cross\ntrained, we often hear about that.\n\n50\n00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,950\nSo rotating through different jobs so\nthat not one person's doing\n\n51\n00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,970\none thing all the time, but rather,\nwe're mixing it up a little bit.\n\n52\n00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,740\nThat way, if someone's up to no\ngood we may find out about it.\n\n53\n00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,630\nAnd maybe then as a security professional,\nunderstand that there\n\n54\n00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,665\nmaybe something that's going on\nthat we may need to be aware of.\n\n55\n00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:03,180\nMm-hm.\n\n56\n00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,540\n>> Right so that's what cross training or\n\n57\n00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,890\nrather job rotation through\ncross training leads to.\n\n58\n00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,280\nThis idea of least privileged,\nI think privilege is with an l and\n\n59\n00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,975\nno dg there right.\n\n60\n00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:20,555\n[CROSSTALK] Privilege something like that\nyeah something like that there we go.\n\n61\n00:03:20,555 --> 00:03:24,720\nProbably a little better closer to it\nanyway was being out on the ledge right.\n\n62\n00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,980\n>> I don't know I guess I turned my\nspell checker off, I don't know.\n\n63\n00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,715\n>> That's what it is.\n\n64\n00:03:27,715 --> 00:03:28,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's what it is.\n\n65\n00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,450\nSo the idea of Least Privilege,\n\n66\n00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:34,180\nis this idea of really almost just,\nthe right amount of permission,\n\n67\n00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,260\nright amount of access, just enough to\nget the job done, but no more than that.\n\n68\n00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,370\nSo if we are not going to be full\nadministrators in the system, but\n\n69\n00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,600\nrather are going to be maybe, contributors\nto that system by putting information in.\n\n70\n00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,930\nWe don't need full control but\nrather maybe contributor.\n\n71\n00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,330\nOr read as opposed to read and write.\n\n72\n00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,340\nThings like that.\n\n73\n00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,160\nSo really just enough to do it but\nnothing more, if possible.\n\n74\n00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,170\nIf we could structure it that way.\n\n75\n00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,060\n>> Right.\nIf you give somebody more permissions than\n\n76\n00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,110\nthey need, there's always the risk that\nthey might accidentally cause problems.\n\n77\n00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,660\nOr maliciously.\n\n78\n00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,090\nOr maliciously in the case of\ncertain individuals, right,\n\n79\n00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,202\nprobably more malicious.\n\n80\n00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:09,880\n>> I had a friend of mine\nwent to a company and\n\n81\n00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,880\ncame back to me and said, I don't\nknow if you've ever seen this before,\n\n82\n00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,370\nbut every one of the users on\nthere was a Windows network.\n\n83\n00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,880\n>> Everyone of their users,\nwas in the domain admin group.\n\n84\n00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,040\nEveryone.\n>> Awesome!\n\n85\n00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,410\n>> They think it was easier when they\nneeded to install software, whatever.\n\n86\n00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,571\nAbsolutely!\n\n87\n00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:28,672\nNot following the principle\nof least privilege.\n\n88\n00:04:28,672 --> 00:04:31,210\n>> We call that job insecurity\nas opposed to job security.\n\n89\n00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,865\nThere for you,\nwho are out there wondering about that.\n\n90\n00:04:33,865 --> 00:04:35,026\nI find that a lot.\n\n91\n00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:35,932\nAll kidding aside.\n\n92\n00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:40,864\nWhen I do auditing work, I find much\nto my surprise, and although I'm not\n\n93\n00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:45,718\nsurprised by it any more, much along\nthe lines of what your friend said,\n\n94\n00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,840\nI find that a lot that we\nsee this in companies.\n\n95\n00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,760\nWe see overuse,\nover subscription of things like\n\n96\n00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,550\nadministrative credentials\nbecause of the ability to\n\n97\n00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,580\nquickly execute on the desktop with\nsome of the new security models.\n\n98\n00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,440\nUAC, right, User Account Control tends\nto be a bit of a challenge there.\n\n99\n00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,190\nPeople don't realize they could turn\nthat stuff off as opposed to modifying\n\n100\n00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,100\npermissions.\n\n101\n00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,860\nAnd so we tend to find that the path of\nleast resistance is the over-arching.\n\n102\n00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,370\nAdministrative.\n\n103\n00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,500\nWell I was trying to be nice about it.\n\n104\n00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,990\nI wasn't going come right out and say,\nI've got a bunch of lazy dopes out there.\n\n105\n00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,970\nBut path of least resistance, politically\ncorrect sub tone to that is implied, but\n\n106\n00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,210\nyou just laid it right out there.\n\n107\n00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,688\nI like that, no bones about it.\n\n108\n00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:26,335\n[CROSSTALK] But\nwe do find that quite a bit.\n\n109\n00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:30,532\nOne of the nice things that I like about\nLinux a little bit more than Windows per\n\n110\n00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:34,230\nse, is this idea that it's a lot\ntougher to do something like that.\n\n111\n00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,090\nYou can still do it, but they make it\na little more challenging there for you.\n\n112\n00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,020\nRight, we don't have quite as many groups,\nthere's not quite as much of that\n\n113\n00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,040\nroot is a jealously guarded\npermission set, typically.\n\n114\n00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,400\nAnd so as a result,\nwe don't tend to see overuse and\n\n115\n00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,730\nabuse perhaps as much in the Linux world.\n\n116\n00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,190\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n117\n00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,030\nMandatory vacations.\n\n118\n00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,410\nSo the idea of taking a vacation,\nbeing forced into if you will,\n\n119\n00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,395\ntaking vacation that way we can see what\nis going on, again, in your job role.\n\n120\n00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:03,300\nSo, if you're constantly there working and\nnever taking a vacation, people don't\n\n121\n00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,540\nreally know what you're up to in the sense\nthat the auditing function may not be able\n\n122\n00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,670\nto capture certain activities because\nyou're there kind of suppressing them.\n\n123\n00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,920\nIf you're not there we may be able to\nfind out things that don't go on or\n\n124\n00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,930\ndo go on when you're not around.\n\n125\n00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,570\nSo just something to think about.\n\n126\n00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,050\nSo want to make sure we're\naware of that as well, and\n\n127\n00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,115\nyes mandatory is with an A,\nas opposed to with an I.\n\n128\n00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:22,858\n>> [CROSSTALK] So thank you.\n\n129\n00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:27,260\n>> Mandatory there, we do appreciate that,\nthank you very much.\n\n130\n00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,920\nAnd always looking for\nthat extra corrective spell checker.\n\n131\n00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,250\n>> A needs for that one.\n\n132\n00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,320\nWho was that?\n>> Always important.\n\n133\n00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,070\nThat was our producer,\nour producer Mr. Jason out there.\n\n134\n00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,950\nSo, all right.\n\n135\n00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,720\nSo, thank you very much.\n\n136\n00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,350\nSo, mandatory vacations.\n\n137\n00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,190\nBy the way, big disclaimer for you,\nI am not the spelling guru in this team.\n\n138\n00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,545\nThis duo, this team right here,\nthe dynamic duo.\n\n139\n00:06:48,545 --> 00:06:50,015\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Mr.Mike handles spelling.\n\n140\n00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:51,036\n>> Woo-hoo!\n>> And as a result,\n\n141\n00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,872\nerror correction on\na somewhat consistent basis.\n\n142\n00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:55,898\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I just simply bring the knowledge\n\n143\n00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:56,800\nto the table.\n\n144\n00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,050\nMike handles the misspelling and\n\n145\n00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,810\nrepresenting it to you\nin the appropriate way.\n\n146\n00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,090\nAll right, we all have to have our jobs,\nas we said, right?\n\n147\n00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,960\nIt's a job rotation.\n\n148\n00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,639\nClipping level.\n\n149\n00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,359\nClipping level is.\n\n150\n00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,091\n>> Yeah, so you're up next, that's right.\n\n151\n00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:07,593\n>> I am, I am up next, right.\n\n152\n00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,380\nSo clipping levels, really we're\ntalking about a baseline concept.\n\n153\n00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,480\nThere are clipping levels of threshold so\nwe use it when we talk about monitoring.\n\n154\n00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,463\nAnd the idea with the clipping level\nis when we set that threshold or\n\n155\n00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:21,150\nthat measure, then if we're above or\nbelow we can tell what's going on.\n\n156\n00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,040\nSo if we have a clipping level, let's\nsay from maybe bad log-on attempts or\n\n157\n00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,490\nfailed log on attempts in the system, then\nas a result of that if we are above that\n\n158\n00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,790\nthreshold we set off a warning to lock\nout the account more often than not.\n\n159\n00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,950\nSo that kind of thing is what\nwe're talking about there.\n\n160\n00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,190\nContinuing that fine tradition.\n\n161\n00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,263\nSo monitoring for basically, either\nabove or below it doesn't really matter.\n\n162\n00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:45,139\n>> I'll fill something in later on it.\n\n163\n00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:46,050\n>> Okay, no problem.\n\n164\n00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,160\nSo we've got a clipping level.\n\n165\n00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,210\nSo assurance levels.\n\n166\n00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,880\nLet's talk about assurance\nlevels a little bit.\n\n167\n00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,315\nThis idea of assurance levels is\nreally this idea of understanding, and\n\n168\n00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,697\nwe folks on assurance\na couple different errors.\n\n169\n00:07:55,697 --> 00:07:58,472\nWe have operational assurance,\nwe have life cycle assurance.\n\n170\n00:07:58,472 --> 00:08:02,828\nThis idea of understanding that in\nthe case of operational assurance,\n\n171\n00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:05,090\nthe entire structure of the system.\n\n172\n00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,530\nSo the product's architecture,\nall of its features,\n\n173\n00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,950\nfunctionality, we kind of\nfocus on all these things, so\n\n174\n00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,500\nthe entire structure of the system so\nit would be focused on all of that.\n\n175\n00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,420\nI'm making sure that all those elements\nare going to operate in such a way,\n\n176\n00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,600\nthat as a result of that we bring\nsecurity into the architecture and\n\n177\n00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,740\nwe are validating that every element of\nit, the sum is greater, or the sum total\n\n178\n00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,630\nof the parts, in other words, are System\nis really made up of all these parts.\n\n179\n00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,700\nThat all of this is gonna contribute\nto security is what operational\n\n180\n00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,790\nassurance is really all about.\n\n181\n00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:42,740\nAnd throughout the life cycle of that so\n\n182\n00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,850\nacross the life cycle,\nthat security is built in all the time.\n\n183\n00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,240\nIt's baked in,\nit's operating the way it should so\n\n184\n00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,840\nthat we maintain the security posture\nthat keeps security as the focus\n\n185\n00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,290\nthroughout the life cycle of that system,\nwhatever that is.\n\n186\n00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,650\nSo, security is operating as it should\nthroughout the intended usage period,\n\n187\n00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,450\nright, whatever that may be\nacross the entire solution there,\n\n188\n00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,340\nthroughout with an R, all right.\n\n189\n00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,809\nSo, just make sure we're\nthinking about that, all right.\n\n190\n00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,070\nSo you wanna make sure that we know,\nand yeah,\n\n191\n00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,960\nkinda through that entire life-cycle,\nhow it's developed and\n\n192\n00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,390\nmaintained, all the way through,\nthat's gonna be important.\n\n193\n00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,880\nAll right, Initial Program Load,\nwhat is called an IPL.\n\n194\n00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,260\nThis is a mainframe term.\n\n195\n00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,580\nWe don't often hear this much anymore in\nmodern operating systems, we do this,\n\n196\n00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,320\nthis is happening, but\nit's kind of underneath the hood.\n\n197\n00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,790\nWe just load the kernel and\nload the operating system.\n\n198\n00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,630\nWe don't really refer to\nthe fact that we're doing an IPL.\n\n199\n00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,320\nBut, those of you who may\nhave been doing this for\n\n200\n00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,430\nawhile may be remembering mainframes,\nor may still work.\n\n201\n00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,490\nIn these kinda systems if you\nare working on a mainframe or\n\n202\n00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,850\na midframe solution, an IPL is basically\nthe initial operating system program load.\n\n203\n00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,080\nWe used to do it off tapes.\n\n204\n00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,040\n>> Right.\n>> Right into the system.\n\n205\n00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,410\nDo you remember\nthe Six Million Dollar Man?\n\n206\n00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,750\n>> Yeah.\n>> Did you see Six Million Dollar Man?\n\n207\n00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,518\n>> Of course.\n[LAUGH]\n\n208\n00:09:49,518 --> 00:09:51,451\n>> So, if you remember that TV show,\n\n209\n00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:55,599\nright in the beginning we can make\nhim stronger, we have the technology.\n\n210\n00:09:55,599 --> 00:09:56,460\n>> We can rebuild.\n\n211\n00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,657\n>> We can rebuild, right.\n\n212\n00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,326\nYou see the big, free standing,\n\n213\n00:09:59,326 --> 00:10:03,270\nprobably about as tall as your eye\nrectangular cabinets, the tape cabinets.\n\n214\n00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,110\n>> Yes.\nAnd so,\n\n215\n00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,660\nyou would see them with big eight track,\nquarter inch or\n\n216\n00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,900\nhalf inch tape on the back.\n\n217\n00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,560\nCut to the data center at NASA,\nor wherever they did that from.\n\n218\n00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,543\nAnd you would see the tapes kinda rotating\nback and forth in the machines If you ever\n\n219\n00:10:15,543 --> 00:10:18,324\ngo to Disney World and\ngo ride on Space Mountain, right.\n\n220\n00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:20,911\n[CROSSTALK] If you've ever done that and\nyou go up the track,\n\n221\n00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,842\nright, on the blue track or\nthe red tracks.\n\n222\n00:10:22,842 --> 00:10:25,227\nYou're going up the initial hill to go in.\n\n223\n00:10:25,227 --> 00:10:29,960\nThey have the the cool 60's space\ncontrol thing off to the side and\n\n224\n00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,480\nthey got the old tapes systems in there.\n\n225\n00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,730\nYou see one or two that are sitting\nin there in the Disney Studios.\n\n226\n00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,720\nSo that's the kind of thing\nthat we're talking about.\n\n227\n00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,710\nWe're talking about an IPL.\n\n228\n00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,790\nWe're talking about loading software\ninitially off those tape systems.\n\n229\n00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,270\nThat's why we used to do it as, and so\nthis is basically the idea of loading\n\n230\n00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,480\nthe operating system's kernel\ninto the computer's main memory.\n\n231\n00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,920\nAnd, so now we just install Windows,\nwe boot up,\n\n232\n00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,330\nit loads automatically from the hard\ndrive internal to the machine.\n\n233\n00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,330\nBut are we think about loading\nit off the tape system but\n\n234\n00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,450\nback in the day mainframes\ndidn't have internal drives.\n\n235\n00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,080\nThey had memory,\nthey stored stuff from memory.\n\n236\n00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,550\nBut the storage, these hard drives were\nthese tapes in effect that were sitting in\n\n237\n00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,300\nthese large cabinets so it's kinda\ninteresting and real old school right?\n\n238\n00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,570\nKind of back in the day.\n\n239\n00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,820\nBut this is what we talk about.\n\n240\n00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,960\nSo the IPL the initial program\nload is a mainframe term.\n\n241\n00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,860\nThat's what we're referring to there.\n\n242\n00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,030\nAsset management is this idea\nof understanding what we own.\n\n243\n00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,960\nWhat are the assets,\nhardware and software both?\n\n244\n00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,170\nPeople found in this category,\n\n245\n00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,280\nhuman resources are considered to be\nassets as is intellectual property.\n\n246\n00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,620\nThese are all assets that a companies\ngonna have and or be able to manage or\n\n247\n00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,870\nhave under management.\n\n248\n00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,560\nWe wanna have an inventory of them,\nbe aware of them, and\n\n249\n00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,110\nknow what's going on with them and\nkeep track of them at all times.\n\n250\n00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,130\nThis is part of how we manage our system.\n\n251\n00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,400\nSo asset management is just\nthat idea of doing that.\n\n252\n00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,990\nOur trusted recovery method,\nso what happens when a system\n\n253\n00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,040\ndoes not behave the way it should, and as\na result then, how do we deal with that?\n\n254\n00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,700\nSo our traditional thought process of,\nwell we'll just reboot it.\n\n255\n00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,060\nIt's Windows, after all.\n\n256\n00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,805\nAnd it should normally fix itself.\n\n257\n00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,807\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> And so that's the old urban myth and\n\n258\n00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:03,430\nlegend about that is kinda\nwhere we think about this.\n\n259\n00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,930\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n260\n00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,390\nwe have three carved out categories or\nthings we think about traditionally here.\n\n261\n00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,190\nWe have our system reboot.\n\n262\n00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,190\nWe have our emergency system restart,\n\n263\n00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,390\nvery serious, and\nthen we have our system cold start.\n\n264\n00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,820\nWhat we're really talking about is here,\n\n265\n00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,360\na system reboot is a controlled\nshutdown of the system and a restart.\n\n266\n00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,810\nSo you'd go in and say I want to restart\nand you are the owner of that system,\n\n267\n00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,530\nyou have the rights to administer it.\n\n268\n00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:31,660\nEverything shuts down properly, systems\nare going to be sensitive if you just\n\n269\n00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,890\npull the power lug on the the back of it,\nhold in the power button, and\n\n270\n00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,920\nall the system services don't shut down\ngracefully application data's not safe.\n\n271\n00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,420\nThen we tend to have corruption,\n\n272\n00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,980\na system reboot is really\njust a controlled restart.\n\n273\n00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,570\nAnd emergency system restart is\nwhen that happens incorrectly.\n\n274\n00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,520\nSo an emergency system restart would be\na blue screen, in Windows a purple screen,\n\n275\n00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,150\nin VM Ware something like that.\n\n276\n00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:56,290\nWhere you have basically\nan uncontrolled restart.\n\n277\n00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,520\nSystem goes down without our\nability to do it properly or\n\n278\n00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,220\nthe kind of clumsy intern is\nbehind the row of servers.\n\n279\n00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,950\n>> Whoops.\n\n280\n00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,930\n>> And trips and\ntakes out the entire power and\n\n281\n00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:10,030\nthen has to restart it as well as\nscrubbing the floor with a toothbrush.\n\n282\n00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,800\n>> Yes, it could be an RGE.\n\n283\n00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,930\n>> That kind of thing.\n\n284\n00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,940\nI miss the days of hazing back\nin the day with the fraternity.\n\n285\n00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,690\nOf course I need my car washed and\n\n286\n00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,740\nyou need an eyelash liner brush\nin order to do that, sir.\n\n287\n00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,330\n>> Yes.\n>> All right, so then system cold start.\n\n288\n00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:26,350\nThis will be where basically we're\nbringing it back up from a crash,\n\n289\n00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,110\nbringing it back up and we have not had\nit running for some period of time.\n\n290\n00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,670\nWe're gonna power back up and\n\n291\n00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,630\nprobably walk through some recovery\nprocedures as part of that.\n\n292\n00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:38,060\nWe may do a system integrity check,\nmay check memory, may check the hardware.\n\n293\n00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,440\nSo the post may kick in on\nthe BIOS to check the hardware,\n\n294\n00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,500\nwill load the kernel,\ncheck the operating system integrities.\n\n295\n00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,760\nWe load the files,\nare the digital signatures matching up?\n\n296\n00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,290\nIs there a corruption in the NT loader\nif it's a Windows based system?\n\n297\n00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,800\n>> Right.\n>> That kind of thing, or the boot loader,\n\n298\n00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,420\nthe Bootstrap loader if it's Linux.\n\n299\n00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,470\nSo whatever that bootloader is,\nis the MBR properly set up or\n\n300\n00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,410\nthe GPT, the partition table,\nthat kind of thing?\n\n301\n00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:04,830\nIf there's issues there, it may stop\nat a certain point through an error.\n\n302\n00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,090\nIt's a system cold start, so basically\nrun through that cycle from power up.\n\n303\n00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,330\nWe're thinking about basically\na power up scenario there.\n\n304\n00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,230\nSo just be aware of that, make sure we're\nkind of thinking through what those\n\n305\n00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,870\nscenarios may look like\nafter one of those happens,\n\n306\n00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,970\nwhat do we do after a system crash?\n\n307\n00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,240\nWhen a system crashes what\nare we going to do there?\n\n308\n00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,980\nTypically we enter into safe mode, so\nagain in Windows may come up in safe mode.\n\n309\n00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,140\nYou may have to hit a button to do that.\n\n310\n00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,780\nMay hit a F8 traditionally right?\n\n311\n00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,328\n>> Or, Shift + F8.\n\n312\n00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:35,320\n>> Or, Shift + F8 or in the newer systems,\nyou may, if you're still inside the GUI,\n\n313\n00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,030\nif it's cracked for\nsome reason you may be able to get to it.\n\n314\n00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,859\nYou know these days you go to\nthe recovery menu in there.\n\n315\n00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:41,216\n>> [CROSSTALK] Best options there, yeah.\n\n316\n00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:46,279\n>> Right, then you can go in but\neither way if you Shift + F8 or whatever.\n\n317\n00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:49,689\nSo safe mode will bring up options\nmaybe with network connectivity,\n\n318\n00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,940\nwithout network connectivity,\ncommand prompts, no video.\n\n319\n00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,510\nThe old SOS switch.\n\n320\n00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,080\nRemember the SOS switch for that?\n\n321\n00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,450\nSo you would come up that way or show me\nall the files as they're loading instead\n\n322\n00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,050\nof the splash screen, so\nI can kind of see where we hang, right?\n\n323\n00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,020\nSee what files File with the DLL is bad.\n\n324\n00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,520\nYes, there are a lot of\nways to do that right.\n\n325\n00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,670\nJust depending on where you are and\nwhat OS you are using.\n\n326\n00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,800\nWe would then, typically in safe mode\ntry and go in and fix issues, recover\n\n327\n00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,460\nfiles and maybe apply a patch, uninstall\nrollback an update, something like that.\n\n328\n00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,310\nMaybe recover some files, take damaged\nfiles off the system, make copies of them,\n\n329\n00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,800\nput back a file that may be damaged and\nreplace the NT loader.\n\n330\n00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,850\nSomething like that, because you\nmay have a problem there and then,\n\n331\n00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,290\nvalidate these critical files.\n\n332\n00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,770\nSo, again,\nthen kind of start back up again.\n\n333\n00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,580\nLet's see if that driver now works\nthe right way, maybe the DLL is good.\n\n334\n00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,420\nDigitally look at all the digital\nsignatures on those files.\n\n335\n00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,736\nSo we may use the sigverif Utility\nin Windows to be able to run a quick\n\n336\n00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:49,293\nverification or something like that.\n\n337\n00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:53,517\nWe have the equivalent utilities depending\non what kind of OS we're using on Linux so\n\n338\n00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:57,264\nwe may have some sort of a validation\nutility we can run against the kernel to\n\n339\n00:15:57,264 --> 00:15:58,232\nvalidate things.\n\n340\n00:15:58,232 --> 00:16:02,228\nThat kind of stuff, so there's a kind of\nmethodology we're walking through here.\n\n341\n00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:06,905\nAgain, it's the CSSISP, remember,\nyour seen as wealth spring of knowledge.\n\n342\n00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:09,358\n>> Yeah.\n>> Kind of that trusted source within\n\n343\n00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:12,409\nthe organization that is\nsupposed to have mastery and\n\n344\n00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:14,730\nknowledge of these kinds of things.\n\n345\n00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,715\nThat doesn't mean you're gonna\nbe the expert that knows how and\n\n346\n00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:20,515\njust mention Windows verification\ntool Called Sigverif.\n\n347\n00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:21,430\n>> Right.\n>> You may never have\n\n348\n00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,250\nheard of that tool, by the way.\n\n349\n00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,690\nRight?\nYou might not know what it is.\n\n350\n00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,060\nAnd that's fine, but\n\n351\n00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,030\nyou should be the person that understands\nhow to tell a team that if they have\n\n352\n00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,120\na problem that there should be some\nsort of process step that says hey,\n\n353\n00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,130\nlet's verify integrity before we turn\nthis back on and put it in production.\n\n354\n00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,985\n>> Right.\n>> How you do that, the tactical.\n\n355\n00:16:39,985 --> 00:16:41,880\n>> Mm-hm.\nMay or may not be all that critical for\n\n356\n00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,830\nyou to know.\n\n357\n00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,450\nBut the strategy,\nthe high level thought process.\n\n358\n00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,380\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Around managing a team\n\n359\n00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:50,860\nthrough that check list is important for\nCISSP to understand how to do.\n\n360\n00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,530\n>> Right, yup.\n\n361\n00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,710\n>> And so, if you don't know that\nparticular tactical element,\n\n362\n00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,820\nyou don't know that tool.\n\n363\n00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,640\nThat's okay.\n\n364\n00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,820\nTell somebody on the team hey, you gotta\ngo find that tool that's appropriate for\n\n365\n00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,890\nthe issue we're having.\n\n366\n00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,520\nBut the fact that there's a check\nbox on the list that says\n\n367\n00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,415\nintegrity verification before putting\nback in production is the CISSPs job.\n\n368\n00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:10,340\n>> Yep.\n>> That's what they gotta know how to do.\n\n369\n00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,140\nAnd they gotta understand\nthe value of that.\n\n370\n00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,750\nSo, as you're studying out there,\nas you're looking to prepare,\n\n371\n00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,160\nas you're challenging yourself and\nultimately challenging the exam and\n\n372\n00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,200\nproving to be successful.\n\n373\n00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,880\nWhen you're on the other side of that,\nwe want you to be, obviously.\n\n374\n00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,925\nVery important.\n\n375\n00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:26,385\nYou gotta be thinking\nabout the right context.\n\n376\n00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:27,445\nThe right amount of knowledge.\n\n377\n00:17:27,445 --> 00:17:29,335\nHow do we bring that to bear.\n\n378\n00:17:29,335 --> 00:17:31,135\nWhat's the right level to study at?\n\n379\n00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,175\nDo I need to become the master of all?\n\n380\n00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:33,795\nRight.\nNo.\n\n381\n00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:34,975\nYou don't need to be the master of all.\n\n382\n00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,545\nIt's not about being a renaissance man.\n\n383\n00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:37,365\nRight.\nWhat it is,\n\n384\n00:17:37,365 --> 00:17:40,775\nis about understanding conceptual ideas,\nand\n\n385\n00:17:40,775 --> 00:17:43,815\nhow they apply to the every\nday practice of security.\n\n386\n00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:46,255\nAnd it really is more about\nstrategy than about tactics.\n\n387\n00:17:46,255 --> 00:17:47,730\nAnd I want you to be aware of that.\n\n388\n00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,230\nWe have three levels we often think about,\n\n389\n00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,400\nstrategy, tactical, and\noperational levels, in a business.\n\n390\n00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,610\nAnd this is about strategy and\nabout operational.\n\n391\n00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:58,060\nIt's not as much about\ntactical on this exam.\n\n392\n00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,820\nThere are some tactical elements.\n\n393\n00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,629\nYou may need to understand, for instance,\nhow to make sure when we talk about IPsec\n\n394\n00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,420\nthat we have these elements to\nmake it up like we discussed.\n\n395\n00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,950\nWhen we talk about L2TP,\nlayered to tunneling protocol,\n\n396\n00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,670\nwe want to know that\nwe have to apply IPsec\n\n397\n00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,725\nto create security there because L2TP\nby itself, has no authentication.\n\n398\n00:18:18,725 --> 00:18:20,700\n>> Right.\n>> No encryption of any kind.\n\n399\n00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,720\nJust creates tunnel, but\nwe don't encapsulate the data\n\n400\n00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,970\nother than to just tunnel it any\nmeaningful way from a security standpoint.\n\n401\n00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,750\nSo understanding that tactic.\n\n402\n00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:34,410\nOf combining L2TP with IPsec is critical\nfor the success of a CISSP candidate.\n\n403\n00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,430\nYou gotta know that.\n\n404\n00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,230\nRight?\nNo bones about it.\n\n405\n00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,840\nGotta know it.\n\n406\n00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,280\n>> Yep.\n>> And how to do it?\n\n407\n00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,530\nReally important to understand\nthe conceptual idea.\n\n408\n00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:44,160\nBut getting right down there in the\ntrenches and walking through like Don and\n\n409\n00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,985\nI do with a demo.\n\n410\n00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:46,970\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> For you on IPsec.\n\n411\n00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,220\nLoading that MMC.\n\n412\n00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,390\nGoing through those wizards.\n\n413\n00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,680\nMaking those choices.\n\n414\n00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,620\nSetting it up and choosing a H.\n\n415\n00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,600\nEsp one or both and what app,\nwhat algorithm md5, or\n\n416\n00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,270\nshy, or esp, or whatever, or\neap with tls or whatever it will be.\n\n417\n00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,820\nYeah, those things, not as critical as\nunderstanding that they have to be done\n\n418\n00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,418\nand why they're done is very\nimportant there on the CISSP front.\n\n419\n00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:13,220\nSo just wanna throw that out as we're\nrunning through some of this...\n\n420\n00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,230\nBreak up the discussion for just a minute,\n\n421\n00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,300\nget you refocused on the right level\nof engagement around the knowledge, and\n\n422\n00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,380\nnow a word from our sponsor,\nlet's go back to our notes.\n\n423\n00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,500\nBut now you have a general sense so,\nthat's right.\n\n424\n00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,930\nSo, you wanna make sure\nyou have that right focus.\n\n425\n00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,752\nSo, we're talking about what\nto do after a system crash so.\n\n426\n00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> What about security concerns\n\n427\n00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,800\nduring a trusted recovery process?\n\n428\n00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,870\nSo, what happens?\n\n429\n00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,220\nWe come back up or\nwe're recovering, right?\n\n430\n00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,540\n>> Right.\n>> So, what are some of the things we\n\n431\n00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,940\nwanna make sure the system does or\ndoes not do, to make sure and\n\n432\n00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,500\nsafeguard that we have integrity.\n\n433\n00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,840\nWe have security so again, three or\nfour steps to think about here.\n\n434\n00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,010\nThe boot up sequence should\nnot be able to be modified.\n\n435\n00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,380\nIn other words, in a secure boot\nup scenario we should not be able\n\n436\n00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:56,840\nto go in and hit F12 and do a network\nboot if we're normally not doing that.\n\n437\n00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,600\n>> Right\n>> We should not\n\n438\n00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,210\nbe able to modify the boot\nsequence in the BIOS.\n\n439\n00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,630\nRight, so that we can say we\nwanna boot to this E drive.\n\n440\n00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,420\n>> Versus this thumb drive, yeah.\n\n441\n00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,440\n>> Versus the thumb drive,\nversus the CD-ROM or whatever.\n\n442\n00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,210\nSo we load an overlay OS and pull\nthe data off through maybe Windows to go,\n\n443\n00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,370\nor Secure Linux like Knoppix or\nsomething like that.\n\n444\n00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,030\nThat should not be possible if we're\nhaving a trusted recovery process.\n\n445\n00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,810\nI want to be clear about this.\n\n446\n00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:24,350\nA trusted recovery process is one\nthat is secure top to bottom, and\n\n447\n00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:28,310\nis process driven,\nrather procedure driven, process managed.\n\n448\n00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,950\nAnd is not, you're just\nrebooting your Windows machine.\n\n449\n00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,940\nAnd being the owner of your own\nlaptop locally, going in and\n\n450\n00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,146\nmodifying the BIOS boot order.\n\n451\n00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:37,120\n>> Right.\n>> We're not saying you can't do that, or\n\n452\n00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,060\nyou shouldn't do that on your machine.\n\n453\n00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,580\nWe're saying on a secure server.\n\n454\n00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,960\nbooting up with a trusted\nrecovery process in place,\n\n455\n00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,460\nthat should not happen unless we\nhave either a specific reason, so\n\n456\n00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,470\nwe have administrative rights and\nwe have to go in to do that.\n\n457\n00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:56,090\nOr we have a documentation solution\nthat says here's how it will be done and\n\n458\n00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,308\nunderchange management coming up\ndown there in a couple of minutes.\n\n459\n00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:00,990\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> We're gonna then have a process to\n\n460\n00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,975\ndocument the fact.\n\n461\n00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:04,210\n>> Right.\n>> That we are gonna engage in that change\n\n462\n00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,440\nbecause maybe the hard drive is blown...\n\n463\n00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,055\nAnd we ned to go in and break our mirror.\n\n464\n00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:10,125\n>> Right.\n>> And maybe cable over or something.\n\n465\n00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,670\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And change the boot up sequence\n\n466\n00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,170\nin order to be able to allow for that.\n\n467\n00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:15,100\nSo it's not that we can't do it, but\n\n468\n00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,140\nin a trusted recovery process after\na system crash, we should not be doing it\n\n469\n00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,370\nbecause that's not the time to do\nit is what we're suggesting, right?\n\n470\n00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,150\n>> Right.\n>> All right, so\n\n471\n00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:26,410\nobviously boot up sequence should\nnot be able to be modified.\n\n472\n00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,520\nWriting actions to system log\nshould not be bypassed, meaning.\n\n473\n00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,440\nShould not be able to boot\nsystem up without logging all\n\n474\n00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,750\nthe activity that goes on.\n\n475\n00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,170\nAgain if we can bypass logging then the\nthought process not trusted, not secure.\n\n476\n00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,590\nWhat else could we be doing that we're\nnot talking about and not exposing.\n\n477\n00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,338\n>> Yeah, cuz now you got no\nrecord of what I'm doing.\n\n478\n00:21:43,338 --> 00:21:44,670\n>> Exactly.\n\n479\n00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:45,690\nRight.\nExactly.\n\n480\n00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,090\nVery important right.\n\n481\n00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,795\nA system forced shut down\nshould not be allowed.\n\n482\n00:21:49,795 --> 00:21:50,415\n>> Mm-hm.\nRight, so\n\n483\n00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:52,470\nwe should not allow the system\nto be force into shutting down.\n\n484\n00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,480\nYou like Ctrl+Alt+Delete.\n\n485\n00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,782\nRestart something like that.\n\n486\n00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,190\n>> Right.\n>> Yeah, we should have an ability to\n\n487\n00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,800\nable to break a process,\nControl C, for instance,\n\n488\n00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,590\nsimply to break a process, right?\n\n489\n00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:05,090\nBut, we should not be able to force\nthe system to shut itself down without\n\n490\n00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:09,370\ndocumenting what's going on and following\nthe proper procedures to shut down.\n\n491\n00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,020\nRight, so things like power\nsupply should be guarded, so,\n\n492\n00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,090\nyou can't just reach around and\npull the cable out.\n\n493\n00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:18,870\nRight, so we may put the system in such a\nway and the furniture in the installation\n\n494\n00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,880\nthat you can't get to be the back of\nthe cable, it's locked or blocked off.\n\n495\n00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,970\nThe power button, up front, may be\ndisabled, maybe unhooked in the case,\n\n496\n00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,085\nso you can't hold it in and do that force\ndelay where you shut the system down.\n\n497\n00:22:30,085 --> 00:22:31,980\n>> Mm-hm.\nWe may constrain the menu where\n\n498\n00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,140\nwe take out the restart feature.\n\n499\n00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,560\nTake out the shut down feature.\n\n500\n00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,550\n>> Right.\nThings like that.\n\n501\n00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,480\nThese are all ways we could create\na trusted recovery process.\n\n502\n00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,010\nOr we could also break all your fingers,\nso\n\n503\n00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,760\nyou can't actually, right, you're in\nthere with your elbows trying to do this.\n\n504\n00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,930\n>> Trying to push with your nose.\n\n505\n00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,060\n>> Exactly, you have the pencil in\nyour mouth, something like that.\n\n506\n00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,150\nSo there's lots of ways to do this, some\nare more interactive than others, right?\n\n507\n00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,830\nAnd then also output should\nnot be able to be rerouted.\n\n508\n00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,550\nWe should not be able to reroute output,\nfor instance and maybe print something.\n\n509\n00:22:58,550 --> 00:22:59,770\n>> Yes.\n>> That, on a secure workstation,\n\n510\n00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:01,140\nnormally doesn't allow printing.\n\n511\n00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,505\nShould not be able to write\nit to external removal media.\n\n512\n00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:04,050\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n513\n00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,040\n>> All the rage several years back,\nwhen I say several,\n\n514\n00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,600\nI mean probably like 10\nto 15 years ago now.\n\n515\n00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,830\nRemember zip drives?\n\n516\n00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,280\n>> Oh, yes.\n>> Zip drives, back in the day?\n\n517\n00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,080\n>> Absolutely.\nStill have one.\n\n518\n00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,140\n>> Right, yeah, so\neven if you have a zip drives,\n\n519\n00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,960\nyou would either take cartridges or\nmedia cartridges that you would use.\n\n520\n00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,750\nThis was kinda the in-between,\n\n521\n00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:21,980\ncuz at that point you'd have\na really big USB external drives.\n\n522\n00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,480\n>> Yes.\n>> Zip\n\n523\n00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,525\ndrives are kinda the next step\nfrom external or internal storage.\n\n524\n00:23:25,525 --> 00:23:26,150\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n525\n00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,060\n>> And so we have those.\n\n526\n00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,410\nYou could re-route output\nbasically to a zip drive,\n\n527\n00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,400\ntake the cartridge,\nyou'll walk away with it.\n\n528\n00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,625\nYou had rewritable optical DVDs and\nthings like that.\n\n529\n00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:35,170\n>> Mm-hm, yeah.\n>> So\n\n530\n00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:39,385\nthis kinda stuff's what we're talking\nabout there, just to remember that.\n\n531\n00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,250\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n532\n00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,060\nAll right, it's very good,\nso we have all that.\n\n533\n00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,540\nSo how do we now, if we talk about trust\nfor recovery, failure, what we do,\n\n534\n00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,015\nhow do we go ahead,\nhow do we harden systems.\n\n535\n00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:49,680\n[INAUDIBLE] talk about system hardening.\n\n536\n00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,977\nI wrote down Bastian Hosts there,\n\n537\n00:23:50,977 --> 00:23:53,132\nI asked Mike actually to write\ndown Bastion hosts there.\n\n538\n00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,856\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Although that one is spelled correctly,\n\n539\n00:23:54,856 --> 00:23:56,099\nI should take credit for that one.\n\n540\n00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:59,810\nSo I wrote that one down because\nit is spelled correctly but\n\n541\n00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:04,508\nbastion hosts are hosts that are going\nto be hardened meaning we remove all\n\n542\n00:24:04,508 --> 00:24:07,557\nextraneous services, we don't install any.\n\n543\n00:24:07,557 --> 00:24:11,431\nSoftware, or any services that\nare going to not be necessary,\n\n544\n00:24:11,431 --> 00:24:16,183\nI know we've talked about this a few\ntimes on some of the other shows, where,\n\n545\n00:24:16,183 --> 00:24:21,130\nif we're doing VDI why on Earth do we\nneed in a normal virtualization solution?\n\n546\n00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,700\nWe need normal services.\n\n547\n00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,500\nThings like network, etc.\n\n548\n00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,310\nBut, why on earth do\nwe need sound drivers?\n\n549\n00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,150\n>> Right. Yeah. >> We need VDI.\n\n550\n00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,420\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> We need sound drivers,\n\n551\n00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,065\nbecause we're emulating on the desktop.\n\n552\n00:24:30,065 --> 00:24:34,940\nSo making sure the Bastion Host is setup\nproperly for what we're looking to do.\n\n553\n00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,540\nIf we're running a virtual solution,\nyou put the sound drivers in, right,\n\n554\n00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,600\nif it's gonna be a VDI desktop solution,\nvideo accelerators, things like that,\n\n555\n00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,490\nbut you don't need them on servers that\nare virtualized cuz when was last time you\n\n556\n00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,735\nactually, more often than not-\n>> [INAUDIBLE] music from it or anything.\n\n557\n00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:49,665\n>> I mean you could, but\nyou probably don't, right?\n\n558\n00:24:49,665 --> 00:24:52,045\nIt's probably not normal at\nleast not in an operational way.\n\n559\n00:24:52,045 --> 00:24:53,545\nAnyway, so as a result of that,\n\n560\n00:24:53,545 --> 00:24:56,735\nmake sure we strip out all of that\nstuff that doesn't belong there.\n\n561\n00:24:56,735 --> 00:25:00,095\nIt's very important, that's what\na bastion host typically represents, and\n\n562\n00:25:00,095 --> 00:25:01,635\nsystem hardening is\nreally just about that.\n\n563\n00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:05,085\nIt's about stripping out all of\nthat configuration information\n\n564\n00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:08,675\nthat does not belong, any of those\nservices, any of that software,\n\n565\n00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:12,640\nwe generically just refer to that as all\nthat stuff that's there as nuisance-ware.\n\n566\n00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,370\nRight?\nJust get rid of it.\n\n567\n00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,840\nOr at least I refer to it,\nanyway, as nuisance-ware.\n\n568\n00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,915\nSo uninstall the previews and\nthe free software all that.\n\n569\n00:25:19,915 --> 00:25:21,240\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Dell.\n\n570\n00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:21,940\nI love Dell.\n\n571\n00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,450\nI've got a few Dell computers [COUGH]\n>> Put all that junk on there.\n\n572\n00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,420\n>> They put a lot of stuff on there\nwhen you first get that machine, and\n\n573\n00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:30,800\nthere was a gentleman that actually wrote\na program called the Dell Decrapper, and\n\n574\n00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,340\nall it was,\nwas a little thing you'd run, and\n\n575\n00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,760\nit would go get rid of all the bloatware,\nthe freeware,\n\n576\n00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,610\nthe trialware, and all that stuff.\n\n577\n00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,720\n>> The bloatware.\nYeah, uninstall the bloatware.\n\n578\n00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,385\nAbsolutely, all the bloatware.\n\n579\n00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:39,028\n[LAUGH] And thank you for that,\nguy, whoever you were [LAUGH].\n\n580\n00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:39,890\n>> Have a cookie.\n\n581\n00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,910\n>> Yeah [LAUGH].\n\n582\n00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,620\n>> All right so, that's very important.\n\n583\n00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,230\nWe could actually,\nyou could start doing an awards thing,\n\n584\n00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,230\nyou could give out cookies.\n\n585\n00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,150\n>> Well, I'm gonna have to start that.\n\n586\n00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,230\nI'm gonna think about a way that\nI could distribute these cookies.\n\n587\n00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,110\n>> Mike's cookies.\n\n588\n00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,960\n>> Yeah, right that'll work.\n\n589\n00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,150\n>> You could be like the Famous Amos\nof the networking world.\n\n590\n00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:54,930\nRight.\n>> All right,\n\n591\n00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,420\nso when we talk about all this stuff,\nvery important to think about that.\n\n592\n00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,670\nAlso, not just the software,\nnot just the services.\n\n593\n00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,250\nBut there may be extraneous files.\n\n594\n00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,490\nThere may be stuff in there that\nmay not really be necessary either.\n\n595\n00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,995\nSo a lot of times in the old school days,\nagain, we would build these system images.\n\n596\n00:26:11,995 --> 00:26:13,660\nWe'd would put i386 in there, right?\n\n597\n00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,730\nSo that we would have the directory\nto add and remove features.\n\n598\n00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:19,170\nWe would put in the the support tools,\nright?\n\n599\n00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,260\nSo, we need support tools typically.\n\n600\n00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:20,840\n>> Yeah.\n\n601\n00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,650\n>> We don't tend to do that a lot anymore.\n\n602\n00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,320\nRight?\nBut, you know,\n\n603\n00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,910\nthere are reasons why some of that stuff\nmay still need to be built, or not built.\n\n604\n00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:30,600\nSo, any of that kind of stuff,\njust anything that if you look at it and\n\n605\n00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,895\ngo there's absolutely no reason I\nneed it here, I'm not using it for\n\n606\n00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:36,020\nanything, then it should not be on\nthe system, let's put it that way.\n\n607\n00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,465\nCuz what will happen is hackers will\nlook for that, and as a result of that,\n\n608\n00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,895\nthey will find it, they'll figure out oh,\nthis is still here.\n\n609\n00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:43,335\nAnd they may try to take advantage of it.\n\n610\n00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:47,162\nSo, you don't typically need to\nput a full install of Office\n\n611\n00:26:47,162 --> 00:26:48,572\non a production level server.\n\n612\n00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:49,692\nBut, you may need Word.\n\n613\n00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:50,992\nRight?\nBecause you may need Word.\n\n614\n00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:52,922\nBecause you may have to\nlook at Word documents.\n\n615\n00:26:52,922 --> 00:26:55,564\nBut do you really need Word or\ndo you need a Word viewer?\n\n616\n00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:59,218\nSo, that's the thing you want to think\nabout because Word brings a bunch of\n\n617\n00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:00,563\nadditional stuff with it.\n\n618\n00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:03,240\nAnd service packs and security patching.\n\n619\n00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,580\nWhereas the Word viewer,\nreally no footprint to speak of.\n\n620\n00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,340\nYou don't need Adobe Acrobat Pro.\n\n621\n00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,840\nYou need PDF Adobe Reader.\n\n622\n00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,905\nSo those are the kinds of things you want\nto be thinking here with system hardening.\n\n623\n00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:17,438\nSo you ought to just think about that,\nkind of is the thought process there.\n\n624\n00:27:17,438 --> 00:27:19,821\nAll right, so\nthen we have remote access security so\n\n625\n00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:23,810\njust thinking again about categories of\nplaces we wanna be focusing our efforts.\n\n626\n00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,440\nSo as we look at remote access,\nwe're looking at VPN based access.\n\n627\n00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,720\nMaybe now no longer VPN based technologies\nbut still remote access technology,\n\n628\n00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:36,040\nso something like RPC over HTTPS,\nthings of that nature,\n\n629\n00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,160\nwhere we're coming in but we're doing so\nwithout a formal VPN overlay.\n\n630\n00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,422\n>> Right.\n>> So how do we safeguard that so\n\n631\n00:27:41,422 --> 00:27:42,938\nthings like AAA here?\n\n632\n00:27:42,938 --> 00:27:45,105\nSo radius solutions would\nbe something to consider.\n\n633\n00:27:45,105 --> 00:27:47,952\nAAA is basically a radius solution, so\n\n634\n00:27:47,952 --> 00:27:52,357\nwhether it's radii [LAUGH]\nwhether it's a radius solution,\n\n635\n00:27:52,357 --> 00:27:57,879\nwhether it is going to be some sort of\nremote access server that is ultimately\n\n636\n00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:03,010\ngoing to be brokering that conversation,\nacting as a buffer for us.\n\n637\n00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,150\nToday is going to be really focused\naround things like the cloud and so\n\n638\n00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,680\nI thought you were starting your own\nuniversity or something from that.\n\n639\n00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,260\nSecurity U.\n\n640\n00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,450\nRight, I did.\n\n641\n00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,760\nSo we could be really focused on\nremote access services and systems or\n\n642\n00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,710\nreally, we're only thinking\nabout the cloud today, right?\n\n643\n00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,930\nAnd just how we bring information out\nto the masses and bring them to us.\n\n644\n00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,900\nAnd we may do so by putting it out\nthere for people to get to, but\n\n645\n00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,620\nit may not be inside our networks.\n\n646\n00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,170\nIt could be sitting out in\nsomeone else's network, so\n\n647\n00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,690\nnow I have to extend the concept\nof what a border means for\n\n648\n00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,560\nthis larger area and\nunderstand how to manage that.\n\n649\n00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,595\n>> Right.\n\n650\n00:28:34,595 --> 00:28:36,775\nThings like mobile access, in general.\n\n651\n00:28:36,775 --> 00:28:37,985\nMobile devices.\n\n652\n00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:41,185\nAnd so just this idea of how\nwe securely access content\n\n653\n00:28:41,185 --> 00:28:42,995\nfrom outside the boundary of our network,\n\n654\n00:28:42,995 --> 00:28:46,225\nwhatever that may be, is what remote\naccess security really is all about.\n\n655\n00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,840\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n656\n00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,520\nConfiguration management.\n\n657\n00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,340\nThis idea of understanding\nhow we look at documents and\n\n658\n00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,920\nultimately manage\nthe configurations of our systems.\n\n659\n00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,620\nSo things like desktop imaging and\nbaseline imaging would be in here.\n\n660\n00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:05,890\nSo document and manage configurations,\nconfigurations of our\n\n661\n00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:11,200\nhardware as well as of\nthe images that we use right and\n\n662\n00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,070\nso you know hardware's good and just desk\ntop imaging or anything like that but\n\n663\n00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:20,190\nmaybe a sub point would be things\nlike server images or desktop images.\n\n664\n00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,480\nSo what kind of imaging\nplatform do we use?\n\n665\n00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,270\nDo we use baselines in order\nto drive those images?\n\n666\n00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,521\nHow do we do patch management?\n\n667\n00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:30,230\nAre we documenting our baselines?\n\n668\n00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,600\nAre we documenting our configurations\nusing some sort of configuration\n\n669\n00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,330\nmanagement database, a term we often hear.\n\n670\n00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,933\nAs Steve discussed, when we talk about so\n\n671\n00:29:39,933 --> 00:29:43,021\nwhen we think about that\nframework Documenting everything.\n\n672\n00:29:43,021 --> 00:29:47,887\nWe'll talk about the importance of\nchange management in relation to this\n\n673\n00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:53,070\na little bit, but this idea overall of\njust keeping track of all those things.\n\n674\n00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:56,401\nWe shouldn't ever walk into a system or\nwalk into a network and\n\n675\n00:29:56,401 --> 00:30:00,567\nfind systems running that don't have\ndocumentation associated with them,\n\n676\n00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:01,990\nthat's just really bad.\n\n677\n00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,688\nAnd if we find that, it's because we just\ndon't have good configuration management.\n\n678\n00:30:05,688 --> 00:30:09,228\nIt's probably cuz we don't have good\nchange management as well but first and\n\n679\n00:30:09,228 --> 00:30:12,580\nforemost it's because we don't have\ngood configuration management.\n\n680\n00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,610\nOr if we go and sample a system and look\nat it and see what's going on with it.\n\n681\n00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,650\nBut then we look at it and\nwe find out that it's changed.\n\n682\n00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,280\nIn other words, the configuration\nis not what it says it should be,\n\n683\n00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,920\nthen we again probably have problems with\nconfiguration and with change management.\n\n684\n00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,560\nSo we want to be aware or that,\nreally just be thinking about that and\n\n685\n00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,530\nunderstand that because the implications\nof these things are that we may actually\n\n686\n00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,990\nhave issues and concerns that are going\nmuch deeper than we have to address.\n\n687\n00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,310\nAll right, very good.\n\n688\n00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:40,360\nI think it's probably a good place for\nus to take a break at least and stop for\n\n689\n00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,220\na few minutes and then come back and\nhave another conversation.\n\n690\n00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:43,938\n>> Sounds good to me.\n\n691\n00:30:43,938 --> 00:30:46,313\nSo we'll see you guys back here in a few.\n\n692\n00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:53,980\n[MUSIC]\n\n693\n00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:58,018\nAll right, welcome back everybody, we\nleft off talking about some configuration\n\n694\n00:30:58,018 --> 00:31:02,010\nmanagement and I think we will get ready\nto go ahead and do some change management.\n\n695\n00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,693\n>> Yeah, I think that's going to be\na good place for us to pick up and\n\n696\n00:31:04,693 --> 00:31:06,087\ncontinue our thought process and\n\n697\n00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:09,715\nour conversation around really managing\nthrough the operational security aspect.\n\n698\n00:31:09,715 --> 00:31:11,060\n>> Right.\n>> So what do we need,\n\n699\n00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,900\nconfiguration management,\nstudy of managing configurations.\n\n700\n00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,270\nSo now let's talk about change.\n\n701\n00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,388\nChange management is a formal process,\nright?\n\n702\n00:31:18,388 --> 00:31:19,911\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So when we think about change,\n\n703\n00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,653\nwe want to obviously want to document\nthings that are gonna happen.\n\n704\n00:31:22,653 --> 00:31:24,460\n>> Right.\n>> We have a formal mechanism or\n\n705\n00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,980\na way of dealing with that.\n\n706\n00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,120\nIt's traditionally looked at\nhere as a six step process and\n\n707\n00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,840\nwe've outlined it for you here.\n\n708\n00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,050\nSo the idea is that at a very high level,\nagain,\n\n709\n00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:37,280\nthere may be some subtle differences in\nyour world if you are gonna be coming from\n\n710\n00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,240\na change management background, maybe\nattached to a PMO, project management\n\n711\n00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,020\noffice in your practice, you may have\na methodology that looks similar, but\n\n712\n00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,350\nmay call out different steps,\nmay have a different name for a step.\n\n713\n00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,480\nBut this is just a generic\nway of representing change.\n\n714\n00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,780\nThe idea is, you would make\na formal request for change.\n\n715\n00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,841\nSo this would be kinda Step 1.\n\n716\n00:31:55,841 --> 00:32:00,059\nWe would submit that, we would then seek\napproval of the change through some sort\n\n717\n00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,595\nof change advisory, change\nmanagement body, we call those CABs,\n\n718\n00:32:03,595 --> 00:32:06,719\ntypically Documentation of\nthe change would be required.\n\n719\n00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:10,710\nWe would then test the change to make sure\nwe know what's gonna happen to it, so\n\n720\n00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,560\nmay do some proof of concept there,\nsome data testing.\n\n721\n00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,420\nThings like that.\n>> Outside of the production environment.\n\n722\n00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,851\n>> Oh no, no.\nWe always wanna test in production.\n\n723\n00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,381\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's the best part, right?\n\n724\n00:32:18,381 --> 00:32:21,310\nCuz then you get to test your DR plan\nas part of that all at the same time.\n\n725\n00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,185\n>> If you want your phone to light up,\nyeah.\n\n726\n00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:23,600\n>> Absolutely.\n\n727\n00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,320\nWhy is our email server no longer running?\n\n728\n00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,380\nRight, so yes, absolutely.\n\n729\n00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,050\nDefinitely, Mike makes a very good point.\n\n730\n00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:32,230\nTest outside of production, or\ngo to your friend's network and\n\n731\n00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,910\ntest in their production environment, cuz\nthat is technically outside of production.\n\n732\n00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:40,020\nIt's just outside of your production, it's\ninside somebody else's, so either way,\n\n733\n00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,720\nwhichever one you wanna do there.\n\n734\n00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,850\nIt depends on how good of a friend\nthey are I suppose, right?\n\n735\n00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,830\nThat's where the whole\nterm frienemy came from.\n\n736\n00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,380\nAnd them implement the change, right?\n\n737\n00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,670\nSo make sure the change\nis gonna be implemented,\n\n738\n00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:55,900\nmeaning put it into production, go live\nin effect, what we talk about there.\n\n739\n00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,305\nAnd then assuming it all goes well,\nwe will then report back or\n\n740\n00:32:59,305 --> 00:33:02,060\nreport on the status of\nthe change to management.\n\n741\n00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:05,998\nIf at the end of step five, the reputation\nof the change something were to go wrong,\n\n742\n00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:07,476\nthen we would have a rollback.\n\n743\n00:33:07,476 --> 00:33:11,816\nA rollback or basically an opt out\nclause in our change plan where we could\n\n744\n00:33:11,816 --> 00:33:14,420\neffectively put things back to normal.\n\n745\n00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,610\nSo you just want to make sure you're\nclear on that whole concept, but\n\n746\n00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,510\nthat's what we're talking about.\n\n747\n00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:22,930\nSo these are the accepted kind of\nhigh-level steps around change management\n\n748\n00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,610\nthat from a formal perspective\nwould be expected.\n\n749\n00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:31,970\nIn other words,\nwhat I'm suggesting here is that this is\n\n750\n00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:37,030\nthe standardized methodology, that if\nyou're going to be discussing change and\n\n751\n00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:41,518\nanswering questions about change,\nyou probably wanna be familiar with.\n\n752\n00:33:41,518 --> 00:33:46,340\nAnd also wanna be familiar with in\nthe order of the steps that they occur.\n\n753\n00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:46,960\n>> Yeah, very important.\n\n754\n00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,900\n>> Because it's very important\nthat you don't test changes\n\n755\n00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,400\nunless they have been requested,\napproved, and documented.\n\n756\n00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,180\nSo you don't wanna get those things out\nof order because then something may not\n\n757\n00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,690\nbe kosher there, as we say.\n\n758\n00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,500\nMight not be too happy with that outcome,\n\n759\n00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,480\nso, let's just make sure\nwe're aware of that.\n\n760\n00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,976\n>> [CROSSTALK] first and then ask for\npermission later, right?\n\n761\n00:34:07,976 --> 00:34:10,509\n>> Oh, it's always easier to ask for\nforgiveness than it is to ask for\n\n762\n00:34:10,509 --> 00:34:11,650\npermission.\n\n763\n00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,550\nWe know that for a fact, right?\n\n764\n00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,540\nThat's why we don't let people manage\nchange unless there's somebody overseeing\n\n765\n00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,510\nthem who has the thought\nprocess around that.\n\n766\n00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,315\nBut do be aware of that all kidding aside.\n\n767\n00:34:21,315 --> 00:34:24,670\nAlright, so, having talked about change,\nnow let's talk about media controls.\n\n768\n00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:29,400\nMedia controls would be this idea of going\nthrough, and how do we deal with media?\n\n769\n00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,580\nMedia is typically gonna\nbe things like DVD-ROMs,\n\n770\n00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:36,220\nCD-ROMs, USB devices,\nanywhere we store data.\n\n771\n00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,290\nAny kind of removable\nstorage is gonna be media.\n\n772\n00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:44,160\nSo, we want to talk about\nthings like sanitization,\n\n773\n00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,410\npurging, zeroization,\ndegaussing, data remnants.\n\n774\n00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:52,720\nThese are all ways, except for data\nremnants, of dealing with wiping out and\n\n775\n00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,250\nmaking sure we clean\nthe media that is gonna\n\n776\n00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,980\nbe given to somebody else if it's\nreusable to make sure there's no\n\n777\n00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,090\nability to have data left in\nthere that could be pulled out.\n\n778\n00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,890\nData remnants is the idea of data\nleft behind if we don't do these\n\n779\n00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:05,672\nthings properly.\n\n780\n00:35:05,672 --> 00:35:10,450\nSo sanitization, Is typically gonna\nbe erasing, very very basic level.\n\n781\n00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,920\nWe sanitize data off of a media device.\n\n782\n00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,560\nWe just talk about erasing it.\n\n783\n00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,632\nPurging it, a little bit more focused.\n\n784\n00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,990\nWe are gonna make, or try to make,\n\n785\n00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,290\nInformation really unrecoverable\neven with extraordinary efforts.\n\n786\n00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,190\nSo we go to the extra added steps, and\nmaybe doing cross writes on the drive,\n\n787\n00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:30,360\nmultiple deep level wipes\nthings of that nature.\n\n788\n00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,870\nZeroization, this is\nthe idea of zeroing out.\n\n789\n00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:36,340\nSo we write multiple times using\nzeros across the drive to do that.\n\n790\n00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:41,330\nWe overwrite a pattern of zeroes that\noverwrites the data in multiple ways.\n\n791\n00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:45,780\nDegaussing is using a heavy magnetic\nfield to erase electronic or\n\n792\n00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,390\nrather magnetic media.\n\n793\n00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,760\nSo, yeah,\nI remember when I was in radio years ago.\n\n794\n00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,410\nWe would use the degaussing machines to\npurge or to wipe the tape cartridges.\n\n795\n00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:58,350\nYou would do a lot of these drops and\nsongs where, at least back in the day,\n\n796\n00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:01,222\na lot of it, almost all of it,\nis gonna be done on either DVDs or\n\n797\n00:36:01,222 --> 00:36:05,240\ndone to just media that's stored\non hard drives, things like that.\n\n798\n00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,000\nSo all this stuff gets prerecorded,\nbut when you did it live and\n\n799\n00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,140\nyou had a lot of this stuff,\nwe did this all on cart tapes,\n\n800\n00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,290\nwe used to call them cartridges,\nthey were like eight track tapes.\n\n801\n00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:16,766\nAnd you bulk load the tape, couple\nminutes of tape, up to maybe ten minutes,\n\n802\n00:36:16,766 --> 00:36:18,810\nwhatever it was, and\nyou would record on it.\n\n803\n00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,735\nIt was re-recordable, and then you would\nhave to put it into the degausser and\n\n804\n00:36:22,735 --> 00:36:24,769\nhit the button and the lights would dim.\n\n805\n00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:27,268\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And the building would shake.\n\n806\n00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,877\nYou'd get the deep guttural moan that was\ngoing on in the bowels of the building as\n\n807\n00:36:30,877 --> 00:36:32,140\nthe degausser spun up.\n\n808\n00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,700\nBut basically it was this heavy\nmagnetic field that would just remove\n\n809\n00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,660\nany trace of data on\nthat particular media.\n\n810\n00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,070\nAnd so that's what a degausser is.\n\n811\n00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,070\nThere are sometimes,\n\n812\n00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,770\nyou see them today built into secure\ndata centers around the door frames.\n\n813\n00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,340\nSo, a lot of times, if you carry the media\nout, you automatically wipe it out.\n\n814\n00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,820\nWhich means if you carry USB drives and\nthings like that in and\n\n815\n00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,880\nout they get wiped out.\n\n816\n00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,280\nCredit cards tend to get wiped out.\n\n817\n00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,109\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] You find out the hard way if\n\n818\n00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:56,977\nyou use it once or twice.\n\n819\n00:36:56,977 --> 00:36:58,439\nHey, why is my watch not working anymore?\n\n820\n00:36:58,439 --> 00:36:59,674\nWhat's going on with that, right?\n\n821\n00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:00,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n822\n00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,910\nyou definitely wanna be aware of that.\n\n823\n00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,600\nBut that, boy, when that machine\nused to kick on, the old style ones.\n\n824\n00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,570\nI mean, you would hold the button and it\nwas like a Harley engine roaring to life.\n\n825\n00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:13,500\nIt was just, that or maybe we just had\none of these really, like, ancient ones.\n\n826\n00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,920\nAnd, you know, I don't know,\nthe nuclear control element or\n\n827\n00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,350\nsomething wasn't aligned.\n\n828\n00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:19,198\nBut it was noisy, I'll tell you what.\n\n829\n00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:23,300\nYou had this deep guttural roar that would\njust kind of come out of that device.\n\n830\n00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,770\nAnd it was cool though, because\nliterally it would wipe out anything.\n\n831\n00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,600\n>> Everything on there.\n\n832\n00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,269\n>> Anything.\n>> Nice.\n\n833\n00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:28,687\n>> It was pretty neat.\n\n834\n00:37:28,687 --> 00:37:32,540\nAlright, so network and\nresource, availability.\n\n835\n00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,380\nYou know, we talk about A for\navailability, right?\n\n836\n00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,370\n>> Right.\nIt's one of our pillars, right?\n\n837\n00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,020\n>> Availability, integrity,\none of our pillars.\n\n838\n00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,620\nRight.\nSo, focusing on resource availability, so\n\n839\n00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,305\nhow do we do this?\n\n840\n00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:44,010\nThings like redundant hardware, so having\nmultiples of things, something breaks,\n\n841\n00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,150\nyou have something else.\n\n842\n00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:49,250\nHot swapping, be able to swap in\nsomething like the power supply.\n\n843\n00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,316\nYou know, some like it hot, right?\n\n844\n00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:53,450\n[LAUGH] Some like hot swapping.\n\n845\n00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:56,980\nSo you know a power supply being swapped\nin is not really hot swapping, because you\n\n846\n00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,480\ncan't run the system if the power supply\ngoes bad, so we put two of them in there\n\n847\n00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,120\nto start with, so that if one fails we\nautomatically have spare that's running.\n\n848\n00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,080\nBut hot swapping can be something\nlike hot swapping for memory.\n\n849\n00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,490\nA memory item goes bad.\n\n850\n00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:12,653\nA processor, some of the newer OS's will\nsupport hot swapping on the CPUs and\n\n851\n00:38:12,653 --> 00:38:14,393\nthe memory, things like that.\n\n852\n00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:15,893\nSo there you are,\nthat's what we're talking about there.\n\n853\n00:38:15,893 --> 00:38:20,013\nFault tolerance, so this idea of being\nable to use something that's going to be\n\n854\n00:38:20,013 --> 00:38:24,367\nable to praise survivability if our data\nwere going to be corrupted in some way.\n\n855\n00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:27,765\nWe're gonna go through raid types here in\na minute and talk about fall tolerant and\n\n856\n00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:28,455\nwhat is and is not.\n\n857\n00:38:28,455 --> 00:38:31,185\nAnd then we have this idea in\nmean time between failure,\n\n858\n00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:36,835\nwhat's known as MTBF, and\nthen mean time to repair\n\n859\n00:38:36,835 --> 00:38:40,740\nsometimes talk about as mean\ntime to recover as well MTTR.\n\n860\n00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,250\nSo mean time between failures is driven\nby the vendor, so the vendor is going\n\n861\n00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,480\nto certify their hardware or\ntheir technology with an MTBF rating.\n\n862\n00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,270\nThis is a rating, it's a numerical value,\nusually done in months or years, so\n\n863\n00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:57,940\nyou will see a MTBF of five years\non a Cisco router or something.\n\n864\n00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,930\nThe idea is that on average,\nthat technology is gonna be set up to run\n\n865\n00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:06,520\nusually without a failure or a fault that\nis significant for a five-year period,\n\n866\n00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,490\n60 months, whatever it may be.\n\n867\n00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:12,645\nSo the vendor drives this rating, it's\nnot something we understand as end user\n\n868\n00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:17,185\nconsumers, the vendor tells us, but it's\nan average of the runtime before it fails.\n\n869\n00:39:17,185 --> 00:39:19,400\nThat's what we're talking about there.\n\n870\n00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,370\nAccepted standard, the way we measure,\nlifetime of a particular product.\n\n871\n00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:28,370\nThen MTTR, mean time to repair is gonna be\na measure that we drive, typically, right?\n\n872\n00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,750\nSo if we're supporting it,\nwe can drive that.\n\n873\n00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:34,005\nAnd say we think it's gonna take, or the\nvendor may tell us it takes on average,\n\n874\n00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,462\nthis amount of time to fix this, but\n\n875\n00:39:35,462 --> 00:39:38,780\nit's really the estimate of how long\nit's gonna take to fix something.\n\n876\n00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,690\nAgain, mean meaning average, so\n\n877\n00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,600\nthe average time it will take\nto fix something, right?\n\n878\n00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:47,774\nSo basically, how long it's gonna\ntake to get this device fixed and\n\n879\n00:39:47,774 --> 00:39:50,221\nback up into production,\nis what the MTTR represents.\n\n880\n00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:54,455\nSPOF, single point of failure, right,\nso that's gonna be if we don't have\n\n881\n00:39:54,455 --> 00:39:58,822\nredundancy, then that system that is\nbasically gonna be a single item system,\n\n882\n00:39:58,822 --> 00:40:00,274\nno redundancy involved.\n\n883\n00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:04,475\nNo spare, if you will, then that's\ngonna be our single point of failure.\n\n884\n00:40:04,475 --> 00:40:07,180\nSometimes referred to as the weakest link,\nwhatever that is.\n\n885\n00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,440\nSometimes we'll do that, but\nthe system would know redundancy.\n\n886\n00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,920\nIt's called a single point failure.\n\n887\n00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,080\nAll right, so having said that,\nlet's talk a little bit about raid levels,\n\n888\n00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,170\nraid types.\n\n889\n00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:20,040\nI think we have a little chart for\nour viewers, do we not,\n\n890\n00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,810\nthat you worked hard on\nputting together for us.\n\n891\n00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:23,690\n>> Look at that.\n\n892\n00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,420\n>> All right.\n\n893\n00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,840\nAwesome, awesome.\n\n894\n00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,510\nLook at that.\nSo,\n\n895\n00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,110\nwe have our different RAID levels here.\n\n896\n00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:29,770\nWe wanted to run through them with you.\n\n897\n00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:32,450\nWe're gonna focus on the traditional\nones that we often see.\n\n898\n00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:36,884\nRAID level 0, RAID level 1, RAID level\n1 + duplexing, RAID level 5, and\n\n899\n00:40:36,884 --> 00:40:40,630\nRAID level 1 + zero sometimes\ncalled RAID level 10.\n\n900\n00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:44,430\nWe're not gonna worry about RAID level two\nand three and four and eight and nine and\n\n901\n00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:47,420\nwhatever they're out there, please\nfeel free to investigate on your own.\n\n902\n00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,080\n>> Please do.\n\n903\n00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,890\n>> They're just variations on a theme.\n\n904\n00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,980\n>> Yeah.\n>> You don't see them very often.\n\n905\n00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:55,640\nRAID level six with inner leave is\nnot something you normally see, but\n\n906\n00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,130\nthese are the ones that you most\nlikely are gonna be asked about and\n\n907\n00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:59,770\nreally should know about in production,\nbecause.\n\n908\n00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,720\nYou're probably managing\nthese on a regular basis.\n\n909\n00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,430\nRight?\n\n910\n00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:02,952\n>> Yep.\n>> So,\n\n911\n00:41:02,952 --> 00:41:05,870\nRAID level 0 considered to be data\nstriping with no fault tolerance.\n\n912\n00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,300\nThe idea there is that we have\nwhat's called a stripe set.\n\n913\n00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,800\nWe have a minimum of two, maximum 32\ndrives that can be in the stripe set.\n\n914\n00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,485\nWe basically write the data across\nthe drives in 64 kilobit chunks.\n\n915\n00:41:17,485 --> 00:41:19,715\nIf we lose one of the drives\nin the stripe set,\n\n916\n00:41:19,715 --> 00:41:22,225\nwe have no fault tolerance\nbecause all the data is lost.\n\n917\n00:41:22,225 --> 00:41:23,885\nThe whole step becomes unreadable,\n\n918\n00:41:23,885 --> 00:41:27,390\nbecause we're putting the data\nout in 64 kilobit chunks.\n\n919\n00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,670\nOn every drive in the set.\n\n920\n00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:33,820\nThe key here to remember is that we have\nto have the smallest amount of free space\n\n921\n00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,470\nin the set is what drives\nthe overall size of the set.\n\n922\n00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,980\nSo if we have three drives each\nwith a gigabyte of free space.\n\n923\n00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,550\nWe would have a 3 gig stripe.\n\n924\n00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,910\n1 gig from each drive.\n\n925\n00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,960\nBut if we had 2 drives of 1 gig, and\n\n926\n00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,670\nthen one drive with 4 gig\nof free space available,\n\n927\n00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,865\nwe would still only have a 3 gig stripe,\n>> Gotta have [CROSSTALK] on each drive.\n\n928\n00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:53,609\n>> We can only take the lowest common\ndenominator, as we talked about.\n\n929\n00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:56,050\nAbsolutely correct, so\njust be aware of that.\n\n930\n00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:59,430\nRaid level one is drive mirroring,\nboth drives have to be having,\n\n931\n00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,970\nagain, the same amount of free space.\n\n932\n00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,760\nRight?\nSet up that way.\n\n933\n00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,020\nSo minimum and maximum of two\ndrives when we set up the mirror.\n\n934\n00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,887\nWe write to both drives simultaneously.\n\n935\n00:42:07,887 --> 00:42:10,915\nSo as a result the data shows\nup in two places at once.\n\n936\n00:42:10,915 --> 00:42:12,265\nWe call this a mirrored set.\n\n937\n00:42:12,265 --> 00:42:13,505\nIt is fall tolerant.\n\n938\n00:42:13,505 --> 00:42:15,255\n>> Right.\n>> If one of the drives were to fail\n\n939\n00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:16,855\nthe data survives on the other.\n\n940\n00:42:16,855 --> 00:42:20,495\nThere may be a small delay while we have\nto go in and either physically cable over\n\n941\n00:42:20,495 --> 00:42:24,645\nor logically switch over and break\nthe mirror from the software interface.\n\n942\n00:42:24,645 --> 00:42:25,345\n>> Right.\n>> But having done\n\n943\n00:42:25,345 --> 00:42:28,205\nthat we should be able to get to\nthe data with little to no difficulty.\n\n944\n00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:32,440\nAnd certainly the data will be there and\nbe available for us as soon as we do that.\n\n945\n00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,170\nRAID level 1 + Duplexing.\n\n946\n00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,630\nSo this is dry mirroring.\n\n947\n00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,280\nBut adding an additional\nlayer of fault tolerance\n\n948\n00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,450\nby focusing not on the drives\nthemselves and the data, but\n\n949\n00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:45,180\nthe additional layer of the controllers,\nthe drive controllers.\n\n950\n00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,350\nYeah, because what we often see is\nwe have one controller hard wired,\n\n951\n00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:51,820\ntypically into the motherboard, so we're\naccessing it, maybe cabling up two or\n\n952\n00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,230\nthree drives to it.\n\n953\n00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,760\nAnd as a result, if the controller\nwere to fail, the drives themselves,\n\n954\n00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,310\nthe mirrors themselves are fine, but\n\n955\n00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:01,020\nwe now have to replace the controller\nto get access to data.\n\n956\n00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,050\n>> Exactly.\n>> So, we typically add an external,\n\n957\n00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:05,320\nor another controller off the motherboard.\n\n958\n00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,250\nWe put in a card of some kind,\nor something like that.\n\n959\n00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:11,570\nAnd as a result of that, we add\na controller, cable each drive to one\n\n960\n00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:15,280\ncontroller, or maybe just have them both\nat one, but have a spare sitting there.\n\n961\n00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,270\nAnd either way, we can then.\n\n962\n00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:18,420\nSpin the drives up off\nthe other controller.\n\n963\n00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,145\nSo, RAID 1 + Duplexing is full tolerant.\n\n964\n00:43:21,145 --> 00:43:21,868\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n965\n00:43:21,868 --> 00:43:25,660\n>> RAID level 5, this is gonna be a data\nstripe, so just like RAID level 0, but\n\n966\n00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,100\na data stripe with parody.\n\n967\n00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:27,730\n>> Right.\n>> And so\n\n968\n00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,280\nwe call this a stripe set with parody,\nminimum of 32.\n\n969\n00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,640\nOr excuse me, a minimum of 32,\nthat would be nice.\n\n970\n00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,120\n>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> A minimum of 32,\nmaximum of 3, right?\n\n971\n00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,270\nToday's opposite day, right?\n\n972\n00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,940\nWe're learning how to count backwards.\n\n973\n00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,180\nSo a minimum of three\n>> Uh-huh.\n\n974\n00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,510\n>> Maximum of 32 drives.\n\n975\n00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:46,250\nAnd as a result of that we see a minimum\nof three drives for special reason.\n\n976\n00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:48,175\nWe have a little photo or a little\npicture I think we want to bring up here.\n\n977\n00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:49,430\n>> Mm-hm. We do.\nLet's see if we can grab it real quick.\n\n978\n00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:52,270\n>> So I'm gonna show you a picture of a\nstripe set with parity to illustrate this,\n\n979\n00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:54,890\nbecause we want to make sure\nwe're aware of is the fact that\n\n980\n00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:58,780\nwe need at least three, in this case we\nhave four drives, but at least three so\n\n981\n00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,045\nthat we can create the parity stripe for\neach of the data sets.\n\n982\n00:44:02,045 --> 00:44:02,650\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And as a result,\n\n983\n00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:05,440\nif we lose one,\nwe're then able to recover.\n\n984\n00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,600\nAnd so what we see here,\nwe see A in blue, B is kinda purple,\n\n985\n00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,970\nI think, C is pink, D is orange.\n\n986\n00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,600\nAnd so the idea is that we have on any\none, let's just do A because it's easy,\n\n987\n00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,520\nit's at the top.\n\n988\n00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,450\nWe have A1, A2, A3, right,\nso basically the stripe\n\n989\n00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,170\n>> Is going across like that.\n\n990\n00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:25,660\nAnd what we see is that we have\ndata from three of the four drives.\n\n991\n00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,952\n>> Right.\n>> The fourth drive in this case Disk 3 is\n\n992\n00:44:27,952 --> 00:44:31,057\nthe fourth one has the parity stripe for\nthe A material.\n\n993\n00:44:31,057 --> 00:44:33,050\n>> RIght.\n>> And then we see one, two, three,\n\n994\n00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:38,020\nthe parity stripe is there and so as a\nresult what will happen is if we lose any\n\n995\n00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:42,640\none of these drives, these physical\ndrives, not the logical partition but\n\n996\n00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,840\nthe physical drive\n>> Right.\n\n997\n00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,760\nSo if we want to just erase the lines for\na minute maybe, and take one out.\n\n998\n00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,490\nAnd then just take out one.\n\n999\n00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:50,980\nSo let's take that one out.\n\n1000\n00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,870\nSo what we're missing is effectively A2,\nB2, and D1.\n\n1001\n00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:57,550\nSo now we have, if you notice,\non disk zero A1.\n\n1002\n00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:58,710\nDisk 2 A3.\n\n1003\n00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:01,560\nBut we have the parity\nstripe on disk 3 for A.\n\n1004\n00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,770\nSo we could reproduce A's content, the\nmissing content, from that parity stripe.\n\n1005\n00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:09,640\nWe're missing B2, but you'll notice\nwe have data on disk 0 for B1.\n\n1006\n00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,240\nWe have data on disk 3 for B3.\n\n1007\n00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,700\nOur parody stripe is going to\nbe over there on disk two.\n\n1008\n00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:19,320\nWe could reproduce the content\nfrom B2 with that parody stripe.\n\n1009\n00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,250\nAnd we've lost the parody stripe for C but\n\n1010\n00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:26,620\nthat's okay because we have all three of\nthe data stripe sets available elsewhere.\n\n1011\n00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,390\nAnd we lost the parody stripe for D.\n\n1012\n00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:30,370\nOr excuse me, we didn't lose it.\n\n1013\n00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,500\nWe lost D1.\nSo we have the parody stripe for\n\n1014\n00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,310\nD over there on disk zero to\nbe able to reproduce that.\n\n1015\n00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,360\nSo effectively what would happen is,\n\n1016\n00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,645\nwe would have to physically\nreplace this disk.\n\n1017\n00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:40,670\nMm-hm.\n\n1018\n00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:41,950\n>> Pull it out of rotation.\n\n1019\n00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,500\n>> Right.\n>> Break the stripe set with parity.\n\n1020\n00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:48,260\nSo effect, we pull out the bad drive, put\nin the new drive, reconfigure the drive.\n\n1021\n00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,595\nSo we'd have to basically recognize it,\nput a signature on it, maybe format it.\n\n1022\n00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:53,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Bring it back up through the software\n\n1023\n00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,360\ninterface.\n\n1024\n00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,860\nAnd then effectively have the stripes\nthat would parody, reproduce itself.\n\n1025\n00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,000\n>> Right.\n>> By writing back and\n\n1026\n00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,010\nreading from the parody information\nto repopulate and reset this up.\n\n1027\n00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,980\nNow, the nice thing about this\nis because it's fall tolerant.\n\n1028\n00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,550\nWhile we're doing that, so\n\n1029\n00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:11,570\nwe're gonna kinda have a split\nbrain syndrome going on here.\n\n1030\n00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:16,360\nPerformance is gonna suffer a little bit\non the box cause we're gonna be accessing\n\n1031\n00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,610\nthe parity stripe to be able\nto rewrite the data but\n\n1032\n00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:21,880\nwe're also gonna be accessing to\naccess to actually serve up data.\n\n1033\n00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,320\nSo we're gonna be able to do both.\n\n1034\n00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,210\nAt the same time.\n\n1035\n00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:25,730\nIt will run slower, but\n\n1036\n00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:28,630\nwe are gonna be able to regenerate\nthat stripe set with parody over time.\n\n1037\n00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,480\nSo it's kind of nice.\n\n1038\n00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,020\n>> It is.\n\n1039\n00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,600\nIt's fantastic.\n\n1040\n00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,210\nAnd with RAID 5, our parody is.\n\n1041\n00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,780\nYou can see it's kind of spread\nout across all the drives.\n\n1042\n00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:37,930\nSo it's not all isolated\non a single drive.\n\n1043\n00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:39,190\n>> Correct.\nCause if we lost that drive,\n\n1044\n00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:40,010\nthen obviously we would be.\n\n1045\n00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:40,720\n>> Which I think, what was it?\n\n1046\n00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,090\nRaid 4 If I remember right.\n\n1047\n00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,220\nHad it all on the same drive.\n\n1048\n00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,990\n>> And then if you lost it,\nyou lost everything.\n\n1049\n00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:45,510\n>> Yeah.\n\n1050\n00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:46,340\nSo that's bad.\n\n1051\n00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,240\nAll right.\nSo we have that.\n\n1052\n00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,855\nSo, yeah, we just wanted to make\nsure we threw that up there for you.\n\n1053\n00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,610\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> See here, let's just go back there.\n\n1054\n00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:53,440\nSo these are the RAID types, right?\n\n1055\n00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,645\nSo we have them on our chart.\n\n1056\n00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,781\n>> [CROSSTALK] Where'd I do?\n\n1057\n00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,310\n>> Yeah, so\nwe've got them right there, right.\n\n1058\n00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:03,613\nSo RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 1 with Duplexing,\nRAID 5 and RAID 1+0.\n\n1059\n00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:04,343\nRight?\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1060\n00:47:04,343 --> 00:47:08,170\n>> So, think we'll try to make sure\nwe have that available for you or\n\n1061\n00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:09,500\nsomehow capture\n>> Yup, absolutely,\n\n1062\n00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,720\nI think we're dumping them\nup there with the episode.\n\n1063\n00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,530\n>> I think we're gonna put some\nof that up there absolutely.\n\n1064\n00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,070\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1065\n00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:20,835\nAll right so let's see what else\nwe have on our listen there,\n\n1066\n00:47:20,835 --> 00:47:25,808\nso just some terms, MAID and\nRATE, massive array,\n\n1067\n00:47:25,808 --> 00:47:31,790\nMAID is a massive array of [COUGH]\nwhat am I thinking [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1068\n00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:34,090\nI keep thinking inexpensive in my head.\n\n1069\n00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,010\nMassive array of inactive disks.\n\n1070\n00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:39,210\nAnd the idea is basically, we just have\na large storage ray just sitting out there\n\n1071\n00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,450\nthat could be spun up\nif we need to use it.\n\n1072\n00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:44,680\nFor you know something,\nrates will be a redundant array,\n\n1073\n00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,350\nredundant array of inexpensive tape.\n\n1074\n00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:51,390\nThis is basically creating a, excuse me\nan independent tape, not inexpensive.\n\n1075\n00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:53,565\nI keep having inexpensive on the brain.\n\n1076\n00:47:53,565 --> 00:47:57,658\nSo a redundant array of independent tape,\nthis is going to be using a tape library\n\n1077\n00:47:57,658 --> 00:48:00,019\nto basically create that storage away for\nus.\n\n1078\n00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:02,161\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> A SAM storage-area network,\n\n1079\n00:48:02,161 --> 00:48:06,680\nthis is going to be a large Network-wide\nstorage solution that will be available,\n\n1080\n00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,020\ntypically clustered storage, very,\nvery expensive on the back end.\n\n1081\n00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,270\nUsed for virtual infrastructure\ntoday to high-end storage.\n\n1082\n00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:17,580\nNAS, Network Attached Storage,\nis gonna be a little bit less expensive.\n\n1083\n00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,150\nIt's gonna be a device, typically.\n\n1084\n00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:23,290\nSo you're gonna have maybe\na NetApp device, or a Drobo, or\n\n1085\n00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:24,400\nsomething like that-\n>> Buffalo.\n\n1086\n00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,650\n>> Where you're gonna put that out there.\n\n1087\n00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,090\nBuffalo, right is another good one.\n\n1088\n00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:29,640\nWhere you just have a large\namount of disks in a box and\n\n1089\n00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,380\neffectively connected up on the network.\n\n1090\n00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,400\nBut it's not gonna be anywhere near as\nfancy and anywhere near as capable.\n\n1091\n00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,840\n>> Smaller enterprises.\n\n1092\n00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,000\nThis small-\n>> With a.\n\n1093\n00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,350\nWith an S.\n\n1094\n00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:42,310\n>> Yeah, SoHo, a, help me out here.\n\n1095\n00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:44,830\n>> SoHo-\n>> Yeah, small office, home office.\n\n1096\n00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:45,930\nThank you.\n\n1097\n00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:48,080\nMy storage capacity is\nstarting to develop a leak.\n\n1098\n00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,950\nIt's flipping outside of my head here.\n\n1099\n00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:50,760\nSo, yeah, something like that.\n\n1100\n00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:52,677\nYou will see that typically\nreferred to in NASA,\n\n1101\n00:48:52,677 --> 00:48:54,937\nactually it's more often than\nnot the poor man's sand.\n\n1102\n00:48:54,937 --> 00:48:57,370\n>> The poor man's sand,\nthe entry level small business kind of-\n\n1103\n00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,460\n>> You say sands are kind of expensive-\n\n1104\n00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:01,080\n>> I mean really expensive.\n\n1105\n00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:02,720\n>> Oh seven figures to do a decent one.\n\n1106\n00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,170\n>> Yes. Yes. >> For a high end\none you could easily spend six or\n\n1107\n00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:06,980\nseven figures without batting an eyelash.\n\n1108\n00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:07,990\n>> Oh yeah, easily.\n\n1109\n00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,770\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1110\n00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,750\n>> All right.\nSo clustering this idea of just being able\n\n1111\n00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,910\nto go ahead and you know,\nthrow together a large amount of storage.\n\n1112\n00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,180\nTypically some sort of\nvirtualized front end.\n\n1113\n00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:21,870\nWhat we call a quorum, a common front\nend that we access the storage through.\n\n1114\n00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:24,040\nAnd then it was so good we named it twice.\n\n1115\n00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,850\nAnd so then we have just a large amount of\nstorage on the back end that is shared,\n\n1116\n00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:31,680\npooled storage is what\nclustering is all about and\n\n1117\n00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,735\nthat's what we use\na clustered solution for.\n\n1118\n00:49:33,735 --> 00:49:37,315\nSo we may see something where\nwe're clustering a male server.\n\n1119\n00:49:37,315 --> 00:49:38,840\nWe're clustering a database.\n\n1120\n00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,025\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> These are traditional\n\n1121\n00:49:40,025 --> 00:49:41,535\nusage cases for this.\n\n1122\n00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:46,955\nGrid computing, where we're gonna bring\nlots of individual computers together.\n\n1123\n00:49:46,955 --> 00:49:49,025\nKind of form a more, you know,\n\n1124\n00:49:50,045 --> 00:49:54,640\npowerful solution than the individual\nlittle computers on their own.\n\n1125\n00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,790\nSo this is going to be something\nthat is greater, more powerful,\n\n1126\n00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,790\nthan the parts individually.\n\n1127\n00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:03,220\nSo great computing is all the rage\nthe last couple of years.\n\n1128\n00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,165\nOne example would be something like\nthe Seti Project, for the search for\n\n1129\n00:50:06,165 --> 00:50:10,410\nextra-terrestrial life or intelligence\nis using great computing to go out and\n\n1130\n00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,420\nput a little application\non everybody's desktop.\n\n1131\n00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,343\n>> Right.\n>> Very down cycles on their computer.\n\n1132\n00:50:14,343 --> 00:50:17,264\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Can effectively run that and use that,\n\n1133\n00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,160\nso that's something to consider.\n\n1134\n00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:26,331\n>> I saw a university doing something\nlike that with PlayStations a while ago.\n\n1135\n00:50:26,331 --> 00:50:29,215\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I think one of the evil geniuses in one\n\n1136\n00:50:29,215 --> 00:50:32,690\nof the sci-fi movies did that\nas well to take over the world.\n\n1137\n00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:36,650\nPinky and the Brain episode,\nor something like that.\n\n1138\n00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,090\nThat was another good one,\nPinky and the Brain.\n\n1139\n00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:39,890\nRemember Pinky and the Brain?\n\n1140\n00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,500\nAnd what are we going to do today, Pinky?\n\n1141\n00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,130\nTake over the world!\n\n1142\n00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,100\n>> Same

00:50:54,350\nwe want to just quickly throw out the idea\nhere of protocols and architecture.\n\n1146\n00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:56,451\nI use that just as framing language for\nus.\n\n1147\n00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:58,100\nWe're talking about protocols.\n\n1148\n00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:58,850\nWe'll tell you about MIME.\n\n1149\n00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:01,985\nThis idea of just\nunderstanding an architecture,\n\n1150\n00:51:01,985 --> 00:51:03,750\nS-MIME, Secure MIME, and MIME.\n\n1151\n00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:07,640\nJust tell you about the standards that\ngovern how we send and receive

just exactly.\n\n1162\n00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,070\nSo, just want to remind you of that,\nthat's just what we are talking about.\n\n1163\n00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:31,800\nWe talked about protocols and\narchitectures here,\n\n1164\n00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,348\njust thinking about that with email.\n\n1165\n00:51:33,348 --> 00:51:33,916\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1166\n00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:36,050\n>> All

and\nwhy they might be important to us.\n\n1171\n00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:51,560\nSo session hijacking, we're gonna go out\nand we're going to simply take over and\n\n1172\n00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:56,490\ntry to execute a session hijack by taking\nover somebody's session live in real time.\n\n1173\n00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:59,630\nTry to redirect it and\nperhaps gain control of it.\n\n1174\n00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:01,670\nSo that's one thing that\nwe want to think about.\n\n1175\n00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:04,930\nThe other idea there would be that we\nhave, and we have a whole list of them\n\n1176\n00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:09,454\nof course, LOKI, not just [INAUDIBLE]\nbrother in the movies as of late.\n\n1177\n00:52:09,454 --> 00:52:12,680\nBut this actually was\na tool that was created for\n\n1178\n00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,300\nmanipulation of TCP header data.\n\n1179\n00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:20,870\nAnd I know you were an enterprising young\nsoul who went out and downloaded the tool,\n\n1180\n00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:25,060\ndisregarding the safety and\nyour personal welfare to your machine.\n\n1181\n00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,770\nAnd so Mike was kind enough to go out and\ndownload the Loki too.\n\n1182\n00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:30,000\nIt's still available out there.\n\n1183\n00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,110\nAnd what Loki does as an attack vector.\n\n1184\n00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:33,560\nYou may never have seen this by the way.\n\n1185\n00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,780\nWe talk about this in hacking classes and\nshow you how to do some of this.\n\n1186\n00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,310\nBut you may not have seen this.\n\n1187\n00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:41,630\nIf you're a CIISP person that\ndoesn't do this kind of stuff.\n\n1188\n00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:45,330\nThe idea behind this attack is we could\ntake the unused space in the TCP headers,\n\n1189\n00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:47,480\nand manipulate the data there right,\n\n1190\n00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,990\nattack fragmented attack packet\ndata into those headers.\n\n1191\n00:52:51,990 --> 00:52:56,350\nAnd then pass it through by bundling it\nwith this tool in such a way that we then\n\n1192\n00:52:56,350 --> 00:53:00,150\ncan reassemble the attack packets on the\nother side, and then take down systems.\n\n1193\n00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,630\nIt's called a Loki Attack.\n\n1194\n00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:03,970\nAll right.\nSo, this is the tool that's used for it.\n\n1195\n00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:05,440\nSo you could actually go out and find it,\n\n1196\n00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,498\nif you just do a quick Google search for\nLoki Tool.\n\n1197\n00:53:08,498 --> 00:53:10,960\n>> And my anti-virus didn't get set off,\nso, and it did not.\n\n1198\n00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,310\n>> I have a good source this time.\n\n1199\n00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:14,950\n>> You got the digitally\nsigned in half version, right.\n\n1200\n00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:18,110\nSo you do need WIN P Cap for that just so\nyou know, as Mike found out.\n\n1201\n00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:20,120\n>> Yes.\n>> Win P Cap will be the promiscuous mode\n\n1202\n00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,770\ndriver that's been poured over from\nLinux to be able to let you run that.\n\n1203\n00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:24,800\n>> Lets you [CROSSTALK]\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1204\n00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,410\nRight.\n\n1205\n00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:28,710\nSo password cracking, going in and\ntrying to break passwords.\n\n1206\n00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,500\nThings like Loft Crack is\na good example of that.\n\n1207\n00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,210\n>> My favorites.\n\n1208\n00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,780\nRight, one of the big one's there.\n\n1209\n00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:37,480\nBackdoor is this idea of putting in\nmalware that opens up remote access\n\n1210\n00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,090\nand let's us in.\n\n1211\n00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,890\nWe sometimes call those RATS,\nremote access trojans.\n\n1212\n00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:42,130\n>> Right.\n>> Denial of service or\n\n1213\n00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:43,558\ndistributed denial of service.\n\n1214\n00:53:43,558 --> 00:53:47,335\nDenial of service at attacking its\none endpoint from just one machine.\n\n1215\n00:53:47,335 --> 00:53:49,430\nKind of a one to one\ntrying to take that down.\n\n1216\n00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:51,365\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Distributed denial of service,\n\n1217\n00:53:51,365 --> 00:53:53,985\nmultiple machines against\na single endpoint.\n\n1218\n00:53:53,985 --> 00:53:56,415\nSo this would be like a bot army or\na botnet or\n\n1219\n00:53:56,415 --> 00:53:59,850\nzombies trying to attack you,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1220\n00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:00,710\nMan in the middle.\n\n1221\n00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:04,570\nThis is where we are effectively going\nto get in between the center and\n\n1222\n00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:06,350\nthe receiver communication stream.\n\n1223\n00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:08,700\nTry to take that data perhaps,\nexamine it and\n\n1224\n00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,660\nsomeway modify it and\nthen send it back on the wire.\n\n1225\n00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,700\nSo that's what we're often\ntalking about there.\n\n1226\n00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,910\nIf you remember when we\ntalked about cryptography.\n\n1227\n00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:21,040\nAnd we talked about diffie helman\nas a key exchange protocol.\n\n1228\n00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,760\nThat we said diffie helman in\nit's native format implemented,\n\n1229\n00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,000\ntraditionally, Is potentially susceptible\nto man in the middle attacks.\n\n1230\n00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,840\n>> Yes.\n>> But we also talk about the fact that,\n\n1231\n00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,150\nbecause we know that,\nwe integrate that into our systems and\n\n1232\n00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:36,240\nour thought process by using a additional\nsupporting elements that offset that.\n\n1233\n00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,620\nSo we secure the system and we know that.\n\n1234\n00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,490\nBut in and\nof itself if diffie helman on its own,\n\n1235\n00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,530\nit's susceptible to man in\nthe middle as it is in the example.\n\n1236\n00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:43,600\nExample.\nRight?\n\n1237\n00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,520\nMail bombing.\n\n1238\n00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,770\nRight?\nOr photo bombing today,\n\n1239\n00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:48,100\nif you may see the more\nrecent version of that.\n\n1240\n00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,170\nBut the idea with mail bombing is\nbasically trying to take down a mail\n\n1241\n00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:51,770\nsystem by flooding it with spam.\n\n1242\n00:54:51,770 --> 00:54:53,270\nRight?\nThat kind of thing.\n\n1243\n00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:54,610\nWar dialing.\n\n1244\n00:54:54,610 --> 00:54:56,413\nThe idea of being able to go out, and\n\n1245\n00:54:56,413 --> 00:55:00,555\nuse that old-fashioned networking\ntool of death, the modem.\n\n1246\n00:55:00,555 --> 00:55:02,795\nAnd be able to go out and\n\n1247\n00:55:02,795 --> 00:55:05,995\ntry to hack into phone systems by\nfinding open modem connections.\n\n1248\n00:55:05,995 --> 00:55:08,530\nWe don't really think about\nthat much any more today.\n\n1249\n00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:11,864\nBut it is an old school approach I want\nto make sure you're aware of it there.\n\n1250\n00:55:11,864 --> 00:55:13,420\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> So the ping of death, right?\n\n1251\n00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,010\nThis is where we can go in and\npotentially and\n\n1252\n00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:17,610\ntry to use malform ping\npackets to be able to\n\n1253\n00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:21,890\ntake down a machine through a distributed\ndenial service or denial service attack.\n\n1254\n00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:26,030\nFocusing a bunch of ICMP packets.\n\n1255\n00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:27,890\nThey're oversized packets.\n\n1256\n00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:31,730\nAnd as a result, the old Windows\nnetworking stack didn't know how to deal\n\n1257\n00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:32,940\nwith the oversized packets.\n\n1258\n00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,870\n>> Yeah it choked and this it, yeah.\n\n1259\n00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:35,570\n>> Just lock up and die.\n\n1260\n00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,250\nSo that would've been one of\nthe things we would see there, but\n\n1261\n00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,310\nthat was back in the Win 9x days.\n\n1262\n00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:39,910\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1263\n00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:41,210\n>> Maybe NT 4 workstation.\n\n1264\n00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:44,160\nBy the time we got into things\nbeing a little more modern,\n\n1265\n00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,060\nwe didn't really see ping of death\nbeing all that big of a deal.\n\n1266\n00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,210\nIt was patched for that.\n\n1267\n00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:49,180\nBut Win Nuke was another example\nof an attack back in the day.\n\n1268\n00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,210\n>> Yeah.\nI remember that one, yeah.\n\n1269\n00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:50,970\nRight?\n\n1270\n00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:52,230\n>> Duke Nukem, remember that one?\n\n1271\n00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:53,190\nThat was another good one.\n\n1272\n00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,740\n>> Absolutely, it was.\n\n1273\n00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:55,820\n>> So we have that, right?\n\n1274\n00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:57,980\nYes, the good old days.\n\n1275\n00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,648\nWe should ponder for just a moment.\n\n1276\n00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:00,952\nReminiscing.\n\n1277\n00:56:00,952 --> 00:56:05,992\nTeardrop attacks, this is where we\nuse malformed, fragment packets.\n\n1278\n00:56:05,992 --> 00:56:10,652\nSo we basically Throw malform\nfragmentation packets at the attackee,\n\n1279\n00:56:10,652 --> 00:56:12,680\ntrying to knock them off line.\n\n1280\n00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,530\nWe could talk about things like smurf and\nfraggle attacks.\n\n1281\n00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:17,340\nThey would also potentially\ncome in to play.\n\n1282\n00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,340\nWe talked about those in prior episodes.\n\n1283\n00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,420\nFake log on screens and\nthis is always a good one.\n\n1284\n00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,500\nWalk up to a machine,\nit's got the log on screen, right?\n\n1285\n00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,011\nYou don't know what it is, try to log in,\ncan't get in for some reason.\n\n1286\n00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:28,550\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> What do most people do?\n\n1287\n00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:29,467\n>> They try it again.\n\n1288\n00:56:29,467 --> 00:56:30,034\n>> They try it again.\n\n1289\n00:56:30,034 --> 00:56:31,130\nMaybe, I didn't put my\npassword in the right way.\n\n1290\n00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,780\n>> The first time didn't work,\nI'm sure it will work the second time.\n\n1291\n00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,110\n>> Absolutely, so we've got this,\n\n1292\n00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:37,460\nprobably a key stroke logger\nrunning on the back end.\n\n1293\n00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,340\n>> Yes, yes.\n>> And as a result,\n\n1294\n00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,760\nwe capture that information.\n\n1295\n00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,795\nYou know, this happens a lot at ATMs and\n\n1296\n00:56:41,795 --> 00:56:44,890\nat gas stations with card readers\nthat are being put in now.\n\n1297\n00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:49,700\nIt's kind of a modern-day take on fake\nlogin screens, but it's been all the rage.\n\n1298\n00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,091\nAlso what's happening you know,\nin places like and\n\n1299\n00:56:51,091 --> 00:56:55,020\nthese places where they have\nthe fake ATM Readers for the cards.\n\n1300\n00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,260\nAnd as a result, they were skimming.\n\n1301\n00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:57,200\nWe call it card skimming.\n\n1302\n00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:57,900\nThey were skimming.\n\n1303\n00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:00,860\nAnd they were skimming the cards\nreading the magnetic stripes\n\n1304\n00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,820\non the cards getting\nthe access information.\n\n1305\n00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,940\nYou punched in your pin.\n\n1306\n00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,680\nThey got your account\nnumber plus your pin.\n\n1307\n00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,520\nAnd then they come by, end of day,\nthey pull the reader out.\n\n1308\n00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,090\n>> Yep.\n>> It's self-contained.\n\n1309\n00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:12,810\n>> Yeah.\n>> So, nobody knows it's there.\n\n1310\n00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:16,030\nHas all the information stored in\na little USB device attached to it.\n\n1311\n00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,310\nAnd as a result, they basically,\nnow, have your account number.\n\n1312\n00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:18,850\n>> Yep.\n>> Your pin.\n\n1313\n00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,100\n>> And the pin that goes with it.\n\n1314\n00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,220\n>> And your money that goes with it.\n\n1315\n00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,180\nExactly.\nSo, they're on their way to the bank, and\n\n1316\n00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:23,790\nthey're right there.\n\n1317\n00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:24,880\n>> Look for that piece of tape.\n\n1318\n00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,430\nMake sure that door has not been opened.\n\n1319\n00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:27,405\n[LAUGH]\n>> Well, that kind of stuff,\n\n1320\n00:57:27,405 --> 00:57:31,560\nand/or when you do it, a lot of times,\nI see people doing this, which is great,\n\n1321\n00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,800\ncuz I'm behind somebody in the bank or\nwhatever, and I watch sometimes where I'm\n\n1322\n00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,990\nstanding behind somebody\n>> And the people that know,\n\n1323\n00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:38,530\nyou walk up to the ATM.\n\n1324\n00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,490\nYou don't wanna break it, of course.\n\n1325\n00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:43,630\nBut before you put your card in there,\ngive it a little tug on the reader to\n\n1326\n00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,530\nmake sure that's not gonna\npop out in your hand.\n\n1327\n00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,000\nSo if it pops out in your hand,\nguess what?\n\n1328\n00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:47,790\n>> Something ain't right.\n\n1329\n00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:48,908\n>> It doesn't belong to the bank.\n\n1330\n00:57:48,908 --> 00:57:51,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> It belongs to somebody else.\n\n1331\n00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:53,460\nAnd now,\nthey're not coming back to get it, right?\n\n1332\n00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,520\nBut you didn't break the ATM,\nrest assured.\n\n1333\n00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,480\nYou actually did the bank a favor,\ncuz they didn't realize.\n\n1334\n00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,200\nSame thing when you go to a gas station.\n\n1335\n00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,060\nBefore you put your card in there,\nwe often do think about it and\n\n1336\n00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:01,850\njust stick it in.\n\n1337\n00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:04,480\nGive it a little tug,\nyou're not gonna break it, I promise you.\n\n1338\n00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,260\nThose things are soldered in place.\n\n1339\n00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,390\nThey're not coming out.\n\n1340\n00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:09,740\nBut if the overlay one,\nthe skimmer is there.\n\n1341\n00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,400\nIt's gonna pop right out in your hands.\n\n1342\n00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,155\nYeah, I won the lottery, right.\n\n1343\n00:58:14,155 --> 00:58:15,910\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You won the security camera, right.\n\n1344\n00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,140\nBack away from the machine.\n\n1345\n00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:20,520\n>> They think it's yours and\nyou were trying to retrieve it, but hey.\n\n1346\n00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:22,810\n>> Sir, put your arms in the air,\nback away slowly.\n\n1347\n00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:23,710\n>> Right.\n\n1348\n00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:24,930\n>> Don't make any sudden movements.\n\n1349\n00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:25,640\nWe have you on camera.\n\n1350\n00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,840\nRight?\nYou know, but\n\n1351\n00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,160\nthis is the kind of thing\nyou want to be aware of.\n\n1352\n00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,750\nRight.\nSecurity awareness is very important.\n\n1353\n00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,030\nSo, just be aware of that.\n\n1354\n00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:31,960\nTraffic analysis.\n\n1355\n00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,650\nI know that we have something\nthat we've put up here.\n\n1356\n00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:35,860\nGot the Shark emblem.\n\n1357\n00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:38,060\nI love seeing that on\nthe task bar down there.\n\n1358\n00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,860\n>> I do too.\n>> Got our Wire Shark running.\n\n1359\n00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,850\n>> They even changed their play\nbuttons to be little shark fins.\n\n1360\n00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:42,440\n>> I know they did.\n\n1361\n00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:44,700\nBack in the day before it was Ethereal,\nright?\n\n1362\n00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,060\nThe good old days.\n\n1363\n00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:49,340\nSo this is a rebranded,\nreconstituted tool.\n\n1364\n00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,140\nUse to be Ethereal, which was a wireless\nscanner and a network scanner.\n\n1365\n00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,500\nCould be doing both in theory.\n\n1366\n00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,675\nAlthough, we have other wireless ones\nlike Cain and Abel, and and all that.\n\n1367\n00:58:57,675 --> 00:58:59,485\nBut you know, this is or was Ethereal.\n\n1368\n00:58:59,485 --> 00:59:00,725\nAnd it's been updated.\n\n1369\n00:59:00,725 --> 00:59:02,985\nIt's now called Wireshark\nin the Windows world.\n\n1370\n00:59:02,985 --> 00:59:06,895\nSo Mike is running this, just be able to\ndo a quick network traffic capture, and\n\n1371\n00:59:06,895 --> 00:59:07,925\ndo some analysis for us.\n\n1372\n00:59:07,925 --> 00:59:09,300\nSo we got some packets there.\n\n1373\n00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:13,420\nI don't think we have to go through all\nthe trouble of actually going in and.\n\n1374\n00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:15,680\n>> Yeah, show it to them live so\nwe can see it scrolling.\n\n1375\n00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,440\nThe idea is we are getting network\ntraffic in real time here.\n\n1376\n00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,840\nSo we're streaming out to you.\n\n1377\n00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,160\nAnd you're seeing network traffic\nhappening in real time or being captured.\n\n1378\n00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:25,790\nSo the idea is,\nthese packets are streaming though.\n\n1379\n00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:27,310\nAnd you know, in an interface like this,\n\n1380\n00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:31,510\nwe can go in and we actually can pull\nan individual packet, look at the length.\n\n1381\n00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:33,000\nWe can look at the structure\nof the packet.\n\n1382\n00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,650\nThat's an ethernet packet right there.\n\n1383\n00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:35,660\nWe can see that.\n\n1384\n00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:36,680\nWe can see the delta.\n\n1385\n00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,960\nThe time deltas from previous capture.\n\n1386\n00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,760\nWe can see the frame IDs.\n\n1387\n00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,004\nWe can see the frame length.\n\n1388\n00:59:42,004 --> 00:59:42,780\n>> [INAUDIBLE].\n\n1389\n00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:47,460\n>> We can go in and\nwe can find the flag offsets there.\n\n1390\n00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,360\nIf we're looking at that, we can\nactually look at the Mac address and\n\n1391\n00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,320\nthe IP address and\nwe can all see sorts of information.\n\n1392\n00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,780\nThere's an IPv4 packet\nthere as we can see.\n\n1393\n00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:59,620\nAnd we can see the source IP,\nthe destination IP.\n\n1394\n00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,330\nWe can look at the TTL.\n\n1395\n01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:02,510\nIt's got a 128 TTL.\n\n1396\n01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:05,430\nIt looks like a fragment offset of zero.\n\n1397\n01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:07,020\nRight?\nSo it looks like it's not fragmenting.\n\n1398\n01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,821\nSo flag value set to 020x02\nwhich is still fragment.\n\n1399\n01:00:10,821 --> 01:00:12,100\n>> Right.\n>> So we can see a lot of\n\n1400\n01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:12,970\ninformation in there.\n\n1401\n01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:14,510\n>> Oh yeah.\n>> By looking at this in real time.\n\n1402\n01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,680\nSo these obviously\nare very valuable tools.\n\n1403\n01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,910\nAgain, in some of those other programs,\n\n1404\n01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:21,658\nsome of the other episodes you may\nwant to take a look at other areas.\n\n1405\n01:00:21,658 --> 01:00:24,330\nI'm sure network plus is doing\na good job looking at some of this.\n\n1406\n01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:27,250\nSecurity plus would also be\na good place to look at this and\n\n1407\n01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,560\ngo a little bit deeper.\n\n1408\n01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:32,020\nAnd some of the other content that we\nhave available for you would be good.\n\n1409\n01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:35,290\nYou can find this kind of\nstuff anywhere you look.\n\n1410\n01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:38,330\nAnd in CISSP,\nyou should really be thinking about\n\n1411\n01:00:38,330 --> 01:00:41,000\nrunning this kind of technology,\nhaving it run to your networks.\n\n1412\n01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,130\nCapturing these packets, looking at them.\n\n1413\n01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:43,050\n>> See what's going on.\n\n1414\n01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:43,820\n>> See what's going on them.\n\n1415\n01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:44,520\n>> This is the only way you're\n\n1416\n01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,020\nreally gonna see what's going\non on that network, right?\n\n1417\n01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:46,880\nDown at the packet levels.\n\n1418\n01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:47,810\n>> Absolutely, absolutely.\n\n1419\n01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:48,790\nSo wanna know that as well.\n\n1420\n01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:50,180\nSo this is actually a really cool demo.\n\n1421\n01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,510\nI'm glad you thought to bring this up.\n\n1422\n01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:53,870\nAnd give credit where credit's due,\nbecause we talked about this.\n\n1423\n01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:55,316\nAnd Mike said, oh wait,\nquick, let me go out and.\n\n1424\n01:00:55,316 --> 01:00:59,700\nPut up you know, put a wire before I\neven knew what was happening there.\n\n1425\n01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:00,240\n>> It's tough.\n\n1426\n01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,110\n>> Yeah it is.\n\n1427\n01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:02,140\nIt's tough being perfect.\n\n1428\n01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,212\nI know.\nI understand.\n\n1429\n01:01:03,212 --> 01:01:04,200\nSlamming.\n\n1430\n01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,360\nLet's finish up our tag types here.\n\n1431\n01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,820\nSo this is an oldie but a goodie.\n\n1432\n01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,390\nThis is one we don't really hear\nabout in this form anymore, but\n\n1433\n01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:14,780\nthis is prevalent maybe ten years ago.\n\n1434\n01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,755\nRight?\nBack around 2000ish.\n\n1435\n01:01:16,755 --> 01:01:18,530\n2003, 2004, 2005.\n\n1436\n01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:22,400\nWhere phone companies were\nbattling it out for customers.\n\n1437\n01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:24,400\nAnd so\nthey were stealing each other's customers.\n\n1438\n01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:27,060\nAnd the idea was that they would\ntake you and they would basically,\n\n1439\n01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:28,810\nswitch you from one carrier to another.\n\n1440\n01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:30,320\n>> Right.\n>> Slamming you is what we used to\n\n1441\n01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,750\ncall it, without telling you.\n\n1442\n01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,560\nAnd so you would go for\na month and not know.\n\n1443\n01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:34,290\n>> Exactly.\n>> And\n\n1444\n01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,750\nthen you wouldn't realize\nyou were switched.\n\n1445\n01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,470\nYou get this massive bill.\n\n1446\n01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:40,160\nCell carriers were doing this as well for\na while.\n\n1447\n01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:40,880\nCell phone carriers.\nWe passed\n\n1448\n01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,040\nlaws in the United States\nto make this illegal.\n\n1449\n01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,070\nSo it really just stopped\nat a certain point.\n\n1450\n01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,320\nIt doesn't happen anymore.\n\n1451\n01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,905\nBut it used to be a big issue.\n\n1452\n01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:49,365\nAnd so being switched you know,\n\n1453\n01:01:49,365 --> 01:01:53,465\neither an ISP switching, network\nproviders, switching phone providers,\n\n1454\n01:01:53,465 --> 01:01:57,145\nwhatever it was, would be generically\nconsidered to be slamming and cramming.\n\n1455\n01:01:57,145 --> 01:01:59,885\nWhere you were changing a user provider or\na service provider,\n\n1456\n01:01:59,885 --> 01:02:01,047\nan underlying service provider.\n\n1457\n01:02:01,047 --> 01:02:05,830\nAll right, so I think probably a good\npoint, excuse me, good place for\n\n1458\n01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:07,480\nus to take a small break.\n\n1459\n01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,940\n>> All right.\n>> We do have some stuff when we come back\n\n1460\n01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,630\nthat we're gonna wanna finish out with.\n\n1461\n01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:13,940\nSome vulnerability testing,\nsome pen testing, a couple other odds and\n\n1462\n01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,920\nends we wanna make sure we come back and\ndiscuss.\n\n1463\n01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,589\nSo, we'll take a small break,\nwe'll see you in just a few.\n\n1464\n01:02:17,589 --> 01:02:18,809\n>> Sounds good.\n\n1465\n01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:26,402\n>> [MUSIC]\n\n1466\n01:02:26,402 --> 01:02:26,990\nAll right.\n\n1467\n01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:30,040\nWelcome back, everybody to our\noperational security episode.\n\n1468\n01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:32,020\nWe're gonna wrap things up today, I think,\n\n1469\n01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:35,600\nwith some different types of testing and-\n>> Okay.\n\n1470\n01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:39,930\n>> Ways that we can go in and\n>> Check and work out,\n\n1471\n01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:40,850\nsee what's going on.\n\n1472\n01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:43,732\n>> All right, since Mike says\nwe're gonna wrap up, that's.\n\n1473\n01:02:43,732 --> 01:02:44,590\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We don't have a choice.\n\n1474\n01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:46,590\nEven if we can't fit it all in,\nwe're done.\n\n1475\n01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:49,660\n>> Well, I suppose, if we can't\nfit it all in then we can go on.\n\n1476\n01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:52,005\n>> So we will be\n>> Be true to form, that we will.\n\n1477\n01:02:52,005 --> 01:02:55,215\nBut let's talk about what we\nhave to still go over here.\n\n1478\n01:02:55,215 --> 01:02:57,295\nSo, we left off talking\nabout some attack types.\n\n1479\n01:02:57,295 --> 01:02:59,595\n>> Right.\n>> And what we wanted to do was finish\n\n1480\n01:02:59,595 --> 01:03:02,345\nthe conversation around\noperational security.\n\n1481\n01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:06,095\nAnd so, we've done hopefully a decent job\nof walking through a lot of different\n\n1482\n01:03:06,095 --> 01:03:08,005\nattacks you may see in the.\n\n1483\n01:03:08,005 --> 01:03:11,175\nBut we didn't really get a chance to talk\nabout how you then can actually tell\n\n1484\n01:03:11,175 --> 01:03:12,255\nthat they're happening, right?\n\n1485\n01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:13,925\nAnd so, are you aware of them?\n\n1486\n01:03:13,925 --> 01:03:14,645\nWhat's that mean?\n\n1487\n01:03:14,645 --> 01:03:16,410\nSo, vulnerability and pen testing,\n\n1488\n01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:18,560\nreally two areas I wanna spend\na little bit of time on.\n\n1489\n01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,620\nYou know,\nwe talked about vulnerability testing.\n\n1490\n01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:26,030\nWe talked about risk and risk management\nearly on in some of our other episodes.\n\n1491\n01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:29,490\nWe have spoken about\nthis idea of going in and\n\n1492\n01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:33,200\nreally looking at the potential threat and\nrisk that's associated with\n\n1493\n01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,610\nsome sort of a configuration,\nsome sort of unknown exploit.\n\n1494\n01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:38,960\nSo this is idea of you know,\nthe potential and\n\n1495\n01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,600\nrisk or\nthreat associated with doing something.\n\n1496\n01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:45,570\nAnd as a result, you know,\nwe call that a vulnerability.\n\n1497\n01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:46,610\nAnd so then, you know,\n\n1498\n01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:49,900\nhow likely is it that the vulnerability\nwill become an issue?\n\n1499\n01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,440\nSo we want to think about those things.\n\n1500\n01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:55,343\nAnd we do understand that or put that in\nthe terminology of vulnerability testing.\n\n1501\n01:03:55,343 --> 01:03:59,704\nAnd so the framework that allows us to\nunderstand this is to really look at and\n\n1502\n01:03:59,704 --> 01:04:02,924\nevaluate modern configurations\nlook at patch levels.\n\n1503\n01:04:02,924 --> 01:04:05,162\nLook at hardware configurations.\n\n1504\n01:04:05,162 --> 01:04:06,033\nAny of those things.\n\n1505\n01:04:06,033 --> 01:04:09,630\nWant to evaluate them against\nknown issues that are out there.\n\n1506\n01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:13,340\nAnd then take remediative, punitive\naction that will allow us to go in and\n\n1507\n01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:15,240\npatch or to reconfigure on the fly,\n\n1508\n01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,720\nin order to be able to then address\nconcerns that we find, right?\n\n1509\n01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,450\nAnd so some are gonna be\nmore important than others.\n\n1510\n01:04:21,450 --> 01:04:22,300\nRight?\nSo we're gonna go in and\n\n1511\n01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:26,480\nspend some time doing things in\nthis area such as patch management.\n\n1512\n01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,570\nWe may be doing things like, looking\nat our baselines for desktop imaging,\n\n1513\n01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:32,750\ntrying to understand what's in there and\nwhether or\n\n1514\n01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:35,500\nnot they are good or\nperhaps we have to update them.\n\n1515\n01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:38,409\nSo those are things we want to be\nthinking about and be aware of.\n\n1516\n01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,020\nWe may be going in here and\nvulnerability testing, and\n\n1517\n01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:47,490\nusing vulnerability scanners,\nsoftware specifically designed, programs\n\n1518\n01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:52,140\nspecifically designed to be able to have\na list of know vulnerabilities in them.\n\n1519\n01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,830\nOr, at least,\nawareness of these vulnerabilities and\n\n1520\n01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:56,710\nthen be able to report\nback on what we find.\n\n1521\n01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:59,980\nSo, something as simple as\nthe Windows Defender product,\n\n1522\n01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:02,400\nwhich is looking for\nmalware on your system.\n\n1523\n01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,850\nThe MBSA, that's a It's an oldie,\nreaching back to the old days there.\n\n1524\n01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:10,290\nSo HF net check pro would have one there,\nright?\n\n1525\n01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:14,825\nThat's actually owned by the same company,\nit was owned by Shavlic who wrote NBSA.\n\n1526\n01:05:14,825 --> 01:05:18,440\nShavlic Technologies actually bought\nby VM ware several years ago, so\n\n1527\n01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,017\nthey're now owned by VMware.\n\n1528\n01:05:20,017 --> 01:05:23,665\nWhich is kind of an interesting commentary\nwhen you think about the fact that\n\n1529\n01:05:23,665 --> 01:05:26,914\nthe people that wrote the Microsoft\nWindows Deployment Services or\n\n1530\n01:05:26,914 --> 01:05:30,334\nnot deployment, rather the VSUS\npatching management solution MBSA,\n\n1531\n01:05:30,334 --> 01:05:34,039\nbasically Microsoft's biggest competitor\nin the virtualization market,\n\n1532\n01:05:34,039 --> 01:05:37,522\nnow own the technology that basically\nis used to patch Windows systems.\n\n1533\n01:05:37,522 --> 01:05:40,413\nSo, it's kind of interesting\nsince VMware bought Shavlic.\n\n1534\n01:05:40,413 --> 01:05:43,070\nYeah, but MBSA, Windows Defender.\n\n1535\n01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:46,340\nIt's just the irony of how\nthat stuff runs, right?\n\n1536\n01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,590\n>> It is.\n>> One day you're competitors,\n\n1537\n01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:50,160\nthe next day one of you owns\nthe IP of the other person.\n\n1538\n01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:55,010\nSo MBSA, Windows Defender,\ncertainly today we have-\n\n1539\n01:05:55,010 --> 01:05:55,870\n>> SolarWinds has,\n\n1540\n01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,900\nI don't know if they have\na vulnerability scanner.\n\n1541\n01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:58,850\nNessus?\n\n1542\n01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:00,460\n>> Nessus is a good example of one.\n\n1543\n01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,110\nAbsolutely, so we got some there.\n\n1544\n01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:06,890\nYou know we talked about Kismet,\nI mentioned, which is a wireless scanner,\n\n1545\n01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:10,390\nbut can do vulnerability\ntesting at some level as well.\n\n1546\n01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:14,430\nThere is Firesheep which is another one\nthat's specifically designed to take\n\n1547\n01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:18,490\nadvantage of certain wireless issues or\nvulnerabilities.\n\n1548\n01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:19,830\nSo Firesheep.\n\n1549\n01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:22,850\nThere's a whole bunch out there, and\nyou could just go on and on and on.\n\n1550\n01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:26,330\nBut the idea is that at the end of\nthe day, we're gonna be able to do\n\n1551\n01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:30,290\nvulnerability scanning using tools\nlike this to find known issues and\n\n1552\n01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:32,525\nthen document them and\ndefend against them.\n\n1553\n01:06:32,525 --> 01:06:34,555\nNow what about vulnerabilities\nthat we're not aware of.\n\n1554\n01:06:34,555 --> 01:06:36,205\n>> It wouldn't do any good against those.\n\n1555\n01:06:36,205 --> 01:06:38,105\n>> It wouldn't do any good for\nthose, obviously.\n\n1556\n01:06:38,105 --> 01:06:40,995\nBut zero day exploits\nare happening all the time.\n\n1557\n01:06:40,995 --> 01:06:42,945\nAnd, there are places you can go out and\n\n1558\n01:06:42,945 --> 01:06:45,670\nlook on the web to be able\nto find some of this stuff.\n\n1559\n01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:47,970\nStay up to date, if you will.\n\n1560\n01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:48,836\nAs a CISSP,\n\n1561\n01:06:48,836 --> 01:06:54,220\nwe talked in one of our earlier\ndiscussions about the CVE mitre websites.\n\n1562\n01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:57,848\nThe common vulnerability in exposure\nwebsite, which would allow you to keep up\n\n1563\n01:06:57,848 --> 01:07:00,450\nto date on the most recent\nvulnerabilities that have been found.\n\n1564\n01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:02,370\nSo that may be one place to go look.\n\n1565\n01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:05,780\nMost of the big security vendors,\nwhen we say that today,\n\n1566\n01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:08,990\nwe're thinking about Symantec,\nkind of at the top of that.\n\n1567\n01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:14,460\nBut there are many others, Kaspersky Labs,\nbelieve it or not, Verizon, which is doing\n\n1568\n01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:18,490\na lot of security work and does the annual\nvulnerability and assessment reports.\n\n1569\n01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:21,440\nA lot of them are putting\nout vulnerability updates on\n\n1570\n01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:25,490\na regular basis on their sites and talking\nabout vulnerability so there's a lot of\n\n1571\n01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:31,480\ninformation out there on the web that\na CISSP candidate, a security practitioner\n\n1572\n01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:34,970\nthat wants to go out there an learn more\nabout this stuff could take advantage of.\n\n1573\n01:07:34,970 --> 01:07:36,490\n>> Yeah, need to keep current.\n\n1574\n01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:38,240\n>> Yeah, wanna keep current, right.\n\n1575\n01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:42,210\n>> Read blogs and things like that,\nso for instance Dark Reading Daily,\n\n1576\n01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:46,890\nI don't know if you do that or not, but\nDark Reading Daily would be a good one.\n\n1577\n01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:51,530\nCSO, Chief Security Officer Online,\nCSO Online, things of that nature.\n\n1578\n01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:56,790\nThere's IT Pro sites certainly,\nbut the Windows sites for Windows.\n\n1579\n01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:57,410\nThere's Linux.\n\n1580\n01:07:57,410 --> 01:08:00,250\nYou maybe go out to some\nof the Linux areas.\n\n1581\n01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:04,044\nCertainly some of the distro sites where\nyou can find distributions of Linux but\n\n1582\n01:08:04,044 --> 01:08:06,771\nalso find a lot of the tools and\nthings that support them.\n\n1583\n01:08:06,771 --> 01:08:09,050\nAll of these will be ways to\nkeep up on vulnerabilities and\n\n1584\n01:08:09,050 --> 01:08:10,570\nunderstand what's going on.\n\n1585\n01:08:10,570 --> 01:08:12,420\nSo, you wanna understand that and\njust kind of be aware of that.\n\n1586\n01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,240\nBe thinking about how you're\ngonna find that information.\n\n1587\n01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,700\nWhen we talk about penetration testing,\n\n1588\n01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,830\nwe're talking about this idea\nof being able to go in and\n\n1589\n01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:24,830\nformalize this idea of using tools,\nthings like maybe vulnerability scanners,\n\n1590\n01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:29,620\nbut also other skills, other knowledge\nbrought to bear, to attack a network,\n\n1591\n01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:33,850\nbut typically attack a network from\na ethical hacking perspective.\n\n1592\n01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:37,900\nSo, doing so with the overall goal\nof being able to find weaknesses,\n\n1593\n01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:42,650\ndocument them, and then remediate them\nin some way, so deal with them, right?\n\n1594\n01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:44,940\nPlug them up before they\nbecome problematic.\n\n1595\n01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:48,254\nSo we have a methodology here, a five\nstep methodology that we speak about.\n\n1596\n01:08:48,254 --> 01:08:50,490\nWhen we speak about penetration testing,\n\n1597\n01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:54,390\nwe want to make sure we're aware of this\nand really understand the way this works.\n\n1598\n01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:57,840\nSo a typical penetration testing\nmethodology again depending\n\n1599\n01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,180\non what you do.\n\n1600\n01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:02,040\nYou may have a slightly\ndifferent methodology.\n\n1601\n01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:03,570\nYou might call it different things.\n\n1602\n01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:07,360\nBut this is the accepted standard\ngeneric way of referring to this.\n\n1603\n01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:11,350\nKind of the accepted five steps that\nare engaged in would be discovery, right?\n\n1604\n01:09:11,350 --> 01:09:17,200\nSo we would go out and we would try to\ndo some general information gathering,\n\n1605\n01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:20,990\nso we may check the web and see what\nthe profile of the business is on the web.\n\n1606\n01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:25,900\nWe may want to try to figure out what kind\nof email addressing solution they use.\n\n1607\n01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:28,060\nIs it first.last at company?\n\n1608\n01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,790\nWe may want to do some call-ins blindly,\ntalk to some people,\n\n1609\n01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:35,420\ntry to do some social engineering,\nto try find out what is there, right,\n\n1610\n01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,360\ndifferent ways of just\ndiscovering information.\n\n1611\n01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,850\nBut basically footprinting and\ngathering information about the target.\n\n1612\n01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:41,670\n>> Mostly publicly available information.\n\n1613\n01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:44,130\nAnd typically at this point\nwe're not crossing any lines.\n\n1614\n01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:45,910\n>> No, no.\nMore often than not publicly available,\n\n1615\n01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:46,800\nabsolutely you're right.\n\n1616\n01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:50,330\nSo we're not inside doing\nanything that could be construed\n\n1617\n01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:53,030\nas potentially being illegal and\n\n1618\n01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:57,720\npotentially land us in a world of trouble,\nand so then we get to enumeration.\n\n1619\n01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,040\nThis is where we do things\nlike port scanning, and\n\n1620\n01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,740\nwe look for resource identification.\n\n1621\n01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,195\nSo we're going to go active.\n\n1622\n01:10:04,195 --> 01:10:07,475\nTry to start probing the exterior\nperimeters of the network.\n\n1623\n01:10:07,475 --> 01:10:12,165\nMay even get in behind some of the\nperimeters and probe some of the boxes in\n\n1624\n01:10:12,165 --> 01:10:15,695\nthe DMZ for instance,\nwhat's open there, that kind of thing.\n\n1625\n01:10:15,695 --> 01:10:19,285\nSo we're gonna start laying out a map and\nbuilding a topology,\n\n1626\n01:10:19,285 --> 01:10:23,525\na visual representation, of what's going\non in the network there with enumeration.\n\n1627\n01:10:23,525 --> 01:10:27,224\nThen vulnerability mapping, we're gonna go\nout and actually identify vulnerabilities\n\n1628\n01:10:27,224 --> 01:10:30,960\nin these systems that we've port\nscanned and things like that.\n\n1629\n01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:36,830\nSo, put little flags on these machines and\nsay, oh this one is running a web server.\n\n1630\n01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:38,460\nThis one has this running.\n\n1631\n01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:39,704\nThis one has that.\n\n1632\n01:10:39,704 --> 01:10:40,835\n>> Still running [CROSSTALK].\n\n1633\n01:10:40,835 --> 01:10:43,928\nRunning sequels so maybe it's\nvulnerable to some injection attack.\n\n1634\n01:10:43,928 --> 01:10:48,170\n>> Some injection attacks for overflows or\nWindows XP, right, is out there so\n\n1635\n01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:48,940\nwhat's that gonna be?\n\n1636\n01:10:50,590 --> 01:10:53,460\nSo those kind of things would just\nbe important to think about there.\n\n1637\n01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:54,890\nExploitation, right?\n\n1638\n01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:58,290\nAttempts to gain unauthorized access\nby typically exploiting right?\n\n1639\n01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:01,480\nTaking advantage of the vulnerabilities\nwe've just mapped out and as a result\n\n1640\n01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:05,550\ngoing active and really then going on the\nattack, on the hunt and trying to get in.\n\n1641\n01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:07,710\nWe talk about planting\nour flag at that point,\n\n1642\n01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:10,420\nwhere we're basically taking\nover the box and marking it.\n\n1643\n01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,820\nSo when we do, and\nI do these kind of pen tests sometimes,\n\n1644\n01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:14,920\nyou will leave a text\nfile hidden in the box.\n\n1645\n01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:15,570\n>> Right.\n>> Or somewhere,\n\n1646\n01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:18,210\nwe can go back and point to it and\nsay, look, it's here obviously.\n\n1647\n01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,250\nYou know, my name and date,\nthis is what we agreed upon ahead of time.\n\n1648\n01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:23,470\nSo I put this on every box\nto show that I was here.\n\n1649\n01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:24,788\nYou know, that kind of thing.\n\n1650\n01:11:24,788 --> 01:11:29,047\nSo that's what we would typically see\nwhen we talk about doing exploitation.\n\n1651\n01:11:29,047 --> 01:11:32,563\nAnd then reporting to management is\nabout summarizing what's gone on,\n\n1652\n01:11:32,563 --> 01:11:36,425\nreporting back out, sitting down and\ndiscussing what's happened.\n\n1653\n01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,015\n>> Right.\n>> And so the most important thing with\n\n1654\n01:11:38,015 --> 01:11:39,845\npen testing is we think\nthrough the methodology.\n\n1655\n01:11:39,845 --> 01:11:42,285\nObviously important to\nunderstand the sequencing again,\n\n1656\n01:11:42,285 --> 01:11:43,550\njust like we talked about.\n\n1657\n01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,970\nWhere we go through and\nlook at change management.\n\n1658\n01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:47,450\nOrder is very important right.\n\n1659\n01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:48,865\nWant to have an orderly pen test.\n\n1660\n01:11:48,865 --> 01:11:53,419\nDon't want to have people randomly running\naround like a Monty Python skit right.\n\n1661\n01:11:53,419 --> 01:11:56,658\nEverything's going to\nhell in a hand basket.\n\n1662\n01:11:56,658 --> 01:11:59,537\nCould you imagine if they had done\nlike a Monty Python episode or\n\n1663\n01:11:59,537 --> 01:12:01,616\nskit where they actually\ndid IT pen testing.\n\n1664\n01:12:01,616 --> 01:12:02,161\n>> Oh yeah.\n\n1665\n01:12:02,161 --> 01:12:05,180\nHave you ever seen the commercial\nwith John Cleese for LiveVault.\n\n1666\n01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,280\n>> Yeah, yeah I have.\n\n1667\n01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,080\n>> That's pretty humorous.\n\n1668\n01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:08,235\n>> Yeah, it is.\nIt is very humorous.\n\n1669\n01:12:08,235 --> 01:12:08,840\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Right.\n\n1670\n01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,060\nSo some very,\n\n1671\n01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:14,580\nvery potentially disturbing opportunities\nthat may come up for comedy there.\n\n1672\n01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,230\nAll right.\nBut\n\n1673\n01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:19,080\nthe idea there is talk about this reports\nmanagement, what I wanted mention was\n\n1674\n01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:22,430\nkind of outlining it around\nthis whole idea of pen testing.\n\n1675\n01:12:22,430 --> 01:12:25,220\nWe have to understand that we need to,\nand we're gonna get into this based on\n\n1676\n01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:28,240\nknowledge levels here a minute,\nbut we need to really document and\n\n1677\n01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,155\nget the support in the buy-in\nof senior management.\n\n1678\n01:12:30,155 --> 01:12:32,445\nBefore we engage in pen testing.\n\n1679\n01:12:32,445 --> 01:12:35,875\nBecause the downside here is that\nif we don't have the right level of\n\n1680\n01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:37,635\nparticipation and support,\n\n1681\n01:12:37,635 --> 01:12:41,040\nthen we get to talk to law enforcement\nas opposed to talking to management.\n\n1682\n01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,485\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> In step number five, or\n\n1683\n01:12:42,485 --> 01:12:44,220\nstep number six rather, excuse me.\n\n1684\n01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:44,890\nNow step number five.\n\n1685\n01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,960\nI'm thinking about change\nmanagement with six steps.\n\n1686\n01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,580\nBut step number five is instead we cross\nout management there and put report to\n\n1687\n01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:54,890\njail because basically you're going to\nbe tried for breaking and entering.\n\n1688\n01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:55,690\n>> Do not pass go.\n\n1689\n01:12:55,690 --> 01:12:56,600\n>> Right.\nSo you need to get,\n\n1690\n01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,360\nliterally what we call a get\nout of jail free card,\n\n1691\n01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,470\nwhich is basically the signed\nstatement of agreement,\n\n1692\n01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:03,900\nstatement of work from senior management,\nbefore you engage in pen testing,\n\n1693\n01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:07,450\nthat says you have the right to do these\nthings, you agree on the boundaries and\n\n1694\n01:13:07,450 --> 01:13:10,480\nthe perimeters, parameters, and\nthe perimeter of what you will test.\n\n1695\n01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,440\nYou don't go beyond that,\nthis is also very important,\n\n1696\n01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,850\nwhen talking about pen testing.\n\n1697\n01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:17,603\nRight, you establish those boundaries,\nthat is what will be done, and\n\n1698\n01:13:17,603 --> 01:13:21,600\nanything beyond that, especially in\nproduction, is just off the table.\n\n1699\n01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,520\n>> Yeah.\n>> Now you may find vulnerabilities,\n\n1700\n01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,140\nyou may map them, but\nyou then cannot exploit them.\n\n1701\n01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,350\nYou must report back and say,\n\n1702\n01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:32,850\nlook while scanning these systems over\nhere we happened to find all this other\n\n1703\n01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:35,460\nstuff that indicates we have all\nthese other problems over here.\n\n1704\n01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:38,210\nSo we documented it, but we didn't\nactually do anything with it because we\n\n1705\n01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:40,730\nwant you to be aware of the fact\nthat this is out there.\n\n1706\n01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:42,640\nSo this is very important.\n\n1707\n01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:46,090\nVery important when you do this.\n\n1708\n01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:46,960\nSo knowledge levels.\n\n1709\n01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:47,960\nLets talk about knowledge levels.\n\n1710\n01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:52,380\nSo, when we engage in these\nkinds of tests, pen testing,\n\n1711\n01:13:52,380 --> 01:13:54,180\nwe talk about different types of doing it.\n\n1712\n01:13:54,180 --> 01:13:56,590\nSometimes talked about is\ndifferent knowledge levels,\n\n1713\n01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:59,050\ndifferent colored testing elements.\n\n1714\n01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:00,600\n>> How much information do\nwe have when we're going in.\n\n1715\n01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,310\n>> Yeah right.\nHow much information we know going in and\n\n1716\n01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:04,010\nwhere we do the attack from, right?\n\n1717\n01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:05,430\nSo is it inside or outside?\n\n1718\n01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:08,470\nSo zero knowledge is often\nreferred to as black box testing,\n\n1719\n01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:11,990\nwhich is gonna be nothing going\nin knowing nothing ahead of time.\n\n1720\n01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:14,030\nBlack box,\nin other words really knowing nothing,\n\n1721\n01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:16,280\ntypically done from outside the network,\nright?\n\n1722\n01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,400\nSo outside really no knowledge.\n\n1723\n01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,470\nYou're on the outside,\ntrying to work your way in.\n\n1724\n01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:23,200\nPartial knowledge often referred\nto as gray box testing.\n\n1725\n01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,660\nAgain typically,\noutside but more knowledge.\n\n1726\n01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:31,010\nYou may be given some IP ranges and\nsome layouts of the network.\n\n1727\n01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:34,230\nThey know some stuff you're\nstill gonna be on the outside.\n\n1728\n01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:35,340\nAnd then full knowledge or\n\n1729\n01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:37,930\nwhite box testing is typically\ndone from inside the network.\n\n1730\n01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:40,380\nYou may even be sitting in\nthe knock right next door or\n\n1731\n01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:42,710\nright next to the security\nteams that are monitoring.\n\n1732\n01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:44,200\nAnd you're going to be\nworking on the network from\n\n1733\n01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,050\nthe inside with the full knowledge or\ntypically a white box test.\n\n1734\n01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,150\nSo you want to be aware of that and\nunderstand that.\n\n1735\n01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:52,480\nIt's going to be very important\nas we think about this.\n\n1736\n01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:56,150\nAnd then ultimately as well, we wanna talk\nabout some of the other vulnerability\n\n1737\n01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:59,980\ntypes that exist out there and then maybe\njust ways of being aware of them and\n\n1738\n01:14:59,980 --> 01:15:00,980\ndealing with them.\n\n1739\n01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:03,400\nSo we have things like you\nknow kernel flaws right so\n\n1740\n01:15:03,400 --> 01:15:05,630\nwhen we do vulnerability\nscans we may look for\n\n1741\n01:15:05,630 --> 01:15:09,080\nalthough they may be hard to find through\na normal scan process but kernel flaw.\n\n1742\n01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:14,405\nSo this will be typically things that\noccur you know below the graphical user\n\n1743\n01:15:14,405 --> 01:15:18,460\ninterface level but at the hardware level\nwithin the kernel of the OS itself so\n\n1744\n01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:21,820\nwe talk about user level,\nwe'll talk about kernel level.\n\n1745\n01:15:21,820 --> 01:15:25,310\nWhen we talk about the OS we're talking\nabout the thing that is really not gonna\n\n1746\n01:15:25,310 --> 01:15:28,610\nbe exposed to the user, but\nin the logic of the core of the OS.\n\n1747\n01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:32,020\nSo this may be a bad implementation\nof a security module.\n\n1748\n01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:36,810\nThis could be a core buffer\noverflow that allows for\n\n1749\n01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:41,070\nperhaps large amounts of data\nto be put into a buffer,\n\n1750\n01:15:41,070 --> 01:15:45,100\nbuffer overflow to occur and then command\nline route level access being given\n\n1751\n01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:48,340\nto a process that's running in\nthe kernel that kind of thing.\n\n1752\n01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:53,220\nSo we have to obviously make sure that we\nare going to patch the operating system\n\n1753\n01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:55,590\nwhatever the vendor tells us\nto do as security updates and\n\n1754\n01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:58,710\npatches have to be applied and\nwe keep up to date on that.\n\n1755\n01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:01,120\nAnd that if we are for\n\n1756\n01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:06,340\nany reason you know finding bizarre\nbehavior occurring You know.\n\n1757\n01:16:06,340 --> 01:16:08,150\nThings are just randomly locking up.\n\n1758\n01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:09,330\nThey're crashing.\n\n1759\n01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:11,170\nWe see strange error messages.\n\n1760\n01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:14,270\nNot that most Windows error messages\nare not strange to begin with but\n\n1761\n01:16:14,270 --> 01:16:15,550\nyou get the general idea.\n\n1762\n01:16:15,550 --> 01:16:17,460\nMore strange than normal,\nI probably should say.\n\n1763\n01:16:17,460 --> 01:16:20,240\nIf you see stuff like that we\nreally have to think about\n\n1764\n01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:23,360\nwhether the operating system itself\ncould have been compromised.\n\n1765\n01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,490\nWe may have to backup our data,\nsafeguard it and maybe blow that out and\n\n1766\n01:16:26,490 --> 01:16:27,540\nreinstall that.\n\n1767\n01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:30,000\nThat may be some issues\nto think about there.\n\n1768\n01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,090\nBuffer overflows would allow\nus to be able to specifically,\n\n1769\n01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:36,820\nnot just in the kernel but, generically\nin software out beyond the kernel,\n\n1770\n01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:40,410\ninject a lot of data into a buffer\nthat was not designed to handle it.\n\n1771\n01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:42,760\nSo, think about filling a glass, right,\n\n1772\n01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:47,850\nif the glass is going to have no entry\npoint other than just the one at the top.\n\n1773\n01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:50,350\nI should say no exit point where\nwe can drain out the bottom.\n\n1774\n01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:53,070\nAnd as a result we just\nkeep pouring stuff in.\n\n1775\n01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:56,610\nEventually we fill the glass and it\noverflows if we're not able to establish\n\n1776\n01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:58,960\na way to remove liquid\nwhile we're putting it in.\n\n1777\n01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,100\nSo a buffer is basically that,\nit's a glass container, or\n\n1778\n01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,210\nsome sort of a container in memory,\n\n1779\n01:17:04,210 --> 01:17:07,360\nthat is structured specifically\nto hold a certain amount of data.\n\n1780\n01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:10,740\nAnd if we don't have a way of clearing\nthat buffer as we are entering more data,\n\n1781\n01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:13,125\neventually we fill it up and\nthen we run into problems.\n\n1782\n01:17:13,125 --> 01:17:17,105\nSo buffer overflows have to be dealt with\nby making sure we do boundary checking.\n\n1783\n01:17:17,105 --> 01:17:19,165\nThis is something we often can do.\n\n1784\n01:17:19,165 --> 01:17:23,395\nSo we make sure the buffer does not\naccept data, except in proper format and\n\n1785\n01:17:23,395 --> 01:17:24,485\nproper form.\n\n1786\n01:17:24,485 --> 01:17:28,015\nBoundary checking and error checking are\ngoing to prevent malformed data from being\n\n1787\n01:17:28,015 --> 01:17:29,640\ninjected into the buffer.\n\n1788\n01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,400\nSo that's gonna be important to consider.\n\n1789\n01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,200\nWe also want to just write better code.\n\n1790\n01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,420\nTake a look at the codes.\n\n1791\n01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:37,520\nGo head and vet it,\nmake sure the code itself is good.\n\n1792\n01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,330\nDoesn't have crappy code\nis really gonna lead to\n\n1793\n01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:43,560\nbuffer overflows because it's gonna lead\nto the opportunity to exploit them, so\n\n1794\n01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,810\nwe wanna make sure we think about that.\n\n1795\n01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:50,650\nSymbolic links,\nthis idea of symbolic link, may be, or\n\n1796\n01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:54,210\nrather is the idea of being able to\nuse the operating system structure\n\n1797\n01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:57,490\nto get to see data that we may not\nnormally see through normal interfaces.\n\n1798\n01:17:57,490 --> 01:18:02,910\nA lot of the times here, we may allow, we\nmay be able to use effectively a shortcut.\n\n1799\n01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:06,660\nBecause symbolic link is basically\na reference or shortcut to something.\n\n1800\n01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:10,330\nAnd so we may be able to access\ndata at the core of the OS\n\n1801\n01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:14,110\nusing symbolic links where normally we may\nnot be able to get to it in other ways.\n\n1802\n01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:15,900\nAnd so, this is coming to us from Unix and\n\n1803\n01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:19,420\nLinux, where symbolic links where\ncreated as cross references, basically.\n\n1804\n01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:21,470\nTo files and shortcuts to files.\n\n1805\n01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:25,460\nAnd so the idea is that although we may be\nnormally blocked from seeing something,\n\n1806\n01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:26,520\ninteracting with it.\n\n1807\n01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:29,550\nBy accessing it through symbolic link,\nit's almost like a hidden share,\n\n1808\n01:18:29,550 --> 01:18:33,250\nwe can get to it and do something\nthat normally may not be able to do.\n\n1809\n01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,870\nSo this can be a problem, so\nyou also want to look for those,\n\n1810\n01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:37,790\neliminate them as much as possible.\n\n1811\n01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:40,710\nTry to control access by\nreally understanding how users\n\n1812\n01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,020\nare interacting and what they're doing,\n\n1813\n01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:45,910\nand assigning the right level of\naccess to them if at all possible.\n\n1814\n01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:47,410\nFile Descriptor Attacks.\n\n1815\n01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:52,660\nThis is where we may go in and\nwe may be able to either use metadata\n\n1816\n01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:56,900\nabout the file and information about\nit to be able to take advantage of it.\n\n1817\n01:18:56,900 --> 01:19:02,310\nWe may be able to use, for instance,\ncertain descriptors that are universal\n\n1818\n01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:05,630\nin Windows that will tell us about\ninformation, others that may be unique.\n\n1819\n01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:10,010\nSo the user ID of 500 and\n501 is a good example of this, right?\n\n1820\n01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:13,790\nSo the guest and the administrator\naccounts that are built in\n\n1821\n01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:18,000\nhave these generic ID's, that you look\nat and you may, or may not realize, but\n\n1822\n01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,020\nthey're the same in every operating\nsystem, basically on the planet.\n\n1823\n01:19:21,020 --> 01:19:21,570\n>> Yup.\n>> Linux and Unix\n\n1824\n01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:22,620\nare the same way as well.\n\n1825\n01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:23,880\n>> They're the same ways.\n\n1826\n01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:29,450\n>> So as a result, you always know 500\nis gonna be one thing, and 501 another.\n\n1827\n01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:31,180\n500 is always administrator,\n501 is always guest, and\n\n1828\n01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:34,810\nas a result what we then know\nis that if we see a user ID\n\n1829\n01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:38,590\non a user ID list that we've dumped,\nwe don't know the name of the account.\n\n1830\n01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:41,120\n>> They might have renamed the\nadministrator account trying to obfuscate\n\n1831\n01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,250\nthat account, but we still can detect it.\n\n1832\n01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:44,700\n>> We still know that, right.\n\n1833\n01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:47,450\nAnd the other thing, so\nI love this when this happens, right.\n\n1834\n01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:49,650\nSo, yes, they've renamed the account-\n>> I know where you're going.\n\n1835\n01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:53,082\n>> Renaming administrator account to\nsomething like Bob or whatever it is, but\n\n1836\n01:19:53,082 --> 01:19:55,584\nthey leave the description\nof the account right there.\n\n1837\n01:19:55,584 --> 01:19:56,666\n>> Right.\nThis is an administrator account.\n\n1838\n01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:57,651\nTo manage this is.\n\n1839\n01:19:57,651 --> 01:19:58,822\n>> In the description field,\nbuilt in admin account is left there.\n\n1840\n01:19:58,822 --> 01:19:59,693\nSo all they do is rename it.\n\n1841\n01:19:59,693 --> 01:20:00,413\nThey leave that.\n\n1842\n01:20:00,413 --> 01:20:03,746\nSo when we would do an account dump,\nright, a pwdump or\n\n1843\n01:20:03,746 --> 01:20:06,146\nwhatever it was to get to the accounts.\n\n1844\n01:20:06,146 --> 01:20:10,602\nSo, we would see that, we would see Bob,\nbuilt-in user for Admin rights, duh!\n\n1845\n01:20:10,602 --> 01:20:13,050\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah,\nyou gotta change all of that, folks.\n\n1846\n01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:17,974\n>> Yeah, wow, you know we don't read that\nstuff, and the hackers in there now.\n\n1847\n01:20:17,974 --> 01:20:21,120\nWe're just finger monkeys here,\nall we're doing is pushing buttons here.\n\n1848\n01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,285\nWe don't read anything, right?\n\n1849\n01:20:22,285 --> 01:20:23,100\n>> That's it, that's it.\n\n1850\n01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:26,370\n>> I mean, we sit around and\nlaugh about this stuff, but\n\n1851\n01:20:26,370 --> 01:20:29,580\nthis is why bad things\nhappen to bad people, right?\n\n1852\n01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,557\n>> That's right.\n>> Because we can tell what's going on,\n\n1853\n01:20:31,557 --> 01:20:34,210\nand good people get in the way,\nand so they're collateral damage.\n\n1854\n01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:36,310\nBut, at the end of the day,\nif you do something like that,\n\n1855\n01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:38,040\nbut don't take it to the end game.\n\n1856\n01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:41,200\nAs you said, rename the account,\nrename the descriptor,\n\n1857\n01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,210\nfile descriptor attacks get you\nin a lot of trouble, right?\n\n1858\n01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:44,010\n>> Exactly.\n\n1859\n01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:46,220\n>> When I do auditing,\nI love when I see that.\n\n1860\n01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:48,810\nAnd they get so excited since they think\nthey did the right thing, but look.\n\n1861\n01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:50,076\n>> [CROSSTALK] If noone does practices,\nright?\n\n1862\n01:20:50,076 --> 01:20:51,360\n>> Right, we renamed the Admin account.\n\n1863\n01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,800\nAnd you say yeah, but\nyou forgot the descriptor.\n\n1864\n01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:56,330\n>> Have you ever had any of them change\nit to something like Superman, or\n\n1865\n01:20:56,330 --> 01:21:00,300\nBatman, not follow their normal naming\nconvention for the rest of their network?\n\n1866\n01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,843\n>> I've seen some doozies over the years,\nI gotta tell you.\n\n1867\n01:21:01,843 --> 01:21:02,594\n>> I wonder if that, yeah.\n\n1868\n01:21:02,594 --> 01:21:03,618\n[LAUGH]\n>> Yeah,\n\n1869\n01:21:03,618 --> 01:21:08,850\nthere have been some real winners out\nthere over the years, I must say.\n\n1870\n01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:11,700\nAll right, so we have file descriptor\ntext, we also have race conditions, right?\n\n1871\n01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:15,710\nRace conditions, this idea that basically\nif a program is designed in such\n\n1872\n01:21:15,710 --> 01:21:18,510\na way that normally processes\nthat run in parallel,\n\n1873\n01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,870\nlet's say,\nnormally complete in a certain order.\n\n1874\n01:21:20,870 --> 01:21:23,010\nOne should always complete,\nthen two should complete,\n\n1875\n01:21:23,010 --> 01:21:25,194\nthen three should complete in sequence.\n\n1876\n01:21:25,194 --> 01:21:26,640\n>> Right.\n>> A race condition is\n\n1877\n01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:29,780\nwhere maybe because they're all running\ndown the track at the same time, but\n\n1878\n01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:34,160\nbecause of a bad architectural design,\nthree completes before two.\n\n1879\n01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,910\nSo one, three, two, in that order,\nor something like that.\n\n1880\n01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:41,025\nWhat can then happen is as a result,\nwe actually can wind up turning the system\n\n1881\n01:21:41,025 --> 01:21:44,450\nupside-down, and exposing flaws,\nand things can go wrong.\n\n1882\n01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:47,340\nCuz we may put certain information\ninto a finished state before\n\n1883\n01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:50,080\nother inputs are there,\nand so things can happen.\n\n1884\n01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:53,640\nSo race conditions are where basically\nprocesses finish out of order, or\n\n1885\n01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:54,650\ntasks, or processes.\n\n1886\n01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:56,160\nIt doesn't matter, either one, and\n\n1887\n01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:57,960\nthat's really what we're\ntalking about there, right?\n\n1888\n01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,060\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1889\n01:21:59,060 --> 01:22:00,660\nWe also have directory permissions, right?\n\n1890\n01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:02,680\nWe have to think about\ndirectory permission issues,\n\n1891\n01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:06,555\nwhich is do we assign permissions\nusing proper best practices?\n\n1892\n01:22:06,555 --> 01:22:07,370\n>> Right.\n>> In Windows,\n\n1893\n01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:10,310\nwe often talk about this\nidea of AGLIP as an acronym.\n\n1894\n01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:12,400\nUser accounts should\nbe assigned to groups,\n\n1895\n01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,580\ngroups should be assigned permissions,\nnot users in other words, right?\n\n1896\n01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:19,430\nAnd so domain local and\npermissions are assigned.\n\n1897\n01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:23,290\nSo this idea of not managing by exception,\nbut managing through\n\n1898\n01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:27,930\nthis idea of delegating group membership,\nrole based access, things of that nature.\n\n1899\n01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:31,900\nReally very important because if we don't\nassign that the right way and we just give\n\n1900\n01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:36,170\nindividual users rights, we tend to A,\nnot document or B, we tend to forget.\n\n1901\n01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:36,770\n>> Exactly, yep.\n>> And\n\n1902\n01:22:36,770 --> 01:22:39,840\nC, we wind up with all these\nusers accessing these files\n\n1903\n01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,020\nwithout really knowing what's happening.\n\n1904\n01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:41,770\n>> Not knowing any of this.\n\n1905\n01:22:41,770 --> 01:22:43,490\n>> And all sorts of bad things\nhappen at the end of the day.\n\n1906\n01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:44,160\n>> Yep, absolutely.\n\n1907\n01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:48,130\n>> It's just not a very good thing\noverall, so just be aware of that as well.\n\n1908\n01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:51,320\nAll right, so we've really kinda run\nthrough our vulnerability types,\n\n1909\n01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,230\nwe've talked about this.\n\n1910\n01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:54,750\nProbably the only other thing we want to\nthrow on there is probably just a quick\n\n1911\n01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,290\nlittle after thought, but it is important.\n\n1912\n01:22:57,290 --> 01:23:00,228\nIs, now that we've done all this stuff,\nwe've talked about operational security,\n\n1913\n01:23:00,228 --> 01:23:03,510\nespecially we've talked about changed\nmanagement, and some of this stuff.\n\n1914\n01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:06,850\nWe have to really look at this and then\nsay okay, so we've done all of this stuff,\n\n1915\n01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,460\npotentially done our vulnerability,\nand our pen testing.\n\n1916\n01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:13,220\nWe've learned a bunch of stuff,\nhopefully patched a bunch of flaws.\n\n1917\n01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:16,083\nNow, how are we gonna know going\nforward that we did all that, and\n\n1918\n01:23:16,083 --> 01:23:19,430\nhow are we gonna capture all of that,\nand what are we then gonna do with it?\n\n1919\n01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:22,400\nSo what we have to do,\nobviously documentation is king,\n\n1920\n01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,050\nwe need to document everything.\n\n1921\n01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:27,600\nBut aside from documentation, we have to\nsit down and really go through what's\n\n1922\n01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,620\neither known as a post-implementation\nreview or a postmortem.\n\n1923\n01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:34,880\nThere's different terms you hear for\nthis depending on whether you come\n\n1924\n01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,690\nfrom a project management background, like\na PMP background, or something like that.\n\n1925\n01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:44,180\nSo, postmortem, E-M, E-M for\nmortem, mortem right?\n\n1926\n01:23:44,180 --> 01:23:47,650\nSo postmortem, i t's all one\nword by the way, but postmortem.\n\n1927\n01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:50,150\nOr what's called\na post-implementation review,\n\n1928\n01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:53,905\na PIR,\nsometimes referred to as lessons learned.\n\n1929\n01:23:53,905 --> 01:23:59,145\nIt's all the same implementation, no,\nnot installation, implementation.\n\n1930\n01:23:59,145 --> 01:23:59,655\n>> Oh, sorry.\n\n1931\n01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:07,372\n>> Post-implementation review, there we go\n>> And/or a lessons learned,\n\n1932\n01:24:07,372 --> 01:24:10,762\nit's referred to in different ways,\nit's all basically the same thing.\n\n1933\n01:24:10,762 --> 01:24:15,082\nIt's this idea of sitting down, gathering\nup all the disparate data point from\n\n1934\n01:24:15,082 --> 01:24:18,372\ndifferent places, writing them down,\ncapturing them and rolling them, forward.\n\n1935\n01:24:18,372 --> 01:24:22,302\nSo that we can really do the root cause\nanalysis on what we did, understand it,\n\n1936\n01:24:22,302 --> 01:24:25,760\nand then really benefit from that\nas we go forward and manage it.\n\n1937\n01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:28,970\nSo this is really important to think\nabout, just as kind of a wrapping-up\n\n1938\n01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:31,490\nthought process where we talk\nabout some of this stuff.\n\n1939\n01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:34,340\nIt's really about that post-mortem,\nthat lessons-learned solution, so\n\n1940\n01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:36,600\nwe want to make sure we're aware of that.\n\n1941\n01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,660\nAll right, very good, so\nlet's talk about operational security.\n\n1942\n01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:41,430\nThat it's really about\nimplementing our systems and\n\n1943\n01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:45,130\noperationally keeping track of them,\ndocumenting what's happening with them,\n\n1944\n01:24:45,130 --> 01:24:46,762\nrunning the network day\nto day if you will.\n\n1945\n01:24:46,762 --> 01:24:48,040\n>> Right.\n>> And managing the security of it,\n\n1946\n01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,540\nthe security posture of it,\nwhat we call our security profile,\n\n1947\n01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:53,250\nand really making sure it is set up and\ndocumented so\n\n1948\n01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:57,930\nthat as we have different checkpoints,\nmilestones along the way that we look at,\n\n1949\n01:24:57,930 --> 01:25:03,550\nour daily, our weekly, our monthly,\nour quarterly, our semi-annual,\n\n1950\n01:25:03,550 --> 01:25:06,800\nour annual checklists around\nmaintenance and things of that nature.\n\n1951\n01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,290\nThen this is really the operational\nsecurity elements, this is where the CISSP\n\n1952\n01:25:10,290 --> 01:25:14,150\nthat does operational security sits and\nlives, they do this kind of stuff, and\n\n1953\n01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:16,040\nthey manage through all\nthis on a regular basis.\n\n1954\n01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:20,795\nSo this is the knowledge area if you will,\nthat a lot of us will,\n\n1955\n01:25:20,795 --> 01:25:22,585\nagain have exposure with,\nbackground with, and\n\n1956\n01:25:22,585 --> 01:25:26,155\ncomfort with, because it touches on all\nthe different elements that we tend,\n\n1957\n01:25:26,155 --> 01:25:28,665\nmore often than not,\nto do in our daily practices.\n\n1958\n01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:32,005\nSo, we tend to see a lot of candidates\ncoming through very comfortable with\n\n1959\n01:25:32,005 --> 01:25:35,630\nthings in the networking area,\nsome uncomfortable with physical security.\n\n1960\n01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,590\nAt a base level, they know we have guards,\n\n1961\n01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:40,690\nthey know we have smart cards,\ncheck-in lists, things like that.\n\n1962\n01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:42,600\nSo, they've seen elements of that,\nmay not know all but\n\n1963\n01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,865\nknow a lot of it, tend to be somewhat\ncomfortable in operational security,\n\n1964\n01:25:45,865 --> 01:25:49,640\ncuz a lot of the stuff we do every day,\ntends to we wind up living here.\n\n1965\n01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:51,070\n>> Very good, very good.\n\n1966\n01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:54,340\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen,\nwell I hope you guys enjoyed our show.\n\n1967\n01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:56,010\nRemember

room where\nyou can post your questions and\n\n1970\n01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,410\nwe can respond to you during the show.\n\n1971\n01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:05,480\nIf you're watching this as a recording or\n\n1972\n01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,530\nafter the fact, top of every page\nwe've got our Q and A links.\n\n1973\n01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:12,130\nSo put your questions there, we'll monitor\nthat, and we will get back to you.\n\n1974\n01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:13,120\nIf you're away from your computer,\n\n1975\n01:26:13,120 --> 01:26:17,780\nremember you can always check us out

right, good morning,\ngood afternoon and good evening and\n\n5\n00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:39,225\nwelcome back to another\nepisode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:39,225 --> 00:00:42,300\nI'm your host Don Pezet back\nagain with Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,030\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:44,510\n>> It's going awesome today.\n\n9\n00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,510\nLittle rainy today, but going awesome.\n\n10\n00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,530\n>> It's one of those beautiful Florida\ndays that people dream about where it\n\n11\n00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,287\nrains for 24 hours.\n\n12\n00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:57,215\n[LAUGH] No motivation to\ngo outside which means\n\n13\n00:00:57,215 --> 00:01:00,045\nmotivation to stay inside and\nrecord more CISS.\n\n14\n00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:02,585\n>> Plenty of time to learn about CISSP.\n\n15\n00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:10,505\n>> Today we've got what I think is really\nthe most important subject in the entire\n\n16\n00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:14,965\nCISSP library, which is business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery.\n\n17\n00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,040\nWhen there is a problem in a company,\n\n18\n00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,450\ngetting it back on its feet is really that\nchance for us to shine, to be that savior,\n\n19\n00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,740\nto bring the company back into\nbusiness and get us going.\n\n20\n00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,190\nAnd so it's exciting, it's fun,\n\n21\n00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,700\nand it's something that I\nreally like to talk about.\n\n22\n00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,835\n>> Okay, so we're gonna keep Don\nexcited and motivated here, so.\n\n23\n00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:34,460\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You're get to watch him bounce around\n\n24\n00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,190\nthe studio while we talk.\n\n25\n00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,530\n>> Woo hoo.\n>> So we are gonna,\n\n26\n00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,930\nyay, we are gonna talk about this\ncontinuity disaster recovery planning.\n\n27\n00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,230\nSo, Don did rightly point out\nthat this is obviously of\n\n28\n00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,310\nall of the areas that we focus on,\nall ten of them are critical.\n\n29\n00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,647\nWhen you want to become a CISSP\nall the bodies knowledge, or\n\n30\n00:01:48,647 --> 00:01:50,130\nthe domain's knowledge.\n\n31\n00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,570\nBut there are some that are more\nrelevant to what we do every day.\n\n32\n00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,330\nLet's put it that way.\n\n33\n00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,160\nAnd probably a good way of framing Don's\nenthusiasm around this is to understand\n\n34\n00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,630\nthat these activities we're gonna talk\nabout here, the business continuity,\n\n35\n00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:07,080\ndisaster recovery planning op activities\nand opportunities we engage in.\n\n36\n00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,630\nAre probably some of the most relevant\nto what business professionals,\n\n37\n00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,670\nsecurity professionals,\nneed to do every day,\n\n38\n00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,750\nin order to understand that when that bad\nthing happens because we're planning for\n\n39\n00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,350\nthe day that things don't turn\nout the way we'd like them to and\n\n40\n00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,160\nwe talked about business continuing\ndisaster recovering planning.\n\n41\n00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,210\nSo this is kind of that insurance policy\nwe put in place around the what if that\n\n42\n00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,640\nat some point we will have a disruptive\nevent a business continuity event.\n\n43\n00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,740\nThat may or\nmay not be catastrophic in nature.\n\n44\n00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,970\nWe obviously hope it's no so\nbad that it destroys the business and\n\n45\n00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,290\nwe spend weeks, months,\nmaybe years having to recover.\n\n46\n00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,170\nWe hope it's something that's minor right,\nso there is disruption.\n\n47\n00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,760\nBut certainly something that's not so\ncatastrophic that\n\n48\n00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,710\nit can lead to perhaps even at the end of\nthat spectrum it's really, really horrible\n\n49\n00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,350\nthings that are going to be so\ncatastrophic they lead to loss of life,\n\n50\n00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,110\nand maybe loss of property,\nthings like that.\n\n51\n00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:04,950\nWe don't want to see that happen\ncertainly, for any reason, and any time.\n\n52\n00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,220\nBut, we do want to plan for\nthe inevitable, right?\n\n53\n00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,096\nWhich is that at some point, somehow, some\nway no matter how good we are doing our\n\n54\n00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:15,362\njobs, there are going to be things\nthat happen beyond our control.\n\n55\n00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,668\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe have to plan for the inevitable.\n\n56\n00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:22,920\nWe have to plan for\nthe day where we show up, the power's out.\n\n57\n00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,590\nOr we're there and the power goes out.\n\n58\n00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,330\nWe show up and\nmaybe the internet is not working.\n\n59\n00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,750\nNot because of anything we've done, but\n\n60\n00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,780\nbecause something else beyond\nour control has gone wrong.\n\n61\n00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,210\nAnd so as a result of that,\nwhat is it we're gonna do at that point?\n\n62\n00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,580\nDo we stand around?\n\n63\n00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,700\nDo we kinda look at each other?\n\n64\n00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,500\nGo, well, I don't know.\n\n65\n00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,650\nWho do we call?\n\n66\n00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,160\nI'm not sure,\nhasn't happened in a while but\n\n67\n00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,120\ndon't have that up-to-date phone\nrecord for who we should call.\n\n68\n00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,830\nOr should we go home?\n\n69\n00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,150\nI often hear this in businesses.\n\n70\n00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,570\nPower's out,\nwe're not sure how long it's gonna be out.\n\n71\n00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,510\nShould we stick around?\n\n72\n00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,140\nShould we go home?\n\n73\n00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,670\nWe can't really do anything.\n\n74\n00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,160\nWhat do we do?\n\n75\n00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,740\nThese are the kind of questions\nwe don't wanna be struggling with\n\n76\n00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,710\nwhen things go wrong.\n\n77\n00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,450\nWe wanna jump in right away,\nhave a plan of action, well rehearsed,\n\n78\n00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,010\nwell understood, documented,\nand really be able to\n\n79\n00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,900\nalmost immediately have everybody\nunderstand where they need to be and\n\n80\n00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,460\nwhat they need to do,\nin order to ascribe responsibility.\n\n81\n00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:17,380\nAnd accountability to people to go out and\ntry to restore service.\n\n82\n00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,240\nYou may not be able to go out and fix the\nfiber cut that some guy with a back hoe\n\n83\n00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,070\ncaused in your parking lot to get\nInternet service back on, but\n\n84\n00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,700\nyou can at least alert the proper\npeople that have to be alerted, so\n\n85\n00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,950\nyou have to call the service provider.\n\n86\n00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,890\nFigure out what's going on,\nsomebody's gotta know,\n\n87\n00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,780\nthey gotta out and\nfind out whether you can restore service.\n\n88\n00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,770\nAnd if not, how long is it going to be?\n\n89\n00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,680\nAnd then someone has to communicate\nthat to all the other parties involved.\n\n90\n00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,830\nSo there's a lot of things,\n\n91\n00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,640\na lot of moving parts that\nhave to happen here, right?\n\n92\n00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,260\nAnd so, we want to can't really zero\nin on those things as we start talking\n\n93\n00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,820\nabout business continuity and\ndisaster recovery planning.\n\n94\n00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,640\nNow as we do at the beginning of every\nsession or segment here as we talk about\n\n95\n00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,820\nthe beginning topic, I wanna remind you of\nthe three pillars of information security\n\n96\n00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,510\nmanagement that we focus on, so\nwe focus on continuity of services, right.\n\n97\n00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,980\nReally thinking about continuity services,\ncontinuity even of information\n\n98\n00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,430\nfrom the idea or\nthe perspective of availability, right.\n\n99\n00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,655\nSo when we talk about availability.\n\n100\n00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:12,565\nWe'll talk about integrity.\n\n101\n00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:14,475\nWe'll talk about confidentiality.\n\n102\n00:05:14,475 --> 00:05:17,345\nHere in particular,\ncontinuity of services,\n\n103\n00:05:17,345 --> 00:05:20,265\ncontinuity of information,\nreally all about availability.\n\n104\n00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:23,930\nSo we are gonna be focused very,\nvery heavy on availability in this area.\n\n105\n00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,420\nWe're interested in integrity.\n\n106\n00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,420\nWe wanna be aware of confidentiality.\n\n107\n00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,010\nWe wanna make sure our data\nstays secure during a disaster,\n\n108\n00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,750\nduring a business continuity event.\n\n109\n00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,190\nWe wanna make sure we\nhave integrity of data.\n\n110\n00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,440\nWe don't want those things\nto fall by the wayside, but\n\n111\n00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,310\nwe're not as concerned\nabout those in this area.\n\n112\n00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,490\nAs we really are about focusing\non restoring availability.\n\n113\n00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,790\nThat's the key criteria that we focus\non in this particular topical area.\n\n114\n00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,070\nSo just want to set the stage for\n\n115\n00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,520\nyou there make sure we're\nunderstanding the proper focus and\n\n116\n00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,020\nproper ratio of the mix of those\nthree terms as we get into this.\n\n117\n00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,450\nAnd then having said that,\nwe wanna start defining some terms.\n\n118\n00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,830\nSo I think we have some notes\nthat we wanna take a look at.\n\n119\n00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,990\nAnd so\nlet's start by defining what ultimately\n\n120\n00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,850\nthe goals of disaster recovery\nbusiness continuity are.\n\n121\n00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,830\nAnd so, we can see on the screen that\ndisaster recovery is really set up\n\n122\n00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,850\nto minimize the effects of a disaster.\n\n123\n00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,650\nSounds kind of like using\na word to describe a word, and\n\n124\n00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,130\nI often hate to do that.\n\n125\n00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,260\nBut it is a pretty succinct definition.\n\n126\n00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:23,280\nThe goal of disaster recovery is really\nto minimize the overall impact of that\n\n127\n00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,290\ndisaster, to give us breathing room,\nso to stop the bleeding if you will,\n\n128\n00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,920\nprevent us from going off the cliff.\n\n129\n00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,340\nThen as a result of stabilizing\nthe environment to that point,\n\n130\n00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,220\nmaking it safe enough that we\ncan now think about recovery.\n\n131\n00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,210\nAt that point, business continuity\nkicks in, and business continuity is\n\n132\n00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,570\nreally all about getting back to\nnormal as quickly as possible.\n\n133\n00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,560\nAnd so we define it as saying resume\nnormal business operations or\n\n134\n00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,040\nwhatever normal is in your world,\n\n135\n00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,890\nbecause you know normal means different\nthings to different businesses.\n\n136\n00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,125\nSome businesses are 24 by seven,\nsome are not.\n\n137\n00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:01,085\nSome run around the clock,\nevery day of the year without fail.\n\n138\n00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:06,025\nSo you think of something simple like\nrestaurants that may never close,\n\n139\n00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,085\nlike overnight restaurants.\n\n140\n00:07:07,085 --> 00:07:10,905\nIn the United States, here in the south\nespecially you have things like Denny's.\n\n141\n00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:11,925\nYou have Waffle House.\n\n142\n00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:14,305\nSome of these places that\njust never close their doors.\n\n143\n00:07:14,305 --> 00:07:16,105\nThey don't actually have\nlocks on their doors.\n\n144\n00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:19,580\nSo since they never close, they don't\nactually have a lock on the front door.\n\n145\n00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,110\nSo for them,\nnormal is we're just always open.\n\n146\n00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,420\nWe're always doing stuff.\n\n147\n00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,600\nBut for other companies, they lock\nthe door at a certain point in time.\n\n148\n00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,100\nThey have keys and they shut\nthe company down if you will, right?\n\n149\n00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,750\n9 o'clock at night or whatever it is.\n\n150\n00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,270\nSo get back to normal\nas quickly as possible.\n\n151\n00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,470\nAnd do so by expending the least\namount of resources right.\n\n152\n00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,894\nSo it's not just about whatever it takes\nto get back clearly what ever it takes we\n\n153\n00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:46,987\ngotta do but if we could do it for\nfive items right what ever those Resources\n\n154\n00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:49,917\nare instead of 12 you want to try and\ndo it for five.\n\n155\n00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:54,075\nBecause as a result of that were gonna\nsave resources that are necessary for\n\n156\n00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:56,453\nthe safety and well being of the business.\n\n157\n00:07:56,453 --> 00:08:00,076\nBut overall were gonna then be more\nhealthy as a result in the longer term.\n\n158\n00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:03,942\nWe're not spending as much Not\nwasting as many resources to recover.\n\n159\n00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:09,039\nSo DR, disaster recovery, all about\nminimizing the impact of the disaster,\n\n160\n00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,360\nstabilizing the situation.\n\n161\n00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,860\nAnd then, business continuity.\n\n162\n00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,270\nAll about taking that stabilized\nsituation, unnormal, not normal for\n\n163\n00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,530\nwhat is should be and\nreturning it to normal.\n\n164\n00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,142\nUnnormal, not a word, right?\n\n165\n00:08:21,142 --> 00:08:22,850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Anti-normal, something like that,\n\n166\n00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,060\nabnormal, right?\n\n167\n00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,000\nOr Abby normal as we used to\nsay when I was a little kid.\n\n168\n00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,230\nRight, so abnormal situation and\nreturn that back\n\n169\n00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:34,140\nto normal that's really what the goal\nof business continuity is going to be.\n\n170\n00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,610\nAnd so let's define some additional\nterms that are very high level but\n\n171\n00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,810\nalso very important for context here.\n\n172\n00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,170\nWe have disaster recovery plan,\nbusiness continuity plan and\n\n173\n00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,440\nbusiness continuity management.\n\n174\n00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,350\nI want to run through each\nof these with you quickly.\n\n175\n00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,190\nSo a DR plan, here,\n\n176\n00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,790\nwe should probably make a little space\njust to make them stand out a little bit.\n\n177\n00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,860\nSo disaster recovery plan, this is the\nbread and butter of the disaster recovery\n\n178\n00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,580\neffort this is the documented\nevidence of our planning cycle.\n\n179\n00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,680\nThis is the thing that we roll out and\nsay, okay step one is this,\n\n180\n00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,210\nstep two is this,\nyou go here, you do that.\n\n181\n00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,780\nThis is all written down in advance.\n\n182\n00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,960\nWe're gonna talk in detail\nabout how to do that, and\n\n183\n00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,400\ndo the documentation here as we go.\n\n184\n00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,780\nBut the Disaster Recovery Plan is\ncarried out when everything is going to\n\n185\n00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,870\nstill be suffering from\nthe effects of the disaster.\n\n186\n00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,470\nSo as we said, since the goal\nis to stabilize the environment\n\n187\n00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,410\nright after the disaster,\nthe disaster recovery plan is the manual.\n\n188\n00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:27,120\nIt's basically the guide that\ntells us how to do that.\n\n189\n00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,610\nHas to be written in advance,\ncan't make this up as you go.\n\n190\n00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,960\nI mean, you can, obviously in some cases\nyou do, because you can't plan for\n\n191\n00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,320\nevery disaster.\n\n192\n00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,440\nBut the reality is,\nyou should try to anticipate as a business\n\n193\n00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,270\nas many of the common disasters\nyou may face as possible.\n\n194\n00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:44,500\nAnd you then try to document\nyour responses to those.\n\n195\n00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,630\nSometimes we don't plan for\ncertain things, we can think of for\n\n196\n00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,470\ninstance, Hurricane Katrina\nseveral years ago.\n\n197\n00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,790\nIt took out basically the better\npart of downtown New Orleans,\n\n198\n00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,330\nwe can think of super storm Sandy\nwhich took out or at least flooded and\n\n199\n00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,650\nreally caused a lot of damage to\nthe upper east part of the united states.\n\n200\n00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,210\nNew York, New Jersey those areas up there.\n\n201\n00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,510\nWe can think of these once in a lifetime,\n\n202\n00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,890\nonce in a hundred year events that\nwe may not really have a plan for.\n\n203\n00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,940\nSome of the horrendous flooding that's\ntaking place out in the Midwest\n\n204\n00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,800\nin the last ten or 15 years, forest fires.\n\n205\n00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,200\nThese kinds of natural events or natural\ndisaster events, we may not plan for\n\n206\n00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,320\nthat doesn't mean that they don't happen.\n\n207\n00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,930\nAnd that doesn't mean that we're not\nresponsible for responding when they do.\n\n208\n00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,624\nBut, we may not see them as being so\nlikely that we sped the planning cycles on\n\n209\n00:10:31,624 --> 00:10:34,597\nthem, right,\nbecause it's just very unlikely to happen.\n\n210\n00:10:34,597 --> 00:10:38,556\nBut the problem is you also can't sit down\nand plan for every possibility because all\n\n211\n00:10:38,556 --> 00:10:41,250\nyou would do is plan and\nnever actually do anything else.\n\n212\n00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,240\nSo you have to really try to strike\na balance here between the most likely\n\n213\n00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,460\nevents that you will face as a business,\nwithin the next one to three years,\n\n214\n00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,860\nis a planning horizon.\n\n215\n00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,130\nBecause we have to revisit\nthese plans pretty often,\n\n216\n00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,390\nupdate them, deal with new events\nthat may come up, new situations.\n\n217\n00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,310\nWhenever you acquire a business,\nwhenever you are acquired by somebody,\n\n218\n00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,610\nwhenever you change or in anyway\nmodify the stance of the business,\n\n219\n00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:08,320\nDR plans have to be, and BCP plans,\nhave to be revisited and updated.\n\n220\n00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,360\nBecause, as a result of that change,\n\n221\n00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,590\nthe plan may not actually reflect\nthe current operating environment.\n\n222\n00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,010\nAnd so, this is where I see a lot of\ncompanies hitting a bump in the road,\n\n223\n00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,430\nif you will, around DR.\n\n224\n00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,310\nBecause as I come in and work with them,\nas I come in and spend time with them,\n\n225\n00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,940\nI'm doing auditing and we're checking the\nintegrity of the plans, things like that.\n\n226\n00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,370\nOr, we're going through a testing cycle\nand they roll the plan out, they kind of\n\n227\n00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,710\nwalk through it We'll talk about what\nsome of those tests are later on.\n\n228\n00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,970\nWhat we often find is the plan\nhasn't been updated recently.\n\n229\n00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,040\nSo things like contact numbers.\n\n230\n00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,400\nWhere people are, how to find them,\nwhat office they work at.\n\n231\n00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,590\nThose kind of things may not be\nup to date, and so, as a result,\n\n232\n00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,960\nif you don't have an update call list and\nyou go into a disaster mode.\n\n233\n00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,380\nYou're trying to notify people,\nget them online,\n\n234\n00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,350\nget them into a safe area\nwhere they can do work.\n\n235\n00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:57,690\nPerhaps get them out of certain areas\nthat may not be safe and into others.\n\n236\n00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,640\nIt's impossible to contact them.\n\n237\n00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,410\nNothing worse than having to go\nthrough everybody's cell phones\n\n238\n00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,930\nsitting around a table trying to compare\ncall numbers, contact numbers for\n\n239\n00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,940\npeople in the middle of a disaster\ncuz you don't have an accurate list.\n\n240\n00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,160\nAnd I've seen that happen.\n\n241\n00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,750\nI've actually seen people\nhaving to sit around a table\n\n242\n00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,920\nget out their personal cell phones and\ntrying to figure out how to reach people.\n\n243\n00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,670\nAnd that's not a good place to be\nwhen you're executing your DR plan.\n\n244\n00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,810\nSo you've really gotta be\nthinking about these things and\n\n245\n00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,530\nbe focused on them as we start talking\nabout how we're gonna build these plans.\n\n246\n00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,370\nSo the DR plan, the disaster recovery\nplan, carried out while everything's still\n\n247\n00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:31,800\nbasically suffering from\nthe effects of the disaster.\n\n248\n00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,500\nThink of this as the immediate response,\nwhat they call first response or\n\n249\n00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,210\nfirst responder plan, right?\n\n250\n00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,130\nWho's gonna get there first,\nwhat are they gonna find,\n\n251\n00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,110\nand what are they gonna do\nto stabilize the situation?\n\n252\n00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,690\nThat's really what the DR\nplan is all about.\n\n253\n00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:47,510\nBusiness Continuity Plan, a BCP plan.\n\n254\n00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,300\nThis is gonna kick in after the immediate\ndisaster recovery takes place.\n\n255\n00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,120\nSo after we stabilize, now this is\ngonna be what we call going home, or\n\n256\n00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,550\nreturning to normal.\n\n257\n00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:04,460\nRight, this is the slang or off-line terms\nyou often hear in BCP and DR plannings.\n\n258\n00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,770\nYou talk to professionals that do this,\nthey talk about going home when they talk\n\n259\n00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,465\nabout doing BCP, because they want to\ntalk about getting back to normal.\n\n260\n00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:15,365\nThis is really kind of how we return\nthe business to normal daily operations.\n\n261\n00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:19,985\nNow what we have to do incrementally,\nin process very well defined in\n\n262\n00:13:19,985 --> 00:13:23,585\nthe timeline to be able to do that\nin steps to get back to normal.\n\n263\n00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:25,625\nAnd we're going to\napproach normal slowly but\n\n264\n00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,275\nsurely until we actually\ncross that threshold.\n\n265\n00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:32,715\nAnd then business continuity management,\nBCM, this is the overarching process,\n\n266\n00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:37,510\nthe umbrella framework that is going\nto sit over the top of both DRP and\n\n267\n00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,090\nBCP and is gonna help manage it,\ngonna be responsible for it.\n\n268\n00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,610\nIt is the process that the business\nengages in overall to then set up and\n\n269\n00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,820\nmanage BRP, or a BCP rather, and DRP.\n\n270\n00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,520\nSo business continuity, management is\nthe framework, the overarching process.\n\n271\n00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,710\nSo these are the component pieces, the\narchitectural modules or elements we're\n\n272\n00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:02,410\ngonna use to build up our knowledge of how\nwe engage in these particular activities.\n\n273\n00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,620\nSo starting with that,\n\n274\n00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,490\none of the first things I wanna talk about\nis the NIST standard that is out there.\n\n275\n00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,630\nThe special publication, NIST SP800-34.\n\n276\n00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,710\nWe've talked about some of these\nNIST references in some other areas,\n\n277\n00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,452\nin some other conversations we've had.\n\n278\n00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:18,200\nWe've taken you out to the website\nto show you where they are, and\n\n279\n00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,350\nI know Don has included the reference for\nthis one, here.\n\n280\n00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,650\nAnd so,\nthis is the continuity planning guide for\n\n281\n00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,080\nIT, and what we thought we were doing,\nI think, Don,\n\n282\n00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,090\nyou did this was, we dropped everybody in\nwith this URL on the search page, right?\n\n283\n00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:31,700\nAnd so, then,\n\n284\n00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,700\nwe could just kind of take them down, show\nthem quickly how to do the search, right?\n\n285\n00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,560\nAnd so if you just go down it's\njumbled up because it's numerical.\n\n286\n00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,720\nBut it's not necessarily gonna flow\nin the order you think it goes from\n\n287\n00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,590\nhighest to lowest.\n\n288\n00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:47,320\nSo you gotta go down almost to\nthe bottom to actually find it.\n\n289\n00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,260\nBut when you see that one there for rev\none, the thing that Don pointed out when I\n\n290\n00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,920\ntook him to this, and said, hey let's\nput the URL on there, is wow, not just\n\n291\n00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,610\nthe actual, in this publication but also\na bunch of templates are there as well.\n\n292\n00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,120\nAnd I think we can see those.\n\n293\n00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,600\nSo you'll see that we have\na bunch of these templates\n\n294\n00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,825\nthat are available that\nNIST has put together.\n\n295\n00:15:04,825 --> 00:15:08,120\nAnd one of the things I recommend you\nlook at doing is if you don't get your\n\n296\n00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,320\ntemplates from here,\nget them from somewhere, but\n\n297\n00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,100\ndownload some of these templates,\ntake a look at them, and\n\n298\n00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,580\nunderstand that if you don't know how to\ndo some of these things, like doing a BIA,\n\n299\n00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,440\nwe'll talk about business impact\nanalysis in a little while.\n\n300\n00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,030\nOr doing some contingency planning there\nfor low, moderate, or high impact systems.\n\n301\n00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,960\nThat this template will allow\nyou to fill in the blanks, and\n\n302\n00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,870\nstart to begin to frame\nthe business impact analysis.\n\n303\n00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,880\nSo it's gonna be a very\nvaluable resource for you.\n\n304\n00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,730\nThey're free.\n\n305\n00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:35,810\nYou can use them freely.\n\n306\n00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,460\nThey're meant for redistribution.\n\n307\n00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,980\nThere's no licensing involved,\n\n308\n00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,840\nso there's no issues with you\ndownloading them and using them.\n\n309\n00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,520\nAnd as a result of that, if you're not\nfamiliar with how to do a business impact\n\n310\n00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,280\nanalysis or a risk assessment, or\ngather that information up and\n\n311\n00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,090\nput it into a usable form, this will\nkick start your initiative there.\n\n312\n00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:54,946\nReally help you to get going.\n\n313\n00:15:54,946 --> 00:15:57,886\nWe'd also mentioned in one\nof our earlier discussions,\n\n314\n00:15:57,886 --> 00:16:01,387\nthe fact that the SANs reading room\nhas a lot of policies available.\n\n315\n00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:05,235\nThey don't have as much on this particular\ntopic per say that you can just download.\n\n316\n00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:08,276\nBut they do have some very valuable\nresources there to take a look at as well.\n\n317\n00:16:08,276 --> 00:16:11,596\nAnd there are a bunch of other websites\nout there that will be helpful for\n\n318\n00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:15,638\nbusiness continuity and disaster recovery\nplanning generically that you should just\n\n319\n00:16:15,638 --> 00:16:18,190\nbe looking at and\nperhaps doing a Google search on.\n\n320\n00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,430\nSo, gather that tool box of resources and\nstart to think about using them.\n\n321\n00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,380\nBut the continuity planning guide for\nIT, what missed in other words in their\n\n322\n00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,250\nspecial publication here,\nputs out is a seven step process.\n\n323\n00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,290\nAnd this is the process that we really\nuse to drive through the methodology\n\n324\n00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,270\naround disaster recovery planning.\n\n325\n00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,200\nAnd this is a pretty well accepted,\nuniversally accepted solution today.\n\n326\n00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,880\nSo the seven steps are listed\non the screen in front of you.\n\n327\n00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,950\nWe see develop the continuity\nplanning policy statement.\n\n328\n00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,440\nWhat is the intent, the focus if you will,\nof continuity planning.\n\n329\n00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,680\nWhat are we going to be focused on?\n\n330\n00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,610\nWhat are the things that\nwe want to encompass there?\n\n331\n00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,050\nConduct a business impact analysis,\nwhat's known as the BIA.\n\n332\n00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,730\nWe'll take a look at the business impact\nanalysis in depth in a few minutes.\n\n333\n00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,460\nBut the BIA, the concept there, is the\nidea of understanding how to prioritize\n\n334\n00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:09,910\nwhat are the critical business factors,\nwhat we call the CBFs for the business.\n\n335\n00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,000\nWhat are the systems, and what\nare the things the business really needs\n\n336\n00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,340\nin order to stay online and\ndo its job everyday?\n\n337\n00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,410\nRank those in priority order and\n\n338\n00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:20,800\nthen have an assessment of their\nimpact if they were to go offline.\n\n339\n00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,580\nWhat would be the downside to that?\n\n340\n00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,400\nAnd then understand how to\ndo restore all operations.\n\n341\n00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,690\nRestore all is just a word for recovery.\n\n342\n00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,290\nSo how do we do restore all\noperations in priority order?\n\n343\n00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,130\nIn order to make sure we bring\nthe business back as quickly as possible.\n\n344\n00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,490\nThat's basically what\nthe BIA will tell us.\n\n345\n00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,700\nIdentify preventative controls.\n\n346\n00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,820\nDevelop recovery strategies.\n\n347\n00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,710\nDevelop the contingency plan.\n\n348\n00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,260\nSo in other words,\n\n349\n00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,240\ngo through think about the things that we\nshould do to put controls in place to help\n\n350\n00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,020\nus understand how to mitigate,\nminimize the overall impact.\n\n351\n00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,540\nDevelop recovery strategies,\nso if there is impact,\n\n352\n00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,420\neven though we minimize it,\nhow are we then, going to recover.\n\n353\n00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,240\nSo an example here,\nwould be in South Florida,\n\n354\n00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,110\nwe have some rain going on,\nwe're not quite in hurricane season yet,\n\n355\n00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,010\nbut we are getting ready to arc into that,\nin the next month or two here.\n\n356\n00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,290\nWhen we think about preventative controls,\nin the Southern,\n\n357\n00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,260\nspecifically the South-Eastern\npart of the United States.\n\n358\n00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,397\nWhat we're thinking about is,\nreally dealing with,\n\n359\n00:18:13,397 --> 00:18:17,720\nfrom let's say maybe late May or\nJune into maybe November or\n\n360\n00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,780\nDecember, we're dealing\nwith weather events.\n\n361\n00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,100\nRight?\nSevere weather.\n\n362\n00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,940\nSo we would want to have\npreventative controls in place,\n\n363\n00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,280\nthings like sandbags if\nwe're at ground level.\n\n364\n00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,300\nWe may wanna have disaster insurance,\nwe may wanna have windstorm insurance,\n\n365\n00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,570\nthings like this.\n\n366\n00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,740\nWould be different kinds of controls\nthat we would put in place.\n\n367\n00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,420\nSome are gonna transfer risk,\nothers are gonna mitigate it,\n\n368\n00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,190\nminimize it, things like that.\n\n369\n00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,420\nBut, we wanna make sure\nwe have storm shutters.\n\n370\n00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,565\nRight?\nAnd we wanna make sure we have\n\n371\n00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:44,570\nhurricane-resistant glass.\n\n372\n00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,592\nWe wanna make sure our\nbuildings are built to code so\n\n373\n00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,540\nthey can withstand certain kinda weather.\n\n374\n00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,320\nAll these kinda things would help us.\n\n375\n00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,920\nRight?\n\n376\n00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,140\nAnd then develop the contingency plan,\nso what are we gonna do,\n\n377\n00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,850\nwhat is our alternate plan.\n\n378\n00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,320\nIf this does happen,\nwhat are we going to be able to do?\n\n379\n00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,080\nAre we gonna have an alternate site?\n\n380\n00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,580\nAre we gonna be able to go\nsomewhere else and operate.\n\n381\n00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,790\nAre we just gonna wait it out?\n\n382\n00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:05,330\nThere's all these different\nthings we could do.\n\n383\n00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,130\nTest those plans, whatever they are,\nconduct training and\n\n384\n00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,520\nexercises to make sure\neverybody is aware of the plan.\n\n385\n00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,620\nSo the greatest plans in the world\nsit on the shelf and are never used.\n\n386\n00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,930\nBut if nobody knows about them, then\nthey're gonna be totally worthless to us.\n\n387\n00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:20,470\nRight?\n\n388\n00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,780\nSo we have to make sure everybody is\npainfully aware of the plan of what has to\n\n389\n00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,880\nhappen with it.\n\n390\n00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,180\nAnd then maintain the plan.\n\n391\n00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,230\nAnd what often happens is, the business,\nthrough a variety of reasons and issues\n\n392\n00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:36,380\nand concerns, does a pretty good job\nat some combination of one through six.\n\n393\n00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,110\nAnd then tends to put the plan on\nthe shelf that clears victory,\n\n394\n00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,990\nsays okay we're good, we got a plan,\nmay test it once or twice, but\n\n395\n00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,330\nthen overtime just gets a little lazy.\n\n396\n00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:47,920\nDoesn't really focus on it,\nunfortunately, as much as they should,\n\n397\n00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,740\nand what happens is that\nplan tends to atrophy.\n\n398\n00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,160\nIt doesn't get maintained\nas well as it should.\n\n399\n00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,430\nAs I said, technology changes.\n\n400\n00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,950\nRight?\nOpportunities within the business\n\n401\n00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,770\nmay arrive, may go in a different\ndirection, the look and\n\n402\n00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,310\nthe feel of the business will change.\n\n403\n00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:04,960\nAnd if the plan isn't brought out and kept\nup to date, then unfortunately find out\n\n404\n00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,530\nthe hard way when we do go to execute\nthe plan several years down the road,\n\n405\n00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:10,720\nthat we have a lot of things\nthat are not in the plan.\n\n406\n00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,910\nOne of the big things,\nbig advents of technology that\n\n407\n00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,465\ncaught a lot of businesses off guard with\nthese plans from the last several years.\n\n408\n00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:21,400\nIt was this whole phenomenon of\nbringing in the consumer electronics\n\n409\n00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,420\ninto the businesses, what we call\ngenerically, again big marketing.\n\n410\n00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,380\nI love this idea.\n\n411\n00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,250\nLet's just throw a word out there and\ncall it something.\n\n412\n00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,235\nAnd we won't really define it but\neverybody will kind of go along with it.\n\n413\n00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:31,770\nSo, that's how Cloud computing started.\n\n414\n00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,270\nRight?\n\n415\n00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,980\nBut this idea of BYOD,\nbring your own device,\n\n416\n00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,130\nnow we just call it\nMobile Device Management.\n\n417\n00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,270\nBut this idea of allowing end users to\nbring in things like Smart Phones and\n\n418\n00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,910\nhook them up to the corporate network.\n\n419\n00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:47,760\nSo if your disaster recovery plan\ndoes not address that in some way,\n\n420\n00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,690\nthen the problem becomes how do\nyou maintain a plan like that.\n\n421\n00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,580\nWhere everybody is expected to\nbe able to consume mail and\n\n422\n00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,860\nas a result get notified of events.\n\n423\n00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,570\nOn a device that you haven't even\nthought about how you're gonna\n\n424\n00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,370\nultimately maintain.\n\n425\n00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,640\nAnd more importantly,\n\n426\n00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,935\nif part of your plan is you're gonna be\nnotifying people not just by email, but\n\n427\n00:21:04,935 --> 00:21:08,970\nyou're gonna be notifying people via SMS,\nvia short text messages.\n\n428\n00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,350\nAre you set up to do that?\n\n429\n00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,490\nDo you have the capabilities to do that?\n\n430\n00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,780\nDo you have the right\namount of support for\n\n431\n00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,130\neach platform that you\nwould need to SMS to?\n\n432\n00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,895\nSo these are the kind of things that\nyou have to really think about there.\n\n433\n00:21:19,895 --> 00:21:21,300\nRight?\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n434\n00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,390\nThese are all the seven steps that\nare laid out by NIST, if you will.\n\n435\n00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,480\nWhen we get past NIST,\nwe had some other standards.\n\n436\n00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,220\nWe just want to throw out a few quickly.\n\n437\n00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,970\nJust to make sure you're aware of them.\n\n438\n00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,060\nI would not spend too much time going out\nand learning about these other standards.\n\n439\n00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,410\nThey're really more references,\nor referential material for you.\n\n440\n00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,005\nBut BS, BS stands for British Standard,\nat least in this context anyway.\n\n441\n00:21:43,005 --> 00:21:45,160\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So British Standard 25999,\n\n442\n00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,800\nwhich is the British Standard For\nbusiness continuity management.\n\n443\n00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,450\nWe have the URLs to be able to give\nyou some landing page information and\n\n444\n00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,770\nsome context around these there.\n\n445\n00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,450\nThere are a couple of ISO standards that\nare also pertinent and prevalent here.\n\n446\n00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,240\nISO 27031, published,\nat least the update to it, in 2011.\n\n447\n00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,730\nBusiness continuity planning\nstandards from ISO there.\n\n448\n00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,650\nAnd then ISO 22301, published in 2012,\nor updated last in 2012.\n\n449\n00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:18,150\nBusiness continuity management system.\n\n450\n00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:24,730\nSo, the overarching management system, the\nBCM, is discussed in this ISO standard.\n\n451\n00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,250\nSo, we wanna make sure we have all\nthree of those noted out there for you.\n\n452\n00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,390\n>> And just a little thing to throw out\nthat Adam reminded me of before the show.\n\n453\n00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,900\nI put the links in here\ndirectly to the ISO.\n\n454\n00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,360\nBecause they're the organization that\ncreates these things and they've got them.\n\n455\n00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,450\nBut I want to remind you guys that\nthey don't make their standards\n\n456\n00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,650\navailable for free.\n\n457\n00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,710\nSo if you want to learn more about\nthem you can go to the ISO site,\n\n458\n00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,280\nI put the URL right to it.\n\n459\n00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,300\nBut I didn't price the first one.\n\n460\n00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,310\nI know the second was about 160 U.S.\ndollars to download the actual standard.\n\n461\n00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,670\nSo sometimes you're better off\nfinding research other places.\n\n462\n00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,200\nYou can find, I hate to say it, but\n\n463\n00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,590\nWikipedia articles,\nthings like that that kind of detail it.\n\n464\n00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,030\nIf you wanna learn more about those great.\n\n465\n00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,850\nBut just having a cursory understanding\nof them is usually enough.\n\n466\n00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:05,975\n>> Absolutely, that's a good point.\n\n467\n00:23:05,975 --> 00:23:09,990\nAnd you want to be aware of the fact that\na lot of these things, unfortunately for\n\n468\n00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,700\na variety of reasons,\nyou do have to pay for them and\n\n469\n00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,600\nthat kind of begs the question.\n\n470\n00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,870\nWell if you do have to pay for them how\nare we supposed to understand them?\n\n471\n00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,085\nAnd if we can't pay for\nthem what do we do?\n\n472\n00:23:18,085 --> 00:23:21,370\nAnd it's unfortunate, but\nyou have to think the context of this,\n\n473\n00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,620\nwhich is that these standards\nare really designed for\n\n474\n00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,960\nbusinesses to be able to recover,\nnot for individuals.\n\n475\n00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,060\nYou as a practitioner in a business\nas a CISSB, want to be aware of them.\n\n476\n00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,710\nThe thought process is typically\nthe business makes the investment\n\n477\n00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:36,450\nas part of the overall\nBCP/DRP planning cycle\n\n478\n00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,070\nas one of the resources to bring to\nthe table to get access to the standards.\n\n479\n00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,570\nSo you as a professional\nwill then be well armed in\n\n480\n00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,830\norder to be able to execute on them.\n\n481\n00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,280\nSo, that may or may not work.\n\n482\n00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,280\nIf you're in a small business, you know.\n\n483\n00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,200\nListen, $160 for\n\n484\n00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,170\na piece of paper is expensive and it may\nnot be in the budget for a small business.\n\n485\n00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,470\nSo I get that, and we do understand that.\n\n486\n00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,533\nBut at the end of the day,\n\n487\n00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:59,076\na lot of this is also just plain\nold fashioned common sense.\n\n488\n00:23:59,076 --> 00:24:02,586\nAnd so we try to extract the most\nimportant elements out of those documents\n\n489\n00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:03,895\nand relay them to you here.\n\n490\n00:24:03,895 --> 00:24:06,112\nLike the seven step process\nwe just went through.\n\n491\n00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:09,931\nIf you can follow that process, you're\ngonna hit it basically on the mark and\n\n492\n00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:13,631\nget it right, even if you don't follow\nthe exact laid out step by step guide\n\n493\n00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:18,410\nin the ISO material you're still gonna be\nokay and that's the most important thing.\n\n494\n00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:22,220\nSo having said that, probably one of the\nthings to frame this conversation around\n\n495\n00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,970\nas we begin to really\nget into the details,\n\n496\n00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,705\nstart to finding out what the high\nlevels of what these plans look like.\n\n497\n00:24:26,705 --> 00:24:29,370\nIs to step back and think about a question\n\n498\n00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,135\nthat is very crucial to our\nunderstanding of how to be successful.\n\n499\n00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:36,200\nAnd we often talk about asking\nquestions when we're young, we grow up,\n\n500\n00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,290\nwe hear that,\nat least in the United States, anyway.\n\n501\n00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:43,020\nWe often talked about questions, we talk\nabout this idea of the five W's and the H.\n\n502\n00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,570\nSo, we learn in school and I found,\n\n503\n00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,970\nas I've traveled around the world, that\nthis is kind of a universal phenomenon.\n\n504\n00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,130\nThis is not just a US thing,\n\n505\n00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,090\nbut maybe framed differently\ndepending on where you grew up.\n\n506\n00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:57,050\nBut at the end of the day, there are a\nseries of questions that if we just ask,\n\n507\n00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,740\nwe tend to find out a lot about\nthings that are going on around us.\n\n508\n00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,680\nSo, the five W's and\nthe H is how we refer to them here.\n\n509\n00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,950\nThe who, what, when, where,\nwhy and, of course, the how.\n\n510\n00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:10,630\nYou know the five questions and\nthen the plus one for six, for the how,\n\n511\n00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,970\nthat if we ask overall, are really gonna\nhelp frame and extract context for us.\n\n512\n00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,840\nAnd so of those questions,\nall of them equally important.\n\n513\n00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,450\nBut of them, one really stands out\na little bit is more important I think\n\n514\n00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,930\nthan the context of BCP and\nDRP than perhaps some of others.\n\n515\n00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,010\nAnd that question is why?\n\n516\n00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,980\nSo if we think about asking why.\n\n517\n00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,230\nWhy are we planning for this event?\n\n518\n00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,710\nWhy are we doing things this way?\n\n519\n00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,830\nWhy is this considered more important,\nmore of a priority to restore than that?\n\n520\n00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:43,620\nWe begin to really start to press\nthe business and really think about\n\n521\n00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:48,570\npressing the business to give us answers\nthat are not just gonna be tactical,\n\n522\n00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,580\nbut are also going to be a little\nbit higher level and more strategic.\n\n523\n00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,910\nAnd most importantly we are going to strip\naway all of the preconceived notions,\n\n524\n00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:00,370\nstrip away all of the opinions, and\nif we ask why in the right sequence and\n\n525\n00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:03,570\nover the right amount of time,\nwe don't stop asking\n\n526\n00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,240\nuntil we get really to bedrock,\nto the very, very base answers.\n\n527\n00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,190\nWhere there really is\nno additional answer.\n\n528\n00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,190\nWe just keep asking why,\nand at the end of the day,\n\n529\n00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,790\nthe last answer is really the final one.\n\n530\n00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,700\nWe've gotten something very crucial to\nBCP and DRP, which is root cause and\n\n531\n00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,230\nif we can get down to root cause,\nwe call this root cause analysis.\n\n532\n00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:26,200\nBut if we get down to root cause,\nand if we get that last why and\n\n533\n00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,920\nwe get that proper answer,\n\n534\n00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,370\nnow we really have the information we\nneed to make the decisions properly.\n\n535\n00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:37,550\nIf the answer to why do we need\nto restore the mail system\n\n536\n00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:42,370\nbefore we install or restore the file and\nprint system is that mail\n\n537\n00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:47,320\nis the most important business process\nthat we have to drive interaction with our\n\n538\n00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,190\ncustomers then that's really gonna help\nus to frame the right prioritization\n\n539\n00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:55,740\nof system restoral within the DRP and\nBCP planning cycle.\n\n540\n00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,000\nIf we don't ask that question and we say,\nyou know we're just, we think we got to\n\n541\n00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,380\nprint a bunch of stuff out you know, so\nwe're gonna need to do file and print,\n\n542\n00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,680\nwe don't know if it's more important or\nless important than email or phone.\n\n543\n00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,670\nSo we're just gonna start there and\njust bring it back online.\n\n544\n00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,960\nWell, yeah, that may or\nmay not be good, and we always want to,\n\n545\n00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,650\nobviously, restore all systems eventually,\nbut we need some systems before others\n\n546\n00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,790\nto make sure we can start reaching out and\ndoing things, right.\n\n547\n00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,500\nSo, if we don't have this ideal of why,\n\n548\n00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,415\nwe don't have mastery of this\nidea of root cause, we're gonna\n\n549\n00:27:24,415 --> 00:27:27,805\nrun into some difficulties about\nrestoring systems in the right order.\n\n550\n00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:30,635\nThis is gonna be a very important thought\nprocess for you and this is a thought\n\n551\n00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:35,175\nprocess that comes to us, by the way,\nnot just from this idea of DRP and BCP.\n\n552\n00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:39,335\nWe see this idea of root cause in almost\nany management framework you can look\n\n553\n00:27:39,335 --> 00:27:40,185\nat today.\n\n554\n00:27:40,185 --> 00:27:42,965\nCertainly we see it in iTill,\nif you are a student of or\n\n555\n00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:45,730\nperhaps knowledgeable around iTill.\n\n556\n00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,530\nWe see this in COBIT,\nwhich is an IT governance\n\n557\n00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:52,820\nframework that helps to understand\nthe impact of regulatory compliance in IT.\n\n558\n00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:56,950\nWe see it in just about any framework\ntoday that touches IT in some way\n\n559\n00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:01,160\nbecause this idea of understanding root\ncause, of getting down to why, is so\n\n560\n00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,290\ncritical to success.\n\n561\n00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,688\nCuz it helps us to focus\nin on the real need, and\n\n562\n00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:07,530\nas a result address that\nneed in the proper way.\n\n563\n00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,330\nRight, so it's gonna be very,\nvery important.\n\n564\n00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:13,200\nSo when we think about that, think about\nasking why, as we frame this discussion.\n\n565\n00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,650\nIt will help you to really make\nsure you're on the right track and\n\n566\n00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:18,250\nvalidate the information that\nyou're hearing from everybody.\n\n567\n00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,660\nAll right, very good.\n\n568\n00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,590\nI think we have probably.\n\n569\n00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,350\nThought we reached a good break point for\nthe moment.\n\n570\n00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:25,810\n>> Yeah, our next topic is BCP policy,\nwhich is a pretty big chunk.\n\n571\n00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:26,520\n>> Absolutely.\n\n572\n00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,360\n>> So, yeah, let's stop here and\ntake a break.\n\n573\n00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,210\nWhen we get back, we're gonna dive\ndeeper into really all the different\n\n574\n00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,560\nthings that we've talked about so far.\n\n575\n00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,000\nWe've got a lot more to go through.\n\n576\n00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,860\nIt's a really good stuff.\n\n577\n00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,646\nSo definitely stay tuned\nwe'll be back after this.\n\n578\n00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:44,670\n[MUSIC]\n\n579\n00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,552\nGorgeous.\n\n580\n00:28:45,552 --> 00:28:47,870\n[LAUGH]\n>> [LAUGH] All right.\n\n581\n00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:52,885\n>> All right, so our queue here was the\nsadness that our director was giving us.\n\n582\n00:28:52,885 --> 00:28:56,830\n[LAUGH]\nLet's restart that one just,\n\n583\n00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,680\nI don't have a good way\nto play that one off.\n\n584\n00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,028\nAnd sometimes I can parley\nit into a good show start.\n\n585\n00:29:02,028 --> 00:29:04,997\n[LAUGH]\n>> All right\n\n586\n00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:12,717\n[MUSIC]\n\n587\n00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:14,640\nAll right, welcome back, everybody.\n\n588\n00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,370\nSo we were talking about some standard And\nI threw up some URLs.\n\n589\n00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,220\nAnd during the break, Adam,\n\n590\n00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,750\nyou had a really good one that we\nwanted to kind of add to that list.\n\n591\n00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:23,300\n>> I did, I did.\n\n592\n00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,310\nSo just I was thinking as we took a quick\nbreak, there's another really good site\n\n593\n00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,720\nthat you guys might wanna use\nas a reference point as well.\n\n594\n00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,960\nSo I asked Don to put it on the notes and\nlook it up for us real quick.\n\n595\n00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,240\nHomeland Security, Department of Homeland\nSecurity here in the United States,\n\n596\n00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,110\nhas a kind of a BCP kit in a box for\nsmall and medium sized businesses.\n\n597\n00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,120\nAnd it actually is a very good\nreference point, very good resource,\n\n598\n00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,700\nvery thorough for you guys.\n\n599\n00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,560\nSo we put the URL up there for\n\n600\n00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,570\nyou, ready.gov,\nbusiness continuity planning suite.\n\n601\n00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,670\nIf you go there, you can actually\njust follow the instructions.\n\n602\n00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,730\nThere's a link and some General\njust explanation of what's there.\n\n603\n00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,760\nYou download it and it's got all\nthe templates and all the tools necessary\n\n604\n00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,760\nto do this for a small business,\nkind of get you kick started there.\n\n605\n00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,440\nSo thought that might be another good\nresource that would be valuable for you.\n\n606\n00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,060\nAll right, so let's talk about\nBCP policy just a little bit,\n\n607\n00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,720\nBusiness Continuity Policy,\nHow do we set it up.\n\n608\n00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,710\nKinda what are the processes involved.\n\n609\n00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,060\nWe're gonna walk through\nthe thought process here.\n\n610\n00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,267\nSo the BCP policy overall is supposed to\nsupply our framework and governance for\n\n611\n00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:19,660\nus, for the BCP efforts.\n\n612\n00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,928\nThe idea is we're gonna\ncreate this document and\n\n613\n00:30:21,928 --> 00:30:25,693\nit's gonna really guide us through\nthe business continuity recovery process,\n\n614\n00:30:25,693 --> 00:30:28,032\nreally understanding\nwhat's happening there.\n\n615\n00:30:28,032 --> 00:30:29,390\nSo it's our playbook in effect.\n\n616\n00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,302\nThat's often what we refer to it as.\n\n617\n00:30:31,302 --> 00:30:35,890\nIt's gonna have the scope, the mission\nstatement, the principles guidelines and\n\n618\n00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,170\nthe standards that all have to be\ndetailed out around business continuity.\n\n619\n00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,300\nSo this is going to literally be our\nreference point for everything we do.\n\n620\n00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,980\nIf it's done the right way, we'll be that\nauthoritative resource in other words.\n\n621\n00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,090\nSo the processes that are involved,\nor the process involved,\n\n622\n00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,370\nthe ten steps in the process involved to\ndraft the policy are drafted here, and\n\n623\n00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,030\nlet's go through them.\n\n624\n00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,670\nLet's just touch on them,\nlet's make sure we know what they are.\n\n625\n00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,240\nAnd, so, step one, identify and\n\n626\n00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,780\ndocument all the components\nthat need to be in the policy.\n\n627\n00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,135\nWe listed a lot of the things that\nare going to be in there up above.\n\n628\n00:31:03,135 --> 00:31:06,305\nThe scope, mission statement,\nprinciples, guidelines, standards.\n\n629\n00:31:06,305 --> 00:31:08,963\nSo we're gonna identify and\ndocument all of those.\n\n630\n00:31:08,963 --> 00:31:12,385\nWe're then gonna identify and define\nexisting policies that could already be in\n\n631\n00:31:12,385 --> 00:31:15,875\nplace, and may have an impact\nin some way on the BCP effort.\n\n632\n00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:19,367\nSo if we have standing policies\nalready around certain systems,\n\n633\n00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:22,407\ntheir usage, guidelines for\nthem, things of that nature.\n\n634\n00:31:22,407 --> 00:31:25,407\nSLA's, service level\nagreements that explain and\n\n635\n00:31:25,407 --> 00:31:28,907\ndocument how they have to be made\navailable under what circumstances,\n\n636\n00:31:28,907 --> 00:31:31,830\nand what down time means and\nhow we define that.\n\n637\n00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,760\nAll those things have to be made aware, or\nwe have to be made aware of the BCP policy\n\n638\n00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,980\nplanning effort, so that we align\nwith those, right, and we don't,\n\n639\n00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,660\nin effect, violate all the work that's\nbeen done on the outside of the business,\n\n640\n00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,230\nto make sure that we can\nthen recover accordingly.\n\n641\n00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:48,660\nIdentify pertinent laws and standards,\nso this will be item number three.\n\n642\n00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,416\nThere may be regulatory and\n\n643\n00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:55,265\nstatutory and compliance regimes we\nhave to be aware of and deal with.\n\n644\n00:31:55,265 --> 00:31:58,916\nSo for instance my clients that\nare in the biopharma industries, so\n\n645\n00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:00,967\nthe biopharmaceutical industries,\n\n646\n00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:05,387\nmy clients in the financial services\nindustries, my clients in healthcare, and\n\n647\n00:32:05,387 --> 00:32:08,862\nextractive resource mining and\nmanagement, all these areas.\n\n648\n00:32:08,862 --> 00:32:12,830\nAlso defense in general, so\nthe defense contractors, things like that.\n\n649\n00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:16,602\nAll of them that I work with,\nall have laws and standards and\n\n650\n00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:19,847\nregulatory regimes that they\nhave to be aware of and\n\n651\n00:32:19,847 --> 00:32:24,390\nthey have to align to in relation\nto business continuity planning.\n\n652\n00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,042\nBecause, if they violate these\nstandards and the attempt to recover,\n\n653\n00:32:28,042 --> 00:32:33,000\nthey're gonna have federal, typically more\noften than not, federal regulatory issues.\n\n654\n00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,260\nThere typically are financial\npenalties involved.\n\n655\n00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,060\nThere may be jail time involved\ndepending on what it is and\n\n656\n00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,550\nhow severe that particular issue is.\n\n657\n00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,240\nSo these are pretty serious things\nthat we have to be aware of.\n\n658\n00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,010\nAnd we have to make sure\nwe incorporate them, and\n\n659\n00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:50,470\nthe thought process around them into\nour BCP policy and planning cycles.\n\n660\n00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,060\nSo it's very important to go out and\nfind those things and be aware of them.\n\n661\n00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,910\nIdentify best practices.\n\n662\n00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,180\nWhat's going on in the industry?\n\n663\n00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,360\nWhat are we going to do?\n\n664\n00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,710\nWhat is the best way to\nrecover that mail system?\n\n665\n00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,500\nIs there a documented best standard\nfrom the vendor that we can look at and\n\n666\n00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,730\nsay well this is what we do.\n\n667\n00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,590\nAnd if we do it this way, usually,\npretty much without exception it works.\n\n668\n00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,180\nIf we go off on our own and kinda do\nour own thing, may or may not work.\n\n669\n00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,720\nRight?\nSo this is the thing we really\n\n670\n00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,630\nwanna look to.\n\n671\n00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,340\nThe idea here is we're,\nwe really wanna bring common sense, and\n\n672\n00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:20,500\nI've talked about this in some\nof our other discussions.\n\n673\n00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,930\nBring common sense to the table.\n\n674\n00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,410\nDon't reinvent the wheel.\n\n675\n00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:28,750\nAnd if somebody's already done it out\nthere, documented it, figured out how to\n\n676\n00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:32,700\ndo it, let's learn from them and let's\nsave some time and let's get it right.\n\n677\n00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,220\nAnd that's really what we want to focus\non, because we have a lot of opportunity\n\n678\n00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,850\nto make mistakes when we're\ndealing with BCP planning.\n\n679\n00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,580\nWe gotta get it right the first time in\norder to get back online, go back home,\n\n680\n00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,520\nreturn to normal as soon as possible.\n\n681\n00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,860\nThis is really critical.\n\n682\n00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,050\nPerforming a gap analysis.\n\n683\n00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,600\nGap analysis is gonna literally show us,\nokay,\n\n684\n00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,500\nwe say it's this way,\nwe have these things over here.\n\n685\n00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,700\nThere seems to be a break, some sort\nof discontinuity between the two.\n\n686\n00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,000\nHow do we address that gap?\n\n687\n00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,800\nWhat do we do to bridge that gap and\n\n688\n00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,210\nmake sure we understand we know how\nto make things work the right way?\n\n689\n00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,900\nSo we're looking for disconnects\nwhen we deal with gap analysis.\n\n690\n00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,820\nWe're looking for things that are gonna,\nfor some reason, some how,\n\n691\n00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,500\nsome way, not be aligned.\n\n692\n00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,340\nAnd then address those misalignments or\n\n693\n00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,160\nthe discontinuity with some\nsort of planning cycle.\n\n694\n00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,480\nI'll compose a draft of the new policy.\n\n695\n00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,630\nSo we now have to start writing things up,\nright?\n\n696\n00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,140\nSteps one through five.\n\n697\n00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:25,360\nDone a lot of background work,\n\n698\n00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,700\ngathered a lot of facts, put a whole\nbunch of stuff on the table, but\n\n699\n00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,800\nit's kind of all sitting there in\ndifferent boxes and different pieces.\n\n700\n00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,770\nIt's not contiguous in any way.\n\n701\n00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:34,730\nThere's no flow to it.\n\n702\n00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,200\nIt's very difficult to\nunderstand what it all means.\n\n703\n00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,800\nWe have to start making sense of it.\n\n704\n00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,660\nSo we have to distill it down and\nreally put it into a form that\n\n705\n00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,200\npeople can read through and kind of\nunderstand and follow along with, right?\n\n706\n00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,990\nSo we're gonna compose that draft.\n\n707\n00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:50,830\nKeyword here, draft,\nmeaning this is not the final product.\n\n708\n00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:54,750\nThis is gonna be simply our first take on\nwhat the final product will look like.\n\n709\n00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:59,370\nWe're gonna then pass it by some people,\nget some feedback, get some ideas,\n\n710\n00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,640\nsome maybe updates that we have to make,\nsome things we have to do differently.\n\n711\n00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,590\nAnd then when we're done, we're gonna\nput out that final product, but\n\n712\n00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,880\nthat's gonna be down in step number ten.\n\n713\n00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,700\nSo step number 6, compose the draft.\n\n714\n00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,980\nStep number 7,\ninternal review of the draft.\n\n715\n00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,410\nMeaning pass it around to\nthe internal departments,\n\n716\n00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:17,310\nthe key people that have\nto really weigh in on this.\n\n717\n00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,540\nGet feedback from the database team.\n\n718\n00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,520\nGet feedback from the messaging team.\n\n719\n00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,100\nGet feedback from perhaps the routing,\nthe network and routing team.\n\n720\n00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,900\nGet feedback from senior management.\n\n721\n00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,150\nMake sure we've addressed all\nthe things that have to be there.\n\n722\n00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,120\nTake that feedback, internalize it, and\n\n723\n00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,720\nthen in step 8,\nincorporate it into the draft.\n\n724\n00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,190\nSo in other words, update it.\n\n725\n00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,950\nSeveral revisions of this\npolicy will typically be gone\n\n726\n00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,960\nthrough along the way to finalizing it.\n\n727\n00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,110\nGet approval from, senior approval of,\nor approval from senior management.\n\n728\n00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,240\nThis will typically be the C level\nmanagement in the business, so, CEO,\n\n729\n00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,220\nCIO, CFO, typically has to be involved\ncuz there might be money involved and\n\n730\n00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,790\nmaybe resources that have to be\nallocated so your financial function and\n\n731\n00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,660\nlegal functions typically have to\nget involved and weigh in on this.\n\n732\n00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:04,620\nAnd then in step 10, when we're basically\nall done at that point, publish public.\n\n733\n00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,550\n[LAUGH] We should say publish.\n\n734\n00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,200\nMake public.\n\n735\n00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,790\nSo we do have to publish the final draft\nand distribute throughout the organization\n\n736\n00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,080\nin order to make sure that everybody\nis aware of their responsibilities,\n\n737\n00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,930\naware of the overall plan, and\nknows really what the road map is.\n\n738\n00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,480\nI often think about BCP when I\ntalk about it with customers or\n\n739\n00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,770\na I talk about it with students, I use\nthe analogy of the Wizard of Oz, right.\n\n740\n00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,740\nBecause I think of the Wizard of Oz, and\n\n741\n00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:31,200\nspecifically I think of Dorothy\nfalling out of the sky.\n\n742\n00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,710\nShe falls, winds up in munchkin land, so\n\n743\n00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:37,220\nshe's on top of the wicked witch,\ncomes out of the house.\n\n744\n00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,020\nWe have the technicolored thing happening,\nwhich was a big deal back in the day.\n\n745\n00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,510\nRight?\n\n746\n00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,840\nAll of a sudden she's out there, she's\ndancing around, she meets everybody, but\n\n747\n00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,980\nshe has to have a plan.\n\n748\n00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,360\nRight?\nIn the beginning she doesn't really know\n\n749\n00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,460\nwhat to do she's kind of clueless.\n\n750\n00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,490\nShe doesn't know why she's there,\ndoesn't know what has to happen.\n\n751\n00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,350\nAnd then all of a sudden Glenda\nthe Good Witch of the North comes.\n\n752\n00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:55,910\nRight?\n\n753\n00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:59,360\nSteps out of the magic little white\nbubble and shows up and says, oh,\n\n754\n00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,870\nno, this is what you need to do.\n\n755\n00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,360\nYou need to go see the Wizard of Oz.\n\n756\n00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,500\nSo here's how you get to the Wizard of Oz.\n\n757\n00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,420\nAnd they put her in the middle\nof the town square, right?\n\n758\n00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,690\nAnd she follows the Yellow Brick Road.\n\n759\n00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,170\nAnd I actually have the soundbite for\nthat on my computer.\n\n760\n00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:16,450\nSo, when I do it, I actually play\nthe Follow the Yellow Brick Road,\n\n761\n00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,420\nwith the munchkins singing\nFollow the Yellow Brick Road.\n\n762\n00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,715\nI actually play that\nwhen I talk about this.\n\n763\n00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:20,980\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We'll spare you that here.\n\n764\n00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,521\nWe're not going to do that here, but\n\n765\n00:37:22,521 --> 00:37:25,975\nthe idea is that basically she follows\nthis pre-determined path, right?\n\n766\n00:37:25,975 --> 00:37:29,645\nThe yellow brick road starts out as\na spiral, spirals around several times,\n\n767\n00:37:29,645 --> 00:37:30,955\nkinda goes out onto this road,\n\n768\n00:37:30,955 --> 00:37:34,795\nliterally, that shoots out toward the\nEmerald City in the background there, and\n\n769\n00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:38,987\nshe knows if she just keeps going down the\nroad and she follows the plan, she follows\n\n770\n00:37:38,987 --> 00:37:44,047\nthe path that the good witch Glenda gave\nher, she will wind up seeing the wizard\n\n771\n00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:47,827\nat some point at the end of that is\nthe the milestone that creates success.\n\n772\n00:37:47,827 --> 00:37:49,598\nThe metric is see wizard, right?\n\n773\n00:37:49,598 --> 00:37:50,418\nAnd get home.\n\n774\n00:37:50,418 --> 00:37:52,608\nAnd so she has a plan.\n\n775\n00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:54,128\nThis is really critical.\n\n776\n00:37:54,128 --> 00:37:57,698\nIf we have a plan,\nwe know how to measure success.\n\n777\n00:37:57,698 --> 00:38:00,028\nAnd this is what we're trying\nto figure out how to do,\n\n778\n00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,654\nwhich is when we get back to normal,\nright?\n\n779\n00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:04,404\nHow do we know what normal is?\n\n780\n00:38:04,404 --> 00:38:06,644\nWell, we know what normal is\nif we define it in the plan.\n\n781\n00:38:06,644 --> 00:38:10,844\nAnd so the end result, the end point\nof the BCP, is that we have returned\n\n782\n00:38:10,844 --> 00:38:14,344\nthe business to normal operations,\nand we can declare success.\n\n783\n00:38:14,344 --> 00:38:17,044\nThe emergency is now over,\nthe disaster has been dealt with,\n\n784\n00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:19,764\nwe stabilized the business and\nwe're back to normal.\n\n785\n00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:23,844\nAnd that milestone, that gate that we call\nit in project management speak, right?\n\n786\n00:38:23,844 --> 00:38:26,340\nIs the transition from the plan to normal.\n\n787\n00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,160\nAnd that's really what\nwe want to understand.\n\n788\n00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,150\nSo we'll focus on that\na little bit more as we go.\n\n789\n00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,200\nI want to make sure you're\ncomfortable with this idea,\n\n790\n00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,140\nand really have a sense of what\nwe do to draft the policy.\n\n791\n00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,705\nSo as we come out now have come\nout of drafting our policy, so\n\n792\n00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:41,285\nwhat we wanna do now is talk a bit\nabout some of the vocabulary and\n\n793\n00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:43,085\nsome of the other things\nthat are gonna go on here.\n\n794\n00:38:43,085 --> 00:38:46,585\nOne of the things we often engage\nin when we do this kind of planning\n\n795\n00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,505\nis something called a SWOT analysis.\n\n796\n00:38:48,505 --> 00:38:54,707\nSWOT is an acronym S-W-O-T, and\nthis stands for, as we've detailed out for\n\n797\n00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:58,007\nyou here, strength, weakness,\nopportunity, and threat.\n\n798\n00:38:58,007 --> 00:39:02,207\nThis is a planning cycle where typically\nkey people in the business, whoever you\n\n799\n00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:05,934\nidentify as being part of this go around\nwhen you want to get feedback from them,\n\n800\n00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:10,273\nwill be asked to in four categories write\ndown what they think are the strengths,\n\n801\n00:39:10,273 --> 00:39:13,823\nweaknesses, opportunities, and\nthreats that the business faces or\n\n802\n00:39:13,823 --> 00:39:15,788\nthat this particular\nprocess may engage in.\n\n803\n00:39:15,788 --> 00:39:19,731\nThere's a lot of ways of framing framing\nSWOT, but the idea is to typically go\n\n804\n00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:24,321\nout and get people's feedback from\ndifferent perspectives in the business\n\n805\n00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:28,561\naround these four areas to incorporate\nthose things into our planning cycle.\n\n806\n00:39:28,561 --> 00:39:33,380\nIf everybody says the strength of\nthe business is that we have this great\n\n807\n00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,040\nrelationship with our customers because\nwe're constantly available to them.\n\n808\n00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,480\nWe have all these ways for\nthem to interact with us, via voice,\n\n809\n00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,200\nvia interactive chat,\nvia email, via web presence.\n\n810\n00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,040\nAnd we focus on them and say okay so\nthat's really important that we know that\n\n811\n00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,220\nin BCP we have to make sure we've\nprioritized those systems and\n\n812\n00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,510\nmake sure they come back\nonline as quickly as possible.\n\n813\n00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,605\nIf we say for instance, that there\nmay be a weakness that we identify,\n\n814\n00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,962\nwhich as you know, we really don't know\nhow to get a hold of certain people,\n\n815\n00:40:01,962 --> 00:40:03,070\ntends to be a challenge.\n\n816\n00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:06,248\nWe don't know where they are,\nthey don't answer the phone all the time,\n\n817\n00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:09,850\nit's really tough to get them, we want to\nidentify that and take steps in our plan.\n\n818\n00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,082\nTo mitigate that,\n\n819\n00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:16,396\nminimize that issue by identifying some\npredetermined numbers and mechanisms.\n\n820\n00:40:16,396 --> 00:40:19,630\nWays that we're gonna reach out to\nthese people if there is an issue.\n\n821\n00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,811\nSo this is the kinda thing we go through,\nwe do SWOT.\n\n822\n00:40:21,811 --> 00:40:24,471\nWe're gonna walk through that and\nreally break down all those areas and\n\n823\n00:40:24,471 --> 00:40:26,030\nmake sure we're comfortable with them.\n\n824\n00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,653\nIt's often done in strategic planning,\nby the way as well.\n\n825\n00:40:28,653 --> 00:40:32,191\nSo as a strategic planning cycle\nseparate outside of these CPRV, but\n\n826\n00:40:32,191 --> 00:40:36,095\njust generically, businesses go through\neither an annual, semiannual or\n\n827\n00:40:36,095 --> 00:40:38,413\nquarterly strategic planning initiative,\n\n828\n00:40:38,413 --> 00:40:42,480\nyou tend to see SWOT analysis brought\nto bear and done there as well.\n\n829\n00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,416\nBusiness Continuity Planning Requirements,\nso very important key things.\n\n830\n00:40:46,416 --> 00:40:48,897\nIf you're listening now\neither live with us or\n\n831\n00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:53,096\nif you're listening at some point later\nthrough a rebroadcast wanna make sure\n\n832\n00:40:53,096 --> 00:40:57,060\nyou focus on these two topics overall,\nthese two subpoints I should say.\n\n833\n00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:00,396\nIn other words, specifically put\na little asterisk next to this.\n\n834\n00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:04,494\nProbably one of the most important things\nto know is that we really can't do BCP\n\n835\n00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:08,657\nunless we have senior management support,\nIn other words, if we don't really\n\n836\n00:41:08,657 --> 00:41:12,383\nget senior management in the business\nto buy in to support our efforts,\n\n837\n00:41:12,383 --> 00:41:16,423\ntell us we're on track, prioritizing\ncorrectly and providing resources,\n\n838\n00:41:16,423 --> 00:41:18,382\nwe've failed before we have begun.\n\n839\n00:41:18,382 --> 00:41:21,109\nAnd we literally will walk away\nwith maybe the shell of a plan,\n\n840\n00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:23,930\nmaybe something will appear,\nsomething will magically.\n\n841\n00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:26,113\nKind of materialize, but\nit's gonna be incomplete,\n\n842\n00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:27,588\nit's not gonna be well thought out.\n\n843\n00:41:27,588 --> 00:41:30,940\nAnd most importantly,\nit's not gonna do the job when we need it.\n\n844\n00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,319\nThat's really gonna be a major issue for\nus.\n\n845\n00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:36,756\nAnd then as a result of point number one,\nsenior management support,\n\n846\n00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:40,893\nwhat we really need to understand is that\nwhat that management support really brings\n\n847\n00:41:40,893 --> 00:41:44,853\nto the table for us is this idea that,\nbecause management is involved, they help\n\n848\n00:41:44,853 --> 00:41:49,240\nus set the goals and the prioritization\nof those goals within the planning cycle.\n\n849\n00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,672\nSo they're going to helpful by telling\nus listen, we need to make sure that our\n\n850\n00:41:53,672 --> 00:41:58,456\ncustomer facing systems are up and running\nno matter what versus internal systems.\n\n851\n00:41:58,456 --> 00:42:01,773\nWe may say, we just don't really\ncare if we can get file and\n\n852\n00:42:01,773 --> 00:42:04,240\nprint back on line It may take six months.\n\n853\n00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,185\nNo problem,\nwe'll figure out a way to deal with that.\n\n854\n00:42:07,185 --> 00:42:12,395\nBut if we don't have our websites up and\nrunning, we're losing $10,000 a minute\n\n855\n00:42:12,395 --> 00:42:17,580\nin revenue from our websites, because\nof transactional e-commerce business.\n\n856\n00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,241\nThat is costing us hundreds of thousands\nof dollar and we can't live without that,\n\n857\n00:42:22,241 --> 00:42:24,715\ngot to prioritize that and\nget that back on.\n\n858\n00:42:24,715 --> 00:42:28,106\nSenior management is really gonna be\nwhere that guidance comes from, so\n\n859\n00:42:28,106 --> 00:42:29,560\nwe need to have them involved.\n\n860\n00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,981\nIf we don't have them involved,\n\n861\n00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,987\nunfortunately BCP is just not gonna\nbe effective at the end of the day.\n\n862\n00:42:33,987 --> 00:42:37,920\nSo this is a very crucial pivot point for\nyou, as you begin to understand and\n\n863\n00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,570\nmaster this topic area.\n\n864\n00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,570\nAnd indeed, if you go out and\ndo this for real.\n\n865\n00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:45,691\nA lot of you that are gonna go through\nthis particular part of our discussion and\n\n866\n00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:49,376\nare gonna be focused in on this domain or\none of these knowledge areas,\n\n867\n00:42:49,376 --> 00:42:51,830\nyou may not have been\ninvolved in this before.\n\n868\n00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:53,118\nThis is a specialty,\n\n869\n00:42:53,118 --> 00:42:57,281\na lot of people tend not to spend a lot\nof time doing this in a business.\n\n870\n00:42:57,281 --> 00:43:01,150\nYou really set out to specialize in this,\nif you're going to do it full time.\n\n871\n00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:04,350\nThere are actually certifications you\ncan get separate from being a CISSP.\n\n872\n00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:07,990\nFor instance, they'll let you be certified\nas a business continuity planner.\n\n873\n00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,330\nA certified business continuity planner or\n\n874\n00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,802\nCBCP is one of\nthe certifications you can get.\n\n875\n00:43:12,802 --> 00:43:15,890\nAnd so as a result of that,\nit's like project management.\n\n876\n00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,103\nPeople specialize in that.\n\n877\n00:43:17,103 --> 00:43:18,890\nThat's what they do.\n\n878\n00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,584\nAnd so you may not really have\na lot of exposure to this.\n\n879\n00:43:21,584 --> 00:43:24,350\nYou may dabble with it,\nyou may have gone through a test.\n\n880\n00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,258\nYou may be aware of\nthe fact there's a plan,\n\n881\n00:43:26,258 --> 00:43:27,917\nyou may not really have seen the plan.\n\n882\n00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:28,799\nHard to say what.\n\n883\n00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:31,120\nSo a lot this may be new to you.\n\n884\n00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,004\nA lot of this is common sense, but a lot\nof it may be new, language may be new.\n\n885\n00:43:35,004 --> 00:43:38,863\nThe terminology we use and the way we do\nit and the prioritized order we do things\n\n886\n00:43:38,863 --> 00:43:42,860\nin may not seem to make a lot of sense and\nmay be new, but this is the way it's done.\n\n887\n00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,373\nSo if you're not really comfortable\nwith a lot of this, that's okay.\n\n888\n00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:49,462\nAs we've said, you may not be\nthat person that goes out and\n\n889\n00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:52,660\nspecializes in doing this\nwhen you become a CISSP.\n\n890\n00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,686\nYou may manage teams that do this, you\nwill certainly be involved in this, but\n\n891\n00:43:56,686 --> 00:43:59,563\nyou may not be the person that\nreally leads this effort.\n\n892\n00:43:59,563 --> 00:44:01,497\nThat's okay, but\nwhat you do have to be aware of,\n\n893\n00:44:01,497 --> 00:44:03,170\nyou don't have to be comfortable with it.\n\n894\n00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,525\nYou do have to be in other words,\naware enough that you can sit at a table,\n\n895\n00:44:06,525 --> 00:44:09,881\nhave a coherent conversation with other\nmembers of a team and help them to\n\n896\n00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:13,472\nunderstand the impact and value that\nthese practices bring to the business.\n\n897\n00:44:13,472 --> 00:44:17,160\nThis is really the takeaway and\nthe goal that we want to strive for here.\n\n898\n00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,723\nSo if we go back to what\nwe were talking about then,\n\n899\n00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,747\nwe have our business impact analysis.\n\n900\n00:44:21,747 --> 00:44:24,980\nSo this idea of BIA,\nBusiness Impact Analysis.\n\n901\n00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:26,907\nWhat is it and why do we engage in it?\n\n902\n00:44:26,907 --> 00:44:29,360\nIt is the first step down the road here.\n\n903\n00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,073\nWe'll talk about risk\nassessment in a little while.\n\n904\n00:44:31,073 --> 00:44:32,687\nRisk assessment will come later.\n\n905\n00:44:32,687 --> 00:44:34,630\nBut first, we do a BIA.\n\n906\n00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,722\nSo Business Impact Analysis is a\nfunctional analysis, we're gonna sit down.\n\n907\n00:44:38,722 --> 00:44:42,560\nWe're gonna talk to people,\ninterview them, examine what goes on.\n\n908\n00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,875\nWe're gonna ask them questions,\nwe're gonna use questionnaires, reviews,\n\n909\n00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:46,711\nwhatever it may be.\n\n910\n00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:50,349\nAnd we're gonna extract information\nfrom them, we're gonna get context and\n\n911\n00:44:50,349 --> 00:44:51,072\nperspective.\n\n912\n00:44:51,072 --> 00:44:53,277\nAnd that's gonna help\nus to then ultimately,\n\n913\n00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:55,823\nidentify which of the company's\ncritical systems or\n\n914\n00:44:55,823 --> 00:44:58,830\nwhat are those critical systems\nthat are needed for survival.\n\n915\n00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,839\nAnd as a result of that, we call these\nthe Critical Business Functions, the CBFs.\n\n916\n00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,340\nOnce we've identified and\nprioritized those,\n\n917\n00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,532\nwe can then estimate the downtime\nthat can be tolerated by system.\n\n918\n00:45:09,532 --> 00:45:13,440\nWe could walk through and say, how much\ndowntime can we have with our firewalls?\n\n919\n00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,901\nHow much downtime with our routers?\n\n920\n00:45:14,901 --> 00:45:16,561\nHow much downtime with our websites?\n\n921\n00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:18,690\nHow much downtime with our desktops?\n\n922\n00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:21,920\nLiterally, just walk through\nthe whole company, top to bottom.\n\n923\n00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,353\nAnd as a result of that,\nwe come up with two measures.\n\n924\n00:45:24,353 --> 00:45:25,630\nWe can think of this either way.\n\n925\n00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,251\nThese both pretty, by the way,\nmean the same thing.\n\n926\n00:45:28,251 --> 00:45:32,430\nYou will see them used interchangeably,\nbut we've identified too few here.\n\n927\n00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,707\nMaximum Tolerable Down-Time,\nwhat's known as MTD.\n\n928\n00:45:35,707 --> 00:45:38,831\nThis is a measure of the maximum\nwindow that the system can be\n\n929\n00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:42,333\noffline before it causes an emergency\nof some kind to be declared,\n\n930\n00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:45,310\nwe get some sort of catastrophic failure.\n\n931\n00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:49,243\nMaximum Period Time of Disruption, MPTD.\n\n932\n00:45:49,243 --> 00:45:51,500\nJust another way of\nlooking at the same thing.\n\n933\n00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,414\nIt is basically the same measure.\n\n934\n00:45:53,414 --> 00:45:56,574\nIt's just that some formulas and\nsome frameworks will use one and\n\n935\n00:45:56,574 --> 00:45:59,008\nsome will use another,\nthey use one or the other.\n\n936\n00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:03,827\nSo either, whichever value or measure\nyou get, I was about to create a new\n\n937\n00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,208\nword there called, vasure-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n938\n00:46:06,208 --> 00:46:07,237\n>> Which would be the value and\n\n939\n00:46:07,237 --> 00:46:08,660\nmeasure combined together.\n\n940\n00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,639\nBut which ever one you do, value or\nmeasure, doesn't really matter.\n\n941\n00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:14,965\nHowever, you get there, at the end of\nthe day, you just wanna understand\n\n942\n00:46:14,965 --> 00:46:18,723\nthat somehow, some way in the BIA, we have\nto come up with not just this prioritized\n\n943\n00:46:18,723 --> 00:46:22,374\nlist of business systems that have to be\nmanaged, but how long each one of them can\n\n944\n00:46:22,374 --> 00:46:25,700\nbe offline before they cause disruption,\nbefore we have an issue.\n\n945\n00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,678\nBecause we see power fluctuations and\nthings in networks all the time,\n\n946\n00:46:28,678 --> 00:46:30,523\nthey're just a normal course of business.\n\n947\n00:46:30,523 --> 00:46:32,253\nPower goes off for just a minute or two.\n\n948\n00:46:32,253 --> 00:46:35,360\nMaybe the wireless access point\nlocks up has to be reset,\n\n949\n00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,470\nthe internet connection may flutter,\nit may go up and down for a minute.\n\n950\n00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,466\nThat's not gonna impact the business\nthe same way a full blown outage does,\n\n951\n00:46:43,466 --> 00:46:47,025\nwhere your power goes off and\nthe entire town or the entire segment or\n\n952\n00:46:47,025 --> 00:46:51,147\nthe entire geo that you're in and you have\nto kick over to backup generators and\n\n953\n00:46:51,147 --> 00:46:53,358\nworry about how long you can run that way.\n\n954\n00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:57,246\nAnd maybe the internet is down, because\npower's gone down and although you have\n\n955\n00:46:57,246 --> 00:47:00,672\npower, the routing infrastructure\ncan get you out to the gateway, but\n\n956\n00:47:00,672 --> 00:47:02,920\nthe internet service\nprovider has gone down.\n\n957\n00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,812\nTheir circuit is offline and as a result,\n\n958\n00:47:04,812 --> 00:47:07,523\neven though you can get out you\nhave nowhere to go in effect.\n\n959\n00:47:07,523 --> 00:47:09,566\nThere's nothing out\nthere beyond the divide.\n\n960\n00:47:09,566 --> 00:47:11,836\nAnd so these kind of things\nare the things we want to think about.\n\n961\n00:47:11,836 --> 00:47:14,910\nThis is what Maximum Tolerable Down-Time\nis all about.\n\n962\n00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:17,970\nBy the way, when we extrapolate\nthis out a little bit further and\n\n963\n00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:21,256\nwe talk about things like service\nlevel agreements, so our SLA's,\n\n964\n00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:23,863\nwhich manage our uptime for\nour prioritized systems,\n\n965\n00:47:23,863 --> 00:47:27,911\nthey are derived around this idea of\nunderstanding Maximum Tolerable Down-Time.\n\n966\n00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,097\nThat's really where the essence,\nthe mirror image,\n\n967\n00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,390\nthe other side of the coin\nwhen we're talking about MTD.\n\n968\n00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:35,263\nWe'll tell you about a SLA,\na service level agreement as well.\n\n969\n00:47:35,263 --> 00:47:39,110\nWhat are the steps involved in a BIA,\nhow do we engage in one?\n\n970\n00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:42,701\nStep one, we will go through and select\nindividuals that we wanna interview for\n\n971\n00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:43,727\nsome data gathering.\n\n972\n00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:47,710\nSo again, focus on the critical\npeople that represent systems.\n\n973\n00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:50,869\nWe may interview line managers or\nsenior level engineers,\n\n974\n00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:55,048\nadministrators that manage these systems\nday to day really understand them.\n\n975\n00:47:55,048 --> 00:47:58,647\nWe may interview some customers on\nthe other side that wanna understand,\n\n976\n00:47:58,647 --> 00:48:01,850\ncuz we wanna understand how\nthey're consuming the system.\n\n977\n00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:04,513\nMake sure we really get that full\npicture of how it's being used, so\n\n978\n00:48:04,513 --> 00:48:05,926\nwe'll target those individuals.\n\n979\n00:48:05,926 --> 00:48:08,707\nSelect them out and\nreally identify them and then go out and\n\n980\n00:48:08,707 --> 00:48:10,024\nspend some time with them.\n\n981\n00:48:10,024 --> 00:48:14,099\nSo step two is data gathering, get\nthe tools together, what are the surveys,\n\n982\n00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:17,885\nthe questionnaires The interviewing\nprocess that we want to engage in.\n\n983\n00:48:17,885 --> 00:48:20,960\nStep three, identify the company's\ncritical business functions.\n\n984\n00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,400\nThose CBFs that I mentioned.\n\n985\n00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,200\nWe will kind of priority rank those,\nand understand what they are.\n\n986\n00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,370\nStep four, identify the resources\nthese functions depend on.\n\n987\n00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:33,330\nNothing worse than saying, yeah,\nemail's pretty important, and we need it.\n\n988\n00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:35,490\nBut then not taking it to the next level,\nand saying, okay, so\n\n989\n00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:36,850\nwhere are our email servers?\n\n990\n00:48:36,850 --> 00:48:38,010\nWhat are they called?\n\n991\n00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:38,760\nWhat are they?\n\n992\n00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,570\nWhere do they live?\n\n993\n00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:41,870\nIf they're virtual,\nwhat hosts are they on?\n\n994\n00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,060\nHow to identify them?\n\n995\n00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,470\nWhat's system do they run?\n\n996\n00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:47,640\nIf you don't have that information,\nthere's no way to do the restore cuz\n\n997\n00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,200\nyou don't know where they are,\nand what they are.\n\n998\n00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,680\nWe have no way to get a hold of them.\n\n999\n00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:51,330\nSo step five,\n\n1000\n00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:55,270\ncalculate how long these functions\ncan survive, without these resources.\n\n1001\n00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:58,595\nSo again, how long can basically,\nemail be up, and running.\n\n1002\n00:48:58,595 --> 00:49:01,190\nOr whatever it is, if we don't\nhave the resource to support it.\n\n1003\n00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,660\nWe will cache, in other words, typically,\ninbound email for a period of time.\n\n1004\n00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:08,290\nOur service provider will, if we are not\nable to accept that inbound mail.\n\n1005\n00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:10,900\nYou can actually negotiate with your\nservice provider to set this up,\n\n1006\n00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,160\nand perhaps cache for\nlonger periods of time.\n\n1007\n00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,720\nBut it's not unusual to see email cache\nfor a day, or more at the inbound gateway,\n\n1008\n00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,020\nmeaning you have the service\nprovider's gateways.\n\n1009\n00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,180\nThey bring it into you.\n\n1010\n00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,600\nIf you can't accept delivery, they will\nbasically, just queue up that mail for\n\n1011\n00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,040\nyou for a period of time,\nuntil you can actually turn it back on.\n\n1012\n00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,130\nSo, you may not lose that mail, but\nyou have to know what that window is,\n\n1013\n00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,800\nbecause at a certain point,\nthey will stop caching inbound mail.\n\n1014\n00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,810\nAnd, as a result of that,\nyou start losing mail.\n\n1015\n00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:36,830\nSo, you have to be aware of that.\n\n1016\n00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,750\nIdentify vulnerabilities, and\nthreats to these functions.\n\n1017\n00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,770\nSo, standard run through here.\n\n1018\n00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:44,870\nWhat's a vulnerability, and, or a threat?\n\n1019\n00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:45,900\nHow do we identify it?\n\n1020\n00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,570\nWe've talked about this in\nsome of our other discussions.\n\n1021\n00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:51,620\nAnd you wanna make sure that you're\ncomfortable with the idea of vulnerability\n\n1022\n00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,770\nassessment, threat analysis.\n\n1023\n00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:56,490\nThese are the key things\nwe talk about in this area.\n\n1024\n00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:00,580\nIf you're not a 100% comfortable with\nthem, you don't remember how to do them,\n\n1025\n00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,000\nor you're not aware of them.\n\n1026\n00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,652\nThen I suggest you go back,\nlisten to some of our prior shows.\n\n1027\n00:50:04,652 --> 00:50:07,100\nWhere we went through, and\ntalked about some of these things.\n\n1028\n00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:10,150\nSo, we did identify in the risk analysis,\nand\n\n1029\n00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,960\ngovernance section of the CISSB course,\nthat we're engaging in.\n\n1030\n00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,540\nWe did a pretty thorough deep dive, and\n\n1031\n00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:18,850\ndiscussion around vulnerability\nassessment, and threat analysis.\n\n1032\n00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,450\nYou wanna just go back, and\nrefresh your memory a little bit there.\n\n1033\n00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:24,410\nCalculate the risk for\neach different business function.\n\n1034\n00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,910\nSo, what is the risk?\n\n1035\n00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,790\nWhat are we talking about?\n\n1036\n00:50:27,790 --> 00:50:31,020\nRisk A, Risk B, Risk C,\nlet's put some values to them,\n\n1037\n00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:34,100\nunderstand what they are,\nwhat their impact will be ultimately.\n\n1038\n00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,650\nAnd then we wanna document the findings,\nand report them to senior management.\n\n1039\n00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:39,770\nAgain, really important last step.\n\n1040\n00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,892\nWe see this in almost every process flow,\nwe look at.\n\n1041\n00:50:42,892 --> 00:50:45,680\nWe wanna report back,\nand tell the business,\n\n1042\n00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,650\nsenior management is the representative\nof the business in this case,\n\n1043\n00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:51,020\ntell the business what it is we're doing.\n\n1044\n00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,210\nMake them aware.\n\n1045\n00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:53,440\nMake sure they know.\n\n1046\n00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,790\nGive them the opportunity to tell us we're\non track, we're good, we like what we see,\n\n1047\n00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,110\nor hey, what about this, what about that,\nyou haven't thought about this.\n\n1048\n00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:03,080\nLet's go back, and incorporate that.\n\n1049\n00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,123\nAnd then I think we've got it,\nI think we're good.\n\n1050\n00:51:05,123 --> 00:51:09,496\nBut if we don't have that feedback,\nwe're missing the most crucial linkage,\n\n1051\n00:51:09,496 --> 00:51:10,684\nthe most vital step.\n\n1052\n00:51:10,684 --> 00:51:12,784\nBecause we have no way to circle back, and\n\n1053\n00:51:12,784 --> 00:51:16,687\nclose that lifecycle around reporting\nto the busines,s what our plans are.\n\n1054\n00:51:16,687 --> 00:51:19,850\nTo make sure that we have not missed\nanything at the end of the day.\n\n1055\n00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:21,180\nSo, this is how we incorporate,\n\n1056\n00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:25,330\nthis is how we actually engage in,\nthe business impact analysis, the BIA.\n\n1057\n00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:28,521\nThis is the first step,\nvery critical step.\n\n1058\n00:51:28,521 --> 00:51:32,856\nThe output the BIA will be a prioritized\nassessment of business processes,\n\n1059\n00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,579\nwhat we call our critical\nbusiness functions.\n\n1060\n00:51:35,579 --> 00:51:39,230\nWith some risk, vulnerability, and threat\nanalysis done against them, in the sense\n\n1061\n00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,790\nof understanding what the vulnerabilities,\nand threats are that they face.\n\n1062\n00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:44,990\nWe'll take the output of the BIA.\n\n1063\n00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:48,610\nWe will engage that output into\na next step in the process,\n\n1064\n00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:51,510\nwhich we will talk about here\nafter we take a small break.\n\n1065\n00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:52,610\nBut we'll come back.\n\n1066\n00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,438\nWe'll talk about our risk assessment,\n\n1067\n00:51:54,438 --> 00:51:56,810\nunderstanding how to analyze\nthe business impact.\n\n1068\n00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:00,352\nAnd then ascribe risk, and value,\ncreate valuation around that risk.\n\n1069\n00:52:00,352 --> 00:52:03,173\nSo that, that way,\nwe ultimately at the end of that process,\n\n1070\n00:52:03,173 --> 00:52:06,946\ncome up with a way to really understand,\nnot just what's important to business.\n\n1071\n00:52:06,946 --> 00:52:10,429\nBut what the potential liabilities are we\nface around those important rankings.\n\n1072\n00:52:10,429 --> 00:52:12,445\nAnd what we have to do to mitigate them,\nand\n\n1073\n00:52:12,445 --> 00:52:14,690\nmake sure we get online\nas quickly as possible.\n\n1074\n00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:15,607\n>> Sounds great, Adam.\n\n1075\n00:52:15,607 --> 00:52:17,640\nSo let's go, and stop here,\nwe'll take a break.\n\n1076\n00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:20,590\nWhen we get back we'll have risk analysis,\nand we'll continue on from there.\n\n1077\n00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:22,440\nSo stay tuned, we'll be back after this.\n\n1078\n00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,301\n>> Great.\n\n1079\n00:52:23,301 --> 00:52:28,881\n>> [SOUND] Welcome back,\n\n1080\n00:52:28,881 --> 00:52:32,291\neverybody.\n\n1081\n00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:36,295\nSo, we paused, it was right after\nbusiness impact- [CROSSTALK]\n\n1082\n00:52:36,295 --> 00:52:36,992\n>> Business impact.\n\n1083\n00:52:36,992 --> 00:52:39,181\n>> And we did a little lead in for\nrisk assessment, so\n\n1084\n00:52:39,181 --> 00:52:41,538\nI guess we should probably go ahead,\nand cover that.\n\n1085\n00:52:41,538 --> 00:52:42,142\n>> [CROSSTALK] do.\n\n1086\n00:52:42,142 --> 00:52:45,484\n>> So, let's take a stab at that, and\nsee what is involved in risk assessment.\n\n1087\n00:52:45,484 --> 00:52:46,964\n>> Very good.\n\n1088\n00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:49,600\nSo, let's get to it as they say,\nor do it to it as they say.\n\n1089\n00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,565\nI think,\nthat was the colloquial [LAUGH] term.\n\n1090\n00:52:51,565 --> 00:52:53,080\n>> [LAUGH] Yeah.\n>> So, risk assessment.\n\n1091\n00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,000\nSo the idea with risk assessment,\nremember, business impact analysis was\n\n1092\n00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,940\nall about figuring out prioritization\naround critical business factors.\n\n1093\n00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,430\nWhat's important in the business?\n\n1094\n00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,290\nWhat systems do we have to focus on?\n\n1095\n00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:06,786\nHow do we make sure we know that, and\nthen what are we gonna do about them?\n\n1096\n00:53:06,786 --> 00:53:09,339\nAnd now, risk assessment is\ngonna look at impact, and\n\n1097\n00:53:09,339 --> 00:53:12,530\nlikelihood that various threats\nto the business are gonna happen.\n\n1098\n00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:15,916\nSo, we're gonna take the output of BIA,\nit's gonna become the input for\n\n1099\n00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:16,800\nrisk assessment.\n\n1100\n00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,740\nIt's very important to know this, in\nthe sense that we have this flow going on.\n\n1101\n00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,750\nWe cannot do risk assessment,\n\n1102\n00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:26,120\nunless we've done BIA because we have\nnothing to assess, in other words.\n\n1103\n00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,206\nWe haven't identified the risks,\nbecause we don't know what to prioritized,\n\n1104\n00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,700\nor important systems are.\n\n1105\n00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,000\nSo, we take the output of BIA, bring it\ninto risk assessment, and we iterate,\n\n1106\n00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,440\nwe run through those.\n\n1107\n00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,540\nAnd as a result, we then are gonna\nbe able understand the impact,\n\n1108\n00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,660\nand the likelihood of these\nthreats that we may face.\n\n1109\n00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,490\nSo, what are the goals\nof risk assessment here?\n\n1110\n00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:50,330\nIdentify, and document what are known\nas SPOFs, or single points of failure.\n\n1111\n00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:54,940\nSo, if we have only one mail server,\nno back-up to it at all.\n\n1112\n00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,630\nIt's virtual.\n\n1113\n00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:56,950\nWe haven't snapshotted it.\n\n1114\n00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:58,240\nWe don't back it up.\n\n1115\n00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,670\nWe don't have a redundancy in\nthe host environment at all.\n\n1116\n00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:04,640\nThere's no way to recover this thing,\nif it blows up it's gone.\n\n1117\n00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,910\nThat's a single point of failure.\n\n1118\n00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:09,300\nIf we only have a single power\nsupply from a hardware perspective,\n\n1119\n00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,710\non a physical server.\n\n1120\n00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:13,630\nMaybe the host,\nthat's running those virtual machines.\n\n1121\n00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,530\nIt only has a single power supply.\n\n1122\n00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:18,030\nWe don't have dual, or\nredundant power supplies in the box.\n\n1123\n00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:20,300\nThat's potentially,\na single point of failure.\n\n1124\n00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,062\nSo, we look at all these different areas,\nand understand that.\n\n1125\n00:54:23,062 --> 00:54:26,040\nAnd wanna make sure we know\nwhat's going on there.\n\n1126\n00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,360\nMake a prioritized list of threats.\n\n1127\n00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,430\nJust like we prioritized\nthe critical business factors.\n\n1128\n00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:32,920\nWhat are the most important systems.\n\n1129\n00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,960\nWanna prioritize our list of threats.\n\n1130\n00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,300\nSo, we may say that\nthe likelihood of getting malware\n\n1131\n00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:43,520\nin our server environment is likely,\nso it's a prioritized threat.\n\n1132\n00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,810\nBut it's not as high on the list as\nsystem interruption due to power failure.\n\n1133\n00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,360\nBecause maybe we live in an area,\n\n1134\n00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,160\nor we do business in an area,\nwhere power provisioning is very spotty.\n\n1135\n00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,890\nThere are parts of the world where\nliterally you may only get three, or\n\n1136\n00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,370\nfour hours of power a day.\n\n1137\n00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:59,880\nAnd you get it every other day,\nand it's not consistent.\n\n1138\n00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,470\nAnd so, prioritize clean power\nis much bigger of a threat\n\n1139\n00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:07,080\nthan the fact that you may, or\nmay not get malware in your system,\n\n1140\n00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,150\nif that's where your doing business.\n\n1141\n00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:10,410\nSo, well, again,\n\n1142\n00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:13,890\nwe have to really understand, and\nincorporate the idea of the environment,\n\n1143\n00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:17,940\nand all of the contextual variables\nthat come in here, to make up a threat.\n\n1144\n00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:19,690\nA threat may be something as simple,\n\n1145\n00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:24,720\nas somebody not showing up to work to swap\nout a shift, at a certain point in time.\n\n1146\n00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,640\nMissing it without telling\nus in other words,\n\n1147\n00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,320\ndo we have a backup for that person?\n\n1148\n00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,890\nIf we don't, now we have the threat of\nsomebody having to do a double shift, or\n\n1149\n00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:33,910\nleaving that system maybe uncovered.\n\n1150\n00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:36,170\nAnd again, this could also be\na threat that we have to do a risk\n\n1151\n00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,210\nassessment around.\n\n1152\n00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,990\nSo, these are the kind of things\nthat you wanna be thinking about.\n\n1153\n00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:43,130\nGathering information to develop\nrisk control strategies,\n\n1154\n00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:46,640\nso our goal is to really get\nall the information required\n\n1155\n00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,010\nto understand how to manage,\nand control risk.\n\n1156\n00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:51,290\nWhat is the likelihood that\nwe're gonna get malware?\n\n1157\n00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:54,460\nWell, do we have malware\npatching solutions in place?\n\n1158\n00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,592\nHow quickly, and\nhow frequently do we update?\n\n1159\n00:55:56,592 --> 00:56:00,110\nHow long does it take to propagate,\nthese updates out into the environment?\n\n1160\n00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,887\nAnd how quickly are they applied?\n\n1161\n00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:04,428\nDo they require restarts?\n\n1162\n00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:07,941\nAnd if so, are they being done during our\nmaintenance windows, right at the time\n\n1163\n00:56:07,941 --> 00:56:11,209\nwhere we're allowed to effectively\ntake the system down, and reboot it.\n\n1164\n00:56:11,209 --> 00:56:13,326\nOr are they not being done\nduring maintenance windows?\n\n1165\n00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:15,530\nThat presents a whole other\nhost of problems, because now,\n\n1166\n00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:16,751\nwe have service interruptions.\n\n1167\n00:56:16,751 --> 00:56:19,315\nSo, there's all these things\nyou wanna understand, and\n\n1168\n00:56:19,315 --> 00:56:22,104\nkind of think about Document\nacceptance of identified risks.\n\n1169\n00:56:22,104 --> 00:56:24,529\nThere are certain risks\nthat we will accept and\n\n1170\n00:56:24,529 --> 00:56:27,892\njust understand that they're\nthe price of doing business.\n\n1171\n00:56:27,892 --> 00:56:31,060\nWe're gonna have to accept the fact\nthat if we run servers connected to\n\n1172\n00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,710\nthe Internet, we are likely at some point\nduring the life cycle of that server,\n\n1173\n00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:38,390\nto get hit with either malware or\nvirus or a Trojan.\n\n1174\n00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:42,130\nOr some sort of a thing\nwill infect that system and\n\n1175\n00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:44,140\nas a result cause service outage.\n\n1176\n00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:44,960\nThere is a likelihood.\n\n1177\n00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,270\nI'm not saying it will happen but\nthere is a risk and\n\n1178\n00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,460\nwe have to accept the risk of doing\nthat if we hook it up to the Internet.\n\n1179\n00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:54,430\nAnd so we would then document and\naccept the fact that we acknowledge that.\n\n1180\n00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:58,640\nThere are also other risks that we\nwill simply not want to address.\n\n1181\n00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,970\nNow it's okay to ignore certain risks, but\nonly if we agree that we're gonna document\n\n1182\n00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:07,790\nwhat they are and then we agree that we,\nin writing, are not going to take them on.\n\n1183\n00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:10,930\nSo we may say look, we're gonna\nhook this sever up to the internet.\n\n1184\n00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:14,360\nWe understand the liability,\nwe know we will get malware potentially,\n\n1185\n00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,450\nthreats things like that can happen.\n\n1186\n00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:20,360\nBut, you know what,\nbecause of the nature of what it does,\n\n1187\n00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,670\nthe fact that it is just really\na disposable server from our perspective.\n\n1188\n00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:24,850\nWe don't really care about it.\n\n1189\n00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,820\nWe're not gonna actively manage it and\nworry about patching it.\n\n1190\n00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,360\nWe're just going to kind\nof let it do its thing.\n\n1191\n00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:33,730\nAnd if it does get infected, it's\na virtual image, we simply just zap it.\n\n1192\n00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,610\nWe bring a new one back up,\nand we're fine.\n\n1193\n00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:39,030\nSo, as a result of that, we may just\nacknowledge the fact the we're not gonna\n\n1194\n00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:44,070\napply any patch management or desktop\napplication update and things like that\n\n1195\n00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:47,250\nto the server because it's basically\nlike a dev environment server.\n\n1196\n00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:50,160\nIt's a testing server, we don't really\ncare about it at the end of the day.\n\n1197\n00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,670\nIt's isolated in it's on VLAN and\nit can't really talk to anything.\n\n1198\n00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,520\nAnd as a result, even if it gets blown up,\noh, well, right?\n\n1199\n00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,470\nWho cares?\nNo big deal.\n\n1200\n00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:01,550\nSo we'll document the acknowledgment of\nthat risk, we're not gonna address it, but\n\n1201\n00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:05,705\nwe are gonna write it down and acknowledge\nthat these servers, these machines in this\n\n1202\n00:58:05,705 --> 00:58:09,550\nVLAN over here doing this are not gonna\nhave patch management, and here's why.\n\n1203\n00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:10,770\nAnd then we would go on.\n\n1204\n00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:14,170\nSo these are the goals that we want\nto really think about, be focused on,\n\n1205\n00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:16,100\nand understand our outcomes,\n\n1206\n00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:19,760\nmeasurable outcomes that we\nidentify with risk assessment.\n\n1207\n00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,650\nHaving said that, how do we actually\nengage in a risk assessment,\n\n1208\n00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:23,720\nin other words, what is it?\n\n1209\n00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,310\nNow we have a ten step process down below,\n\n1210\n00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:28,870\nwe'll get to that in just a second, one of\nthe main components of risk assessment.\n\n1211\n00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:32,222\nBut we kind of reduce risk assessment\ndown to this idea of a formula.\n\n1212\n00:58:32,222 --> 00:58:36,010\nThere is very few formulas we ask you\nto be aware of when we talk about CISSP\n\n1213\n00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:40,650\nknowledge and get you ready for CISSP\nif you're gonna go out ultimately and\n\n1214\n00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:43,320\nattempt the exam and\ntry to become certified.\n\n1215\n00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:47,090\nThere are two or three that we really\ntell you to focus on, really be aware of.\n\n1216\n00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,580\nMake sure you understand.\n\n1217\n00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,470\nAL equals sleep times arrow,\n\n1218\n00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:53,440\none of the ones we've given you in\nsome of our earlier conversations.\n\n1219\n00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,950\nThis idea of annualized loss expectancy\nis made up of single loss expectancy\n\n1220\n00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:00,900\ntimes annual rate of occurrence, is one\nthat you definitely need to master and\n\n1221\n00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,430\nbe aware of and\nthen there's this one, risk and\n\n1222\n00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:06,650\nhow we identify risk from\na risk assessment perspective.\n\n1223\n00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:09,450\nIt is traditionally\ndefined as risk equalling\n\n1224\n00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:13,390\nthreats times impact times probability,\nthose little asterisks or\n\n1225\n00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:16,500\nstars are gonna signify\na multiplication of that.\n\n1226\n00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,380\nSo risk is made up of, or\n\n1227\n00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:22,290\nidentified as being made up of,\nthreat times impact times probability.\n\n1228\n00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:24,730\nIf we ascribe numerical values to these,\nand\n\n1229\n00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:28,840\nwe do through a matrix, we give\nthem some sort of value and weight.\n\n1230\n00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,110\nAnd then we multiply those values out.\n\n1231\n00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:35,956\nWe get an overall risk rating or\nthe assessed impact number,\n\n1232\n00:59:35,956 --> 00:59:38,370\nthere's different ways of looking at it.\n\n1233\n00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:41,398\nThat risk will represent will then\nbe derived by multiplying out these\n\n1234\n00:59:41,398 --> 00:59:42,900\nparticular items, right?\n\n1235\n00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,960\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1236\n00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,390\nMay want to make sure you\ntake a note on that formula.\n\n1237\n00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:49,490\nGood idea to throw it\nup on the flash card or\n\n1238\n00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:52,980\nsomething like that, that we talk\nabout you using as a study guide.\n\n1239\n00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:54,470\nAnd just have that at the ready.\n\n1240\n00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:55,890\nBe comfortable with the idea.\n\n1241\n00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:56,690\nRefer back to it and\n\n1242\n00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:59,900\nbe able to answer questions\naround it as you look to prepare.\n\n1243\n00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:03,000\nSo what are the main components\nof a risk assessment?\n\n1244\n01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,529\nWe have ten stepped items that we call\nout here, so let's go through and\n\n1245\n01:00:06,529 --> 01:00:09,660\nlet's just make sure that we talk about\nthem, the main parts or components.\n\n1246\n01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:13,860\nThere we go, just gonna move them\nup to the top for easy viewing and\n\n1247\n01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,070\nreference, so for your viewing pleasure.\n\n1248\n01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,230\nWe'll put them up to the top.\n\n1249\n01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:17,940\n>> We aim to please.\n\n1250\n01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:18,550\n>> We aim to please.\n\n1251\n01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:19,230\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n1252\n01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:22,960\nSo item number 1, Review existing\nstrategies for risk management.\n\n1253\n01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,900\nSo we wanna go back and\nlook at what's already being done.\n\n1254\n01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,810\nWe may already have\nwork done in this area.\n\n1255\n01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:30,420\nThere may be prior planning, and\nprior management strategies in place,\n\n1256\n01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:31,820\nwanna align with those.\n\n1257\n01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:34,840\nThose that are good, we wanna keep if\nthey're still up to date and timely.\n\n1258\n01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,720\nThose that may need to be revised in\nsome way, cuz it may drift a little bit,\n\n1259\n01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,630\nmay not be exactly 100% accurate\nanymore will have to be assessed and\n\n1260\n01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:45,610\nthen maybe either thrown out or\nperhaps modified.\n\n1261\n01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:48,338\nAnother good example of just a sea change,\na major or\n\n1262\n01:00:48,338 --> 01:00:52,183\nmassive shift change that occurred,\nthe technology base, as a result,\n\n1263\n01:00:52,183 --> 01:00:56,648\naround things like risk assessment and BIA\nand the stuff we've been talking about was\n\n1264\n01:00:56,648 --> 01:01:00,555\nthis move from physical to virtual\ninfrastructure that we've over last,\n\n1265\n01:01:00,555 --> 01:01:04,180\nwe still are seeing it, by the way,\nbecause it's still happening.\n\n1266\n01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,405\nBut especially over the last,\nlets say, maybe four to five years,\n\n1267\n01:01:07,405 --> 01:01:11,198\nwe've really seen a lot of businesses,\nespecially in the last three years on,\n\n1268\n01:01:11,198 --> 01:01:14,992\nreally just incrementally getting much,\nmuch quicker in the adoption rates,\n\n1269\n01:01:14,992 --> 01:01:16,941\naround virtualizing infrastructure.\n\n1270\n01:01:16,941 --> 01:01:21,124\nAnd so if you had gone from physical\ninfrastructure, physical servers,\n\n1271\n01:01:21,124 --> 01:01:24,564\nover to virtual servers, and\nreally had made that leap, and\n\n1272\n01:01:24,564 --> 01:01:27,262\nstarted to get rid of,\nor what we call sundown,\n\n1273\n01:01:27,262 --> 01:01:32,260\nturn off a lot of those physical boxes do\na P to V, physical to virtual conversion.\n\n1274\n01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,960\nAnd get them into\na virtual infrastructure.\n\n1275\n01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,930\nYour entire DR and BCP planning cycles and\nall the plans, and\n\n1276\n01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:43,000\nall the things associated with them,\nbasically had to be revised and changed.\n\n1277\n01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:43,630\nNot thrown out.\n\n1278\n01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:44,870\nThey're still good, but\n\n1279\n01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:48,970\nthere are large components of them\nthat are now totally misaligned.\n\n1280\n01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:52,020\nAnd are not going to speak properly to\nthe way in which you would have to recover\n\n1281\n01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:56,530\nbecause you're plan will say, go over\nthere to that rack, box number three.\n\n1282\n01:01:56,530 --> 01:01:58,570\nRestart it if not,\nswap out the power supply.\n\n1283\n01:01:58,570 --> 01:01:59,800\nDo this.\nDo that.\n\n1284\n01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,030\nThere's no box anymore, right?\n\n1285\n01:02:01,030 --> 01:02:01,900\nYou're not gonna go touch that.\n\n1286\n01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:02,780\nIt's all virtual now.\n\n1287\n01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:07,720\nSo this is one of those key areas where\nif you had not gone back and reviewed and\n\n1288\n01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,820\ndone the existing review to\nunderstand the technology base\n\n1289\n01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,740\nat the time the plans were created,\nthe assessments were done.\n\n1290\n01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:14,250\nRight?\n\n1291\n01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:17,430\nYou're gonna be missing, there's gonna be\na huge gap there that you're gonna miss\n\n1292\n01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:21,060\nand you're ultimately gonna fall into\nwhen you go to actually execute the plan.\n\n1293\n01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:24,550\nSo, Construct numerical scoring system for\nprobability and impact.\n\n1294\n01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:27,240\nWe talked about this when we just\nreviewed the formula a minute ago where\n\n1295\n01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:28,770\nwe said risk was made up of,\n\n1296\n01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:32,460\nright, this idea of risk being made up of\nthreat times impact times probability.\n\n1297\n01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:34,770\nWe have to start ascribing numbers there.\n\n1298\n01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:39,170\nSo we do a probability of impact\nstudy where we usually use a matrix.\n\n1299\n01:02:39,170 --> 01:02:42,745\nI think we've shown them in one or two of\nour other discussions where we had low\n\n1300\n01:02:42,745 --> 01:02:45,331\nmedium high and\nwe looked at the idea of understanding.\n\n1301\n01:02:45,331 --> 01:02:50,073\nLow-low versus medium versus high and a\nhigh-high on the matrix, high impact high\n\n1302\n01:02:50,073 --> 01:02:54,616\nprobability is going to potentially be\nsomething we deal with right away instead\n\n1303\n01:02:54,616 --> 01:02:58,727\nof low, medium, high, we often\nwill use numbers like 1, 2, and 3.\n\n1304\n01:02:58,727 --> 01:03:00,028\nSo we do a 3 by 3 matrix and\n\n1305\n01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:03,540\nwe come up with a possible value\nrating of anything from 1 through 9.\n\n1306\n01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:07,510\nAnd we start ascribing value and\nthen obviously the higher the number,\n\n1307\n01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:10,430\nthe more likely the impact is and more\nlikely the probability of it occurring.\n\n1308\n01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:13,688\nAnd therefore the higher the rating we\nget we give to the risk ultimately and\n\n1309\n01:03:13,688 --> 01:03:17,100\nultimately we then try to deal with those\nrisks before we deal with anything else.\n\n1310\n01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,290\nSo, it's done different ways.\n\n1311\n01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:19,040\nIt could be low, medium, high.\n\n1312\n01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,090\nIt could be one, two, three.\n\n1313\n01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:23,120\nThere's lots of different\nmethodologies out there.\n\n1314\n01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:27,370\nBut however you get there, at the end of\nthe day, you want to ascribe values to\n\n1315\n01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:31,000\nthis, and typically we do numerical\nvalues as opposed to low, medium, high.\n\n1316\n01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,200\nI'll use numerical scoring\nto gauge effective threat.\n\n1317\n01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,760\nSo we just talked about that.\n\n1318\n01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,410\nWhat is a one versus a nine.\n\n1319\n01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:38,280\nOne being low, nine being high.\n\n1320\n01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,680\nRight?\nThat kind of thing.\n\n1321\n01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:41,180\nEstimate probability of threat.\n\n1322\n01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:44,910\nSo we go through and figure out how\nlikely is it that this threat will occur?\n\n1323\n01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:48,780\nThat once in a hundred year weather event\nversus the fact that we get torrential\n\n1324\n01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:51,390\nrain four or five times a year,\nwithout fail.\n\n1325\n01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:54,940\nTorrential rain meaning literally several\ninches of standing water on the ground.\n\n1326\n01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,085\nSomething like that.\n\n1327\n01:03:56,085 --> 01:03:58,855\nSo that means people may be\ndelayed coming into the office.\n\n1328\n01:03:58,855 --> 01:04:01,955\nMay not be able to get there,\nor maybe power fluctuates.\n\n1329\n01:04:01,955 --> 01:04:03,965\nThings like that can occur.\n\n1330\n01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:04,970\nSo we do that.\n\n1331\n01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:06,610\nWeigh each threat through\nthe scoring system.\n\n1332\n01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:10,131\nSo we kinda go through and say what's\nthe likelihood based on this ranking,\n\n1333\n01:04:10,131 --> 01:04:14,051\ncalculate the risk by combining the scores\nof likelihood and impact of each threat.\n\n1334\n01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:17,952\nSo we actually do the math and say this\nis gonna equal this, this will be that.\n\n1335\n01:04:17,952 --> 01:04:24,130\nOh, doing a little revisioning and\nupdating there to compress.\n\n1336\n01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:25,430\nAll right, very good.\n\n1337\n01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:26,970\nSo we've just saved ourself a line.\n\n1338\n01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:28,910\nJust pull the line in.\n\n1339\n01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:29,640\n>> Every line helps.\n\n1340\n01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,570\n>> Every line helps, absolutely correct.\n\n1341\n01:04:31,570 --> 01:04:34,218\nSecure sponsor sign off on\nrisk priorities, right.\n\n1342\n01:04:34,218 --> 01:04:37,210\nSo, you wanna make sure again,\nyou'll think about this idea.\n\n1343\n01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,950\nThat we wanna go back, and\nthere's two levels here.\n\n1344\n01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:42,800\nNumber ten is that key milestone\nwe kept talking about, go back and\n\n1345\n01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,950\ninform the business executive management.\n\n1346\n01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:46,320\nSponsors are different.\n\n1347\n01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:51,070\nSponsors are typically gonna be senior\nmanagement, but the sponsor is the person\n\n1348\n01:04:51,070 --> 01:04:54,680\nin the business that stands up and\nsays I'm willing to back this idea.\n\n1349\n01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,410\nI will put resources up to it.\n\n1350\n01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:58,560\nIt's gonna be done, and\nI'm going to be the champion.\n\n1351\n01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,760\nI'm gonna stand up be responsible and\naccountable for it.\n\n1352\n01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,390\nAnd the buck stops here, in effect,\nas President Truman used to say.\n\n1353\n01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:06,180\nRight?\nAnd so,\n\n1354\n01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:09,020\nthat's what the sponsor is\nin project management speak.\n\n1355\n01:05:09,020 --> 01:05:12,680\nIf you deal with project management\nphilosophies and understand the PMBOK,\n\n1356\n01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,430\nthe Project Manager Body of Knowledge.\n\n1357\n01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:17,710\nThe sponsor is the person, or\nthe group of people if there may be\n\n1358\n01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:21,630\nmore than one sponsor, that is gonna\ninitiate, kick off the project.\n\n1359\n01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:25,710\nThey provide the resources and the impetus\nto do so, so just be aware of that.\n\n1360\n01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:27,740\nWeigh the appropriate measures, right?\n\n1361\n01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:30,820\nMake sure planned measures\ndo not hide into the risks.\n\n1362\n01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:32,400\nSo in other words,\nthe things that we are going to do,\n\n1363\n01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,230\nmeasures are basically going\nto be mitigation strategies.\n\n1364\n01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:38,190\nWhat will we do to then\ndeal with this risk?\n\n1365\n01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:41,750\nWe wanna make sure that by fixing\nthis risk, we don't inadvertently\n\n1366\n01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,370\nkick off three or four others over\nhere that are even worse in effect, or\n\n1367\n01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:47,560\nas bad as the one we just mitigated.\n\n1368\n01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,730\nNothing worse than solving one problem and\nin so\n\n1369\n01:05:49,730 --> 01:05:51,230\ndoing, creating three others,\nin other words.\n\n1370\n01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:51,750\nThat would be bad.\n\n1371\n01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:57,300\nSo then as a result of that, step ten,\nultimately we'd present the findings.\n\n1372\n01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:59,100\nRemember, this is a risk assessment.\n\n1373\n01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:02,962\nThis is not us going out actually in\nthe field in real time life deali,\n\n1374\n01:06:02,962 --> 01:06:03,780\nng with this.\n\n1375\n01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,470\nThis is the structure, the framework and\n\n1376\n01:06:05,470 --> 01:06:08,740\nthe plan that will guide us to\ndo that when we're ready to.\n\n1377\n01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,970\nBut this is what we're\nproducing is the plan.\n\n1378\n01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:12,472\nSo we're producing the assessment,\n\n1379\n01:06:12,472 --> 01:06:15,400\nand we're then we're going to report\nthat back to executive management.\n\n1380\n01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,790\nWe give that back to the business.\n\n1381\n01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:19,210\nAgain as we've said in other areas,\n\n1382\n01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:22,960\nlike the business impact analysis,\noverall, report back.\n\n1383\n01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,440\nTell us what you're doing, make sure we're\nin alignment, we haven't missed anything.\n\n1384\n01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:28,360\nOkay, is there something\nwe're not aware of?\n\n1385\n01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:32,690\nThere could be M&A, merger and acquisition\nactivity going on that nobody's aware of,\n\n1386\n01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:35,180\nbut that could directly\nimpact our risk assessment.\n\n1387\n01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:38,920\nBecause now, we're about to expose\nthe liability of the company by acquiring\n\n1388\n01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,730\nanother company, or\nwe may be acquired by somebody else.\n\n1389\n01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:42,600\nWho knows, right?\n\n1390\n01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:43,930\nThese things happen all the time.\n\n1391\n01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:46,830\nWe may be negotiating to\nmove to a new location,\n\n1392\n01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:49,090\nget bigger office space,\nnobody may know that.\n\n1393\n01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:51,200\nBut senior management typically will, and\n\n1394\n01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,000\nif that's about to happen,\nwe have to take that into account.\n\n1395\n01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,750\nBecause now, our risk assessment\nmodeling and our business impact, and\n\n1396\n01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:59,650\nall that has to be adjusted for the new.\n\n1397\n01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:02,700\nNot only for the move, but\nthen ultimately for the new office space.\n\n1398\n01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:06,292\nSo, it's really important to go back and\ntalk to these people because there may be\n\n1399\n01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:08,910\nthings going on behind the scenes\nthat we're not aware of.\n\n1400\n01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:13,850\nOne of the big ones that happens,\nit doesn't happen very often, but\n\n1401\n01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:16,430\nI've had it happen with a couple of\ncompanies that I've done work with,\n\n1402\n01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:17,980\nis they're planning on doing an IPO.\n\n1403\n01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:20,780\nThey're getting ready to go public,\nin effect.\n\n1404\n01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:22,640\nAnd it's obviously very quiet,\nit's hush-hush.\n\n1405\n01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:26,040\nYou don't tell people until right before\nthe filings actually going to take place.\n\n1406\n01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:26,720\nBut they're planning.\n\n1407\n01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:30,940\nThey're on that one year or two year\nRAM cycle towards going to an IPO.\n\n1408\n01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:34,630\nAnd as a result of that, there are certain\nrisk assessment things that have to be\n\n1409\n01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:38,410\ntaken into account, and business\nimpact analysis that has to be done\n\n1410\n01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:41,780\naround the public offering that will\naffect the way you do business.\n\n1411\n01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:43,790\nThat are not in place until you go public.\n\n1412\n01:07:43,790 --> 01:07:47,270\nAnd so, that has to be made at\nleast not public knowledge.\n\n1413\n01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:50,510\nBut probably has to be something that\na certain select group of individuals\n\n1414\n01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:53,510\nwithin the company need to be made\naware of in order to account for.\n\n1415\n01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:55,700\nCuz you don't just go out and\ntell everybody, hey,\n\n1416\n01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:58,680\nin a year we're cycling towards\ntrying to get ready to go public.\n\n1417\n01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,630\nBut a certain small group of\npeople will be aware of that.\n\n1418\n01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:03,730\nSo, just wanna make sure you're\nthinking about those things,\n\n1419\n01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:06,412\nas we talk about going back and\naddressing executive management.\n\n1420\n01:08:06,412 --> 01:08:07,680\nAll right, very good.\n\n1421\n01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:10,260\nSo we've gone through that,\nI think now we have to talk about\n\n1422\n01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,780\njust some vocabulary I wanns\nthrow out there for the mix.\n\n1423\n01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:17,552\nSome recovery time objective, recovery\npoint objective, work recovery time.\n\n1424\n01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:19,560\nMaximum tolerable downtime.\n\n1425\n01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,720\nGot a bunch of different things\nwe wanna define there for you.\n\n1426\n01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,680\nThis is the working vocabulary, right?\n\n1427\n01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,230\nThe actual vocabulary that\ndoes the heavy lifting,\n\n1428\n01:08:27,230 --> 01:08:30,210\nthat indicates the actual\nsequencing of events.\n\n1429\n01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:34,200\nAnd the slicing of the time of\nthose events within this idea\n\n1430\n01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,160\nof recovery in just what we wanna do.\n\n1431\n01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:39,050\nSo actually,\nvery important information here.\n\n1432\n01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:42,330\nOne of those areas in this section you\ndefinitely wanna focus on spending\n\n1433\n01:08:42,330 --> 01:08:46,660\na little time on, get comfortable with the\ndefinitions, understand them in context.\n\n1434\n01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:49,150\nWe've drawn a pretty picture for\nall of our\n\n1435\n01:08:49,150 --> 01:08:52,390\npeople out there that Don's gonna share\nwith us, that puts us in the context.\n\n1436\n01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:53,730\nBut let's just talk through it first, and\n\n1437\n01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,760\nwe'll put picture up and\nkinda come back to it.\n\n1438\n01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,380\nSo, Recovery Time Objective,\nwhich is known as RTO.\n\n1439\n01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:02,800\nCRTO, the earliest time\nperiod at a service level.\n\n1440\n01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,840\nWe talked about both cause we\ntalked about puritive time and\n\n1441\n01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,530\nthe level of service we\nprovide within that time.\n\n1442\n01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:10,960\nWithin which a business process\nmust be restored after a disaster.\n\n1443\n01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,050\nSo the RTO is the absolute\nearliest point in time\n\n1444\n01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:20,300\nthat we will restore that service back to\nwhen we think about a disaster happening.\n\n1445\n01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,410\nSo it is kind of our starting point,\nright?\n\n1446\n01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:24,270\nIf we say we can recover and\n\n1447\n01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:28,560\nhit the mark with RTO, we're back up\nwithin the SLA window, let's say.\n\n1448\n01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,580\nRight around that recovery objective,\nwe're good.\n\n1449\n01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:35,900\nNow it's typically,\nthe RTO is gonna be smaller than the MTD.\n\n1450\n01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:40,560\nThe MTD is the maximum tolerable downtime.\n\n1451\n01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,380\nThe MTD represents the furthest\npoint out on the scale.\n\n1452\n01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:45,530\nRight?\nIf we think about\n\n1453\n01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:49,520\nRTO being the beginning point, where if we\nhit the mark and we recover we're good.\n\n1454\n01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,150\nRight?\n\n1455\n01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:55,310\nMTD is that furthest point out on\nthe scale where we can still recover,\n\n1456\n01:09:55,310 --> 01:09:56,930\nand it's gonna be okay.\n\n1457\n01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:58,620\nRight?\nWe're still within the window.\n\n1458\n01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:01,280\nBut if we pass that MTD, at the point,\n\n1459\n01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,840\nwe've passed the maximum tolerable\namount of time we can be down.\n\n1460\n01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:08,690\nAt that point, our inability to recover is\ngonna start leading to some significant\n\n1461\n01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:10,050\nliabilities for the business.\n\n1462\n01:10:10,050 --> 01:10:12,800\nPerhaps, damage to our\nreputation as we said there.\n\n1463\n01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:18,350\nWhich is a qualitative measure, a soft\nmeasure, and or quantitative measures.\n\n1464\n01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:21,510\nFinancial impact, numbers,\nbottom line kind of thing.\n\n1465\n01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:22,880\nWe measure both, but\n\n1466\n01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,550\nthe MTD is that maximum window that we\ncan recover against and still be okay.\n\n1467\n01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:30,340\nThe RTO is the minimum,\nthe earliest part of that window.\n\n1468\n01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:32,740\nAnd the two of them\ntogether form like a block,\n\n1469\n01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:35,442\na timeline within which\nwe try to nail recovery.\n\n1470\n01:10:35,442 --> 01:10:37,900\nWe wanna be somewhere between the RTO and\nthe MTD in other words,\n\n1471\n01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,850\nis what we ultimately want to do.\n\n1472\n01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:43,170\nThe RTO assumes there is a period\nof acceptable downtime, by the way.\n\n1473\n01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:45,360\nRight?\nSo as a result of this we say,\n\n1474\n01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,870\nlisten, we may go off line.\n\n1475\n01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:49,990\nWe can go off line for up to an hour.\n\n1476\n01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:50,570\nRight?\n\n1477\n01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:53,680\nAnd so if an hour's our\nmaximum tolerable down time,\n\n1478\n01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:56,270\nthe RTO maybe somewhere within that.\n\n1479\n01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:59,630\nMaybe within 15 minutes,\nwe wanna be back up if at all possible.\n\n1480\n01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:00,405\nRight?\nSo\n\n1481\n01:11:00,405 --> 01:11:03,570\nRTO may be the fifteen minute\nmark in that downtime cycle.\n\n1482\n01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:05,750\nAnd then an hour, 45 minutes later,\n\n1483\n01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:09,622\na total of 60 minutes is our MTB,\nour maximum tolerable downtime.\n\n1484\n01:11:09,622 --> 01:11:13,160\nWe wanna be somewhere between 15\nminutes and 60 on our recovery.\n\n1485\n01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:15,740\nFifteen minutes, you maybe ask yourself,\nwell, why not one minute?\n\n1486\n01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,300\nWhy don't we just come back up right away?\n\n1487\n01:11:17,300 --> 01:11:20,190\nFifteen minutes is probably because,\nright?\n\n1488\n01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:22,534\nAnd because I'm making the scenario,\nI can say it's definitely because.\n\n1489\n01:11:22,534 --> 01:11:23,600\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Because it's in my head.\n\n1490\n01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:28,760\nIn real business, what we often see\nis those RTO's are going to be 15,\n\n1491\n01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,980\n20 minutes or\nsomething like that to start off with.\n\n1492\n01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:32,590\nBecause you're gonna have to account for\n\n1493\n01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:34,605\nthe fact that systems\nmay have to be cycled.\n\n1494\n01:11:34,605 --> 01:11:36,660\nRight?\nWe may have to do certain things to bring\n\n1495\n01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:37,640\nthem back on.\n\n1496\n01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:40,440\nThere's usually a checklist\ninvolved in us going through\n\n1497\n01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:42,130\nthat if we have to restart things.\n\n1498\n01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:45,540\nThings may have to restart in a certain\norder, and be brought up and running for\n\n1499\n01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:48,730\na certain period of time before we\ncan then bring something else on.\n\n1500\n01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:52,578\nAnd so as a result of that checklist to\nwalk through the proper safe recovery\n\n1501\n01:11:52,578 --> 01:11:55,770\nprocedures, there's usually\na time associated with that.\n\n1502\n01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:56,740\nWhatever that is.\n\n1503\n01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:59,720\nThat amount of time we add up is the RTO,\nright?\n\n1504\n01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:03,230\nThat's how long at a minimum, it takes us\nto get back to a point where we in theory,\n\n1505\n01:12:03,230 --> 01:12:05,870\ncould be recovered if\neverything went flawlessly and\n\n1506\n01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:07,950\nthere were no interruptions,\nnothing went sideways.\n\n1507\n01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:09,745\nEverything just worked the way it should.\n\n1508\n01:12:09,745 --> 01:12:11,654\nWhich normally is not usually the case,\nright?\n\n1509\n01:12:11,654 --> 01:12:15,798\nSo we shoot for that, but the reality is\nwe typically wind up somewhere inside\n\n1510\n01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:20,036\nof the RTO, but hopefully prior to the MTD\nis what we're really shooting for.\n\n1511\n01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:22,299\nThat sweet spot between the two.\n\n1512\n01:12:22,299 --> 01:12:27,446\nThe work recovery time,\nwhat's known as the WRT, is the remainder\n\n1513\n01:12:27,446 --> 01:12:33,320\nof the overall maximum tolerable\ndowntime value after we pass the RTO.\n\n1514\n01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:36,050\nSo in other words,\nsomewhere between 15 minutes and\n\n1515\n01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:40,840\n60 in my example, is the WRT,\nthe work recovery time.\n\n1516\n01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:46,080\nSo it's that time that exists after\nthe RTO mark, but before the MTD mark.\n\n1517\n01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:47,600\nThat's what we want to think about there.\n\n1518\n01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,390\nWe have, again, a picture we'll\nshow you in a minute to do that.\n\n1519\n01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:54,690\nRecovery point objective,\nRPO, Recovery point objective\n\n1520\n01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:58,600\nis the acceptable amount of data\nlost that is measured over time.\n\n1521\n01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,147\nSo, we may say, look, we're gonna\nlose fifteen minutes worth of data,\n\n1522\n01:13:02,147 --> 01:13:05,230\n100 megabytes over 15\nminutes to a achieve our RTO.\n\n1523\n01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:06,390\nWe're okay with that.\n\n1524\n01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:08,970\nThat would be our recovery point\nobjective, whatever that is, but\n\n1525\n01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:13,040\nit's data loss measured over or\nin a certain amount of time, and\n\n1526\n01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:17,830\nnotice here before we go to the graphic,\nthe MTD, the maximum tolerable downtime.\n\n1527\n01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:20,270\nRTO, recovery time objective, and\n\n1528\n01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:26,110\nRPO, recovery point objective, all of\nthese values are derived during the BIA.\n\n1529\n01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,430\nHugely important statement for\nus to make there.\n\n1530\n01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:31,100\nProbably worthy of an asterisk as well,\nI would think.\n\n1531\n01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:36,280\nProbably want to know that the MTD, RTO\nand RPO values have derived from the BIA,\n\n1532\n01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,510\nfrom the business impact analysis and\nremember, maybe a good time to\n\n1533\n01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,980\nbring out the graphic as well,\nwhile I'm talking over this for a minute.\n\n1534\n01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:48,490\nRemember, that everything good, everything\nwe do, goodness equals recovery by\n\n1535\n01:13:48,490 --> 01:13:53,670\nthe way in our world here, so everything\ngood starts with the BIA, right?\n\n1536\n01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:57,540\nBecause we don't do the BIA we can't\npossibly do the risk assessment.\n\n1537\n01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:00,420\nIf we don't do the risk assessment\nwe don't know how to react.\n\n1538\n01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:03,498\nAnd we haven't defined our maximum\ntolerable downtimes, our RPOs and\n\n1539\n01:14:03,498 --> 01:14:06,024\nour RTOs and we have no way\nof understanding that, right?\n\n1540\n01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:08,050\nSo, just be aware of that, all right.\n\n1541\n01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:10,340\nSo, the recovery point objective is there.\n\n1542\n01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:12,870\nRecovery time objective is there.\n\n1543\n01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:17,870\nOur WRT,\nour work recovery time is there, right,\n\n1544\n01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,360\nso all our stuff is listed\nthere as you can see.\n\n1545\n01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:23,370\nSo our system goes unavailable\non the left there, right?\n\n1546\n01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:25,340\nKind of starting point right there.\n\n1547\n01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,130\nSo at that point,\nour recovery point objective kicks in.\n\n1548\n01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:31,420\nRemember, it's the amount of data\nwe can lose over the time it takes\n\n1549\n01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:34,950\nto begin system recovery,\nthat's what our RPO represents.\n\n1550\n01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:39,530\nSo that space right there, up to the RTO\nwhere it says, begin system recovery,\n\n1551\n01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:44,310\nis that amount of time representing the\nRPO, and the amount of data we may lose.\n\n1552\n01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:45,750\nMaybe something like ten megabytes.\n\n1553\n01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:46,490\nWe don't know what it is.\n\n1554\n01:14:46,490 --> 01:14:47,910\nWhatever it's measured out as.\n\n1555\n01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:49,143\nWhatever we define it as.\n\n1556\n01:14:49,143 --> 01:14:53,857\nThe RTO there on the first yellow or\norangeish line, whatever color that is,\n\n1557\n01:14:53,857 --> 01:14:54,710\nkicks in.\n\n1558\n01:14:54,710 --> 01:14:57,210\nWe have an ongoing debate\nhere about what color it is.\n\n1559\n01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:00,170\nSo it kicks in there,\nbegins system recovery.\n\n1560\n01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:03,090\nThat is where we will\nstart to do the recovery.\n\n1561\n01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:04,470\nNow again, if everything lines up,\n\n1562\n01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:08,380\neverything works flawlessly, we hit\nthe RTO mark, we're back online right?\n\n1563\n01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:11,630\nWe could just jump right over\nto resume normal operation.\n\n1564\n01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:14,860\nBecause, in effect, we've actually hit\nthe mark and everything has worked well.\n\n1565\n01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:19,810\nSo somewhere in that RTO period,\nright, is where we wanna be, but\n\n1566\n01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:22,530\nagain, not everything works\nthe right way the first time,\n\n1567\n01:15:22,530 --> 01:15:24,210\nnot everything comes\nback online right away.\n\n1568\n01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:25,220\nThings go wrong.\n\n1569\n01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:30,330\nSo we may verge into the remainder of\nour maximum tolerable downtown window,\n\n1570\n01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:34,130\nwhich is going to be the WRT,\nright, the work recovery time.\n\n1571\n01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:35,180\nYou can see it there.\n\n1572\n01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:40,490\nSo the WRT is that remainder block of\ntime up to the bar where the MTD stops.\n\n1573\n01:15:40,490 --> 01:15:44,180\nThe absolute window on the far end\nwhere we say we must be recovered by\n\n1574\n01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,300\nthis point in time.\n\n1575\n01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:47,080\nIt's the drop dead, we often call it.\n\n1576\n01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:50,220\nThe drop dead window, right, where you\ngotta be back online no matter what.\n\n1577\n01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:51,760\nSo that's the MTD.\n\n1578\n01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,720\nSo then you see,\nassuming we hit our marks,\n\n1579\n01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:58,670\nsomewhere from RTO at the beginning to\nultimately the MTD value on the far side,\n\n1580\n01:15:58,670 --> 01:16:02,490\nwhatever that is, if we hit our mark,\nwe resume normal operations at that point.\n\n1581\n01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:04,680\nSo it's going to be very\nimportant to be aware of that and\n\n1582\n01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:05,780\nbe thinking about that, right?\n\n1583\n01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:09,350\nSo hopefully the graphic just helps\nto put that in perspective for you.\n\n1584\n01:16:09,350 --> 01:16:13,310\nYou want to obviously understand MTD,\nmaximum tolerable downtime\n\n1585\n01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:17,950\nis made up of the RTO plus the WRT,\nin other words, split into two parts.\n\n1586\n01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:21,880\nThe RPO is that ramp up, that amount of\ntime, and the amount of data over that\n\n1587\n01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,350\namount of time we're going to\nlose until we start recovery and\n\n1588\n01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:28,310\nthe maximum tolerable downtime over all\nis that window that we try to attempt\n\n1589\n01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:32,740\nrecovery within, right before we have some\nsort of catastrophic disaster or event.\n\n1590\n01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:33,470\nAll right, very good.\n\n1591\n01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:35,010\nSo hopefully the graphic\nhelps a little bit.\n\n1592\n01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:39,290\nAlways good to visualize things,\nnot just see them as words on the page and\n\n1593\n01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:41,770\nhear them, but also go through and\nvisualize them as well.\n\n1594\n01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:45,490\nAll right, so, having put all of this\ninto context, we've done the BIA.\n\n1595\n01:16:45,490 --> 01:16:47,610\nThere's this impact analysis.\n\n1596\n01:16:47,610 --> 01:16:49,230\nWe've done the risk assessment.\n\n1597\n01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:52,001\nWe've talked about the mechanisms,\nthe timing mechanisms,\n\n1598\n01:16:52,001 --> 01:16:54,311\nthat are used to do the recovery,\nto drive it for us.\n\n1599\n01:16:54,311 --> 01:16:57,125\nWe've laid out a,\nhopefully a pretty good map for you, and\n\n1600\n01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:59,500\na pretty good flow overall\nas to what we want to do.\n\n1601\n01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:03,212\nWe're gonna come back with a few other\nthings we want to go through and\n\n1602\n01:17:03,212 --> 01:17:07,244\njust make sure we've documented those\nout for us, and that will be another\n\n1603\n01:17:07,244 --> 01:17:11,727\ndiscussion coming back after we finish up\nthis one, and take another small break.\n\n1604\n01:17:11,727 --> 01:17:13,847\n>> [LAUGH] All right, well,\nwhat we're going to do is,\n\n1605\n01:17:13,847 --> 01:17:16,518\nI think we're actually gonna branch\nthis one off into a part two.\n\n1606\n01:17:16,518 --> 01:17:17,643\nSo.\n>> Part two.\n\n1607\n01:17:17,643 --> 01:17:20,530\n>> So, we'll go ahead and\nwrap this episode here.\n\n1608\n01:17:20,530 --> 01:17:22,580\nYou know,\nI love to leave it on a cliffhanger right?\n\n1609\n01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:25,320\nThe anticipation, the energy it creates.\n\n1610\n01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:30,350\nSo, we'll stop and when we get\nback in business continuity and.\n\n1611\n01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:31,260\n>> Disaster recovery planning.\n\n1612\n01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:31,925\n>> The longest title.\n\n1613\n01:17:31,925 --> 01:17:34,670\n[LAUGH] There's gotta be\na shorter name to this episode.\n\n1614\n01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:36,480\nAnyhow, this will be part one.\n\n1615\n01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:39,830\nStay tuned, because we're gonna jump into\npart two and you'll get a chance to see\n\n1616\n01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:42,480\nthe exciting conclusion as we\nmove through the final topics,\n\n1617\n01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:43,500\nsome of the various things.\n\n1618\n01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:46,070\nIt'll probably be a shorter episode,\ncuz there's not.\n\n1619\n01:17:46,070 --> 01:17:48,090\n>> Yeah, just some things like\nfacility recovery types and\n\n1620\n01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:49,950\nsome very small amount of\nstuff we've got to go through.\n\n1621\n01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:50,570\nAbsolutely.\n\n1622\n01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:51,120\n>> So we'll get to that.\n\n1623\n01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,090\nSo stay tuned.\n\n1624\n01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:53,300\nWe hope you guys enjoyed this show.\n\n1625\n01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:56,920\nLet me just remind you guys if you\never have any

00:00:34,811\nAll right, everybody.\n\n5\n00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:36,800\nWelcome to another episode of ITProTV.\n\n6\n00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,150\nI'm Mike Rodrick and\nwith me today is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n7\n00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,520\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n8\n00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,280\nI am doing spectacular.\n\n9\n00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,940\n>> Good, good, good, good.\n\n10\n00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,710\n>> I am doing great.\n\n11\n00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,990\n>> We are still working on\nour CISSP episodes and today,\n\n12\n00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,670\nwe are gonna do part two of our business\ncontinuity and disaster recovery.\n\n13\n00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,412\nSo we'll take a look at some of those.\n\n14\n00:00:55,412 --> 00:01:01,220\nMore vocabulary and then some techniques\nthat we can use to do just that, to\n\n15\n00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,910\nmake sure our business is up and running\nand recover in the event of a disaster.\n\n16\n00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,210\nAbsolutely, so\nlet's get right down to it as they say.\n\n17\n00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,440\nDon't want to waste any time when\nwe're dealing with recovery.\n\n18\n00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:10,950\n>> That's right.\n\n19\n00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,980\nBe spot on and\n\n20\n00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,920\nfocused there and hit our MTBD, which\nis our mean time between Mountain Dew.\n\n21\n00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,530\nOr MTBMD I should say, right?\n\n22\n00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,040\nMean time between Mountain Dew.\n\n23\n00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,960\nSo we want to make sure we're focused.\n\n24\n00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,030\nIf you remember, if you've gone through\nand have been looking at our content or\n\n25\n00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,300\nif you're following us live as we've been\nbroadcasting these past few discussions,\n\n26\n00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,570\nwe've been talking about the beginning\nparts of business continuity and\n\n27\n00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,840\ndisaster recovery.\n\n28\n00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,250\nSo we went through, laid out for\n\n29\n00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,320\nyou the overarching In kind\nof overview thought process.\n\n30\n00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,680\nWhat is it, why do we do it,\nwhat do we focus on?\n\n31\n00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,890\nWe looked at some of the constituent\nparts, the business impact analysis,\n\n32\n00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,590\nthe BIA, we talked about setting that up,\nunderstanding why we run that,\n\n33\n00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,670\nto be able to identify what are known as\nthe CBFs or critical business factors.\n\n34\n00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,810\nSo really focusing on those systems,\n\n35\n00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,060\nthose functions the business must\nhave in order to survive and thrive.\n\n36\n00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,740\nWe took the output of the BIA,\nthe Business Impact Analysis,\n\n37\n00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,160\nrolled it into our risk assessment,\nwalked through the steps associated\n\n38\n00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,950\nwith risk assessment to help us understand\nand identify risk as a function.\n\n39\n00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,850\nReally understanding what\nthe threat impact and probability\n\n40\n00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,460\nwill be of those risks that we're\ntalking about, really being realized.\n\n41\n00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,260\nSo if we identify in the BIA\nthat email is a critical system,\n\n42\n00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,050\nwe need to have email up and running,\n\n43\n00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,630\nwhat is the true risk to the business\nif email is down and for how long?\n\n44\n00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,490\nHow do we ascribe value to that?\n\n45\n00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,590\nHow do we prioritize that?\n\n46\n00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,880\nWhat does that mean?\n\n47\n00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,620\nSo we went through, we talked about\nall that, put that all in context.\n\n48\n00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,980\nWhat we want to do now\nis what we talked about,\n\n49\n00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,780\nsome of the facility recovery\nsolutions that we have.\n\n50\n00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,260\nHow do we go through,\nhow do we identify what kind of recovery\n\n51\n00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,670\nwe're dealing with based on whether\nit's a disaster, a catastrophe?\n\n52\n00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,210\nWhat is that occurrence?\n\n53\n00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:49,930\nWhat do we label it?\n\n54\n00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,000\nWhat does it mean?\n\n55\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,960\nWe'll talk about that, and then we'll talk\nabout some of the other options like what\n\n56\n00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,990\nkind of recovery site we might be dealing\nwith, what are the mechanisms involved.\n\n57\n00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,780\nAlso, what are some of the back up\nsolutions we might bring to bear,\n\n58\n00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,010\nwhether we journal, whether we vault,\nwhether we do a straight back up of data,\n\n59\n00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,710\nwe do an incremental or differential.\n\n60\n00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,020\nYou'll wanna talk through some of\nthose things, put those in context.\n\n61\n00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,630\n>> Then, we'll go through and also discuss\nsome of the testing types that we do\n\n62\n00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,840\naround looking at our plans,\nonce we get them all put together,\n\n63\n00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,580\nkind of laid out, and\nreported out to the business and\n\n64\n00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,740\nsatisfied that we've covered all\nthe elements we have to account for.\n\n65\n00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,710\n>> We then wanna run through and\n\n66\n00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,890\nlook at them over a periodic amount of\ntime to ensure that they're still aligned,\n\n67\n00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,202\nstill focused and really still\nvaluable for what we're doing.\n\n68\n00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:33,040\nSo we'll go through and\ntalk about those as well.\n\n69\n00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,980\nAll right, non-disaster.\n\n70\n00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,515\nWe'll talk about facility recovery.\n\n71\n00:03:36,515 --> 00:03:40,295\nWe'll want to first classify what\nkind of an event we're dealing with.\n\n72\n00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:44,855\nA non-disaster, in the language of\nbusiness continuity and disaster recovery,\n\n73\n00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:48,555\nis this idea of disruption and\nservice due to some sort of failure but\n\n74\n00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:54,032\none that's not going be so critical\nthat it just blows us out of the water.\n\n75\n00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:55,842\nSo we haven't lost the building,\n\n76\n00:03:55,842 --> 00:04:00,002\nwe haven't lost the entire use of\nthe building for any period of time.\n\n77\n00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:03,930\nWe really just have an individual\ndevice or a service that's gone dark,\n\n78\n00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,080\nso this could be as simple as the power\nsupply on the laptop fails but\n\n79\n00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,730\nif it's a mission critical laptop,\nthen obviously that's an event.\n\n80\n00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,400\nIt's something we need to be aware of but\nit's not a disaster at the end of the day.\n\n81\n00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,770\nMaybe for you, if happens to be your\nmachine that could be an issue but\n\n82\n00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,510\nfor everyone else around you,\nthey're still happy,\n\n83\n00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,660\nthey're just not really\ntoo concerned about it.\n\n84\n00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,020\nLast night, I lost internet connectivity\nand I was trying to do some work.\n\n85\n00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,660\n>> Was it a disaster?\n\n86\n00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,628\n>> It was not quite a disaster but\ngave me time to actually then engage\n\n87\n00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:42,100\nin other activities, so I was actually\nable to catch up on some other things.\n\n88\n00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,580\nBut the idea was I was kind of looking\nforward to being able to get some work\n\n89\n00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,610\ndone after we got done and catch up on\na few things, didn't work out that way.\n\n90\n00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,180\n>> Right.\n>> As a result, that was a non-disaster\n\n91\n00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,740\nevent for me but obviously, could have\nbeen a little bit more productive.\n\n92\n00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,220\nSo that's what you see.\n\n93\n00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,560\n>> With the disaster, we're talking about\nevents that caused the entire facility of\n\n94\n00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,290\nthe office, wherever we are, whatever that\nfocus is that we're talking about there,\n\n95\n00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,810\nthat facility, that building, to be\nable to be unusable for a day or longer.\n\n96\n00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,800\nA disaster is something that will\nrender that area unusable for\n\n97\n00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,110\na period of time,\ntypically use a day as a threshold there.\n\n98\n00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,930\nIf the event that takes place\ncauses a disruption in power or\n\n99\n00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,950\nInternet service for\na couple of hours but not for\n\n100\n00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,860\nan entire day,\nwe'd say it's a non-disaster event.\n\n101\n00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,390\nIf it took us down for a day or\nlonger, it would then be a disaster.\n\n102\n00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:29,930\nRight.\n\n103\n00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,460\n>> So just think about that.\n\n104\n00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,390\nThen a catastrophe is a major disruption,\nnot just hey,\n\n105\n00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,850\nwe lost power, it's going to be out for 12\nhours, so go home and come back tomorrow.\n\n106\n00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,300\nA disaster that really can\ntake down something and\n\n107\n00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,780\nknock it out totally\nwe call a catastrophe.\n\n108\n00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,560\nThat's where maybe the building gets\ndamaged, we're not able to use it.\n\n109\n00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,690\nAt that point,\nperhaps it's even destroyed.\n\n110\n00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,630\nIt could be a fire, some sort of\nsevere weather event could do this.\n\n111\n00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:59,420\nMaybe a hurricane or some sort of a snow\nstorm or a flood, whatever it may be,\n\n112\n00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,340\nthat is going to be a catastrophe and\nthat's how we're going to categorize that.\n\n113\n00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,630\nJust wanna make sure we're comfortable\nwith these ideas, these definitions,\n\n114\n00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,960\na lot of this is just strictly vocabulary,\nterminology we have to just understand.\n\n115\n00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,680\nI think you've said, a couple times,\nwe've gone through some of this,\n\n116\n00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,172\nthis is the brute force memorization\nportion of our program.\n\n117\n00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:21,565\nThis is good stuff to consider,\nmaybe throwing into some flash cards,\n\n118\n00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:26,010\ncarting some vocabulary lists around,\ndoing some rote memorization,\n\n119\n00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,180\ngoing through and understanding,\nmastering these terms will be valuable for\n\n120\n00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,250\nyou as you look to prepare\nto answer some questions.\n\n121\n00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,640\nWhen we talk about now that we've\nkind of framed the event itself,\n\n122\n00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,460\nwhat category is it, non-disaster,\ndisaster, catastrophe,\n\n123\n00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,780\nnow what we have to do is think about\nwhat we're actually going to start doing.\n\n124\n00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,890\nAre we going to recover?\n\n125\n00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,640\nIf so, where are we going to recover and\nwhat kind of measurements of time,\n\n126\n00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,640\nwhat metrics are we going to\nuse to help us understand that?\n\n127\n00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:58,820\nWe have MTBF, a mean time between failure,\nand we have MTTR, mean time to repair.\n\n128\n00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,930\nThe MTBF measurement is a measurement\ngiven to us by the vendor\n\n129\n00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,630\nthat provides the good or the service.\n\n130\n00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,740\nThis is basically an expiration,\nlife cycle measurement, so\n\n131\n00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,440\nthis particular piece of equipment\nis good for this long, typically.\n\n132\n00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,070\n>> So that's the average it should\nbe good for before it fails.\n\n133\n00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,780\nWe call that planned obsolescence in\nthe marketing area of our program,\n\n134\n00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,390\nwhere you build something, it's good for\n\n135\n00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,960\na year because you're building in that\nautomatic revenue re-generation cycle.\n\n136\n00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,130\nSo iPhones may fall into this category,\nfor instance.\n\n137\n00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,610\nIf you can't get the battery out of\nthe darn thing, at a certain point,\n\n138\n00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,950\nyou've got to go and get a new one.\n\n139\n00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,050\n>> They know you're going\nto buy another one.\n\n140\n00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,350\n>> They know you're going to\nbuy another one, exactly right.\n\n141\n00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,555\nSo the MTBF there for the Apple device\nis little bit manipulated probably but\n\n142\n00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:43,697\nwhen you think generically about\nnetworking gear, think about the kind of\n\n143\n00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:48,361\ngear we may build into an infrastructure,\nwhether it's a router, it's a switch,\n\n144\n00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:51,209\nhard drive, a firewall,\ncould be a power supply.\n\n145\n00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,915\nSome things last longer than others.\n\n146\n00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:56,069\nWe don't tend to see power supplies\nfail too often, they do fail, but\n\n147\n00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,060\nthey don't tend to fail very often.\n\n148\n00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,220\nHard drives do tend to fail if they're\nbad, but if you get a good bunch and\n\n149\n00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,970\nthey are good, they tend to be\ngood longer than the actual\n\n150\n00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,440\nequipment that they're usually in, right?\n\n151\n00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,860\nIn other words,\nyou tend to retire that server\n\n152\n00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,860\ntypically long before that\nhard drive actually goes bad.\n\n153\n00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,180\nAgain, you know, on average,\nmore often than not.\n\n154\n00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,510\nLots of cases where the hard drive\nfails way before the equipment does.\n\n155\n00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,880\nBut, if you look at the life\ncycle of those products,\n\n156\n00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,590\nyou tend to see that in\nlaptops' power supplies, right?\n\n157\n00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,980\nCuz of the constant bundling and\nunbundling of that cord.\n\n158\n00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,530\nThey tend to go bad way\nbefore the device does.\n\n159\n00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,210\nYou may crack a screen on this thing, or\n\n160\n00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:32,170\nblow pixels on it way before\nthe hard drive goes bad.\n\n161\n00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,780\nSo, it depends on the kind of\nequipment we're talking about.\n\n162\n00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,170\nYou know, those old track ball\nmouses used to be famous for\n\n163\n00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,670\njust going bad on you, especially if you\nwere rolling them around on the desk where\n\n164\n00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,140\nthere's a lot of dirt and dust.\n\n165\n00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,890\nAnd so those will go bad every year or\nsomething you'll be replacing those,\n\n166\n00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,130\nwhereas keyboards,\nyou know, may last forever.\n\n167\n00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,560\nIf you didn't start pulling the keys\nout of it and things like that.\n\n168\n00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,280\n>> They survive all the Dorito crumbs and\neverything.\n\n169\n00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,390\n>> They do.\nThey're almost indestructible.\n\n170\n00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,540\nYou often wonder if they could just make\nthe rest of the laptop as impervious to\n\n171\n00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,970\ndamage as your keyboard,\nwhy it'd just be great,\n\n172\n00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,410\nbut then they'd only sell one laptop,\nand that would be it.\n\n173\n00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,318\nSo that's the kind of\nthing we're talking about.\n\n174\n00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:09,500\nSo MTBF is really coming from the vendor,\nin the sense they kinda tell you,\n\n175\n00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,240\nwe think this product's\ngonna last this long.\n\n176\n00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,330\nThat kind of thing.\n\n177\n00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,145\nMTTR, mean time to repair.\n\n178\n00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:16,435\nThis is, again, an average.\n\n179\n00:09:16,435 --> 00:09:17,355\nMean means average.\n\n180\n00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:20,675\nSo we're looking at an average amount,\nan average measure of time.\n\n181\n00:09:20,675 --> 00:09:23,605\nThis is gonna be, on average,\nhow long it takes to repair something.\n\n182\n00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,467\nIf we go back to that idea\nof the old track ball mice,\n\n183\n00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,155\nthat was a pretty quick fix, right?\n\n184\n00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:29,545\nYou'd unscrew that little bottom piece.\n\n185\n00:09:29,545 --> 00:09:30,605\n>> Pull that thing out the bottom.\n\n186\n00:09:30,605 --> 00:09:33,340\n>> Pop the ball out there,\ngive it a good shot of air.\n\n187\n00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,438\nYou'd use compressed air or\njust blow into it.\n\n188\n00:09:35,438 --> 00:09:37,902\nMay stick a finger in there and\npull some of the junk off the roller.\n\n189\n00:09:37,902 --> 00:09:39,830\nCuz you have all that lint and\nstuff rolled up in there.\n\n190\n00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,890\n>> Don't try to think where it came\nfrom and just get it off there.\n\n191\n00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,310\n>> Right, well,\nthat's why you need interns, right?\n\n192\n00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,850\nThat's why we used to have interns.\n\n193\n00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,610\nCuz interns were perfect for\nthis kind of stuff.\n\n194\n00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,240\nJoey, come here.\n\n195\n00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,190\nI gotta job for ya.\n\n196\n00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,798\nYou're gonna wanna put\nthis on your resume.\n\n197\n00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:50,384\nRight?\n[LAUGH]\n\n198\n00:09:50,384 --> 00:09:50,893\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n199\n00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:54,010\n>> Head mouse cleaner here at company ABC.\n\n200\n00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,985\nAnd so yeah, you would just,\nreally probably two, three minute fix,\n\n201\n00:09:56,985 --> 00:10:00,550\njust really quickly turn it over, shake\nit out, clean it out, get a little air\n\n202\n00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,750\nin there, and then you would put it back\nin, roll it around, make sure it was good.\n\n203\n00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,960\nMore often than not, you were pretty good.\n\n204\n00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,520\n>> Back in business.\n\n205\n00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,970\n>> So it really would just depend.\n\n206\n00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,970\nYou ever have the VGA cables?\n\n207\n00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,700\n>> Yes.\n>> That you would be pushing in there,\n\n208\n00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,157\nand one of those pins would get broken.\n\n209\n00:10:12,157 --> 00:10:16,583\n[CROSSTALK] Or the PS2 mouse or the PS2\nkeyboard, you'd have to get the little\n\n210\n00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,097\ntweezers out or the-\n>> Try to bend it back without breaking it\n\n211\n00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:19,670\nall the way off.\n\n212\n00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,570\n>> Right.\n>> Cuz you know if you\n\n213\n00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,940\nbend it too many times\nthat baby's gonna snap.\n\n214\n00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,900\n>> Exactly, right.\n\n215\n00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,950\nSo then you get it out, if you didn't have\nthe tweezers or the needlenose pliers,\n\n216\n00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,600\nthe old school trick was, you get a paper\nclip out, kind of unbend half of it.\n\n217\n00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,290\nGet in there and pry it back up.\n\n218\n00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:33,630\nThen you gotta get down there,\n\n219\n00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,400\nand you're like the mad scientist\nwith the little head light, trying\n\n220\n00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,740\nto figure out how to get it back in the\nhole so it doesn't bend or break again.\n\n221\n00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,310\nThen you put a big piece of tape on it and\nsay, do not remove.\n\n222\n00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,420\nThat kind of thing.\n\n223\n00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,630\nThis is what would go on in the old\ndays when you were trying to rig stuff.\n\n224\n00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,310\nYeah, exactly, yeah.\n\n225\n00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,575\n>> That's what I classified it as,\nthe joy of networking back then.\n\n226\n00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:53,270\n[LAUGH]\n>> So yeah.\n\n227\n00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,630\nThis is the kind of stuff you used to\ndo if you had to fix something, so\n\n228\n00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,490\nthis was like mean time to repair.\n\n229\n00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,700\nHow long did it take you to go find the\npaperclip, bend the pin back into place,\n\n230\n00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,520\nand then get under the desk and\ntry to plug it back in that thing.\n\n231\n00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,940\nAt that point,\nyou would just probably go and you know.\n\n232\n00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,050\nThat's why they invented USB mice and\n\n233\n00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,270\nUSB keyboards because somebody got\nsick and tired of doing that I think.\n\n234\n00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,970\nSo it's probably what drove that\nwhole solution right there.\n\n235\n00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,180\nSo that's the kind of thing we're\ntalking about, MTBF and MTTR.\n\n236\n00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,120\nSo then let's talk about it, since we now\nhave kind of measure of time and what it's\n\n237\n00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,240\ngonna mean, let's talk about where we\nmight actually seek to do some recovery.\n\n238\n00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,490\nSo we have this idea of hot, warm, and\n\n239\n00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,160\ncold sites, also threw in there\na redundant site, a rolling hot site,\n\n240\n00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,880\njust your different categories of sites\nthat we could look to as off-site recovery\n\n241\n00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,694\noptions if our primary facility met\nwith a catastrophe and became unusable.\n\n242\n00:11:41,694 --> 00:11:45,480\nOr met with a disaster and was unusable\nfor less of a period of time than\n\n243\n00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,780\na catastrophe, but we still had, we're\ngonna be out of it for a period of time.\n\n244\n00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,510\nRight?\nMaybe the roof developed a leak, so\n\n245\n00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,520\nthere's water damage.\n\n246\n00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,473\nYou gotta wait for that to get fixed.\n\n247\n00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:53,220\n>> Right, a couple of days, yep.\n\n248\n00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,444\n>> Could be a little bit.\n\n249\n00:11:54,444 --> 00:11:55,523\nGotta have some place else to go.\n\n250\n00:11:55,523 --> 00:11:57,795\nThese days, it may or\nmay not be as critical.\n\n251\n00:11:57,795 --> 00:12:01,675\nA lot of people work remotely, so you\nmay not need as many people in an office\n\n252\n00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:03,940\nin one place kinda doing\nwhat they're doing.\n\n253\n00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,235\nBut then again there's\ncertain kinds of companies,\n\n254\n00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:08,710\ncertain kinds of businesses that\nyou pretty much need to be there.\n\n255\n00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,630\n>> Yep.\n>> Because that's the only place\n\n256\n00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:10,350\nyou can do what you do, right?\n\n257\n00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,180\n>> Absolutely.\nAbsolutely.\n\n258\n00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,390\n>> So it really just depends on\nthe kind of business you're in.\n\n259\n00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,660\nSo we've probably often, a lot of us\nhave probably heard these ideas of hot,\n\n260\n00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,050\nwarm and cold site, but might never\nhave really formally defined them or\n\n261\n00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,182\ngone out and gotten the formal definition.\n\n262\n00:12:22,182 --> 00:12:24,680\nSo I wanna make sure we\nthrow them out here for you.\n\n263\n00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,350\nSo the key here with hot, warm, and\ncold is the beginning statement here,\n\n264\n00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,540\nwhere we say the facility is leased or\nrented.\n\n265\n00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,685\nMeaning it's not owned by the company but\nrather is indirectly gonna be used\n\n266\n00:12:35,685 --> 00:12:39,355\nby the company, and we'll compare that\nto a redundant site in a few minutes,\n\n267\n00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:43,205\nwhich is basically owned and\nmaintained directly by the company.\n\n268\n00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:44,893\nSo this idea of leasing or renting.\n\n269\n00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:47,985\nIn other words, you're borrowing\nfrom somebody on a per month basis,\n\n270\n00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:50,825\nyou're kinda paying them, so\nthe site's available, but\n\n271\n00:12:50,825 --> 00:12:52,395\nit's not an asset of the company.\n\n272\n00:12:52,395 --> 00:12:53,755\nYou don't own it.\n\n273\n00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:57,635\nAnd so it's leased or rented, and\nwith a hot site, it's fully ready and\n\n274\n00:12:57,635 --> 00:12:58,965\noperational within a few hours.\n\n275\n00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:02,990\nWe have all the wiring, so all of the HVAC\nis there, electrical, all the computers,\n\n276\n00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,750\nfurniture, all in place, wired up.\n\n277\n00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,650\nNetwork access is set up,\nthe site is probably up and\n\n278\n00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,120\nrunning, it may be close to being\nmirrored for data in real time.\n\n279\n00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,020\nYou may be running off\na few hours literally,\n\n280\n00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,990\nbecause probably every day\nat the end of the day,\n\n281\n00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,830\nthere may be a data dump into the system\nto bring that day's processing stuff in.\n\n282\n00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,670\nMaybe a few hour offset if you're\njournaling, you know bringing archives of\n\n283\n00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,370\nthe logs, or\nthe journal entries over for databases.\n\n284\n00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,630\nSo there's typically a small offset where\ndata's not 100% in sync in real time,\n\n285\n00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,090\nbut pretty close.\n\n286\n00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,960\nAnd so you may just have to bring\nin a few hours' worth of tape,\n\n287\n00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,900\na few hours worth of whatever to\neffectively synchronize the system, and\n\n288\n00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,580\nthen you're up and running, so it's very,\nvery quick recovery, almost immediate.\n\n289\n00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,990\n>> Really all you're doing, you got to\nredirect your users to the new facility.\n\n290\n00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,570\nThey can walk in, and they can go to work.\n\n291\n00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,250\n>> They can and obviously maybe\nswitch over some DNS records to\n\n292\n00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,310\nredirect web traffic and\nemail traffic, things like that.\n\n293\n00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,800\nMaybe your voice traffic, your VOIP\nswitch, has to be redirected over, so\n\n294\n00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,040\nyou know where that's stuff coming.\n\n295\n00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,270\nBut again, it's fairly quick.\n\n296\n00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,500\nWe're really talking about just some\nunder the hood tinkering, some nuts and\n\n297\n00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,530\nbolts kind of stuff.\n\n298\n00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,760\nIt's very tactical.\n\n299\n00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,534\nThe over-arching architecture and all the\nstuff supporting it's already all built,\n\n300\n00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:14,500\nup and running in place,\nand tested and ready to go.\n\n301\n00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,079\n>> Yes.\n>> A warm site facility that is leased or\n\n302\n00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,450\nrented and\nfully ready to operate within a few days.\n\n303\n00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,100\nYou're not quite as\nbuilt out as a hot site.\n\n304\n00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,960\nAll the architecture and\nthe implementation of it is, for\n\n305\n00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,040\nthe most part, done.\n\n306\n00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,048\nSo we do have all the HVAC stuff, so\nheating is there, cooling is there,\n\n307\n00:14:30,048 --> 00:14:33,467\npower's on, wiring is done,\nyou got your furniture there,\n\n308\n00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:36,714\ngot the computers laid out,\nprobably they're wired up.\n\n309\n00:14:36,714 --> 00:14:39,940\nBut stuff may be mothballed,\nmeaning it's probably all turned off.\n\n310\n00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,900\nIt hasn't been spun up recently.\n\n311\n00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,920\nYou gotta bring it up.\n\n312\n00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,900\nYou may have to load several weeks' or a\nmonth's worth of data because maybe you're\n\n313\n00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,760\nnot keeping that up to date very often.\n\n314\n00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,870\nMaybe it's literally just turned on and\nupdated once a week or once a month, so\n\n315\n00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,540\nit's not gonna be as up to date.\n\n316\n00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,010\nYou have all the other stuff you have to\ndo with hot site, redirecting people,\n\n317\n00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,330\nredirecting infrastructure,\nlike web and voice and e-mail.\n\n318\n00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,000\nAll that stuff has to happen, but\n\n319\n00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,280\nyou're also gonna have to bulk\nload data into the system, so\n\n320\n00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,950\nyou're gonna have to come in with, like I\nsaid, maybe up to 30 days' worth of data.\n\n321\n00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,640\nAnd do the upload into\nthe system to synchronize, so\n\n322\n00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,121\nthere's gonna be a delay\nthere when you do that.\n\n323\n00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:17,312\n[CROSSTALK] It could be a couple of\ndays to get that up and running,\n\n324\n00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:18,091\nabsolutely correct.\n\n325\n00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:22,960\nAnd then the cold site is really gonna be\nagain this idea of leasing or renting.\n\n326\n00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,790\nIt's gonna be a few weeks\nto turn this thing on.\n\n327\n00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,884\nIt is basically a shell, right.\n\n328\n00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:31,350\nYou're gonna walk in, it's probably a\nbare, concrete, bare office like facility.\n\n329\n00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,430\nSo, there is stuff there.\n\n330\n00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,330\nYou have the basic shell.\n\n331\n00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,480\nYou have wiring.\n\n332\n00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,383\nHVAC is there.\n\n333\n00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,740\nThese systems have to be turned on,\ntypically.\n\n334\n00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,900\nSo there's power available.\n\n335\n00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,824\nBut other than just the bare walls and\n\n336\n00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:46,184\nmaybe some jacks in the wall to be able to\nhook stuff into, everything may be there.\n\n337\n00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:49,710\nYou may preload and have available\nthe furniture and the computers,\n\n338\n00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,415\nprobably all mothballed in store,\nbut it's not broken out, set up, or\n\n339\n00:15:53,415 --> 00:15:57,820\nif it is broken out and set up, it's all\ndust covered, and it's probably not wired.\n\n340\n00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,466\nSo you gotta go in and\nfirst wire everything up, set it all up.\n\n341\n00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:01,419\nBuild it all out.\n\n342\n00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:04,810\nThat's if you don't have it all delivered\nbecause it may just literally be an empty\n\n343\n00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,370\nwarehouse, and you have to have everything\ndelivered in first before you even set up.\n\n344\n00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,382\nSo this could take several weeks to\nreally get up and running properly.\n\n345\n00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:13,790\nSo again, we're gonna go from hours, days,\n\n346\n00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,750\nto weeks here as we go down\nfrom hot to warm to cold.\n\n347\n00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,620\nSo just think about the concept,\nthe idea there.\n\n348\n00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,542\nBut the key defining characteristic of all\nthree, the facility is leased or rented.\n\n349\n00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:26,300\nOr it's not gonna be owned by the company.\n\n350\n00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,560\nAnd then we have redundant sites\nwhich are gonna be owned and\n\n351\n00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,810\nmaintained by the company.\n\n352\n00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,328\nSo you set up your own data center.\n\n353\n00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:35,540\nYou build a duplicate a thousand\nmiles away owned by the company and\n\n354\n00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,900\nmirroring production in real time.\n\n355\n00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,840\nSo data's on.\n\n356\n00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,190\nIt's flowing in real time.\n\n357\n00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,500\nBoth sites are synchronous.\n\n358\n00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,820\nThey can run the business\nfrom either location.\n\n359\n00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,980\nAnd, literally, if you turn one off,\nthe other is in the system in real time,\n\n360\n00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,630\nand there's no loss, or\nminimal if any loss of continuity there.\n\n361\n00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,225\nThere may be some slight delays\nas certain system s cut over.\n\n362\n00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:54,430\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> You may lose a little bit of\n\n363\n00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,650\ntransactional data,\nbecause of the buffering,\n\n364\n00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:00,710\nif it's an active/passive solution,\nso there's a small\n\n365\n00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,990\nfail over delay while the passive nodes\ncome back up, that kind of thing.\n\n366\n00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,870\nBut in general, we see this as\nbeing a real-time mirror, and\n\n367\n00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,770\nas a result there's really no\nloss of continuity to speak of.\n\n368\n00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,550\nSo, that's a redundant site.\n\n369\n00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,360\nThe key difference there is that it's\nowned and maintained by the company.\n\n370\n00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,540\nYou wanna zero in on this concept\nof what is owned by the company\n\n371\n00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,100\nversus what is rented,\nreleased as a pivot point,\n\n372\n00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,870\nas a preparation point to make sure\nyou're clear on the difference there.\n\n373\n00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,510\nRolling hot-site is gonna be where we\nback up the tractor trailer or semi.\n\n374\n00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:32,420\nThey bring in these huge 54 foot rolling\ncontainers or whatever they are, that\n\n375\n00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,400\nwhole just thing the semi, the 18 wheeler\nwill drag around and they drop it off.\n\n376\n00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,040\nIt's got the basically\npower generation built in.\n\n377\n00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,920\nThey've got the onboard generators.\n\n378\n00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,994\nThey got the 220 and the 110 hookups,\nand racks and racks of gear, and\n\n379\n00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:46,530\nyou just plug this thing in.\n\n380\n00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,652\nYou basically just wire it up,\nand you're ready to go.\n\n381\n00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:53,896\nSo, for instance, after 9/11 happened, in\nNew York and some of the other areas that\n\n382\n00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:57,572\nwere hit, this is what we saw, we saw\na lot of these systems being brought in,\n\n383\n00:17:57,572 --> 00:18:00,480\nespecially around\nthe World Trade Center and that area.\n\n384\n00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,410\nThe phone companies in particular\nhad to bring these things in in\n\n385\n00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,860\norder to run their phone systems and\ncell systems.\n\n386\n00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,600\nBecause literally almost all\nthe infrastructure that was driving this\n\n387\n00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,240\nstuff was under the towers.\n\n388\n00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,710\nOr on top of it.\n\n389\n00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,180\nAs a result when they came down,\nit was all wiped out.\n\n390\n00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,500\nBillions of dollars of infrastructure\njust basically disappeared\n\n391\n00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,240\nas soon as those towers came down.\n\n392\n00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,435\nAnd so all that stuff had to be reproduced\non the fly till they could go back in,\n\n393\n00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,370\nultimately clear the sites and\n\n394\n00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,985\nre-architect it all because\nall the conduit and\n\n395\n00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:33,085\nall that stuff underneath the buildings\nand the tunnels was ripped out and gone.\n\n396\n00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:36,225\nSo as a result you saw these things for a\ncouple of years afterwards in some cases,\n\n397\n00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:37,435\nsitting on street corners.\n\n398\n00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:38,765\nNot these huge ones, necessarily.\n\n399\n00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:41,015\nSmaller ones that were\nlocalized to a certain area.\n\n400\n00:18:41,015 --> 00:18:43,135\nBut in the beginning you\nsaw these massive trailers,\n\n401\n00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:46,325\nand then you would see these smaller ones\nparked like by street lamp that were\n\n402\n00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:50,030\nservicing a couple of block radius as\nthey were rewiring and reworking these.\n\n403\n00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,810\nSo NASA has these.\n\n404\n00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,370\nThey use them.\n\n405\n00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:55,530\nAll the major Telco vendors have them.\n\n406\n00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,180\nLike Verizon, T-Mobile, etc.\n\n407\n00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,720\nThey have these things that can roll\nout when there's either a big need for\n\n408\n00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,750\ncertain capacity like big sporting\ngames they bring out these things and\n\n409\n00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,430\nset them up for extra capacity,\n\n410\n00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:09,170\nif there's a disaster somewhere they\nbring these things out and roll them in.\n\n411\n00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,300\n>> Thunderstorms, hurricanes,\nand things like that.\n\n412\n00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,650\n>> So, like the Army has them,\nthe National Guard has them for\n\n413\n00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:18,700\non site operations, police and fire\ndepartment systems have them where they're\n\n414\n00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,580\ndoing these large events where they\nhave to deal with these disasters.\n\n415\n00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,070\nSo, you see them in a lot\nof different places.\n\n416\n00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:27,170\nSo then we want to talk about some of\nthe back-up types that are available.\n\n417\n00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,090\nSo we've talked about these in\na couple of our other discussions.\n\n418\n00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,410\nI know in the networking area\nwe talked about back ups.\n\n419\n00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,985\nI think that actually was you and I that\nhad gone through and talked about that.\n\n420\n00:19:34,985 --> 00:19:36,971\n>> Yep.\n>> So the idea here is really what kind\n\n421\n00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:40,040\nof back up do we use in order to\nbe able to restore information?\n\n422\n00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,380\nAnd we do a full backup.\n\n423\n00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,960\nAll the data is backed up whatever\ndata has been selected of\n\n424\n00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,430\ncourse for backing up.\n\n425\n00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,740\nAnd as a result of that, when we're done,\nwe clear what is known as the archive bit.\n\n426\n00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,025\nIf you think of the archive bit\nas basically being a flag, right?\n\n427\n00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,050\nSo think of a flag,\n\n428\n00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:57,280\na flag would either be the pen that\nI'm holding in my hand is a flag.\n\n429\n00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,370\nIf the flag was standing up, right,\nthe bit is effectively not clear, but\n\n430\n00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,240\nrather it is on.\n\n431\n00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,240\nThink of it in binary like a one and\na zero.\n\n432\n00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,000\nSo, the flag represents or signifies\nthat the data has to be backed up.\n\n433\n00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,520\nSo, the flag is on.\n\n434\n00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,480\nIf we reset the archive bit,\nthe flag goes down.\n\n435\n00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,280\nIn effect and it means we've done\nthe back up when we're clearing.\n\n436\n00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,080\nWhat we often talk about is\ndata that has the flag up\n\n437\n00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,660\nis data that is waiting to be backed up.\n\n438\n00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,479\nAnd data that has the flag down is data,\ndepending on the designation, it may or\n\n439\n00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:25,850\nmay not have been backed up.\n\n440\n00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:30,100\nWe don't know for sure but we know\nthat if the data has the flag down,\n\n441\n00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,870\nthen it's either not being backed up or\nit has already been backed up but\n\n442\n00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,750\nwe've reset the archive.\n\n443\n00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,008\n>> It has been modified since [INAUDIBLE].\n\n444\n00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:35,510\n>> It has been modified.\n\n445\n00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,300\nSo the archive bit is\nreally just an indicator.\n\n446\n00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,200\nYou think of it as a flag, and it's\na simple on, off yes, no kind of switch.\n\n447\n00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,280\nAnd so the backup software\nthat runs will go through and\n\n448\n00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,220\nreset these archive bits on\nthe files as part of the process.\n\n449\n00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,460\nSo, a full backup,\n\n450\n00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,960\nall data that is selected is backed up,\narchive bit is cleared.\n\n451\n00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,800\nWhereas we do a differential backup,\n\n452\n00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,020\nall data modified since last full backup\nhas been done, or has been backed up.\n\n453\n00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,060\nThe archive bit is not cleared, right.\n\n454\n00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,520\nAnd so the idea there is that\nwe're gathering the differences,\n\n455\n00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,880\nthe differentials or\nthe deltas on the backups as we go.\n\n456\n00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,520\nAnd since we leave the archive\nbit enabled, we do not clear it,\n\n457\n00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,040\nwe're capturing all that data from today\nplus any differences from tomorrow,\n\n458\n00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,800\nany differences from the day after.\n\n459\n00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,405\nSo, if you think about it we're building\non that backup every every time we run it.\n\n460\n00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:26,462\nSo the last differential back\nup that we do, before recovery,\n\n461\n00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:29,707\nis gonna have all of the data from\nthe prior back ups obtained in it.\n\n462\n00:21:29,707 --> 00:21:31,575\n>> All the way back to that full.\n\n463\n00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:33,765\n>> Right.\nAs a result of that we can actually do\n\n464\n00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:38,007\na restore process with the last full\nbackup, or the full backup from that week.\n\n465\n00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:41,287\nSo we often say, if we do a full backup\non Sunday, and we do differentials,\n\n466\n00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:44,427\nlet's say through the rest of the week,\nand we have a failure on Wednesday,\n\n467\n00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:46,197\nthen what do we need to restore?\n\n468\n00:21:46,197 --> 00:21:48,537\nWe need the full backup from from Sunday,\nright?\n\n469\n00:21:48,537 --> 00:21:50,707\nAnd then we need\nthe differential from Tuesday,\n\n470\n00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:52,597\nthat was the last successful differential.\n\n471\n00:21:52,597 --> 00:21:55,607\nSo we need the full backup,\nplus the differential from Tuesday,\n\n472\n00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:59,515\nwhich has Monday's differential,\nplus Tuesday's differential on it.\n\n473\n00:21:59,515 --> 00:22:01,540\nAnd we effectively can restore from there.\n\n474\n00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,020\n>> So each day we do those differentials,\nthat differential's gonna take longer and\n\n475\n00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,790\nlonger each time.\n\n476\n00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:08,350\nCuz it's gonna have to get all those\nchanges all the way back to that fold.\n\n477\n00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,140\nBut on the plus side of it when you go\nto do the restore you only have a couple\n\n478\n00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,600\nbacks up to restore, you've got\nthat full back up and the last one.\n\n479\n00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,283\n>> Right only two tapes\nprobably to manage.\n\n480\n00:22:16,283 --> 00:22:19,032\nIf you're doing tapes, or whatever your\nmedium is, but you have less media,\n\n481\n00:22:19,032 --> 00:22:20,751\nultimately to deal with,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n482\n00:22:20,751 --> 00:22:24,892\nSo little bit longer, as you said, as we\nmove through the week, on the front end,\n\n483\n00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:28,210\nbut quicker for restoral processes,\ntypically on the back end.\n\n484\n00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,910\nAnd then incremental,\nkind of think of it as the exact opposite.\n\n485\n00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,850\nIncremental, all data modified since\nlast back up, or the incremental backup,\n\n486\n00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,892\nwhatever it was that was run, cuz you\nwere doing full and then incremental.\n\n487\n00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:41,840\nSo it'll be the last incremental that was\nrun that will then reset the archive bit.\n\n488\n00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,900\nSo the archive bit is cleared.\n\n489\n00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,580\nSo effectively each day's tape is\nonly getting those changes from that\n\n490\n00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,360\nday if it's done successfully,\nif there's no errors.\n\n491\n00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,090\nYou may have errors,\n\n492\n00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,950\nin which case you have to rerun it because\nobviously you didn't' capture everything.\n\n493\n00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,260\nSo we obviously wanna make sure we\nthink about verifying the backup.\n\n494\n00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,212\n[CROSSTALK] The integrity of\nthe data becomes important.\n\n495\n00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:02,117\nBut if we do incrementals,\nsame scenario, full backup on Sunday,\n\n496\n00:23:02,117 --> 00:23:05,474\nincrementals all week,\nwe need the full backup to restore\n\n497\n00:23:05,474 --> 00:23:08,570\nplus all the incrementals\nin reverse order, right?\n\n498\n00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:11,430\nSo, we need Sunday, then we need Monday,\nTuesday, Wednesday,\n\n499\n00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,320\nif the failure happens on Thursday,\nand we gotta lay them down in order,\n\n500\n00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,970\nin order to then achieve,\neffectively, a full restore, right?\n\n501\n00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,040\nSo, we lay down Wednesday's incremental,\nbut don't do Monday's and\n\n502\n00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040\nTuesday's, we only got\nWednesday's changes.\n\n503\n00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,720\nWe don't have Monday or\nTuesday's data, right?\n\n504\n00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,750\nWe're missing it all.\n\n505\n00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:26,690\nSo that's gonna be important.\n\n506\n00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:28,870\nWanna make sure we understand and\n\n507\n00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:32,580\nwe are clear on the difference here\nbetween them, and understand how the full,\n\n508\n00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,160\nthe differential, and\nthe incremental backups work.\n\n509\n00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,110\n>> It's all about the archive.\n\n510\n00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,330\n>> And how they come together and\ncombine together by the way for\n\n511\n00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,770\nrestore, cuz definitely\ngonna wanna know that.\n\n512\n00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,530\nYou may see some questions or at least be\nasked about the thought process is around\n\n513\n00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,750\ncombining these, so\ndefinitely want to be functional there.\n\n514\n00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,030\nIf we could roll up,\ncause I'm missing a little bit.\n\n515\n00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:51,670\nI have a shadow on my area of knowledge.\n\n516\n00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,144\nI'm missing a little bit of some of this.\n\n517\n00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:56,008\nSo we wanna run through some of\nthe vocabulary here with you, and\n\n518\n00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:57,184\njust talk through these.\n\n519\n00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,343\nPretty self-explanatory based on\nthe definitions we've thrown up here, but\n\n520\n00:24:00,343 --> 00:24:01,341\nlet's go through them.\n\n521\n00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:05,047\nSo disk shadowing, it's gonna\nallow us to basically duplicate or\n\n522\n00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:09,560\nusing duplicative hardware and maintain\none or more copies of the information.\n\n523\n00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,970\nSo what we mean here in\nEnglish effectively,\n\n524\n00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,810\nis this is basically disk mirroring.\n\n525\n00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:16,020\nSo we're doing a disk mirror, but\nthe key difference between disk shadowing,\n\n526\n00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,940\ndisk mirroring.\n\n527\n00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,600\nDisk mirroring is specifically\ndesigned to only have two drives.\n\n528\n00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,350\nThe master and the slave, if you will.\n\n529\n00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,100\nTwo copies written simultaneously.\n\n530\n00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,130\nDisk shadowing can actually have two or\nmore disks that are used.\n\n531\n00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,430\nSo we can effectively shadow to an array.\n\n532\n00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,390\nWe can have multiple copies on disks\nout there, so that way if one or\n\n533\n00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:36,600\nmore of them fails, we still effect,\nwe have a viable option.\n\n534\n00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,310\n>> And\nwe can survive more failures that way.\n\n535\n00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,010\n>> Absolutely, correct.\n\n536\n00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,190\nWe'd survive more failures.\n\n537\n00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:43,270\nSo if we have a lot of\ndata coming in high speed,\n\n538\n00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,260\nwe need to really create multiple copies.\n\n539\n00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:49,100\nGeographically disperse our data\nout to different geographies for\n\n540\n00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,190\nsurvivability and just shadowing can\nreally become a kind of next step up\n\n541\n00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,460\nfrom the just mirroring concept.\n\n542\n00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,590\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n543\n00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,350\nIt's just basically just mirror\nwith multiple drives on the back\n\n544\n00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,240\nend in some sort of an array.\n\n545\n00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,829\nElectronic vaulting, this makes copies\nperiodically and sends them off site for\n\n546\n00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:04,355\nrecovery.\n\n547\n00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:08,199\nSo we're just gonna every hour,\nevery two hours, copy a bunch of data,\n\n548\n00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:11,543\nelectronically send it out to\nthe offsite recovery solution,\n\n549\n00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:15,310\nand then maybe put on tape or\nwhatever we do with it at that point.\n\n550\n00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,010\nIt's called electronic vaulting.\n\n551\n00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,860\nRemote journaling allows us to do the same\nidea as electronic vaulting, but instead\n\n552\n00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:25,970\nof all the data, we're just backing up\nthe journal or the transactional logs\n\n553\n00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,230\nof the system, simply done with databases,\nfor instance, right?\n\n554\n00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,490\nSo we can use those to recover,\nrestore, and\n\n555\n00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,240\nreplay those transactions\nback into the data set.\n\n556\n00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,600\nAnd so we do that again offsite,\nit's set somewhere else, it is set and\n\n557\n00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,930\ndone at a periodic time, but\nit is going to be not the whole data set,\n\n558\n00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,920\njust the journal of the transactional\nlocks, hence the name remote journaling.\n\n559\n00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,320\nTape vaulting, data sent out over\nsome sort of dedicated connection\n\n560\n00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,120\nto the backup tape system\nthat is typically offsite, so\n\n561\n00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,870\nthe tape vaulting is just sending all\nthat data out to our tape solution\n\n562\n00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:00,600\n100 miles away or wherever it is,\nacross a dedicated circuit.\n\n563\n00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,040\nAsynchronous replication, this idea\nof basically having our primary and\n\n564\n00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,680\nour secondary volumes, whatever we're\nreplicating from, replicating to,\n\n565\n00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,860\nthey're out of sync,\nthey are not synchronous.\n\n566\n00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:12,970\n>> Right.\n>> And as a result,\n\n567\n00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,030\nwe have to synchronize them\nover a period of time.\n\n568\n00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:19,400\nThat synchronization window is gonna\nbe based on the technology we use and\n\n569\n00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,270\nthe kind of setup,\nthe kind of the circuits that we use, and\n\n570\n00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,990\nthe kind of structure we've built,\nbut there is gonna be a lag or a delay\n\n571\n00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,050\nin replication, so if we were going to\nknock out the primary site, the secondary\n\n572\n00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,150\nwould be out of sync to a certain degree\n>> Right.\n\n573\n00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,830\n>> May not be all that data there,\nwe might lose some transactional integrity\n\n574\n00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:40,360\nas a result of it, especially if it's in\ntransit on the wire, when that happens,\n\n575\n00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,730\nwe may lose some of that.\n\n576\n00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,735\nSynchronous replication on the other hand,\nprimary and secondary vines always in\n\n577\n00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:48,300\nsync, and as a result, we have the effect\nof real time duplication of data.\n\n578\n00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,186\nSo mirroring is basically synchronous\nreplication technology, right?\n\n579\n00:26:51,186 --> 00:26:54,970\nSo it's gonna be mirrored in real time,\nor available in real time.\n\n580\n00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,060\nHigh availability.\n\n581\n00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:00,980\nWe expect with high availability that\nwe will have some form of downtime.\n\n582\n00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,100\nSo when we talk about high availability\nsolutions, we're talking about\n\n583\n00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:09,100\nan acceptable window and acceptable\nperiod of downtime to recover, restart,\n\n584\n00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,130\nboot up, or bring up new systems,\njust whatever that is, right?\n\n585\n00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,640\nSo when we talk about it in relation\nto virtualization for instance, we talk\n\n586\n00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,340\nabout HA technology in the virtualization\nworld, we talk about technology that is\n\n587\n00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:26,080\nprotecting RVMs, but we have to restart\nthe VMs on another host If we're using HA\n\n588\n00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,090\nto bring them back up when a host fails,\nso there is a period of downtime.\n\n589\n00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,825\nThat period will vary, it will be declared\nbased on the surface level agreements and\n\n590\n00:27:33,825 --> 00:27:37,555\nkind of technologies that we're using, but\nthere will be some period of downtime.\n\n591\n00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:41,650\nWhereas fault tolerance has associated\nwith it, typically zero downtime.\n\n592\n00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,460\nFault tolerance solutions imply\nthat we will have no downtime.\n\n593\n00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,760\nSo, we have real time duplicative data,\nin other words, mirrored systems, or\n\n594\n00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,615\nwhatever, and so, even if one were to\ntotally fail on us, the other system would\n\n595\n00:27:53,615 --> 00:27:56,385\npick up and really there should be\nabsolutely no loss of continuity,\n\n596\n00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:58,785\nno loss of transactional integrity.\n\n597\n00:27:58,785 --> 00:28:00,875\nSo you can think of\nthings like 911 systems,\n\n598\n00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:05,185\nright, that if you pick up the phone and\ncall 911, you can't wait for them to say,\n\n599\n00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:08,660\nwell, hold on, we're rebooting,\ngive us five minutes, call back.\n\n600\n00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,260\nI mean imagine, literally we're\ntalking about people's lives.\n\n601\n00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,460\n>> Yes.\n>> People can die\n\n602\n00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,192\nif those systems are not on all the time.\n\n603\n00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:18,165\nAnd so these systems are built triple,\nquadruple redundant in some cases,\n\n604\n00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:21,760\nwhere for every system you have\nthere's an exact duplicate running.\n\n605\n00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,905\nAnd if that system were to go down,\nthere's a backup of that other system.\n\n606\n00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:28,437\nAnd so when they do maintenance on these,\nthey just simply fail over to their other\n\n607\n00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:32,030\nsystems, but because they're fault\ntolerant, they're never offline.\n\n608\n00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,827\nWe see the same thing with planes for\ninstance.\n\n609\n00:28:33,827 --> 00:28:38,020\nRight, every system in a plane is at\nleast double, if not triple, redundant.\n\n610\n00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,480\nSo in flight, right, you can't\njust go fix something, typically.\n\n611\n00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,660\nSomething fails,\nit's gotta keep running, right?\n\n612\n00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,040\nYou just can't have that happen.\n\n613\n00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,100\nRight?\nYou could run out of water.\n\n614\n00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,720\nRight?\nThat's one thing.\n\n615\n00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,030\nPeople might be upset, but\nif you run out of navigation, or\n\n616\n00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,820\nrun out of something else,\nyou got a big problem.\n\n617\n00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,820\nRight?\nSo these systems are built fault tolerant\n\n618\n00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,345\nas a result.\n\n619\n00:28:57,345 --> 00:29:01,790\nSo let's talk about the difference in\nteams and the thought process here about\n\n620\n00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,100\nhow these teams, that's actually, probably\nhelpful so you can see it, very good.\n\n621\n00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,912\nGood call on your part.\n\n622\n00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:06,521\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So,\n\n623\n00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:08,595\nlet's talk about how\nthese teams are set up.\n\n624\n00:29:08,595 --> 00:29:10,735\nWe've talked a lot about\nthe different mechanisms.\n\n625\n00:29:10,735 --> 00:29:13,355\nWell, let's talk about the actual\nteams and how they're structured.\n\n626\n00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:16,125\nSo this idea of a restoration\nteam versus a salvage team.\n\n627\n00:29:17,305 --> 00:29:22,180\nReally goes to this idea of DRP, disaster\nrecovery, versus BCP, business continuity,\n\n628\n00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:25,460\nbecause we really see one associated\nwith each of these functions.\n\n629\n00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:29,260\nSo the restoration team is gonna\nbe this team as you can see here,\n\n630\n00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,580\nthat's responsible for getting\nthe alternate site into or up to and\n\n631\n00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,710\nrunning as a functioning environment,\nright?\n\n632\n00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,920\nSo they're gonna go to the automatically\nkind of be deployed to the alternate site,\n\n633\n00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,560\nget it up and running, make sure it's\navailable, so we can, basically at that\n\n634\n00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,520\npoint, right, go back and\ntry to get back to normal is what we say.\n\n635\n00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,060\nSo restoration teams are typically\ngonna be associated with BCP,\n\n636\n00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,910\nbusiness continuity functionality\nbecause they're all about making sure\n\n637\n00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,700\nthat we can return to what\nis considered to be normal,\n\n638\n00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,070\nworking, in the site with our gear and\neverything.\n\n639\n00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,770\nIt may not be our home, but\nwe want to get back to normal as.\n\n640\n00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,930\n>> Right\n>> Soon as possible.\n\n641\n00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,565\nSo the restoration teams\nare associated with BCP activities.\n\n642\n00:30:08,565 --> 00:30:10,790\nWhereas salvage teams responsible for\n\n643\n00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:13,060\nstarting the recovery\nof the original site.\n\n644\n00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:16,250\nThey're gonna be associated with the\ndisaster recovery solutions, typically,\n\n645\n00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,680\nbecause if they're gonna go\nback to the original site, and\n\n646\n00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,580\nreally try to get in there and\nfind out what went wrong, and clean up,\n\n647\n00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,110\nand stabilize it, and\nthen ultimately hopefully make it safe,\n\n648\n00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:27,940\nso the salvage team goes and\npicks up the pieces of whatever happened.\n\n649\n00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,890\n>> Right.\n>> Whereas the restoration team's all but\n\n650\n00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,830\ngetting us back to up and\nrunning as quickly as possible.\n\n651\n00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,610\nBack to normal.\n\n652\n00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:36,250\nSo we just want to make sure we associate\nthe function in each of these areas.\n\n653\n00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,460\nReally think about it in relation\nto BCP and DRP functionality.\n\n654\n00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,572\nMake sure we're comfortable with that.\n\n655\n00:30:41,572 --> 00:30:44,490\nAll right, so I think that's probably\na good place for us to take a small break.\n\n656\n00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,740\n>> All right.\n>> Come back we have a few things\n\n657\n00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,340\nleft to talk about.\n\n658\n00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:49,190\nI think we're gonna talk about\ncontinuity plan structure and also talk\n\n659\n00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:53,720\nabout different kinds of testing that we\nmay do around these plans, as we continue.\n\n660\n00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,290\n>> Sounds like a plan.\n\n661\n00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,051\nWe'll see you guys back here in a few.\n\n662\n00:30:56,051 --> 00:31:01,413\n[SOUND] All right, hope you guys\nenjoyed the break, welcome back,\n\n663\n00:31:01,413 --> 00:31:06,587\nand back into some business continuity and\ndisaster recovery,\n\n664\n00:31:06,587 --> 00:31:12,359\nand let's talk about some of our\nbusiness continuity plan structure.\n\n665\n00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:14,202\n>> All right, so let's do that.\n\n666\n00:31:14,202 --> 00:31:17,188\nSo we're talking about discontinuity\nplans, we obviously have,\n\n667\n00:31:17,188 --> 00:31:20,360\nagain the analysis format, right,\na method to our madness if you will,\n\n668\n00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,340\nthat we're gonna wanna focus on,\nmake sure you guys are comfortable with,\n\n669\n00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,160\nin general as you go out and as a CISSP,\nyou may very well be asked to take on\n\n670\n00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,510\neither leadership of a team that is\ninvolved with doing this planning, or\n\n671\n00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:35,490\nperhaps head up the team itself,\ndepends on your level of comfort here.\n\n672\n00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,140\nWhat your background is.\n\n673\n00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,030\nBut, or\nyou just may become a member of a team.\n\n674\n00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,890\nYou may not actually be\nasked to manage it at all.\n\n675\n00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,870\nYou simply may just be a member of\nthe team that contributes and does this.\n\n676\n00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,916\nSo there is a structure, a method to our\nmadness that we kind of go through here.\n\n677\n00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:51,892\nSo we're gonna be thinking about the five\nareas that a plan typically has as we\n\n678\n00:31:51,892 --> 00:31:52,512\nlay it out.\n\n679\n00:31:52,512 --> 00:31:55,590\nThis will be the written plan,\nthe plan we kind of publish, put together.\n\n680\n00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,516\nIt's typically in a binder of some kind.\n\n681\n00:31:57,516 --> 00:32:00,363\nIt's gonna have these headers or\nthese sections associated with it.\n\n682\n00:32:00,363 --> 00:32:04,300\nSo we have the initiation, we can\nthink of theses as almost phases, but\n\n683\n00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,950\nthe initiation phase.\n\n684\n00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,020\nWe're going to go out and\nget all this set up and\n\n685\n00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,320\nwhat we'll detail out kind of\ngoes in there in a minute.\n\n686\n00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,840\nActivation phase, recovery phase,\nreconstruction, and\n\n687\n00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,810\nthen the appendices are just\ntypically additional material.\n\n688\n00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,620\nReference material,\n\n689\n00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,530\ntables we'll call trees and things like\nthat that may have to be put in there.\n\n690\n00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,360\nDiagrams, whatever it may be.\n\n691\n00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,690\nSo in the initiation phase, we're gonna\nhave things like our goal statements.\n\n692\n00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,190\nSo what is our,\nwhat are we trying to accomplish here?\n\n693\n00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,445\nWhat are we doing?\n\n694\n00:32:32,445 --> 00:32:36,060\nA overview typically of what\nwe're looking to accomplish.\n\n695\n00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,030\nYou kmow, what's our network?\n\n696\n00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:37,800\nWhat's it look like?\n\n697\n00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,040\nWhat's the high level goal?\n\n698\n00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,320\nThose kind of things.\n\n699\n00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,440\nRoles and definitions of the team\nwill be laid out here in initiation.\n\n700\n00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,660\nSo we will see the roles that are assigned\nlater down or later on for the teams.\n\n701\n00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,925\nSo we may not call out\nspecific team members.\n\n702\n00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:57,765\nBut we will call out team member roles,\n\n703\n00:32:57,765 --> 00:33:02,145\nlike backup operator,\nrecovery operator, that kind of thing.\n\n704\n00:33:02,145 --> 00:33:06,765\nAs opposed to Jason is the guy who\ndoes the backup and the restore.\n\n705\n00:33:06,765 --> 00:33:08,885\nSo this again, kind of high level, right?\n\n706\n00:33:08,885 --> 00:33:10,105\nThe final criteria for\n\n707\n00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:13,675\ninitiation is typically something that's\ngoing to be a high level view of things.\n\n708\n00:33:13,675 --> 00:33:17,985\nIn the activation phase, we're going to\nhave things like our notification steps.\n\n709\n00:33:17,985 --> 00:33:20,350\nSo how are we going to go\nthrough notifying people,\n\n710\n00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,020\nwhat's that process look like?\n\n711\n00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,700\nHow do we notify the business\nwe may have a disaster?\n\n712\n00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,470\nWhat's that process look like,\nthings like that.\n\n713\n00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,800\nOur damage assessments will be here.\n\n714\n00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,045\nSo we'll be able to\nunderstand what goes on and\n\n715\n00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:34,500\nwhat kind of damage we may be looking at.\n\n716\n00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,130\nAnd the criteria for plan activation will\ntake place, or be available here as well.\n\n717\n00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,570\nWhich is,\nwhat are the thresholds that we look at?\n\n718\n00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,810\nTo then say, okay,\nwe've crossed this threshold.\n\n719\n00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,510\nAs a result we now have to call in or\ndecide that we have a disaster.\n\n720\n00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,690\nAnd then, what does that mean?\n\n721\n00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,790\nAnd then,\nwhat goes into effect as a result of that.\n\n722\n00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:57,530\nYou know several years back,\nwe had that power outage in\n\n723\n00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:02,190\nthe northeast that kinda ran across the\nupper northeast of the U.S. into Canada.\n\n724\n00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:05,130\nWhere we lost the power grid or\nportions of the power grid.\n\n725\n00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,780\nAnd as a result of that, you know there\nwere a lot of impacts that happened,\n\n726\n00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,420\nobviously power was out for\nseveral days, we had some issues.\n\n727\n00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,820\nAside from the obvious things,\n\n728\n00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,480\nthere were a lot of studies\nthat were done after the fact.\n\n729\n00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,860\nLooking at what went wrong we\nnow are focused on this idea of\n\n730\n00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,290\ncreating a smart grid.\n\n731\n00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:23,320\nThat's self healing as\na result as some of this,\n\n732\n00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,700\nbecause we understood the grid\ninfrastructure ultimately was overloaded.\n\n733\n00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,480\nBecause it was old,\n\n734\n00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,310\nit wasn't being maintained, wasn't\nbeing monitored in real time properly.\n\n735\n00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,650\nAnd human error ultimately\nbecame the issue there,\n\n736\n00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,400\nbecause we had a cascading\nfailure in the grid.\n\n737\n00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,820\nThat wasn't stopped at a couple of\ncritical monitoring junctions or points.\n\n738\n00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,930\nAnd because human operator\nerror took place,\n\n739\n00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,710\nit kinda just propagated that error to\nthe point or propagated that overload to\n\n740\n00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,850\nthe point that it blew out all\nthese key switching systems.\n\n741\n00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,851\nAnd Fed-which took down the entire grid.\n\n742\n00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:54,571\nAnd so now we're dealing with those\nissues, but what was interesting about\n\n743\n00:34:54,571 --> 00:34:58,455\nthis that they found out was\nthe criteria in the activation phase.\n\n744\n00:34:58,455 --> 00:35:02,395\nFor a lot of these businesses that were\neffected to declare disasters was what\n\n745\n00:35:02,395 --> 00:35:03,540\nthey looked at some of these.\n\n746\n00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,505\nCuz up there in that arc, you have\na lot of, well at least even today.\n\n747\n00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:10,285\nWhat's left of the heavy\nmanufacturing days, right?\n\n748\n00:35:10,285 --> 00:35:13,840\nSo you have things like car companies\nthat are doing manufacturing up there,\n\n749\n00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,780\ntheir steel production up there.\n\n750\n00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,400\nYou know, shipyards are up there.\n\n751\n00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,665\nSo you have a lot of this heavy industry,\nheavy production consumes a lot of power.\n\n752\n00:35:22,665 --> 00:35:25,675\nA lot of you know,\nraw materials coming in,\n\n753\n00:35:25,675 --> 00:35:29,485\na lot of these systems run on just in\ntime production environments today.\n\n754\n00:35:29,485 --> 00:35:33,765\nWhere they are shipping in just enough\nmaterials on a maybe 12, or 24, or\n\n755\n00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:36,505\n48 hour rotating basis, to build.\n\n756\n00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:39,275\nSo there's constant stuff\ncoming through the system.\n\n757\n00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:42,215\nThey don't tend to warehouse a lot\nof these raw materials anymore,\n\n758\n00:35:42,215 --> 00:35:44,655\nbecause it's very expensive\nto keep them on site.\n\n759\n00:35:44,655 --> 00:35:47,130\nAnd to own that inventory\nwhen it's not being used.\n\n760\n00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:52,940\nYou know 25, 30, 40 years ago, you'd go\nto a car plant they had graveyards and\n\n761\n00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,430\nwarehouses full of steel and parts.\n\n762\n00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,960\nThey had everything needed to build\ncars for 30, 40 days at a time.\n\n763\n00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,570\nToday, it's not that way.\n\n764\n00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,550\nYou go there and they're offloading\ntrains with 12-hour windows to get this\n\n765\n00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,520\nstuff into the production assembly lines.\n\n766\n00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,470\nAnd build enough to basically do one\ncircuit or one 12 hour shift in the plant\n\n767\n00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:14,370\nand if they lose that capability,\nthat capacity to bring this stuff in.\n\n768\n00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,540\nMaybe its a 24 or 48 hour turn\ndepending on what we are talking about.\n\n769\n00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,647\nThey literally don't have\nenough material on hand and\n\n770\n00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:21,380\nthey have got to stop building.\n\n771\n00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:24,360\nNow when they stop building its a little\nbit more involved, because you idle\n\n772\n00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,990\na plant that's got several thousand\nthings going on it simultaneously.\n\n773\n00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,340\nToday a lot of it is robots,\n\n774\n00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,370\nright I mean you idle it,\nyou idle it their sitting around.\n\n775\n00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,040\nIt's not like they walk\noff the assembly line,\n\n776\n00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,970\ngo take a coffee break\nthey're outside smoking.\n\n777\n00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,610\nTheir just hanging out there and all the\narms are just down like this you know and\n\n778\n00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,870\nthen they wait and then they come back on.\n\n779\n00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,470\nA lot of this stuff is automated\nwith robots today, but\n\n780\n00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,940\nthe problem with that is not that\nthe human capacity is being idle.\n\n781\n00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,660\nThere are human beings so you have to\nidle them, but you could send them off.\n\n782\n00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,400\nGo say hey sit down for\nan hour, take a break.\n\n783\n00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,300\n>> Right.\n>> Come back and\n\n784\n00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,050\nyou know whatever\n>> That's not the hard part,\n\n785\n00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,820\nthe hard part is you start\npowering down these systems.\n\n786\n00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,660\nThese robotic systems and\nshutting down these plants.\n\n787\n00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,030\nThere's a whole cycle and\na process you have to go through\n\n788\n00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,810\n>> You start it you just can't stop.\n\n789\n00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,030\n>> You can't stop in mid stream and\n\n790\n00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,840\nmore importantly,\nnot only do you have to complete it.\n\n791\n00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:09,030\nBut you have to go through the start up\ncycle on the other side to get it all\n\n792\n00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,890\ndone the right way.\n\n793\n00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:14,550\nOnce you trigger a disaster, you've passed\nthat threshold in these entities and\n\n794\n00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,580\nthey go into disaster mode.\n\n795\n00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,320\nAnd disaster equals shut down plant.\n\n796\n00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,100\nEven if the power comes\nback on 20 minutes later,\n\n797\n00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,840\nonce they start, they basically gotta\nrun through a four or five day cycle.\n\n798\n00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,600\nOr whatever it is in that company\nto shut down and power back on.\n\n799\n00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,710\nAnd so it becomes very\nproblematic in these companies,\n\n800\n00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:34,670\nwhere they hit these\nbrick windows in effect.\n\n801\n00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,266\nOr brick windows.\n\n802\n00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:36,896\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Yeah, that's an interesting weird,\n\n803\n00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,720\nwe have brick windows.\n\n804\n00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,102\nLook at the nice facade on the house.\n\n805\n00:37:40,102 --> 00:37:42,690\nAll right, let's hit the reset button\non that one, not a brick window.\n\n806\n00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,190\nThey hit a brick wall, right?\n\n807\n00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:47,340\nWhich has windows in it, but\nthey're clearly not made of brick.\n\n808\n00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,360\nRight?\n\n809\n00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,065\nWhat can I say?\n\n810\n00:37:49,065 --> 00:37:51,641\nEvery so often, you've just got to throw\nsomething out there to see if people\n\n811\n00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:52,444\nare paying attention.\n\n812\n00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:53,860\n>> Just gotta make sure\nyou're awake out there.\n\n813\n00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,850\n>> Absolutely.\n\n814\n00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:59,070\nSo the idea here is that when we\nhit that glass ceiling right or\n\n815\n00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,720\nthat brick wal,l if we then\nare on the other side of\n\n816\n00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,810\nit when we declare the disaster this can\nbe a huge liability for the company.\n\n817\n00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,130\nAnd so they did some studies on this,\n\n818\n00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,400\nbecause a lot of this was\njust a question of timing.\n\n819\n00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,160\nDid we have enough stuff on hand?\n\n820\n00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:18,080\nDo we have enough back up and or\nexcess capacity to make it through?\n\n821\n00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,080\nIs what these people were trying to\nfigure out as they were managing through\n\n822\n00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,070\nthe power outage.\n\n823\n00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,090\nNot knowing when the power's\ngonna come back on.\n\n824\n00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,660\nHow soon it would come back on?\n\n825\n00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,370\nThey didn't know.\n\n826\n00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,580\nDo we send everybody home?\n\n827\n00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,642\nDo we shut down the plant?\n\n828\n00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:30,750\nAre we not getting anymore\nshipments coming in,\n\n829\n00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,220\nbecause the rail heads were idle.\n\n830\n00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,525\nBecause they couldn't switch the trains,\nso they couldn't get them in.\n\n831\n00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:36,540\nCuz all that stuff's driven with power.\n\n832\n00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,630\nAnd so as a result,\nthey basically were sitting.\n\n833\n00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,960\nWhere they may have had a train\nin the dock and they unloaded.\n\n834\n00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,090\nBut once they unloaded it,\nit couldn't go anywhere.\n\n835\n00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,935\nSo as a result they basically were stuck.\n\n836\n00:38:45,935 --> 00:38:49,221\nSo there's a lot of studies done\nafter the fact on this stuff.\n\n837\n00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:53,393\nAnd it's very interesting just on\nthe process of understanding how to manage\n\n838\n00:38:53,393 --> 00:38:54,236\nthrough this.\n\n839\n00:38:54,236 --> 00:38:58,060\nAnd understanding what these thresholds\nreally mean in this particular phase.\n\n840\n00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,210\nWhen we are talking about\nthe activation phase in particular,\n\n841\n00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:05,100\nit is very important to understand what\nthese criteria for plan activation are.\n\n842\n00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,465\nAnd to understand the implications of\nwhat it means to declare that disaster.\n\n843\n00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:11,700\nOr declare that we're now gonna\ngo into business continuity,\n\n844\n00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,420\nto try to start back up again.\n\n845\n00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,260\nBecause this is really ultimately,\n\n846\n00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,240\nwhat's gonna be the difference\nbetween success and failure.\n\n847\n00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,670\n>> Right, absolutely.\n>> When we talk about this so,\n\n848\n00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,260\nthis is the activation area,\nactivation phase.\n\n849\n00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:23,980\nIn recovery we're going to have\nthings like moving to the alternate\n\n850\n00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,980\nsite taking place.\n\n851\n00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,740\nSo what's our move going to look like?\n\n852\n00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,290\nWhat's the plan around that?\n\n853\n00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:29,750\nHow quickly do we do that?\n\n854\n00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:33,980\nDo we throw people on a plane, you know on\nMonday expect them to be up on Wednesday?\n\n855\n00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,420\nIs somebody bringing the tractor\ntrailer full of gear and\n\n856\n00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,230\nall the filing cabinets, all that stuff?\n\n857\n00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,430\nHow's all that working?\n\n858\n00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:43,270\nWhat are the restore processes?\n\n859\n00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,510\nWhat are the restoral?\n\n860\n00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,660\nWe call them restoral or just restore.\n\n861\n00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,910\nBecause restoral is usually\na harder word to spell.\n\n862\n00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,768\n>> Yeah.\n>> So what are the restore processes that\n\n863\n00:39:50,768 --> 00:39:52,213\nwe have to go through, right?\n\n864\n00:39:52,213 --> 00:39:53,954\nWho's going to load the tapes,\nhow many days?\n\n865\n00:39:53,954 --> 00:39:55,173\nWhere are they coming from?\n\n866\n00:39:55,173 --> 00:39:58,693\nIf we have secure offsite storage for\ntapes, or we're using Iron Mountain or\n\n867\n00:39:58,693 --> 00:40:00,090\nsomething as a service.\n\n868\n00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:03,320\nDo they know that they have to send\nthem over to our recovery site?\n\n869\n00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,680\nWho's got the authority\nto tell them to do that?\n\n870\n00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,950\nHas that call been made?\n\n871\n00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,985\nIs somebody at the recovery\nsite to be able to accept them?\n\n872\n00:40:09,985 --> 00:40:12,710\nCuz they don't just show up and\ndrop them off at the door, and\n\n873\n00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,125\nnot leave without a sign.\n\n874\n00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:15,606\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> This isn't UPS or FedEx.\n\n875\n00:40:15,606 --> 00:40:18,500\nRight?\nOh yeah, just leave the package,\n\n876\n00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,330\nnobody was there.\n\n877\n00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,300\nA bunch of people milling around,\nthey kind of looked weird, but\n\n878\n00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,515\nI thought it would be okay so\nI left the package there.\n\n879\n00:40:23,515 --> 00:40:24,485\nNo, we don't do that.\n\n880\n00:40:24,485 --> 00:40:25,815\nThey come in a locked box, right?\n\n881\n00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:29,340\nAnd they've got to hand them to somebody,\nand you've got to basically sign for them.\n\n882\n00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,195\nRight?\nSo if nobody's there,\n\n883\n00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,425\nthen they can't drop the tapes.\n\n884\n00:40:32,425 --> 00:40:35,115\nIn which case, you're stuck because they\nshow up, you're not there, they leave.\n\n885\n00:40:35,115 --> 00:40:36,494\n>> They're gone.\n>> They don't hang out.\n\n886\n00:40:36,494 --> 00:40:37,760\nRight?\nSo you know that could\n\n887\n00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,190\ndelay the whole thing,\nthat could just be a huge issue.\n\n888\n00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,460\nSo you got to be aware of that.\n\n889\n00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,870\nAlso what are our recovery procedures?\n\n890\n00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,740\nJust what are the procedures for recovery?\n\n891\n00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:49,370\nNot just for store processes, but\nwhat are our actual recovery procedures.\n\n892\n00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,410\nWhat are they going to look like and\nwhat are they?\n\n893\n00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,395\nAnd how are they going to behave?\n\n894\n00:40:52,395 --> 00:40:55,090\nSo we wanna make sure we have\nthat documented out there.\n\n895\n00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:58,260\nUnder reconstruction,\nthings like restoring the facility.\n\n896\n00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,622\nSo getting it up and running, and\n\n897\n00:40:59,622 --> 00:41:01,978\nrestoring the original facility\nis gonna be important.\n\n898\n00:41:01,978 --> 00:41:03,380\n[COUGH] Excuse me.\n\n899\n00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,300\nSetting up our test environments, so we\ncould begin to put things back online and\n\n900\n00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,270\nturn them back on.\n\n901\n00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,489\nThat's also gonna be important.\n\n902\n00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,960\nMoving operations.\n\n903\n00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472\nRight?\nSo,\n\n904\n00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,719\nwe may have to move back\nfrom the recovery site,\n\n905\n00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:19,020\nback over to the facility after\nwe stabilize and recovered it.\n\n906\n00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,670\nSo, that's gonna happen there,\nmove operations back.\n\n907\n00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,700\nSo, that's gonna happen.\n\n908\n00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,970\nOr at least,\nbe documenting what's the process there.\n\n909\n00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:25,532\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n910\n00:41:25,532 --> 00:41:28,373\n>> And then in the appendices, as I said,\na lot of things will live there.\n\n911\n00:41:28,373 --> 00:41:32,225\nIt's where the kind of random hodge-podge,\nbecause we're not sure by business and\n\n912\n00:41:32,225 --> 00:41:33,865\nby entity what will belong there.\n\n913\n00:41:33,865 --> 00:41:36,937\nBut anything is, just a general rule\nof thumb, anything doesn't belong on\n\n914\n00:41:36,937 --> 00:41:40,897\nthe first floor areas, but is important\nto document winds up in the appendices.\n\n915\n00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:43,377\nSo, this is really just gonna\nbe our reference material.\n\n916\n00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:45,097\nI mentioned things like call trees,\n\n917\n00:41:45,097 --> 00:41:49,560\nwhich are kind of the number flow charts\nwe have that tell us who to call when.\n\n918\n00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,020\nThings of that nature.\n\n919\n00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,510\nWe may have network documentation, so\nmaybe Visio diagrams, key systems,\n\n920\n00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:56,540\nthings like that.\n\n921\n00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:03,210\nYou may have a list of passwords,\nand account information for\n\n922\n00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:06,665\ncertain key systems, or\nthis could be media that is attached.\n\n923\n00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:08,020\nYou may not put it in print form, but\n\n924\n00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:12,130\nyou may have a disc or a designated\ndrive that has all that stuff on it.\n\n925\n00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:15,120\nThat's effective the appendicy,\nbut it may be electronic.\n\n926\n00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:17,520\nMaybe part of that, but it's not\ngoing to be actually printed out for\n\n927\n00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,700\nsecurity reasons.\n\n928\n00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,570\nRight, that kind of stuff, but\n\n929\n00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:23,290\nall that reference material is all gonna\nsit in the appendices, whatever that is.\n\n930\n00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,750\nSo I always just think of it as being\nanything that I need to document that\n\n931\n00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,130\nisn't a part of one of those other four\ncategories, will ultimately wind up there.\n\n932\n00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,270\nIf it's important enough, I need it,\n\n933\n00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,490\nit's gonna go in the appendices,\nwhatever that may be.\n\n934\n00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:38,480\nSo that's where we see all of this taking\nplace and kinda what shows up there.\n\n935\n00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,610\nAnd then once we have all that together,\nultimately everything's documented.\n\n936\n00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:42,930\nWe've done all the analysis.\n\n937\n00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,140\nWe've written up the plan.\n\n938\n00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,810\nWe now have to go in and test the plan.\n\n939\n00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:46,920\nAnd so how do we test it?\n\n940\n00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,300\nHow do we know it's there?\n\n941\n00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,340\nIt's not enough just to\nput the plan on the shelf.\n\n942\n00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,940\nIn effect, we say hey by the way, success.\n\n943\n00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:53,755\nI have the binder.\n\n944\n00:42:53,755 --> 00:42:55,499\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> I'm sure we're [CROSSTALK].\n\n945\n00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:56,600\nI know it's gonna work.\n\n946\n00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,270\n>> I know it's gonna work.\n\n947\n00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,110\nWhy would I test it?\n\n948\n00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,020\nIt's gonna be good.\n\n949\n00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,635\nJust trust me.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n950\n00:42:59,635 --> 00:43:00,135\n>> Right?\n\n951\n00:43:00,135 --> 00:43:01,325\nI mean, I work for the government.\n\n952\n00:43:01,325 --> 00:43:02,300\nWhy would you trust me?\n\n953\n00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:02,975\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n954\n00:43:02,975 --> 00:43:04,275\n>> Haven't heard that before,\n\n955\n00:43:04,275 --> 00:43:06,995\nright?\nSo, what we have to do is we have to test\n\n956\n00:43:06,995 --> 00:43:08,890\nthe plan.\nThe idea is you create the plan, but\n\n957\n00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:11,120\nthen you have to test\nthe plan on an ongoing basis.\n\n958\n00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,850\nAnd this is often where businesses fail.\n\n959\n00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:15,450\nThey don't fail in the disaster.\n\n960\n00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,140\nThey don't fail in the recovery.\n\n961\n00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,590\nThey never get the chance to get that far\n\n962\n00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,320\nbecause what happens is by\nthe time they get there.\n\n963\n00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,190\nThe plan that they spent all this time and\n\n964\n00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:28,510\nenergy working on, three four five years\nago whatever it was, has become obsolete.\n\n965\n00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:31,510\nBecause they haven't bothered to\ntrot it out and things have changed.\n\n966\n00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:35,350\nAnd so as a result, they've failed in\neffect before they've begun, right?\n\n967\n00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,420\n>> Set yourself up for failure.\n\n968\n00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,890\n>> They failed before\nthe disasters happened.\n\n969\n00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,360\nEffectively, they've already\nbasically they've just lost.\n\n970\n00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,100\nNothing goods going to happen there.\n\n971\n00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:46,030\nSo, what we need to do is be testing,\nand testing relentlessly all the time.\n\n972\n00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:48,940\nNow when I say that, let's be clear.\n\n973\n00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:53,170\nLet's take the reality\nversus the best practice\n\n974\n00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,350\nbubble world scenario where everything's\nperfect and nothing goes wrong.\n\n975\n00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:02,290\n>> So we tell you always, hey, test at\nleast once a year, at least twice a year.\n\n976\n00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:03,910\nYou gotta be testing this stuff.\n\n977\n00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:06,614\nSo at a bare minimum, listen,\nbaseline, once a year,\n\n978\n00:44:06,614 --> 00:44:08,120\nyou gotta roll this stuff out.\n\n979\n00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,285\nYou gotta do a test.\n\n980\n00:44:09,285 --> 00:44:12,084\nBut the reality is, some companies\nwill test a lot more then that.\n\n981\n00:44:12,084 --> 00:44:13,570\n>> Right.\n>> Regulatory compliance\n\n982\n00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,420\nmay dictate your testing every quarter.\n\n983\n00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,250\nIf you're in the financial\nservices industry,\n\n984\n00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,490\nif you're in bio-pharmaceuticals,\nfor instance.\n\n985\n00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,110\nYou've got some incredibly stringent\nrequirements around a lot of stuff.\n\n986\n00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,335\nOne of them is disaster recovery.\n\n987\n00:44:24,335 --> 00:44:26,460\n>> Yeah\n>> You've got to be testing all the time.\n\n988\n00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,200\nSo it really depends on what you're doing,\nand what kind of systems you run.\n\n989\n00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,534\nIf you're just in a normal business,\nnothing out of the ordinary,\n\n990\n00:44:33,534 --> 00:44:35,063\nyou're not publicly traded.\n\n991\n00:44:35,063 --> 00:44:39,308\nSo you're basically a private entity and\nthere's not a lot of regulatory oversight,\n\n992\n00:44:39,308 --> 00:44:41,180\nif any, associated with what you do.\n\n993\n00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:44,650\nYou just may not test, or you may\njust test once every couple years, or\n\n994\n00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:46,075\njust randomly whenever\nyou get around to it.\n\n995\n00:44:46,075 --> 00:44:47,700\nSo, that's what it is.\n\n996\n00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,760\nBut reality is best\npractices will dictate that,\n\n997\n00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,670\nat a minimum, once a year that\nyou do a full test of this.\n\n998\n00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,660\nSo you do have to do that.\n\n999\n00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,970\nAnd if you're audited, by the way, if\nyou're a company that is publicly traded,\n\n1000\n00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,490\nif you do auditing,\naudited financials, things like that.\n\n1001\n00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:04,510\nIf you have information\nauditors coming in,\n\n1002\n00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,950\nthey're gonna mandate you do your testing.\n\n1003\n00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:06,790\nIt's gotta be documented.\n\n1004\n00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:09,060\nWe have to see it when we come in and\non site.\n\n1005\n00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:13,050\nIf we don't see the output of the audit,\nthen you just basically are, excuse me,\n\n1006\n00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,815\nthe output of the test.\n\n1007\n00:45:13,815 --> 00:45:15,110\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Then the output of the audit is a big\n\n1008\n00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:16,890\nred x'd for a finding, and you're done.\n\n1009\n00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,180\n>> Yep.\n>> We don't even bother to\n\n1010\n00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,570\nreally go through the audit,\nbecause as a result,\n\n1011\n00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,100\nwe have no of validating\nwhat you're doing, right?\n\n1012\n00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:22,750\n>> Exactly.\n\n1013\n00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,960\n>> Or we're make you do one.\n\n1014\n00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,605\nRight, Clay?\n>> Yeah.\n\n1015\n00:45:24,605 --> 00:45:25,294\n[LAUGH]\n>> We'll say, okay.\n\n1016\n00:45:25,294 --> 00:45:26,281\nSo we're coming back in a month.\n\n1017\n00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:28,510\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> And, basically, you got a month.\n\n1018\n00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:29,630\nGo do it.\nAnd then we're coming back,\n\n1019\n00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,755\nbecause, you may have just\ninadvertently scheduled it typically.\n\n1020\n00:45:32,755 --> 00:45:34,230\n>> Right.\n>> You schedule these things so\n\n1021\n00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,340\nthey happen after these events occur.\n\n1022\n00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,180\nBut if it's just bad timing,\n\n1023\n00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:41,050\nthen obviously you can't conduct\nthe audit until after the review's done.\n\n1024\n00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:42,840\nSo you wanna just make\nsure you're aware of that.\n\n1025\n00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,690\nI've had that happen once or\n\n1026\n00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:47,663\ntwice, where we've shown up and just bad\ntiming, scheduling, miscommunication.\n\n1027\n00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:48,965\n>> Right.\n>> You were supposed to do it.\n\n1028\n00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:50,375\nSomething happened, and\nyou didn't get it done.\n\n1029\n00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:53,585\nAnd we had to push the audit back because\nwe had to make sure the test results were\n\n1030\n00:45:53,585 --> 00:45:54,875\nin before we could do the audit.\n\n1031\n00:45:54,875 --> 00:45:56,825\nRight?\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1032\n00:45:56,825 --> 00:45:59,316\nSo having said that, let's just\nquickly go through the test types.\n\n1033\n00:45:59,316 --> 00:46:00,917\nRight?\nSo we have what's called a checklist.\n\n1034\n00:46:00,917 --> 00:46:04,807\nSometimes this test is also\nreferred to as the desk check test,\n\n1035\n00:46:04,807 --> 00:46:06,217\nthese are kind of the same thing.\n\n1036\n00:46:06,217 --> 00:46:09,877\nWe basically send printed copies,\nelectronic or printed, either way, but\n\n1037\n00:46:09,877 --> 00:46:13,867\njust basically copies, usually\nelectronic of this around to everybody.\n\n1038\n00:46:13,867 --> 00:46:15,587\nSay hey, kind of sit at your desk.\n\n1039\n00:46:15,587 --> 00:46:17,447\nLook at it, look at your piece.\n\n1040\n00:46:17,447 --> 00:46:18,807\nKind of walk it through.\n\n1041\n00:46:18,807 --> 00:46:22,690\nCheck off the pieces you're\nresponsible for, and make sure\n\n1042\n00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:26,460\nthat from a functional review perspective,\nyou're familiar with what's in there.\n\n1043\n00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:27,540\nAnd you're okay with it.\n\n1044\n00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,375\nNothing's changed,\nyou don't have any input.\n\n1045\n00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:31,060\nOh, it's not this anymore.\n\n1046\n00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,380\nHey, we changed this thing.\n\n1047\n00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,215\nWe don't have this system.\n\n1048\n00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,840\n>> Yeah.\n>> That kind of stuff comes back.\n\n1049\n00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:37,200\nBut you basically just,\nit's done in isolation.\n\n1050\n00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,190\nPeople aren't in the same room together,\nyou just do a read through.\n\n1051\n00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,080\nAnd it's very, very basic dry run,\nand we check it off.\n\n1052\n00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,130\nThat's why we call it a checklist,\n\n1053\n00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:47,780\nwe just literally check off\na box that says we read it.\n\n1054\n00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,900\nAnd we may provide some feedback, and\nthen that's the extent of the test.\n\n1055\n00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:51,790\nNothing else is done.\n\n1056\n00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:53,020\nSo totally paper based.\n\n1057\n00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:53,990\nWe don't do anything.\n\n1058\n00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:57,380\nWe don't look at any real systems,\nwe don't do anything of that kind at all.\n\n1059\n00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,930\nThe next kind is called\na structured walk through.\n\n1060\n00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:03,620\nStructured walk through is where we get\nrepresentatives in from each department.\n\n1061\n00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,270\nSo if we have HR,\nif we have sales and marketing.\n\n1062\n00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,420\nWe have finance.\n\n1063\n00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:12,270\nWe have database.\n\n1064\n00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,640\nWe have directory services.\n\n1065\n00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,850\nWe have networking.\n\n1066\n00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:15,970\nWe have all those different departments.\n\n1067\n00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:18,490\nThey all come in,\nsit together in a room basically.\n\n1068\n00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:21,640\nEverybody has copies again, so\nyou gotta print out a bunch of copies.\n\n1069\n00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,800\nAnd we come together,\nand we go over the plan.\n\n1070\n00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,870\nAgain, totally on paper.\n\n1071\n00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,740\nWe're not actually\nbringing up live systems.\n\n1072\n00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:31,180\nWe don't touch anything but now we've\ngot all the players in a single room\n\n1073\n00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:35,930\ntalking to each other, basically\nhelping us understand what is going on.\n\n1074\n00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,840\nBut again we're just reading\nthrough the plan in effect, but\n\n1075\n00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,600\nwe're going through it kind of\ntop to bottom in order there.\n\n1076\n00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,750\nSo that way, we have a sense and\n\n1077\n00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,990\neverybody kind of chimes in and\nsays what's going on.\n\n1078\n00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:48,660\nThen we have a simulation.\n\n1079\n00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,390\nSo this is like, I used to call this\nthe Dungeons and Dragons test, right?\n\n1080\n00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:55,703\nBecause the simulation test is,\nyou come up with a scenario, right?\n\n1081\n00:47:55,703 --> 00:47:59,404\nSo, okay, we're going to simulate\ntoday that we had, if you were out,\n\n1082\n00:47:59,404 --> 00:48:03,062\nlet's say in California Did this\na few times with companies out there.\n\n1083\n00:48:03,062 --> 00:48:06,301\nSo we just had a level four earthquake.\n\n1084\n00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:08,450\nIt was 7.0 on the Richter scale.\n\n1085\n00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:14,300\nPower's out, we have fires all over\nthe place, and the data center's offline.\n\n1086\n00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,430\nSo that's our scenario.\n\n1087\n00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:17,160\nNow let's kinda walk through the scenario.\n\n1088\n00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,220\nAnd everybody's in the room,\nyou got all the key players there.\n\n1089\n00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,180\nAgain, it's paper based in\nthe sense it's a scenario.\n\n1090\n00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,000\nYou're not touching real systems.\n\n1091\n00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:29,880\nBut you are gonna go through, and you are\ngonna basically see what's going on there.\n\n1092\n00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,370\nAnd so, we're gonna simulate this, and\n\n1093\n00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:35,150\nwe're gonna simulate\nthe operational issues.\n\n1094\n00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,805\nSo people are gonna act\nlike it's really happening.\n\n1095\n00:48:37,805 --> 00:48:40,755\nThey're gonna sit at the console,\nthey're gonna basically be playing and\n\n1096\n00:48:40,755 --> 00:48:41,615\ndoing these things.\n\n1097\n00:48:41,615 --> 00:48:43,716\nBut we're not gonna\nactually fail systems over,\n\n1098\n00:48:43,716 --> 00:48:45,575\nwe're not really gonna touch production.\n\n1099\n00:48:45,575 --> 00:48:47,505\n>> Right.\n>> We're just gonna kinda walk through\n\n1100\n00:48:47,505 --> 00:48:48,365\nwhat that's gonna look like.\n\n1101\n00:48:48,365 --> 00:48:52,865\nIt's either called a simulation or\nscenario exam, or a simulation or\n\n1102\n00:48:52,865 --> 00:48:53,965\nscenario test.\n\n1103\n00:48:53,965 --> 00:48:57,965\nBut the idea is that basically you're\npicking a scenario problem, a what if, and\n\n1104\n00:48:57,965 --> 00:49:01,160\nyou're walking through what the plan\nlooks like from that perspective.\n\n1105\n00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,040\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1106\n00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:05,620\nThen we have what's known\nas a parallel test.\n\n1107\n00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,770\nParallel test is where we have\nsome systems that are interrupted.\n\n1108\n00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,320\nSo, this is where we start\nactually going live on systems.\n\n1109\n00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,695\nWe're gonna pick some subsets of system.\n\n1110\n00:49:13,695 --> 00:49:14,905\nFail them over.\n\n1111\n00:49:14,905 --> 00:49:17,215\nInterrupt them to the recovery site.\n\n1112\n00:49:17,215 --> 00:49:20,545\nRun them from there for\na period of time and then fail them back.\n\n1113\n00:49:20,545 --> 00:49:22,799\nAnd so, we're not gonna fail\nthe entire system over, but\n\n1114\n00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:26,355\nwe may just decide to say, hey, you\nknow what, we're gonna fail over email.\n\n1115\n00:49:26,355 --> 00:49:30,145\nSo, this weekend is our parallel test,\nour parallel DR test for email.\n\n1116\n00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:35,180\nWe fail over the email system to\nthe recovery site, we run email there for\n\n1117\n00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,690\n24 hours, and then we fail it back.\n\n1118\n00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:41,920\nAnd so the idea is to test different\nareas or aspects of our architecture\n\n1119\n00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,820\nin order to ensure that when we do go\nto a full failover in the real thing,\n\n1120\n00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,310\nthat hopefully it works.\n\n1121\n00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:50,360\nSo there's some value in this in\nthe sense you get to see a slice\n\n1122\n00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,860\nof the system failing over.\n\n1123\n00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,600\nThe downside here, the lack of clarity is,\n\n1124\n00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,100\nbecause the entire structure\ndoesn't failover at once, right?\n\n1125\n00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,135\nWhat I often find, I've had this\nhappen with a lot of clients,\n\n1126\n00:50:00,135 --> 00:50:03,560\nis that piece works really well,\nthe failover on the routing for\n\n1127\n00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,680\nthe email works well, but there's problems\nin the routing topology elsewhere.\n\n1128\n00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,140\nAnd we don't see them until\nwe failover the whole system.\n\n1129\n00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:15,850\nSo as a result, that part works flawlessly\nand they check it off, okay, we're good.\n\n1130\n00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:18,980\nAnd then something happens six months\nlater before the next test and\n\n1131\n00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,180\nthey failover everything for real.\n\n1132\n00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,800\nAnd all of a sudden while email may be up\nand running, VoIP is hosed because you\n\n1133\n00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,750\ncan't get the routing topology for\nVoIP to failover, because your layer three\n\n1134\n00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,270\nswitches, you know, there was a firmware\nupdate nobody did it or something crazy.\n\n1135\n00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:35,390\nOr they did do it and it screwed up\nthe failover because now they wiped out\n\n1136\n00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,950\nthe routes that are supposed\nto be there for failover.\n\n1137\n00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,960\nSo, I've seen all sorts of really crazy,\nbizarre things happen.\n\n1138\n00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,420\nThey usually happen outside of testing,\nbecause they happen in between tests.\n\n1139\n00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:48,690\nAnd then nobody really understands the\nimplication of them cuz we're not doing\n\n1140\n00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:50,360\na full failover, we're don't see it.\n\n1141\n00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:51,570\nSo that's really an issue.\n\n1142\n00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:52,670\nAnd then full interruption.\n\n1143\n00:50:53,830 --> 00:50:56,302\nFull interruption,\nlike the name implies, right?\n\n1144\n00:50:56,302 --> 00:51:00,295\nWe're gonna basically just\ntake the entire system and\n\n1145\n00:51:00,295 --> 00:51:04,140\nfail it over to whatever\nis our recovery option.\n\n1146\n00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:07,940\nAnd so this is literally like walking\nout behind the back of the shed,\n\n1147\n00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:12,110\npulling the bower plug out of the entire\nbusiness and just seeing what happens.\n\n1148\n00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:16,110\nAnd we obviously have a full team in place\nat the recovery site, and everybody is\n\n1149\n00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:20,490\nset up in the knock or whatever's gonna be\nonline to manage this, and we're running,\n\n1150\n00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,310\nin effect, the entire business from\nover there for a period of time.\n\n1151\n00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:26,860\nAnd then of course we're failing back\nover once that recovery solution\n\n1152\n00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,740\nhas been tested.\n\n1153\n00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,372\nAnd this is really typically where\nwe tend to shake things out and\n\n1154\n00:51:30,372 --> 00:51:31,795\nfind the issues I just discussed.\n\n1155\n00:51:31,795 --> 00:51:35,847\nWhere maybe there's a routing topology\nproblem, maybe there is some sort of\n\n1156\n00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:39,794\nredundancy problem where the redundant\nsystem isn't fully spinning up.\n\n1157\n00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:43,149\nA lot of times, what we see is even\nthough these systems are maintained,\n\n1158\n00:51:43,149 --> 00:51:45,290\nthere could be things like I mentioned.\n\n1159\n00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,460\nSome sort of a patch to firmware.\n\n1160\n00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:51,980\nSome sort of an update that we've engaged\nin part of the scenario or part of\n\n1161\n00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:55,880\nthe system, where maybe we're starting to\ndo rip and replace around certain gear.\n\n1162\n00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,950\nSo certain gear has been updated, but then\nmaybe the recovery gear has not been, or\n\n1163\n00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,520\nhas not been fully updated,\nso you're mixed topologies.\n\n1164\n00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,290\nAnd as a result of that, we tend to then\nhave issues where there's mismatches, and\n\n1165\n00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,050\nas a result,\n\n1166\n00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:10,820\nwe tend to have problems because we're\nnot operating on the same level.\n\n1167\n00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:12,760\nDifferent protocols may be\ninvolved at that point,\n\n1168\n00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,560\ndifferent configurations,\ndifferent abilities.\n\n1169\n00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,600\nWhen we do a firmware update we\ntend to see different abilities.\n\n1170\n00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,020\nDifferent things come online.\n\n1171\n00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,090\nSo that's usually something\nthat will take place.\n\n1172\n00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:26,900\nSo these are all the different kinds\nof tests that we actually can see and\n\n1173\n00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:27,690\nwe run through.\n\n1174\n00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:28,870\nAnd again, to be clear,\n\n1175\n00:52:28,870 --> 00:52:33,360\na company should be doing more than\none of these every time they test.\n\n1176\n00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,030\nBut they will do a mixture of these.\n\n1177\n00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:38,460\nSo literally every two or three months, I\nhave customers that'll do different kinds\n\n1178\n00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,530\nof tests to test a plan at different\nlevels all throughout the year.\n\n1179\n00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:46,130\nSo they may start out with some basic\nwalk-through, structured testing.\n\n1180\n00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:50,090\nBut on paper, they may migrate towards\nthe middle of the year to things like\n\n1181\n00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:51,880\nparallel tests or scenario tests.\n\n1182\n00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,810\nThen ultimately end up the year\nwith a full interruption\n\n1183\n00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:56,510\nwhere they're actually gonna go\nthrough and do the whole thing.\n\n1184\n00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,850\n>> Some of those tests are not\nquite as resource intensive, so\n\n1185\n00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:02,030\nyou might actually be able to do them a\nlittle more often, where I'm not actually\n\n1186\n00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,520\nfailing systems over, and-\n>> Right,\n\n1187\n00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,040\na structured walkthrough, a checklist\nis really just buying people lunch.\n\n1188\n00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,480\nChecklist is not even that.\n\n1189\n00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,520\nJust say, hey, give me an hour,\nand we're gonna do that.\n\n1190\n00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,520\nBut a structured walk-through,\n\n1191\n00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,300\nyou're basically putting everybody in a\nroom, you're buying them food for the day.\n\n1192\n00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,870\nI mean, it's very inexpensive.\n\n1193\n00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:18,140\nBut a parallel test, you gotta put\npeople on planes, fly them out there.\n\n1194\n00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:19,320\n>> Right.\n>> They've got to stay there for\n\n1195\n00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,550\na few days, right?\n\n1196\n00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:22,690\nThey gotta come back,\nyou gotta failover, failback.\n\n1197\n00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:26,250\nSo no, there's definitely expense\nassociated with that, no doubt about it.\n\n1198\n00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:26,750\nAbsolutely.\n\n1199\n00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:27,920\nAll right, very good.\n\n1200\n00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,872\nSo I think we are at a completion point,\nas opposed to a stopping point.\n\n1201\n00:53:31,872 --> 00:53:33,230\n>> Yeah, I think so too.\n\n1202\n00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:34,270\nThat was a good episode.\n\n1203\n00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,600\nI love the business continuity and\ndisaster recovery.\n\n1204\n00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:38,130\nAll right, ladies and gentlemen,\n\n1205\n00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,560\nI hope you guys enjoy the show as\nmuch as we did

TV.\n\n4\n00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:39,790\nI'm Mike Roderick, and\nwith me today is Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n5\n00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,610\nHow you doing, Adam?\n\n6\n00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,340\n>> I'm doing great.\n\n7\n00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,770\nI am in a legal mood today.\n\n8\n00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,970\n>> A legal mood today.\n\n9\n00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:44,866\nI like it.\n\n10\n00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:49,985\nThat's a good thing since our next\nepisode in our CISSP track is all\n\n11\n00:00:49,985 --> 00:00:54,933\nabout legal regulations,\ninvestigations, and compliance.\n\n12\n00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:57,417\nYou should be a happy\ncamper at this point, then.\n\n13\n00:00:57,417 --> 00:00:59,576\n>> I am happily compliant.\n\n14\n00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:01,700\nI'm compliantly happy.\n\n15\n00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,370\n>> Book them, Danno.\n\n16\n00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,180\n>> We've got some cool stuff to get to and\ntalk about with you guys.\n\n17\n00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:12,050\nWe're gonna spend some time talking\nabout the background, the regulatory,\n\n18\n00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,460\nthe compliance, the investigatory areas\nthat really help us to understand\n\n19\n00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,670\nwhat goes on as we look at being a CISSP.\n\n20\n00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,630\nWhat are the requirements we may have,\nwhat are the things that have to focus on.\n\n21\n00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,820\nAnd how are we going to bring them all\ntogether with some sort of overview\n\n22\n00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,930\nof information security management.\n\n23\n00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,975\nAnd so, we wanna always start out as\nwe do when we start a new topic area.\n\n24\n00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:33,190\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> A new body of knowledge.\n\n25\n00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,830\nOne of the new domains,\nby really reinventing and\n\n26\n00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,930\nthinking about a refocusing our efforts\naround the three pillars of information\n\n27\n00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,800\nsecurity management.\n\n28\n00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,500\nSo, we're constantly thinking\nabout confidentiality.\n\n29\n00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,250\nThinking about the ways in\nwhich we safeguard information,\n\n30\n00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,140\nkeep it from prying eyes.\n\n31\n00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,840\n>> Right.\n>> Make sure people\n\n32\n00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,320\nwho aren't supposed to see it don't.\n\n33\n00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,910\nPeople are supposed to it do.\n\n34\n00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,870\nWe're constantly thinking about integrity.\n\n35\n00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,530\nWhat is the way in which we ensure that\ninformation is not modified in any way,\n\n36\n00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,740\nbackwards or forwards.\n\n37\n00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,230\nSo data on the wire,\ndata at rest, all those things.\n\n38\n00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,320\nWe talked about some of these mechanisms\nlike hashing, digital signatures, and\n\n39\n00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,260\nthings of that nature\nthat go into integrity.\n\n40\n00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,610\nAnd then availability, and how do we make\nsure that information is safe guarded.\n\n41\n00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,240\nSo confidentiality is gonna be making sure\nthat haven't modified any way, integrity.\n\n42\n00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,920\nBut then, we make sure it's available\nto people that belong seeing it for\n\n43\n00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,980\nthings like access control, continuous\nmonitoring, redundancy in our systems.\n\n44\n00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,940\nAll these kind of things\ngo into availability.\n\n45\n00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,510\nSo a lot of this is driven\nby regulatory compliance.\n\n46\n00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,090\nA lot of it is driven by laws.\n\n47\n00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,900\nWhat can we do?\n\n48\n00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,850\nWhat are we not supposed to do?\n\n49\n00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,265\nSo I wanna talk about things\nfrom that perspective.\n\n50\n00:02:36,265 --> 00:02:39,770\nWanna bring in the conversations some\nof the ideas about how we protect\n\n51\n00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,910\ninformation.\n\n52\n00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,710\nOut beyond just the physicality\nof information management,\n\n53\n00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,350\nbeyond access controls.\n\n54\n00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,650\nThings such as copyrights,\ntrademarks, patents,\n\n55\n00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,530\nthat whole regulatory\ncompliance perspective.\n\n56\n00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,260\nAnd how we see the information that\nwe manage, intellectual property.\n\n57\n00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,570\nAnd the results of that being protected\nand safeguarded so people can't come and\n\n58\n00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:59,610\ntake it away from us.\n\n59\n00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,980\nRight?\nCuz we don't want that to happen.\n\n60\n00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,180\nSo, we're gonna go through and\ntalk about all those things.\n\n61\n00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,070\nAlso talk about the investigatory\naspects of this.\n\n62\n00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,860\nHow do we induct and go through an\ninvestigation, maybe forensic in nature?\n\n63\n00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,980\nSort of gonna do there in\nterms of overviewing or\n\n64\n00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,190\nreally thinking about the steps\nof a forensic investigation.\n\n65\n00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,274\nYou may never really have had\nan opportunity to go through one.\n\n66\n00:03:19,274 --> 00:03:23,092\nMay have seen them on TV, but you may\nnever have really gone through a forensic\n\n67\n00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:25,821\ninvestigation yourself as\na security practitioner.\n\n68\n00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:30,160\nSo as a CISSP, you will be expected to\nhave some knowledge of this process.\n\n69\n00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,960\nYou may never engage in it yourself, but\n\n70\n00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,000\nyou certainly have to understand how to\nmake awareness of these processes and\n\n71\n00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,020\nthings we have to do part of the average,\neveryday life cycle of what people know.\n\n72\n00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,810\nSo that if they do happen\nupon a crime scene,\n\n73\n00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,400\nif they do think something is going on,\nthey're not gonna act inadvertently and\n\n74\n00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,340\nperhaps ruin the evidence that was there.\n\n75\n00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,520\nSo we have to enforce chain of custody of\nevidence, make sure we understand that.\n\n76\n00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,850\nSo we'll take a look at that and\nfocus on that a little bit.\n\n77\n00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,710\nAnd also, not just with that,\n\n78\n00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,040\nbut we'll talk about the ways in which\nwe gather evidence and safeguard it.\n\n79\n00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,060\nSo we store it for long term usage,\n\n80\n00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,190\nand make sure it's admissible\nin a court of law.\n\n81\n00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,395\n>> [CROSSTALK] What\nkind of evidence is it?\n\n82\n00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:06,960\nIs it hearsay evidence,\nis it best evidence?\n\n83\n00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,910\nThings of that nature.\n\n84\n00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,770\nSo we'll go through and\ntalk about all that.\n\n85\n00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:10,630\n>> Exciting.\n\n86\n00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,930\nThat'll take like five minutes by the way.\n\n87\n00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,160\nSo if we do all that, we still\nhave like all this time left over,\n\n88\n00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,590\nthen Mike's gonna tell us some jokes.\n\n89\n00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,990\nThat's what we're gonna do.\n\n90\n00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,362\nAll right.\nSo let's get started.\n\n91\n00:04:20,362 --> 00:04:23,570\n>> [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]\n>> A guy walks into a bar, Rabbi,\n\n92\n00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,790\na computer, an engineer, and a priest.\n\n93\n00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,610\nAll walk into a bar.\n\n94\n00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,630\nWhat happens?\n\n95\n00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,760\nAll right, so let's go through.\n\n96\n00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,490\nLet's talk about some\nof the notes we have.\n\n97\n00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,740\nWe have put together a bunch\nof information for you.\n\n98\n00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,830\nSo computer assisted crime,\n\n99\n00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,620\ncomputer targeted crime,\ncomputer being incidental to the crime.\n\n100\n00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,410\nThese are three categories of crime.\n\n101\n00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,920\nBut we just wanted to find and start out\nby setting the bar for it because we have\n\n102\n00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,980\nto understand what role the computer\nplays in relation to the crime.\n\n103\n00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,080\nIn order to understand\nthen how to go in and\n\n104\n00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,140\nbasically investigate and\napply the right requirements there,\n\n105\n00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,910\nto make sure we gather the right\nevidence in the right way.\n\n106\n00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,290\nAnd so when we think about that or\nwhen we talk about that,\n\n107\n00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,700\nwhat we're talking about is if the\ncomputer is gonna be part of the crime.\n\n108\n00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,260\nSo computer assisted crime,\n\n109\n00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,640\na computer is used as a tool\nto help carry out the crime.\n\n110\n00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,030\nThe computer may, for instance, have\nbeen used to hack into another system.\n\n111\n00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,360\nSo if the crime is trespassing, or perhaps\ntaking information, stealing it from\n\n112\n00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,490\nanother system, the computer being used\nto hack in would be part of the crime.\n\n113\n00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,165\nSo the computer assisted\ncrime takes place there.\n\n114\n00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:23,525\nAlso if you take the computer\noff the shelf and\n\n115\n00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:25,045\nyou beat somebody with it-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n116\n00:05:25,045 --> 00:05:26,725\n>> As the commission of a crime,\n\n117\n00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:29,395\nthen is is part of the crime,\nand it's computer assisted.\n\n118\n00:05:29,395 --> 00:05:32,520\nSo if that person really aggravates\nyou in the cube next to you,\n\n119\n00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,540\nyou beat them mercifully\nwith the computer.\n\n120\n00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,470\nIt is computer assisted crime.\n\n121\n00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,370\nDon't do that by the way.\n\n122\n00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:38,950\nIt's not a good idea.\n\n123\n00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,020\n>> A very bad thing.\n\n124\n00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,440\n>> That's a very bad thing.\n\n125\n00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,880\nYou can imagine all these\nlittle brothers and\n\n126\n00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,750\nsisters running around, beating Johnny and\nbeating Sarah with the computer.\n\n127\n00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,353\nBut you're bothering me and they go,\nwhat happened to my laptop?\n\n128\n00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:51,086\n[LAUGH]\n>> Pick up the iPad, right?\n\n129\n00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:54,830\n[LAUGH] Or the laptop, or something,\nand it's in pieces on the floor.\n\n130\n00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,960\nAll right, so we don't want to do that.\n\n131\n00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,710\nRemember, the code of ethics\nspecifically says for\n\n132\n00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,570\ncertified professionals you must always\nput life, safety, above all else.\n\n133\n00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,470\nSo while you may graze somebody, you're\nnot supposed to kill them with a computer.\n\n134\n00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,450\nThat's very important.\n\n135\n00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,440\n>> All right, so computer targeted crime,\n\n136\n00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,400\nthe computer is actually\nthe victim of the crime.\n\n137\n00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,820\nSo in our same example from a minute ago,\n\n138\n00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,020\nwhere we said maybe somebody hacked in,\nstole some information, using a computer.\n\n139\n00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,980\nThe computer that was used to\nbreak in would be the computer\n\n140\n00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,450\nassisted crime piece.\n\n141\n00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,280\nBut the computer that was targeted, the\nfile server, maybe the financial server or\n\n142\n00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,840\nwhatever it was, that we actually broke\ninto and stole the information from.\n\n143\n00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,960\nThat's computer target crime.\n\n144\n00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,120\n>> That would be the victim.\n\n145\n00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,540\n>> That is the victim of the crime.\n\n146\n00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,780\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n147\n00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,120\nAnd then,\ncomputer is incidental to the crime.\n\n148\n00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,290\nComputer was not really central in any\nway to the commission of the crime.\n\n149\n00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,750\nMay happen to have been there.\n\n150\n00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,560\nSomebody may have done something.\n\n151\n00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,600\nBut it was incidental, really wasn't part\nof the central focus of the crime, so\n\n152\n00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,090\nwe didn't really use it to create\nthe crime or carry it out.\n\n153\n00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,500\nWe didn't really target it.\n\n154\n00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,400\nIt just may have been around and\njust peripherally there.\n\n155\n00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,754\nSo maybe they printed something\nout on the computer, but\n\n156\n00:06:58,754 --> 00:07:00,700\nit wasn't really the focus in any way.\n\n157\n00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,889\nComputer incidental to the crime.\n\n158\n00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:02,581\nThat kind of thing.\n\n159\n00:07:02,581 --> 00:07:04,497\nChecked your bank account.\n\n160\n00:07:04,497 --> 00:07:06,210\nOrdered some food on the way out.\n\n161\n00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:06,863\nSomething like that.\n\n162\n00:07:06,863 --> 00:07:08,391\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Just log into my email account,\n\n163\n00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:09,883\nwhile I'm robbing this house.\n\n164\n00:07:09,883 --> 00:07:10,760\n>> Netflix.\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n165\n00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,400\n>> Stream a movie while I'm downloading,\n\n166\n00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,820\nsomething like that.\n\n167\n00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,310\nThat's incidental to the crime,\n\n168\n00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,220\nit's not actually being used,\nat least not to perpetrate the crime.\n\n169\n00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,800\nPerhaps to capture that very, very\nsmart crime carrier outer, as you said.\n\n170\n00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,650\nThe person who actually carries out\nthe crime may have been leaving behind\n\n171\n00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,930\nevidence when it was incidental.\n\n172\n00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,800\nSo we wanna make sure.\n\n173\n00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,510\nYeah, oops, right?\n\n174\n00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,090\nIt's a technical term we have for that.\n\n175\n00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:31,590\nOops.\n>> Yeah.\n\n176\n00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,387\n>> I just wanna make sure that\n\n177\n00:07:32,387 --> 00:07:33,380\nwe're aware of that.\n\n178\n00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,640\nAll right, so some other vocabulary.\n\n179\n00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,320\nNow that we kind of broad definition of\nthe language maybe computers brought in.\n\n180\n00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,960\nPerhaps become part of evidence,\nbe part of a crime.\n\n181\n00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,730\nLet's just define some terms\nthat kind of catch all,\n\n182\n00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,700\nbeing the beginning of this discussion.\n\n183\n00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,140\nJust a bunch of terms that\nare important to know.\n\n184\n00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,810\nSo this idea of being a Script Kiddie.\n\n185\n00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,081\nIt's really a person who\nis claiming to be a hacker.\n\n186\n00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:57,112\nWe'll put that idea in quotes out there,\nour famous air quotes.\n\n187\n00:07:57,112 --> 00:07:58,252\nThey are a hacker, but\n\n188\n00:07:58,252 --> 00:08:02,035\nthey are a hacker that doesn't really\nhave the skills to hack on their own.\n\n189\n00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:05,657\nSo this is actually considered a very\nderogatory term in those circles.\n\n190\n00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:10,281\nIf you're referred to as a script kitty\nin hacker circles, it means basically,\n\n191\n00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,735\nthat you're a wannabe.\n\n192\n00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:12,260\nRight?\n\n193\n00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,005\nYou're kind of there, but you really\njust rely on other people's exploits,\n\n194\n00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:20,455\npublish code,\ntools that somebody else has built.\n\n195\n00:08:20,455 --> 00:08:23,465\nSo you're that point and\nclick kind of hacker person, right?\n\n196\n00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:26,555\n>> Type in the IP address, click\nthe button, and see if the attack worked.\n\n197\n00:08:26,555 --> 00:08:28,525\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n198\n00:08:28,525 --> 00:08:33,380\nSo as a result of that, we're really\ngonna be seeing these script kiddies\n\n199\n00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,510\nas being people that\nare derogatorily identified as being\n\n200\n00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,170\npeople that don't really\nhave hacking skills.\n\n201\n00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,530\nThat is what we're gonna\nbe thinking about there.\n\n202\n00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,920\nAdvanced persistent threats, APTs.\n\n203\n00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,110\nSo advance persistent.\n\n204\n00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,510\nI think it's actually E-N-T.\n\n205\n00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,860\nPersistent.\n\n206\n00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,610\nAs opposed to persistant.\n\n207\n00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,960\nI think it's spelled E, persistent.\n\n208\n00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,710\nYeah.\nPersistent threats.\n\n209\n00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,680\nSo APT is a category in and\nof themselves today.\n\n210\n00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,890\nVery, very important category.\n\n211\n00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,280\nWe see a lot of this\ntaking place out there.\n\n212\n00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,760\nThis idea of really custom crafted and\n\n213\n00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,900\nspecifically built and\ndesigned malicious code or malcode.\n\n214\n00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,100\nThat is targeted or built specifically\nto target individual machines or\n\n215\n00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,920\nnetworks, and is really crafted to\nget in there, and stay active and\n\n216\n00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,388\nreally hide itself and burrow.\n\n217\n00:09:17,388 --> 00:09:20,170\nBe very decidious,\nvery difficult to get rid of.\n\n218\n00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,910\nIt's a whole separate and\nvery difficult and\n\n219\n00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,800\nproblematic category of malware\nthat we deal with today.\n\n220\n00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,020\nThe rise of APTs of advance persistent\nthreats over the last couple of years\n\n221\n00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,010\nhas really been meteoric when we look at\nkind of the year over year threat reports.\n\n222\n00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,514\nAnd maybe the Verizon threat report or\n\n223\n00:09:38,514 --> 00:09:40,570\nsome of the other big\nones that are out there.\n\n224\n00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,284\nWe see APT usage and\n\n225\n00:09:42,284 --> 00:09:46,040\nAPTcategories in terms of infestations\nreally going through the roof.\n\n226\n00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,728\nAnd it's one of those rises that's kinda\ngoing up like this because there is so\n\n227\n00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:55,704\nmuch activity, especially from organized\ncrime in places like eastern Europe and\n\n228\n00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:58,140\nAsia, that are targeting businesses.\n\n229\n00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,650\nIndustrial espionage, really designing\nthreatware and malware to go in and\n\n230\n00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,740\nburrow deep and extract specific\ninformation out of these systems.\n\n231\n00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,390\nAnd so, this category generically\nis now being referred to as APT or\n\n232\n00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,440\nAdvanced Persistent Threat.\n\n233\n00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,330\nSo this is what we're seeing there.\n\n234\n00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,800\nIt is a separate category in and\nof itself.\n\n235\n00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,110\nPeople specialize in\ndealing with this now.\n\n236\n00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,860\nSo it is something potentially you\nmay find a lot of value in if you're\n\n237\n00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,820\ninterested in going out and dealing with.\n\n238\n00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,020\nBut it's something you should\ndefinitely be aware of as a CISSP or\n\n239\n00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,030\na CIS candidate ultimately,\nthat wants to be successful.\n\n240\n00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,520\nSo we also have some other ideas\nthat we want to share with you.\n\n241\n00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,850\nA few agreements or just statements\nof what certain things are.\n\n242\n00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,560\nIf you're doing business in the world\ntoday, this whole idea of privacy,\n\n243\n00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,500\nof safeguarding information,\n\n244\n00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,970\nmaking sure we know what kind\nof information is out there.\n\n245\n00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,229\nWhat needs to be kept secret, what\nconfidentiality needs to be applied to.\n\n246\n00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:51,885\nWhat integrity needs to be applied to\n\n247\n00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:55,015\nis critical to success in\nthe modern business world today.\n\n248\n00:10:55,015 --> 00:11:00,915\nCISSP's are going to be tasked with\nunderstanding these regulatory regimes and\n\n249\n00:11:00,915 --> 00:11:02,215\nthese requirements.\n\n250\n00:11:02,215 --> 00:11:06,054\nSafeguarding of personal information\nbecomes uppermost and primary as one of\n\n251\n00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:10,285\nthe key things that we have to do around\nconfidentiality and around integrity.\n\n252\n00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:14,300\nAnd so if you're doing business\nin Europe as a non European,\n\n253\n00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,520\nmeaning maybe a business\nmaybe based here in the US,\n\n254\n00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,600\nthat is doing business in Europe and\ndoing business with Europeans.\n\n255\n00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,820\nMore importantly,\n\n256\n00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,440\nthen you must adhere to what are known\nas the Safe Harbor Requirement rules.\n\n257\n00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,770\nSafe Harbor Requirements are going to\nbe European based privacy laws and\n\n258\n00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,710\nrules that are going to dictate and\nmandate certain levels of data privacy\n\n259\n00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:36,690\nthat have to be effectively\nmade available.\n\n260\n00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,380\nWhere we have to somehow\nunderstand how to deal with them.\n\n261\n00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,470\nAnd so,\nthere's a bunch of categories there.\n\n262\n00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,540\nAs you can see, there are seven areas\nthat these requirements touch on.\n\n263\n00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:49,620\nThe areas of notice, of choice,\nof onward transfer, security,\n\n264\n00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,700\ndata integrity, access, and enforcement.\n\n265\n00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,540\nI would say it's important for\nyou, as a CISSP candidate,\n\n266\n00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,510\nto be generically,\ngenerally high level, right?\n\n267\n00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:06,200\nInch, inch and a half worth of knowledge\nhere, aware of Safe Harbor as a process.\n\n268\n00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,290\nWhat does it require?\n\n269\n00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,420\nWhat does it mean?\n\n270\n00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,320\nIt means that non-Europeans doing\nbusiness in European areas must adhere to\n\n271\n00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,420\nthese requirements for data protection,\npersonal information protection.\n\n272\n00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,935\nDo you need to go deep here?\n\n273\n00:12:18,935 --> 00:12:22,380\nAnd really understand what the seven areas\nare, even though we've listed them for\n\n274\n00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,410\nyou because I think it's important for\nyou to be aware of them.\n\n275\n00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,640\nDo you really need to understand\noperational details on all these areas?\n\n276\n00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,880\nProbably not gonna be that critical for\nyour success.\n\n277\n00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,390\nRemember, the ideas that we're going\nto be asking are very broad or\n\n278\n00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,650\nbeing asked to answer.\n\n279\n00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,855\nVery broad series of questions across\nmultiple domains of knowledge.\n\n280\n00:12:39,855 --> 00:12:41,510\n>> Right.\n>> We understand that while these things\n\n281\n00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:46,410\nare important, that there are going\nto be varying regulatory bodies or\n\n282\n00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,620\nagencies by country,\nby area, by geography.\n\n283\n00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,840\nThat are gonna impact\nthe execution of these rules and\n\n284\n00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,270\nthe way in which we see them.\n\n285\n00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,610\nAnd so, we can't really get specific\nabout one set of rules as the CISSP,\n\n286\n00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,980\nunless we exclusively do business there.\n\n287\n00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,280\nTo test that knowledge,\nit would be really unfair to say, okay.\n\n288\n00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,650\nKnow everything about this country's\nrules, but not about everybody else's.\n\n289\n00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,110\nIt's very uneven.\n\n290\n00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,280\nWe're not really gonna spend a lot\nof time in this area talking about\n\n291\n00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,500\nEuropean specific or US specific rules.\n\n292\n00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,720\nWe're not gonna drill in, for instance,\non the US federal rules of evidence,\n\n293\n00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,980\neven though they make up a very\nlarge amount of discussion points\n\n294\n00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,800\nthat we may wanna take on.\n\n295\n00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,610\nTo really become an expert if we are gonna\nbe practicing in the United States.\n\n296\n00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,240\nWe're not gonna spend a lot of time.\n\n297\n00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,480\nTalking about US specific\nregulatory bodies, or requirements.\n\n298\n00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,930\nSo things like HIPAA,\n\n299\n00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,510\nthings like Sarbanes–Oxley,\nGramm–Leach–Bliley, Bank Secrecy Act.\n\n300\n00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,800\nWe're not gonna mention\nthem in any detail at all\n\n301\n00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,610\nbecause this is not\njust a US centric exam.\n\n302\n00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,260\nIt is a global exam, the CISSP exam is.\n\n303\n00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,230\nAnd you're expected to\nunderstand the process,\n\n304\n00:13:55,230 --> 00:14:00,070\nthe procedure the overarching\nstrategy of information security.\n\n305\n00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,490\nNot the specifics of how\nthe United States of America and\n\n306\n00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,680\nits government decides that they should\nimplement it within the borders of the US.\n\n307\n00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,120\nSo when we reference something like\nSafe Harbor requirements, it's so\n\n308\n00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,170\nthat you have a sense of\nthis being out there.\n\n309\n00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,440\nIt's one of those areas where it is pretty\nimportant because it cuts across multiple\n\n310\n00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,080\njurisdictions, but\nunderstanding the specific details,\n\n311\n00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,240\nprobably not as critical, so\njust put that in context.\n\n312\n00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,870\nThe Wassenaar Agreement, pretty\nimportant set of agreements out there.\n\n313\n00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,990\nThis is an agreement that implements\nexport controls on arms, but\n\n314\n00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,690\nalso a lot of other categories.\n\n315\n00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,990\nCivilly, we call dual use goods.\n\n316\n00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,960\nSo, the export of things like Encryption\ncontrols, computers, anything that\n\n317\n00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,690\ncan be used for multiple purposes is\ncovered under the Loss of Hour Agreement.\n\n318\n00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,400\nSo this is the agreement that a lot\nof countries, if they are party to,\n\n319\n00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,970\nwill basically use to control the import\nand the export of these goods.\n\n320\n00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,140\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n321\n00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,160\nAll right, so\nthen we have types of legal systems.\n\n322\n00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,320\nThere are multiple types\nof legal systems out there.\n\n323\n00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,740\nThis forms one of the key pillars,\none of the hearts\n\n324\n00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,050\nof this section of the knowledge\nmaterial that we are going through.\n\n325\n00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,000\nKnowledge of these legal systems at a high\nlevel, understanding the differences, for\n\n326\n00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,260\ninstance, between civil and\ncommon law systems,\n\n327\n00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,230\nbetween tort law and\ncriminal law within the common-law area.\n\n328\n00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,558\nVery important.\n\n329\n00:15:19,558 --> 00:15:22,300\nDefinitely gonna wanna make sure\nyou're comfortable answering questions\n\n330\n00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,160\nin this area and about this material.\n\n331\n00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,390\nSo I wannaspend a few minutes with you,\nrun through them.\n\n332\n00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,880\nI've summarized at a high level for\n\n333\n00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,098\nyou what I think the key points are with\nthe help of a my co-host here, Mike.\n\n334\n00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,440\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We've gone through and\n\n335\n00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,680\nput them together for you.\n\n336\n00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,260\nJust remember, big disclaimer,\nany of the stuff that looks good and\n\n337\n00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,080\nwas typed correctly you\ncan attribute to me.\n\n338\n00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,460\nAny of the spelling mistakes,\n\n339\n00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,830\nwe're gonna attribute right over here\nto Magic Fingers Mike, as we say.\n\n340\n00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,238\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So let's make sure we go through and\n\n341\n00:15:45,238 --> 00:15:45,870\ntalk about these.\n\n342\n00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,950\n>> I got my spell checker right here.\n\n343\n00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,800\n>> You do have your spell checker;\nI act as Mike's spell checker.\n\n344\n00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,480\nSo we try to filter it\nthrough several layers\n\n345\n00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,950\nto make sure it comes out correctly for\nyou.\n\n346\n00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,730\n>> Absolutely.\n>> All right,\n\n347\n00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,144\nso let's go back up to our notes here.\n\n348\n00:15:56,144 --> 00:15:58,304\nLet's start in on types of legal systems.\n\n349\n00:15:58,304 --> 00:16:01,029\nSo the first legal system we see,\nit is the most prevalent,\n\n350\n00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:02,728\nmost widespread in the world today.\n\n351\n00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,572\nThis is what is known as civil or\ncode law.\n\n352\n00:16:05,572 --> 00:16:09,630\nCivil or code law systems,\nthese are used in continental Europe.\n\n353\n00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,658\nSo places like France, Germany for\n\n354\n00:16:11,658 --> 00:16:15,520\ninstance are gonna be using this\nkind of system have for centuries.\n\n355\n00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,797\nRule based law, so this is not\nlaw that is based on precedent,\n\n356\n00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:21,490\nbut rather based on\nrules that are written.\n\n357\n00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:26,159\nSo it's focused on codified or\nwritten laws, so we have a book or\n\n358\n00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,653\na tome of written laws we refer to and\nwe say the law says this and\n\n359\n00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:32,650\nthis is what's in the law.\n\n360\n00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,075\nSo if you cross against the light on\na Sunday at 2 o'clock and it says,\n\n361\n00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:39,980\nyou don't cross against the light on\na Sunday at 2 o'clock, that's the law.\n\n362\n00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,680\nThere's really no wiggle room there.\n\n363\n00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,523\nWhat if it was a Sunday,\nbut it was not 2 o'clock.\n\n364\n00:16:45,523 --> 00:16:48,590\nIt was like 1:59 and\nI didn't know the time.\n\n365\n00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,245\nIt says,\n2 o'clock that's what it says in the law,\n\n366\n00:16:51,245 --> 00:16:53,550\nthis is the way a civil\nlaw code is structured.\n\n367\n00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,418\nSo it's very, very specific in the sense\nthat if it's in the book in the law,\n\n368\n00:16:57,418 --> 00:16:58,740\nwe interpret it that way.\n\n369\n00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,480\nIt's written down, that's what we go by.\n\n370\n00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,620\nThere's no precedents.\n\n371\n00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,809\nWe don't look at prior cases and look at\nhistorical implementation of the law,\n\n372\n00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:08,510\nthe way we do in what\nare called common law systems.\n\n373\n00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,940\nWe'll get to that in a minute.\n\n374\n00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:14,029\nWe just simply base our interpretation\naround what the rule says,\n\n375\n00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:16,010\nwhat the law is written on that.\n\n376\n00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,190\nThis is the most widespread\nlegal system in the world today.\n\n377\n00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:22,120\nBy the way, so civil a code law\nsystems are very widespread.\n\n378\n00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,789\nThey are basically the standard in\nalmost all of the major countries and\n\n379\n00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:29,581\na lot of the smaller countries in\nthe world today, because you think about\n\n380\n00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:33,742\nthe idea that most of the continental\nEuropean powers were the colonial powers,\n\n381\n00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:35,240\nmost of the big ones anyway.\n\n382\n00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,322\nCertainly, Germany, France, Spain or\n\n383\n00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,481\na lot of the big continental\npowers were also colonial powers.\n\n384\n00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:45,791\nThey spread their law systems far and wide\nwhen they were colonizing over the last 3,\n\n385\n00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:49,331\n400 years up until,\nbasically the early 1950s or\n\n386\n00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:53,490\n60s in some cases when a lot\nof those colonial possessions.\n\n387\n00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,811\nIn many cases in the Caribbean and\nAfrica and\n\n388\n00:17:55,811 --> 00:18:00,269\nplaces were finally granted independence,\nthose law systems have been in place for\n\n389\n00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:02,290\nhundreds of years based on civil law.\n\n390\n00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,380\nAnd as a result, we're really\ngonna see that law system prevail.\n\n391\n00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,984\nAlmost totally prevalent everywhere in\nthe world, even in the Middle East for\n\n392\n00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:13,023\ninstance, what where there were a lot of\ncolonial possessions and a lot of those\n\n393\n00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:16,600\nalso Latin America, where a lot of those\ncolonial entities would have been.\n\n394\n00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,570\nSo that's why we see it as being\nthe most common and widespread today.\n\n395\n00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,230\nCommon law, remember common\nlaw was developed in England.\n\n396\n00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,314\nSo we set continental Europe for\ncivil law,\n\n397\n00:18:24,314 --> 00:18:27,370\nbecause England is not considered\npart of continental Europe.\n\n398\n00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,355\nIt is separate in case you missed out\non the whole geography thing recently.\n\n399\n00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:32,975\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Haven't looked at a globe lately.\n\n400\n00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:34,355\n>> [INAUDIBLE]\n>> Got a little bit of water,\n\n401\n00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:35,835\na little blue stuff on the map.\n\n402\n00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:37,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Kind of floating in the middle.\n\n403\n00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,030\nGot it's own little island thing going on,\nso it's not part of continental Europe.\n\n404\n00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:44,188\nSo it developed its own law\nsystem called common law and\n\n405\n00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:47,900\ncommon law is based on prior or\nprevious interpretation of law.\n\n406\n00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,760\nSo this is based on precedence or\nhistorical interpretation of law.\n\n407\n00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,300\nSo this is what we see it reflects\ntypically, common law does.\n\n408\n00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,576\nThe community moral and expectation,\nso the community's morals and\n\n409\n00:18:58,576 --> 00:19:00,220\nexpectations, rather so.\n\n410\n00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,587\nWe see the interpretation\nof the law changing and\n\n411\n00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:08,517\nbeing kind of nuanced around what\nthe communities at large over history\n\n412\n00:19:08,517 --> 00:19:12,640\nhave seen as being moral,\nupright and expected behavior.\n\n413\n00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,619\nSo if you look back on a very dark time in\nAmerica certainly and in parts of Europe,\n\n414\n00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:22,440\nwhere during the 1600s, for\ninstance, there were witch trials.\n\n415\n00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,022\nWitchcraft trials and so you'll hear,\nvery famously in the United States,\n\n416\n00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:27,190\nthe Salem Witch Trials.\n\n417\n00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,091\nBut throughout Europe as well,\nwitches were hunted down or\n\n418\n00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:33,630\npeople that they thought were witches\nwere hunted down, prosecuted and\n\n419\n00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,200\nbasically put to death on\nthe slimmest of evidence.\n\n420\n00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,502\nReally, no evidence at all to\nprove that they were witches, but\n\n421\n00:19:39,502 --> 00:19:43,490\nwhatever that community moral or\nexpectation for behavior was at that time.\n\n422\n00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,541\nIf you were acting in a certain way,\nif you did certain things, represented\n\n423\n00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:51,800\nyourself in a certain way that led people\nto believe that might be what you were.\n\n424\n00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,740\nThe law of the land was basically,\nokay, you're acting like a witch.\n\n425\n00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,481\nYou must be a witch.\n\n426\n00:19:55,481 --> 00:19:56,295\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so\n\n427\n00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,580\nwe effectively called you a witch and\nthat's what happened.\n\n428\n00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,460\nSo you gotta make sure when you look at\nthis kind of law that you understand that\n\n429\n00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,098\nit could be influenced at certain\npoints in time by the community moral,\n\n430\n00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:09,900\nthe expectation,\nwhat is right what is wrong.\n\n431\n00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,180\nJudges and\njuries are used to decide these cases.\n\n432\n00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:17,100\nSo you're pretty common in today as we\nsee cases, law cases in the US certainly.\n\n433\n00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,345\nWe use common law, we use this kind\nof a system, we have the subtypes,\n\n434\n00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,890\nas we'll get to in a minute here.\n\n435\n00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,997\nCriminal and civil tort law and\nadministrative law all exist in\n\n436\n00:20:24,997 --> 00:20:28,150\nthe United States and\nin countries that use common law.\n\n437\n00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,315\nSo this is not to use the word\ninappropriately, but a common system.\n\n438\n00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,656\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Common law is common,\n\n439\n00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:36,597\nnowhere near as widespread as we\nsaid as civil or code law, but\n\n440\n00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:40,230\nit certainly is a common system the US\nuses it as do certain other countries.\n\n441\n00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,000\nEngland certainly uses it, as well.\n\n442\n00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,560\nSo subtypes of common law.\n\n443\n00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,898\nSo what are some\nsubcategories of common law?\n\n444\n00:20:46,898 --> 00:20:49,190\nWe will see three that are very important.\n\n445\n00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,397\nWe have criminal law,\nthis is based on common law,\n\n446\n00:20:52,397 --> 00:20:54,940\nstatutory law or a combination of both.\n\n447\n00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,574\nSo this is gonna be written\nlaw that is gonna be crafted,\n\n448\n00:20:57,574 --> 00:21:01,970\nspecifically to carve out certain kinds of\nbehavior, speak to certain expectations.\n\n449\n00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,850\nWe address behavior considered\nharmful to society.\n\n450\n00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,580\nI think harmful is with one L.\n\n451\n00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,655\nHarmful to society.\n\n452\n00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:09,586\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We have real-time spell checking\n\n453\n00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:10,220\ngoing on here.\n\n454\n00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,730\nThere we go.\n\n455\n00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,728\nHarmful to society.\n\n456\n00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,406\nIt's magic.\n\n457\n00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:15,203\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> And a punishment usually involves loss\n\n458\n00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:18,695\nof freedom or\nsome sort of monetary fines of some kind.\n\n459\n00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:22,450\nSo criminal law, really based on the idea\nthat you act in a certain way, but\n\n460\n00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,085\nthere are gonna be penalties\nassociated with that.\n\n461\n00:21:25,085 --> 00:21:28,537\nWe prove you guilty or innocent based\non a trial of your peers typically or\n\n462\n00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:32,273\ntrial before a judge, depending on whether\nyou choose to give up your rights to\n\n463\n00:21:32,273 --> 00:21:36,625\na jury trial and then we decide based on\nthe evidence presented before the court.\n\n464\n00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:39,046\nA civil or tort law under civil law,\n\n465\n00:21:39,046 --> 00:21:43,670\nthe defendant owes what is referred\nto as a legal duty to the victim.\n\n466\n00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:47,959\nAnd as a result of that legal duty to\nthe victim, the defendant's breach of that\n\n467\n00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:51,608\nduty will then cause what is considered\nto be injury to the victim and\n\n468\n00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:53,670\nthat injury then has to be sorted out.\n\n469\n00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,980\nWe have to ascribe a value to that injury.\n\n470\n00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,400\nWe often hear about things,\nlike pain and suffering.\n\n471\n00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,690\nAnd as a result,\nwe award some sort of monetary.\n\n472\n00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:04,526\nTypically, monetary compensation for\npain and suffering or\n\n473\n00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:09,670\nwhatever the injury is under the civil or\ntort law under the common law area.\n\n474\n00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,080\nAnd then administrative,\noften referred to as regulatory law.\n\n475\n00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,560\nThese are laws that are created\nby administrative agencies.\n\n476\n00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,820\nSo you may have laws from the government,\na certain regulatory body.\n\n477\n00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:24,575\nUnited States, for instance, we have\na regulatory entity called the FCC,\n\n478\n00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:28,812\nFederal Communications Commission,\nwhich regulates what can and\n\n479\n00:22:28,812 --> 00:22:33,714\ncannot be said or done or showed or\ninteracted with and presented on airwaves,\n\n480\n00:22:33,714 --> 00:22:37,910\non TV, on radio and any transmission\nmedia, you regulates that.\n\n481\n00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,441\nSo you're innocent in that thought\nprocess under administrative law until\n\n482\n00:22:41,441 --> 00:22:42,220\nproven guilty.\n\n483\n00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,759\nThe idea is you have the burden of proof\nis on the prosecution to prove that you\n\n484\n00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,632\nhave violated the administrative law, as\nopposed to on the defendant to prove they\n\n485\n00:22:49,632 --> 00:22:52,508\nare innocent, which is a little\nbit of a different approach,\n\n486\n00:22:52,508 --> 00:22:54,840\ndepending on where you live in the world.\n\n487\n00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,171\nAnd so\nwe talk about subtypes of common law,\n\n488\n00:22:57,171 --> 00:23:01,266\nI want to make sure we're clear on the\ndifference between criminal or civil or\n\n489\n00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:05,110\ntort, so just quickly think about this\nidea of being in a criminal case.\n\n490\n00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,762\nThere are examples of this where you could\nbe found innocent of criminal activity in\n\n491\n00:23:09,762 --> 00:23:13,284\na criminal case but still held liable,\nfound guilty of civil or\n\n492\n00:23:13,284 --> 00:23:16,142\ntort law violations have\nbeen made to pay damages,\n\n493\n00:23:16,142 --> 00:23:19,220\neven though you were not\nconsidered guilty of a crime.\n\n494\n00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,470\nAnd so we have several famous examples\nof this in the United States,\n\n495\n00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:25,092\nthe one that often gets cited\nthat often comes to mind,\n\n496\n00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:28,770\nprobably know where I'm going with\nthis would be the O.J. Simpson trial.\n\n497\n00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:32,363\nThe O.J. Simpson trial from several\nyears ago So whether you believe O.J.\n\n498\n00:23:32,363 --> 00:23:35,900\nSimpson was guilty or innocent, whether\nyou believe he did or did not commit\n\n499\n00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,730\nthe crimes that were discussed and that\nhe was charged with really not important.\n\n500\n00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,570\nWe're not getting into\nthat conversation here,\n\n501\n00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,540\nI have no opinion about it one way or\nthe other.\n\n502\n00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,445\nAnd even if I did,\nI would not share it with you.\n\n503\n00:23:45,445 --> 00:23:46,020\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> But\n\n504\n00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,134\nwhat I do want to point out\nto you is the following.\n\n505\n00:23:48,134 --> 00:23:52,146\nO.J. Simpson was found by a jury\nof his peers in a jury trial,\n\n506\n00:23:52,146 --> 00:23:56,929\nin a criminal trial under common law was\nfound to be innocent of the crime of\n\n507\n00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:00,043\ncommitting the murders\nthat he was accused of.\n\n508\n00:24:00,043 --> 00:24:01,111\n>> Reasonable doubt.\n\n509\n00:24:01,111 --> 00:24:03,944\n>> In the criminal prosecution,\nhe was found innocent.\n\n510\n00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:08,455\nHowever, in the civil thwart prosecution\narea of that case cuz there was a criminal\n\n511\n00:24:08,455 --> 00:24:09,990\nas well as a civil case.\n\n512\n00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:15,550\nIn the civil case, he was held to be\nguilty, and held to be liable, as we say.\n\n513\n00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:19,570\nAnd as a result of that, he was found\nto be liable in the civil portion of\n\n514\n00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,680\nthe trial, but\nnot guilty in the criminal portion.\n\n515\n00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,300\nAnd so, we can see that happening.\n\n516\n00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,060\nWe just want to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n517\n00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,280\nSo he was obviously given whatever\nthe penalties were that he was ascribed to\n\n518\n00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,220\nin the civil area to make restitution, but\n\n519\n00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,130\nhe was found innocent in\nthe criminal portion.\n\n520\n00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:37,220\nAll right,\nwhat was that that we heard earlier?\n\n521\n00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,288\n>> In civil it's a preponderance I think,\nover 50%.\n\n522\n00:24:40,288 --> 00:24:43,556\n>> Preponderance of evidence, [CROSSTALK]\nbut Don was going on about something\n\n523\n00:24:43,556 --> 00:24:46,413\nbefore we got on the air,\nsomething about if the glove don't fit,\n\n524\n00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:49,290\nthey must acquit or whatever that\nchant was that they had going on.\n\n525\n00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:49,820\nRight?\n\n526\n00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,831\nSo if it doesn't fit,\n\n527\n00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:54,370\nyou must acquit was the slogan that\nwas going around during the trial.\n\n528\n00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,960\nAnd obviously given the way\nthe criminal trial was handled\n\n529\n00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,320\nOJ Simpson ultimately was\nfound not guilty there.\n\n530\n00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,590\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n531\n00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,190\nSo we also have customary law.\n\n532\n00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,110\nOther types of law I want to go down and\nget to here.\n\n533\n00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,940\nCustomary law,\nbased on tradition and or custom.\n\n534\n00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,760\nRestitution under customary law,\ntraditionally, go into common or\n\n535\n00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,540\ncommonly, is going to into the form\nof monetary fines or services.\n\n536\n00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,170\nYou may have to render a service\nof some kind, do something for\n\n537\n00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,440\nsomebody, whatever that may be.\n\n538\n00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,070\nReligious law,\nrather than creating laws, and acting on\n\n539\n00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,570\nthe creation of laws specifically,\nscholars and lawmakers really focus on and\n\n540\n00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,410\nattempt to discover what is\nknown as the truth of the law.\n\n541\n00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,830\nWe have examples of religious law.\n\n542\n00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,870\nFor instance, in Judaism, you have\nwhat are known as the Kashrut laws.\n\n543\n00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:42,030\nThe laws around keeping Kosher and\nobserving dietary restrictions.\n\n544\n00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,480\nAnd we have laws in the Hebrew Bible.\n\n545\n00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,547\nWe certainly have laws\nin the Islamic world.\n\n546\n00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:49,850\nIn the Qur'an, there's a whole series\nof religious law that goes with it,\n\n547\n00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,290\nthe Sharia law that\nIslamic law is based on.\n\n548\n00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,690\nSo there's many examples of religious\nlaw that can be looked at and\n\n549\n00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,756\ncertainly could be interpreted,\ncan be discussed.\n\n550\n00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:02,870\nIt is certainly a a very common practice\ntoday in many areas of the world to have\n\n551\n00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,303\nelements of religious law play a part in\ncertain aspects of our lives, depending on\n\n552\n00:26:07,303 --> 00:26:11,705\nwhether you follow that or not obviously\ndepends on just how observant you may be.\n\n553\n00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:15,410\nMixed law systems Two or more of the\nprevious systems that we've talked about\n\n554\n00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:19,858\nwhether it's customary, religious, common,\ncivil, you know within common criminal,\n\n555\n00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:23,700\ncivil, tort administrative,\nwhatever those are, mixed together, right?\n\n556\n00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,062\nWe just simply have one or\nmore of them or excuse me, two or\n\n557\n00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:29,166\nmore of them mixed together then we have\nwhat is known as a mixed law system,\n\n558\n00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:30,850\nthat's what we see there.\n\n559\n00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:33,870\nAnd so when we talk about\nthese different law systems,\n\n560\n00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,490\nwe're really talking about\ndifferent ways in which.\n\n561\n00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,520\nWe can categorize.\n\n562\n00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,240\nClassifying group together\nthese systems of law\n\n563\n00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,100\nthat help us understand how\nwe interact with each other.\n\n564\n00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,690\nHow countries interact.\n\n565\n00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,860\nAnd how we can have an expectation of what\nis and is not not appropriate behavior.\n\n566\n00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,550\nIt's what really laws\nhelp us to understand.\n\n567\n00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,250\nNow we have other categories of law.\n\n568\n00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:57,900\nWe have a whole list of the here at\nthe next area that we're going to start\n\n569\n00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,760\nspending some time and going through.\n\n570\n00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,620\nSo we have intellectual property law.\n\n571\n00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,300\nThe focus on and the protection of\nanything that is going to be considered\n\n572\n00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,440\nintellectual property is something\nthat is created by an entity,\n\n573\n00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,930\neither by a company or\na person within a company.\n\n574\n00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,250\nThe company then maintains\nthe ownership of it.\n\n575\n00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,440\nSo it's really focused on how a company,\nor an individual can protect what\n\n576\n00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,790\nthey own, what it owns, what is created\nfrom unauthorized duplication or use.\n\n577\n00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:27,140\nSo, intellectual property law is all\nabout the protection of this intellectual\n\n578\n00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,400\nproperty created,\n\n579\n00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,000\nand making sure that if somebody does\nuse it, number one they have permission.\n\n580\n00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,200\nAnd, if they don't have permission\nthey can't, but if they do that you\n\n581\n00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,600\nreceive some monetary compensation for\nit, whatever that will be.\n\n582\n00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,240\nRight?\n\n583\n00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,780\nSo we have trade secret law.\n\n584\n00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,840\nTrade secret law.\n\n585\n00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,810\nA trade secret is considered to be\nsomething that is proprietary to a company\n\n586\n00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:48,620\nand is considered to be imported for\nits survival.\n\n587\n00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:53,480\nSo we often joke around about the Coke\nrecipe, right, or Colonel Sanders'\n\n588\n00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,550\nsecret recipe, or a secret sauce for\nMcDonald's, the Big Mac or whatever it is.\n\n589\n00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,190\nYou know, but\nthese are trade secrets right?\n\n590\n00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,110\nThere are many other examples of this,\nso anything that is considered something\n\n591\n00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:08,040\nproprietary to that company and important\nfor it's survival is a trade secret.\n\n592\n00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,380\nAnd is governed by trade secrets and\nthe trade secrets laws, and so\n\n593\n00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,360\nwe see these being focused on protecting\ncertain types of information or\n\n594\n00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,910\nresources again from unauthorized use or\ndisclosure.\n\n595\n00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,280\nReally similar to intellectual\nproperty law, copyright law.\n\n596\n00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,240\nAs we move down copyright law protects the\nrights of an author, somebody who creates\n\n597\n00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,660\nsomething, is gonna be protecting\nthat under a copyright law typically.\n\n598\n00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,570\nAlthough we have trademark and\npatents we'll talk about as well.\n\n599\n00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,010\nBut the idea here is protecting the rights\nof an author to control the public\n\n600\n00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,990\ndistribution, reproduction,\ndisplay, and or\n\n601\n00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,500\nadaptation of their original work,\nand these are important distinctions.\n\n602\n00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,600\nDistributing it, reproducing it,\ndisplaying it, or adapting it in some way,\n\n603\n00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,430\nall of these activities\nare covered by the copyright laws.\n\n604\n00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,970\nSo, they protect the expression\nOf the idea of the resource,\n\n605\n00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,310\ncopyright laws do,\nnot the resource itself.\n\n606\n00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,660\nA very important distinction.\n\n607\n00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,380\nWe wanna protect the resource,\nwe have to get into patent law.\n\n608\n00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,830\nWe'll get to that in a minute, but\n\n609\n00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,960\npatents protect the object as well\nas the other areas around it.\n\n610\n00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,950\nCopyright law is very narrowly defined\non just the expression of that idea.\n\n611\n00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,860\nSo, it's very important as a distinction.\n\n612\n00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,460\nSo copyright protection is granted for\nlife plus 50 years.\n\n613\n00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,770\nAnd there's been a big debate until\na few years back about how we would\n\n614\n00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:25,170\npotentially protect digital media.\n\n615\n00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,380\nThings like computer programs,\nfor instance.\n\n616\n00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,370\nBecause this was a new and\n\n617\n00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:31,860\nemerging area, that when the copyright\nlaws were originally written\n\n618\n00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,330\nreally nobody envisioned, nobody said, oh,\nin 50 years there's gonna be computers and\n\n619\n00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,740\nso we should carve out an exception under\nthe copyright law and protect them.\n\n620\n00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:43,030\nSo we didn't really see digital works\nbeing detailed out on the copyright.\n\n621\n00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,340\nWell and there was some question early\non about how we could protect them and\n\n622\n00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,860\nkinda where they would fall.\n\n623\n00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,340\nSo they've been granted protection\nat least initially anyway,\n\n624\n00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,700\nunder the ID of a literary work.\n\n625\n00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,860\nMaybe not the best category, best fit,\nbut it does offer protection,\n\n626\n00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,330\nthat's what's the most important thing.\n\n627\n00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,150\nSo computer programs\nare protected under copyright\n\n628\n00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,260\nlaws because they are considered\nas literary works.\n\n629\n00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,480\nImportant for\nyou to know as you're preparing and\n\n630\n00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,350\nlooking to answer some questions to know\nthat's how we would work in software and\n\n631\n00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,985\ncomputer programs underneath\nthe copyright laws.\n\n632\n00:30:13,985 --> 00:30:17,945\nOn trademarks, trademarks are used to\nprotect a word, a name, a symbol, a shape,\n\n633\n00:30:17,945 --> 00:30:20,485\na sound, a color, or\nsome combination of these.\n\n634\n00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:24,375\nObvious things like the Nike swoosh and\nthe pattern of the Nike swoosh,\n\n635\n00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:27,250\nthe Just do it logo that goes with it.\n\n636\n00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,580\nThe golden arches of McDonald's.\n\n637\n00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,700\nAmerican Express's trademark a few years\nago, was where do you want to go today?\n\n638\n00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,540\nDon't leave home without it.\n\n639\n00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,600\nRight, don't leave home without it,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n640\n00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,430\n>> Where's the beef?\n\n641\n00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,375\nWhere's the beef?\n\n642\n00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:41,940\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> That's a 1980s one.\n\n643\n00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:46,090\nA lot of people out there might not\nremember that one from Wendy's right?\n\n644\n00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,190\nWhere's the beef?\n\n645\n00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,320\nAll these trademarks are all trademarked\nand as a result are protected.\n\n646\n00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,950\nI want to make sure we know that.\n\n647\n00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,270\nSome key dates and\nthings to remember here.\n\n648\n00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,920\nIn 1883 the Pais Convention is signed.\n\n649\n00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,860\nIt's really the first international accord\n\n650\n00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,930\nthat deals with detailing\nout trademarking.\n\n651\n00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,410\nJust want to make sure we understand that.\n\n652\n00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,090\n1891 was the Madrid Agreement.\n\n653\n00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,270\nKind of followed on the heels about eight\nyears later, another key agreement that\n\n654\n00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:13,290\ndealt with how to deal with trademarks and\nformalize them internationally.\n\n655\n00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:15,340\nCurrently, trademarks\nare overseen by what is known\n\n656\n00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:20,490\nas the World Intellectual Property\nOrganization, known as W-I-P-O, or WIPO.\n\n657\n00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,450\nIt is a United Nations agency,\nand deals with and\n\n658\n00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:27,520\nkind of manages trademarking among\nother intellectual property rights,\n\n659\n00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,540\nand agreements around the world,\nso it is an international body.\n\n660\n00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,432\nLet's deal with, or just let's rather,\nI should say finish up with patents and\n\n661\n00:31:35,432 --> 00:31:38,130\nthen we'll probably be a good place for\nus to take a break here in just a minute.\n\n662\n00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,660\n>> Okay.\n>> So patents are gonna be seen as really\n\n663\n00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,480\nbeing the most encompassing.\n\n664\n00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,590\nThey are typically going to be the most\n\n665\n00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:47,900\nprotective of the intellectual\nproperty that we create.\n\n666\n00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,010\nSo they're giving the individuals or\ncompanies,\n\n667\n00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,320\nto grant them legal ownership over.\n\n668\n00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,629\nLet me try that again.\n\n669\n00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:55,184\n[LAUGH] They're going to be given.\n\n670\n00:31:55,184 --> 00:31:59,044\nI just kind of ran off the rails there,\ngiving individuals or companies to grant\n\n671\n00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:02,516\nthem legal ownership of, and or\nto allow them to have, to enable them.\n\n672\n00:32:02,516 --> 00:32:03,611\nThat's what I was trying to say.\n\n673\n00:32:03,611 --> 00:32:05,750\nTo enable them to exclude\nothers from using or\n\n674\n00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,961\ncopying the invention\ncovered by the patent.\n\n675\n00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:10,200\nSo, a patent is all encompassing.\n\n676\n00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,720\nIf you get a patent on a design of some\nkind you own the rights to that, any use\n\n677\n00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,700\nof that, any knock off of that, any way\nthat it can be potentially implemented or\n\n678\n00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,820\ncopied, you must give permission.\n\n679\n00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,320\nIf you don't, you have a case.\n\n680\n00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,830\nYou actually then can sue for damages.\n\n681\n00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:27,480\nWe've been seeing a lot of this going on\nwith some of the loss that's going back\n\n682\n00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,620\nand forth last year or two between Apple\nand Samsung and some of these other\n\n683\n00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,440\ntech companies where they're on a binge,\nthey're out there buying up patents left\n\n684\n00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,480\nand right to try to get intellectual\nproperty that they now own and maintain.\n\n685\n00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,220\nAnd now they're going out and\n\n686\n00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,190\nsuing other companies around the use\nof that intellectual property right.\n\n687\n00:32:45,190 --> 00:32:47,300\nSo there was a really famous service and\n\n688\n00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,860\nknock down drag out case over the last\ncouple of years, between Samsung and\n\n689\n00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,770\nApple around certain aspects of the design\nof the phone and the interface.\n\n690\n00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,080\nAnd you were mentioning the shape\nof the application icons and\n\n691\n00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,410\nthings like that, the whole interface\naround the iOS versus what,\n\n692\n00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:05,220\nthe Google open source\nthe Android platform is doing.\n\n693\n00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,680\nSo this is some of the stuff\nwe're seeing with patents.\n\n694\n00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,620\nAnd they basically went out and\n\n695\n00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,830\nbought a bunch of patents,\nboth sides did, trying to control\n\n696\n00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:15,180\nthe intellectual property around all\nthese aspects of their their solutions.\n\n697\n00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,140\nKinda interesting.\n\n698\n00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,510\nSo, we say the invention must be novel,\nit must be useful, and\n\n699\n00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,500\nit must not be obvious.\n\n700\n00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,340\nSo, you can't go out and patent something\nsomebody else has created like,\n\n701\n00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,330\nyou know, for instance, a bottle of water.\n\n702\n00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:25,850\nJust like this.\n\n703\n00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,200\nThis is, you know,\nsomething that's been around for a while.\n\n704\n00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,980\nSomebody at some point has\na patent on this thing.\n\n705\n00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,580\nSomebody did create it, right?\n\n706\n00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,290\nBut I can't go out and just say oh, and\ninstead of a white cap I have a black cap.\n\n707\n00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,050\nSo now I wanna patent it because I\ncame up with something new and novel.\n\n708\n00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,380\nWell, no, it's not new and novel.\n\n709\n00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,760\nAnd it's certainly not obvious.\n\n710\n00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,700\nBecause it's pretty obvious, right?\n\n711\n00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,850\nYou just put a cap on there.\n\n712\n00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:48,480\nSo it's gotta be something that is\nunusual, hasn't been done before and\n\n713\n00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,800\nin some way is new compared to\neverything else around it for\n\n714\n00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,790\nyou to be granted a patent.\n\n715\n00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:54,520\nThere's an application process\nyou go through, and a very,\n\n716\n00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,410\nvery rigorous process to deal with that.\n\n717\n00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:59,980\nSo I said the patent is the strongest\nform of intellectual property protection.\n\n718\n00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,820\nPlease make sure you understand that.\n\n719\n00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,700\nAnd it is typically granted for 20 years.\n\n720\n00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,890\nThere are some exceptions there.\n\n721\n00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,040\nIt can be granted for\ndifferent periods of time.\n\n722\n00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,810\nBut typically for 20 years.\n\n723\n00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,870\nSo for instance in biopharma,\nlike when you patent a drug,\n\n724\n00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:16,660\nyou typically get 20 years to sell\nthe drug as a branded name entity, and\n\n725\n00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,110\nthen after 20 years the patent expires and\nruns out.\n\n726\n00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,430\nThen all the generic knock-offs\nstart coming in, and\n\n727\n00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,540\nthen people are making a lot of money,\nand the drug companies, so\n\n728\n00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,675\nthey haven't made their money back by\nthen, are in trouble because now there's\n\n729\n00:34:26,675 --> 00:34:30,920\n25 versions of that same drug for\na tenth of what it may cost.\n\n730\n00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,790\nAll right.\nVery good.\n\n731\n00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,790\nSo we've gone through, I think we've\ncovered all of the different law areas and\n\n732\n00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,970\nthe protections available to us.\n\n733\n00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,870\nWe're gonna come back and\nobviously in some future discussions talk\n\n734\n00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:43,730\nabout a lot of the other areas associated\nwith law, regulatory compliance and\n\n735\n00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,170\ninvestigations within information\nsecurity, but a good starting point,\n\n736\n00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,588\ngood foundation for us to build from.\n\n737\n00:34:48,588 --> 00:34:49,480\n>> I think so.\n\n738\n00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,290\n>> All right, well we're going\nto take a little break then and\n\n739\n00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,890\nwe will be back in just a few, okay?\n\n740\n00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,285\n>> See you in a few.\n\n741\n00:34:55,285 --> 00:35:00,988\n[SOUND] All right,\nwelcome back, everybody,\n\n742\n00:35:00,988 --> 00:35:08,456\nto our legal episode in our CISSP track,\nI guess you call it.\n\n743\n00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:11,510\n>> Sure, sure, dealing with more\nof our legal requirements and\n\n744\n00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,940\ninvestigatory compliance requirements,\nabsolutely.\n\n745\n00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,990\nSo we've been talking a little bit in\nour last discussion just about all\n\n746\n00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:22,040\nthe different types of laws and\nthe ways in which we can approach this.\n\n747\n00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:27,840\nAnd the categories, patent protections,\ntrademarks, things of that nature.\n\n748\n00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,260\nWhat we now want to do is kind of continue\nto drill down, talk to you a little bit\n\n749\n00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,550\nmore about some of the underlying\narchitectural elements and\n\n750\n00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,700\nthen things that go on around that.\n\n751\n00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:41,270\nSo things such as software piracy, and\nsome of the things like due care and\n\n752\n00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:43,210\ndue diligence which we'll get\ninto here in a few minutes,\n\n753\n00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:48,350\nas well as, forensic investigatory\nprocess, chain of custody of evidence,\n\n754\n00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,900\nall the good stuff that goes\non in those kinds of areas.\n\n755\n00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,188\nSo when we talk about software piracy,\nwhat we're talking about is this idea of\n\n756\n00:35:55,188 --> 00:35:59,220\npeople going out and borrowing software,\nmostly likely without the prior\n\n757\n00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,950\nknowledge of and/or the permission of\nthe owner, the person who puts it out.\n\n758\n00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,270\nThis is a fairly widespread,\n\n759\n00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:10,360\nfairly common practice and one that CISSPs\nmay be asked to deal with in the sense of\n\n760\n00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,200\nif there is illegal usage in the business,\nCISSPs may uncover that.\n\n761\n00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,730\nThere should be policies\nassociated with this.\n\n762\n00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,890\nSo we should have a usage policy\nto prevent unlicensed software\n\n763\n00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:20,470\nfrom coming in.\n\n764\n00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,670\nAnd we should make sure that\nwe have controls in place,\n\n765\n00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:28,110\nfiscal controls on our desktops in terms\nof installation of unlicensed software,\n\n766\n00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:31,810\nimaging, baselines and requirements,\nthings of these natures, or\n\n767\n00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:36,770\nthings of this nature rather, will be\nareas that CISSPs bring focus to the table\n\n768\n00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:41,305\naround in terms of bringing their skills\nin, in this particular thought process.\n\n769\n00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:45,535\nSo, software licensing categories, we see\ndifferent kinds of software licensing,\n\n770\n00:36:45,535 --> 00:36:48,030\nfreeware, stuff that's\nbasically given out for free.\n\n771\n00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:48,610\nYou download it.\n\n772\n00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:49,520\nYou use it.\n\n773\n00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,360\nAdobe Acrobat reader, for\ninstance, falls into this category.\n\n774\n00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,080\nIt's free.\n\n775\n00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,680\nFlash player falls into this category.\n\n776\n00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,500\nIt's free.\n\n777\n00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,302\nYou get what you pay for\nI suppose in that respect.\n\n778\n00:36:58,302 --> 00:37:02,999\nShareware, right, so stuff that is shared,\nmade available for a period of time but\n\n779\n00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:07,368\nthen typically there's some sort of fee\nassociated with that after a period of\n\n780\n00:37:07,368 --> 00:37:08,243\ntime as a demo.\n\n781\n00:37:08,243 --> 00:37:10,150\n>> Try it before you buy it.\n\n782\n00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:14,590\n>> Try it before you buy it thing and/or\nyou may get a limited version that has\n\n783\n00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:20,180\nlimited features for free but then if you\nwanna upgrade you have to pay for that.\n\n784\n00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:23,730\nA lot of times apps on the mobile\ndevice platforms today are gonna\n\n785\n00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,460\nfall under this category.\n\n786\n00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:29,240\nSo I know, for instance, you download\ncertain apps, they give you the basics,\n\n787\n00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,500\nso you get a game or\nan app that does certain things, but\n\n788\n00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,890\nif you want to unlock it\nfully you have to pay for it.\n\n789\n00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:37,300\n>> The first few levels and then [SOUND]\n>> Yeah, something like that.\n\n790\n00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,955\nSo my Solitaire app is that way.\n\n791\n00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:43,320\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I can basically play it, but\n\n792\n00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,840\nthe problem is if I want to play it\nwithout unlocking and paying for\n\n793\n00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,030\nit, I have to then put up with all the\nnuisance that comes in every five minutes.\n\n794\n00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,580\nThere's a pop-up message,\nthere's an ad, there's all this.\n\n795\n00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,052\nSo that's all shareware.\n\n796\n00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:53,746\nThat's why I don't play that anymore.\n\n797\n00:37:53,746 --> 00:37:55,131\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> I play Bejeweled Blitz\n\n798\n00:37:55,131 --> 00:37:57,424\ninstead because it's free and\nI don't have to worry about it, right.\n\n799\n00:37:57,424 --> 00:38:01,653\nSo commercial software, this is going to\nbe software that you buy, you license,\n\n800\n00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:03,325\nand you basically pay a fee for.\n\n801\n00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:06,932\nI'll see [INAUDIBLE] think about\nthe common standard software that you may\n\n802\n00:38:06,932 --> 00:38:10,072\nuse in business today,\nMicrosoft Office, Adobe Acrobat Pro,\n\n803\n00:38:10,072 --> 00:38:13,853\nany of the Adobe commercial suites,\nanything like those programs, right,\n\n804\n00:38:13,853 --> 00:38:16,024\nExchange Share Point, whatever it may be.\n\n805\n00:38:16,024 --> 00:38:20,479\nAcademic softwares, is basically gonna\nbe commercial software but retooled for\n\n806\n00:38:20,479 --> 00:38:24,300\nthe academic market, so typically\nwe have a lower price point there.\n\n807\n00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,860\nPeople get discounts for it.\n\n808\n00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,390\nThey may have certain features\nthat are not available.\n\n809\n00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:32,090\nCertain offerings that are really\nonly created for the academic market.\n\n810\n00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,360\nBut in general it's basically\nsoftware you paid for, but\n\n811\n00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,030\nyou have to be in a special\ncategory to get it.\n\n812\n00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,100\nYou have to be a student, and\nit's really geared around productivity for\n\n813\n00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,520\nthe students at that particular price.\n\n814\n00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,100\nOne of the things I often missed\nabout being in college was\n\n815\n00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:47,130\nto go to get that academic discount and\nget that software.\n\n816\n00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,310\nSo that was actually kind of neat.\n\n817\n00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,880\n>> And in the end,\ndon't you think there, I mean,\n\n818\n00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,200\nthey knew what they were doing, right?\n\n819\n00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,290\nThey were gonna get you to use that.\n\n820\n00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,290\n>> They get you hooked.\n\n821\n00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,640\n>> Yeah, you pay five bucks for Office\nwhen you're in college and then that's\n\n822\n00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,840\nthat's the productivity suite you want\nto use for the rest of your life, so.\n\n823\n00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,130\n>> That's why Lotus went like this and\nMicrosoft went like this,\n\n824\n00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,740\nright off the cliff right.\n\n825\n00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,170\nRemember Lotus is a productivity suite,\nLotus 1-2-3.\n\n826\n00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,470\n>> Yeah.\n\n827\n00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,390\n>> Most prevalent spreadsheet and\nproductivity platform at the time.\n\n828\n00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,740\n>> Yeah.\n>> They had the thing.\n\n829\n00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:18,470\nI mean way before Excel ever came out,\nwas Lotus 1-2-3, and of course,\n\n830\n00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:21,407\nwhere is Lotus 1-2-3 today?\n\n831\n00:39:21,407 --> 00:39:21,967\n>> Gone.\n\n832\n00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:22,810\n>> Yeah, long gone.\n\n833\n00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,360\nIt's more like Locus 99,\n101 in stil counting.\n\n834\n00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,195\nSo, long gone.\n\n835\n00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:28,820\nAll right.\nSo then we also have this idea of what's\n\n836\n00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,810\ncalled the Digital\nMillennium Copyright Act,\n\n837\n00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,800\njust one of these areas I\nwanna make you aware of.\n\n838\n00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,463\nI would not focus my attention too\nheavily on this one particular piece\n\n839\n00:39:37,463 --> 00:39:42,363\nof information as I was preparing to\ngo out and conquer the CISSP exam, but\n\n840\n00:39:42,363 --> 00:39:44,590\nI would be aware of it in context.\n\n841\n00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,418\nWhat I mean by that is, that it's what\nthe Digital Millennium Copyright Act,\n\n842\n00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:52,072\nis what in the United States in particular\nreally focused on the US market,\n\n843\n00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:55,801\nmade it illegal to create products\nthat circumvent copyright protection.\n\n844\n00:39:55,801 --> 00:39:57,961\nIn English,\nit made it illegal to pirate software.\n\n845\n00:39:57,961 --> 00:39:58,622\n>> Right, yeah.\n\n846\n00:39:58,622 --> 00:39:59,401\n>> That's what it did.\n\n847\n00:39:59,401 --> 00:40:03,161\nSo, if you went to jail,\nbecause you pirated software.\n\n848\n00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:06,620\nIt's because you violated\nthe Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\n\n849\n00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,170\nSo you want to be aware of it,\nbecause again,\n\n850\n00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,618\nsome of these things are not just about,\nhey, how do I prepare for the exam?\n\n851\n00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:15,920\nThis knowledge in particular you know,\nfor somebody who's finding themselves in\n\n852\n00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,700\nthe role of CISSP advising the business,\nbeing the voice of reason.\n\n853\n00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,460\nThe best practice articulation you know,\n\n854\n00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,620\nthat we have to bring to bear\nhere around these discussions.\n\n855\n00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,890\nAnd most importantly, kind of being seen\nas that authoritative voice on security,\n\n856\n00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,860\nyou want to be aware of\nthese kinds of things.\n\n857\n00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:35,230\nBecause you have to advise the business\nabout the fact that there might be legal\n\n858\n00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:39,100\nliability ramifications,\nif you're found using unlicensed software.\n\n859\n00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,180\nRight, because you could\nbe held as the business.\n\n860\n00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,150\nAnd you individually, as the practitioner,\ncould theoretically be held liable for\n\n861\n00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,770\nviolating the Digital\nMillennium Copyright Act.\n\n862\n00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,380\n>> Absolutely\n>> In which case you could face a fee,\n\n863\n00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,950\na penalty, and, or go to jail, or both.\n\n864\n00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,000\nIn order to validate the fact that\nyou caused wrong to somebody.\n\n865\n00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,799\nAnd you have to the remunerate them,\ngive them some sort of financial you know,\n\n866\n00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:00,100\ngive back as we say.\n\n867\n00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,080\n>> Sometimes the bosses really want to\ncut the cord, and save a little money.\n\n868\n00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,838\nAnd you've got to be the one\nthat convinces them [CROSSTALK]\n\n869\n00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:06,926\n>> Listen there's always that\n\n870\n00:41:06,926 --> 00:41:07,880\nopportunity in theory.\n\n871\n00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:12,150\nAlways an opportunity to go out and\ndo that and you know, let's be clear.\n\n872\n00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:15,500\nAbsolute wrong, 100%,\nnot acceptable, should not happen.\n\n873\n00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,070\nBut then there's the reality\nof the situation.\n\n874\n00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:20,790\nWhere we say, although it shouldn't\nhappen, things do happen, right?\n\n875\n00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:24,970\nAnd so then we get down to the idea well,\nif we uncover it, what are we going to do?\n\n876\n00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,540\nVersus never should have\nhappened in the first place.\n\n877\n00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:32,060\nIt's your job acting ethically as CISSP\nto report this kind of behavior and\n\n878\n00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,200\nto put a stop to it.\n\n879\n00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,820\nJust to be clear.\n\n880\n00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,940\nSo, you wanna make sure you understand\nthat and you're aware of that.\n\n881\n00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,640\nAll right, having said that P2, as in\nPlaystation 2, which is really supposed to\n\n882\n00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,340\nbe Pi, but we couldn't think of\na good way to represent that.\n\n883\n00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,300\nIt is written as P and\ntwo Roman Numerals, to capital I's so PII.\n\n884\n00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,440\nSo this represents personally\nidentifiable information.\n\n885\n00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,990\nThis idea of information that is\nuniquely attributed to an individual\n\n886\n00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,810\nthat is typically going to be aggregated,\ncollected by a lot of companies.\n\n887\n00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,490\nBut then has to be kept secret.\n\n888\n00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:05,320\nAnd confidentiality and integrity, both\nhave to be applied to it in data bases.\n\n889\n00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,160\nSo yeah, when we think of things like\nTarget breech that happened here in the US\n\n890\n00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,760\nwithin the last several months.\n\n891\n00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,320\nWe think this idea of the information\nthat would have been exposed for\n\n892\n00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,770\nindividual account holders.\n\n893\n00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:19,030\nThat would have been PII information,\npersonally identifiable information.\n\n894\n00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:21,260\nWhere we then have issues\nlike account number,\n\n895\n00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,255\nsocial security numbers,\nbirthdays, security identifiers.\n\n896\n00:42:25,255 --> 00:42:26,935\nThings like mother's maiden name-\n>> Right.\n\n897\n00:42:26,935 --> 00:42:28,115\n>> Addresses.\n\n898\n00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:30,355\nThis stuff could've\npotentially been exposed.\n\n899\n00:42:30,355 --> 00:42:33,715\nAnd this is the kind of stuff that has to\nbe safe guarded when we talk about PII.\n\n900\n00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:37,715\nSo, it's a category of information that\nwe have to apply security controls to.\n\n901\n00:42:37,715 --> 00:42:40,695\nJust wanna make you aware of them,\nmake sure you understand the idea.\n\n902\n00:42:40,695 --> 00:42:43,195\nYou may or\nmay not have heard this term before, but\n\n903\n00:42:43,195 --> 00:42:45,480\nit is used pretty frequently today.\n\n904\n00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:49,030\nEspecially given the unfortunate\nnature and the timing of the fact,\n\n905\n00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,720\nwe keep seeing breaches happening.\n\n906\n00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,460\nAlmost weekly,\nin the news somewhere in the world.\n\n907\n00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,850\nIt's not just a US phenomenon by the way.\n\n908\n00:42:55,850 --> 00:43:00,680\nBut somewhere in the world regarding\nthis exact thing, the exposure of PII.\n\n909\n00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,360\nSo when you here about those kind of\nissues, be thinking about those things.\n\n910\n00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,240\nBasel two, which is an international\ncourt around financial services,\n\n911\n00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,570\nmanagement of financial services,\nhealth and safeguarding of financial\n\n912\n00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,870\ninstitutions, wanted just to have\na little bit of awareness here.\n\n913\n00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:19,160\nIt's really focused on determining\nthe actual exposure to risk\n\n914\n00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,100\nof the financial institutions\nthat are part of the accord.\n\n915\n00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,780\nAnd so, there's three sub-categories,\n\n916\n00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,120\nareas specifically that Basel\nreally attempts to deal with.\n\n917\n00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,330\nAnd so we want to make sure\nwe're comfortable with this.\n\n918\n00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:31,430\nWe have minimum capital requirements,\n\n919\n00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,550\nmeaning you have to have certain amount\nof money on account at all times.\n\n920\n00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:37,080\nAnd have to prove that you\nhave those assets liquid.\n\n921\n00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,020\nYou can effectively use them if necessary.\n\n922\n00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:43,485\nThere has to be supervision oversight\nof the institution through third party,\n\n923\n00:43:43,485 --> 00:43:46,130\nnon-biased regulatory bodies.\n\n924\n00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:48,530\nSo there has to be this way\nto be able to go in and\n\n925\n00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,560\nkeep track of what's going on there.\n\n926\n00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,900\nSo you have things like\nbank auditing you know, and\n\n927\n00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,680\nimpartial third party institutions\nthat keep track of this stuff.\n\n928\n00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,700\nYou can't self regulate.\n\n929\n00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,860\nYou can't self police as a bank for\ninstance.\n\n930\n00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,560\nAnd then market discipline,\nyou have to follow the market conditions.\n\n931\n00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,830\nDo smart things, don't do stupid things.\n\n932\n00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,450\nPay attention to what's going on.\n\n933\n00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:11,931\nThe fact that we didn't really enforce\nproperly a lot of the provisions of Bazel\n\n934\n00:44:11,931 --> 00:44:17,220\n2 on the financial services sector\nin the United States back in 2008,\n\n935\n00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:20,610\nwhen the meltdown happened that really\nled to the global economic crisis\n\n936\n00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,632\nof the last several years\nis one of the key things.\n\n937\n00:44:23,632 --> 00:44:28,341\nBecause had Bazel 2\nreally been thoughtfully,\n\n938\n00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:32,341\nyou know, apply the procedures and\nthe requirements of Bazel 2.\n\n939\n00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:33,940\nHad they been thoughtfully applied and\n\n940\n00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:38,080\nreally applied even handedly across\nthe financial services industries,\n\n941\n00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,940\nwe would have seen that these\ncapital requirements, this need for\n\n942\n00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:45,820\nsupervision would really have put a stop\nto this bad loan cycle that we were in,\n\n943\n00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,810\nwith these garbage junk bonds,\ngarbage mortgages.\n\n944\n00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:52,270\nAnd we would have seen very early on that\na lot of this was just smoke and mirrors.\n\n945\n00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:56,080\nSome paper that was bad was being\npushed from me to you and back again.\n\n946\n00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,460\nWe kept repackaging and saying oh my God,\nlook at how good this is,\n\n947\n00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,990\nhow much more valuable it is.\n\n948\n00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,220\nAnd it was just really a bunch of garbage.\n\n949\n00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,560\nRight, that's what we call toxic assets.\n\n950\n00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,260\nAnd so had we really been\nfocused on this kind of stuff,\n\n951\n00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,450\nwe could have actually potentially\nseen an ability to divert the crisis.\n\n952\n00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:13,930\nBut, because we weren't in certain\nmarkets for certain reasons.\n\n953\n00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,440\nWe were not paying attention\nto these things, you know?\n\n954\n00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:17,660\nThis is obviously you know,\n\n955\n00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:21,900\nled to several years of economic you know,\nunstable economic markets.\n\n956\n00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,960\nAnd just in general,\neconomic malaise throughout the world.\n\n957\n00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,790\nSo you just want to be aware of that.\n\n958\n00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,460\nSo you know, sometimes that butterfly\neffect that we sometimes hear about or\n\n959\n00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,100\ntalk about right?\n\n960\n00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:33,890\nWhere one thing happening in one area can\nhave unintended consequences in a lot\n\n961\n00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:34,600\nof other areas.\n\n962\n00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,090\nIt's very important to think about.\n\n963\n00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:39,100\n>> It's the sound of one hand\nclapping in the forest, grasshopper.\n\n964\n00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,835\n>> [CROSSTALK] All right, so\ndue care versus due diligence.\n\n965\n00:45:41,835 --> 00:45:43,290\nLet's talk about these terms.\n\n966\n00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,670\nVery important here.\n\n967\n00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,720\nYou have the formal\ndefinitions of due care and\n\n968\n00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:48,530\ndue diligence kind of up above here.\n\n969\n00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,670\nThen, my definitions\njust summarizing them,\n\n970\n00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:54,020\ngetting them down into some very\neasy speak down below there for you.\n\n971\n00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:56,140\nBut the idea is the due diligence and\ndue care.\n\n972\n00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,580\nSo due care means that a company\ndid all it could reasonably do.\n\n973\n00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,890\nActed reasonably, responsibly,\nethically to prevent security breaches.\n\n974\n00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,840\nAnd if a security breach\ndid indeed take place,\n\n975\n00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,960\nthey have steps in place\nto mitigate the damage.\n\n976\n00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,850\nRight?\nSo in other words, strip that down,\n\n977\n00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,800\nwhat does it really mean\nin a couple of words?\n\n978\n00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,120\nAct responsibly, right?\n\n979\n00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:17,450\nMake sure the company's focused on\ndoing all the things they've got to do.\n\n980\n00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,865\nTaking all the steps,\nbeing there when they need to.\n\n981\n00:46:19,865 --> 00:46:22,405\nAttention to detail so,\nthat way they act responsibly.\n\n982\n00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,045\nThat's what due care is all about.\n\n983\n00:46:24,045 --> 00:46:26,585\nDue diligence means\nthe company investigated and\n\n984\n00:46:26,585 --> 00:46:30,495\nproperly identified all possible\nvulnerabilities and weaknesses.\n\n985\n00:46:30,495 --> 00:46:32,500\nSo, in other words,\nwhat do we really mean there?\n\n986\n00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,740\nHave as much information as possible\nto make the best decisions,\n\n987\n00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,120\nis what due diligence is all about.\n\n988\n00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,790\nSo if you hire new people,\nyou don't do background checks on them?\n\n989\n00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:43,280\nWe say,\nyou're not exercising due diligence.\n\n990\n00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,220\nIf you act irresponsibly, so\n\n991\n00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:50,280\nyou allow people that are not trained as\nhealthcare providers to provide health\n\n992\n00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,510\ncare services to individuals,\nyou're not acting with due care, right?\n\n993\n00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,040\nSo, think about those ideas,\nbut act responsibly.\n\n994\n00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,460\nMake sure you have as much information\nas is realistically possible,\n\n995\n00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,220\nto make the best possible decisions.\n\n996\n00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,790\nActing with due diligence,\nthese two terms together,\n\n997\n00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:06,520\nindividually and together,\nare brought up all the time\n\n998\n00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,950\nin law cases where we try to\nassign responsibility and blame.\n\n999\n00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:11,140\nSo if we're talking about fault.\n\n1000\n00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,830\nAnd we're talking about maybe\nthe monetary value of that fault,\n\n1001\n00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:16,240\nwe're going to ask questions\naround due care and due diligence.\n\n1002\n00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,400\nDid you act responsibly?\n\n1003\n00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,710\nDid you have as much\ninformation as you should?\n\n1004\n00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:23,040\nDid you use that information in\na responsible way to make good decisions?\n\n1005\n00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,630\nAnd if companies are found\nto act without due care or\n\n1006\n00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,245\ndue diligence,\nthey are typically found to be liable.\n\n1007\n00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:29,825\nSomething is wrong.\n\n1008\n00:47:29,825 --> 00:47:33,935\nSo I want to make sure that you are aware\nof this and you understand this as well.\n\n1009\n00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,315\nHaving to take that\ndown to the next level,\n\n1010\n00:47:35,315 --> 00:47:37,035\nI just mentioned responsibility and\naccountability.\n\n1011\n00:47:37,035 --> 00:47:39,900\nSo probably a good idea I\nthought to define those terms.\n\n1012\n00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,510\nResponsibility is really\nthis idea of obligations and\n\n1013\n00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:45,320\nexpected actions of a particular party.\n\n1014\n00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,768\nAnd then accountability is really this\nidea of the ability to hold a party\n\n1015\n00:47:48,768 --> 00:47:50,476\nresponsible for certain actions.\n\n1016\n00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:53,371\nSo, we often think of accountability and\nresponsibility,\n\n1017\n00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:56,222\nat least I often think of it,\nin relation to the following.\n\n1018\n00:47:56,222 --> 00:48:00,155\nI think of management versus\nownership of something.\n\n1019\n00:48:00,155 --> 00:48:02,871\nWhen I think of ownership,\nan owner of something,\n\n1020\n00:48:02,871 --> 00:48:05,155\nI think of the owner as being accountable.\n\n1021\n00:48:05,155 --> 00:48:08,740\nBecause they are going to be at\nthe end of the day the person,\n\n1022\n00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:12,401\nthe voice of reason that bears\nultimate accountability, so\n\n1023\n00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:15,970\nbasically ultimately is\ngoing to own that solution.\n\n1024\n00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,550\nI think of management or\nmanaging something\n\n1025\n00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:23,200\nas being given responsibility to execute\non something by the accountable party.\n\n1026\n00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,280\nSo I think of accountability\nexisting at an ownership level.\n\n1027\n00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,270\nAnd I think of responsibility\nbeing given to me by the owner.\n\n1028\n00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,880\nAnd then I am managing,\nI'm executing on, that obligation or\n\n1029\n00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,970\nthat accepted responsibility based\non the delegation from the owner.\n\n1030\n00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:40,540\nSo if you want to perhaps think of it\nthat way, I don't know if that helps.\n\n1031\n00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:45,310\nIf that works for you but I typically see\naccountability associated with ownership.\n\n1032\n00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:48,380\nI see responsibility\nassociated with management.\n\n1033\n00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,630\nSo that's how at least I\nwould think about that and\n\n1034\n00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,540\nperhaps it does or\ndoes not make sense for you.\n\n1035\n00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,490\nSo just think about that.\n\n1036\n00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,920\nBy the way ITIL as a framework\nhappens to view those the same way,\n\n1037\n00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,670\nso you have a point of reference there.\n\n1038\n00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,870\nWe tend to talk about accountability and\n\n1039\n00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,850\nresponsibility the same\nway in the ITIL framework.\n\n1040\n00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,460\nProximate cause,\n\n1041\n00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,300\nagain just some vocabulary terminology\nI want to throw out to you here.\n\n1042\n00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,290\nProximate cause, an act or\nomission that produces a consequence.\n\n1043\n00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:16,360\nSo when we talk about legal terms,\ntalk about a law case again, or\n\n1044\n00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,480\nsomething like that.\n\n1045\n00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,860\nTalk about proximate cause.\n\n1046\n00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:22,140\nWe're talking about something you do or\nsomething you don't do.\n\n1047\n00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,590\nAn omission is something you don't do or\ndon't say that you did when you did,\n\n1048\n00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:26,540\nthat kind of thing.\n\n1049\n00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:29,770\nSo I didn't really lie, I just didn't tell\nyou the truth is what you often hear.\n\n1050\n00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,940\nI just completely forgot to tell you.\n\n1051\n00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,580\nRight that I did that.\n\n1052\n00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,220\nThat's an admission,\nin case you were wondering, right?\n\n1053\n00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:38,830\nIn case you're planning on using\nthat defense at some point later.\n\n1054\n00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,680\n>> It's not going to work\nis what you're telling me.\n\n1055\n00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,450\n>> No it's not going to work.\n\n1056\n00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:43,320\nSo an act or an omission, right, and\n\n1057\n00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:46,950\nact or an omission is what we're\ntalking about and that act or omission.\n\n1058\n00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,510\nIs something that we have\nto really think about,\n\n1059\n00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:51,490\nbecause that act of omission\nproduces a consequence.\n\n1060\n00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:53,920\nAnd so if it produces a consequence,\n\n1061\n00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,380\ntypically thinking of\na consequence being negative.\n\n1062\n00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,100\nWe don't say, oh we had good\nconsequences that came out of that.\n\n1063\n00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,180\nTypically say that has\nnegative consequences, right?\n\n1064\n00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:05,938\nSo proximate cause, an act or\nomission reduces a consequence, typically\n\n1065\n00:50:05,938 --> 00:50:10,288\nremember negative there and so we just\nthink about that and we define that term.\n\n1066\n00:50:10,288 --> 00:50:12,590\nIn relation of things that\ncould be done or are done, or\n\n1067\n00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:17,185\nperhaps are not done and the negative\noutcome as a result of a negative outcome.\n\n1068\n00:50:17,185 --> 00:50:21,555\nWhat we think of there is that, in a case\nof law, for instance, a case of law,\n\n1069\n00:50:21,555 --> 00:50:26,035\nin a case that involves the law where we\nare before a judge, before a jury, right?\n\n1070\n00:50:26,035 --> 00:50:27,655\nSo, we're trying to explain what happened.\n\n1071\n00:50:27,655 --> 00:50:31,115\nWe're taught this idea of proximate cause\nbecause if somebody takes an action over\n\n1072\n00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:34,975\nhere and that then somehow impacts\nthe trajectory of something, and\n\n1073\n00:50:34,975 --> 00:50:37,545\nwe're then talking about that,\nthat's the connection we make.\n\n1074\n00:50:37,545 --> 00:50:40,130\nThat's what proximate cause is.\n\n1075\n00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:43,320\nNow when we talk about these things,\nresponsibility, accountability.\n\n1076\n00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:45,600\nRight, we talk about this idea.\n\n1077\n00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,610\nExcuse me.\nThese ideas of approximate cause,\n\n1078\n00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:48,970\ndue care, due diligence.\n\n1079\n00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:50,880\nWe wrap all that up,\nwe put it all together.\n\n1080\n00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,250\nWe bring it all back.\n\n1081\n00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:56,460\nKind of wrap it up, and then put it\ninto the system that we're building and\n\n1082\n00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,940\nwe use that in relation to something\ncalled incident management.\n\n1083\n00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:03,060\nAnd so, this idea of now taking\nthese ideas, taking these terms.\n\n1084\n00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,760\nTaking the outcome, the output of\nthese processes we're describing and\n\n1085\n00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:10,090\nrelating them to how we manage incidents\nis what we want to spend a few minutes\n\n1086\n00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:11,310\ntalking about next.\n\n1087\n00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:14,890\nAnd so starting with the definition of\nwhat incident management is, the idea\n\n1088\n00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:18,980\nhere is this idea of a primary goal,\nreally focused on an incident management.\n\n1089\n00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,760\nThe idea of containing and\nmitigating, right?\n\n1090\n00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,380\nRemember mitigating,\njust a fancy term for minimizing,\n\n1091\n00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,020\njust want to contain and minimize.\n\n1092\n00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:28,840\nAny damage caused by an incident\nand/or to prevent any further damage.\n\n1093\n00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,390\nSo, duality here, dual goal.\n\n1094\n00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:36,140\nStop the initial incident from causing\nharm, and then make sure we don't repeat\n\n1095\n00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,080\nthat over time by fixing it and\nmaking sure it doesn't happen again.\n\n1096\n00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,960\nIt's that old saying, fool me once,\nshame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.\n\n1097\n00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:44,580\nRight.\n\n1098\n00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:48,280\nAnd so, we want to make sure with incident\nmanagement, that we're not being blamed\n\n1099\n00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,140\nfor something time and time again,\nbecause we propagate it.\n\n1100\n00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:54,940\nWe allow it to go forward, cuz we don't\nfind the root cause, we don't prevent it\n\n1101\n00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,560\nby actually stopping it and\nfixing it the right way the first time.\n\n1102\n00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:00,270\nWant to make sure we understand\nthat as the dual goal there.\n\n1103\n00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:02,250\nIncident handling should\nbe closely linked.\n\n1104\n00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,350\nClosely I believe is spelled with an e.\n\n1105\n00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,500\n>> That's an e in there I believe.\n>> At least the last time I checked.\n\n1106\n00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,790\nI think that was the case.\n\n1107\n00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:10,604\nSo we'll correct that in real time.\n\n1108\n00:52:10,604 --> 00:52:13,795\n[INAUDIBLE] I should have\nspecified where closely.\n\n1109\n00:52:13,795 --> 00:52:15,214\n[CROSSTALK] is spelled with an e.\n\n1110\n00:52:15,214 --> 00:52:17,770\nSo, you can see real time\nspell checking going on here.\n\n1111\n00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:18,270\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1112\n00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,221\n>> All right.\nSo much for\n\n1113\n00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:21,777\nthat idea of getting Dragon Speak and\n\n1114\n00:52:21,777 --> 00:52:23,793\nhaving that whole thing happening for\nus here.\n\n1115\n00:52:23,793 --> 00:52:26,315\nWe have Mike speak, and Mike type instead.\n\n1116\n00:52:26,315 --> 00:52:27,055\n>> It doesn't do nearly\nas well [CROSSTALK]\n\n1117\n00:52:27,055 --> 00:52:27,890\n>> No, version 1.0.\n\n1118\n00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:30,030\nWe need a firmware upgrade on that.\n\n1119\n00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:30,670\n>> Working on that.\n\n1120\n00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:32,430\n>> So incident handling should be closely,\nright?\n\n1121\n00:52:32,430 --> 00:52:35,300\nClosely liked to security training and\nawareness.\n\n1122\n00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,200\nMeaning the idea here,\nis also to make you stop and\n\n1123\n00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,310\nthink about the fact, that as a CISSP,\nif you're out there and\n\n1124\n00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:43,730\nultimately are gonna to become one,\nyou're going to be successful on the exam,\n\n1125\n00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,800\nyou're going to go through\nall of our conversations,\n\n1126\n00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,690\ngo through the entire program, and\nyou're going to pass the exam.\n\n1127\n00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:53,030\nSo when you do, when you go out and you\nbecome a CISSP, one of the things you're\n\n1128\n00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:55,590\ngoing to be asked to do is deal with\nincident management and some handling.\n\n1129\n00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:58,210\nAnd so as a result of that,\nwhat has to happen is,\n\n1130\n00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:00,060\nwe talk about this a lot in other areas.\n\n1131\n00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,690\nWe have this constant idea,\n\n1132\n00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:05,370\nthis constant drum beat behind the scenes\nabout having to create security training\n\n1133\n00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:08,880\nprograms, security awareness for\neverybody in the organization, right?\n\n1134\n00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,550\nNot just senior managers.\n\n1135\n00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:15,090\nNot just individuals, not just the team,\nthe IT team, but everybody.\n\n1136\n00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,290\nEverybody has to have awareness and\ntraining.\n\n1137\n00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:19,740\nA lot of companies implement\nthis on a yearly basis.\n\n1138\n00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,610\nIt's one of those, oh my God,\n\n1139\n00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:25,810\nwe've got to go through the video,\nwatch it again, put the check mark.\n\n1140\n00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:26,338\n>> It's that time of the year again.\n\n1141\n00:53:26,338 --> 00:53:28,080\n>> It's that time of the year.\nPut the check mark in the box,\n\n1142\n00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,560\nHR says we've got to do it.\n\n1143\n00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,420\nThat's kind of what you hear about it, and\n\n1144\n00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,540\nunfortunately that's really not the right\nattitude, that's not the right approach.\n\n1145\n00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,130\nRight?\nBecause while that is propagating\n\n1146\n00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:41,390\nthe knowledge, people take it about as\nseriously as you heard me describe it.\n\n1147\n00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:44,280\nIt's a pain, it's an imposition,\nthey don't really pay attention to it.\n\n1148\n00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,180\nAnd they know they got to do it,\nbut it's kind of dull and boring.\n\n1149\n00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,430\nSo I'm not suggesting we\ncreate the Cirque du Soleil.\n\n1150\n00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:50,590\nInteractive security.\n\n1151\n00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:52,300\nAwareness training phenomenon.\n\n1152\n00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,010\nWhat I am suggesting,\nwe're a captivating theater.\n\n1153\n00:53:55,010 --> 00:54:01,360\nWhat I am suggesting though is that as a\nCISSP, it's one of your responsibilities.\n\n1154\n00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,540\nAs a practicing security professional\nyou have to be focused on this idea\n\n1155\n00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,630\nof creating security awareness and\n\n1156\n00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:12,110\ntraining that links to these key core\nconcepts like incident handling.\n\n1157\n00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:14,740\nWhat does everybody in\nthe organization need to be aware of?\n\n1158\n00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,410\nThey don't have to be trained in handlers.\n\n1159\n00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:18,120\nRight?\nThey don't have to be\n\n1160\n00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,880\ntrained in such a way, that when they\nshow up, they put on the gloves.\n\n1161\n00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,022\nThe CSI music plays in the background.\n\n1162\n00:54:24,022 --> 00:54:24,595\n>> [LAUGH].\n\n1163\n00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:28,330\n>> .All the cool technology pops up and\nthey solve the case.\n\n1164\n00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:29,250\nThat's not what it's about.\n\n1165\n00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:33,620\nBut what they have to be trained on at\na base, for a baseline response is,\n\n1166\n00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:37,770\nif you walk into a situation, something\ndoesn't look right, something's not\n\n1167\n00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:41,920\nthe way it should be, don't go over and\ntouch a whole bunch of stuff.\n\n1168\n00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,000\nStop, don't touch anything.\n\n1169\n00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,580\nCall somebody,\nwhoever that somebody is, and\n\n1170\n00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,310\nby the way, that's part of the training.\n\n1171\n00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:50,390\nWho do you call, right?\n\n1172\n00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:51,035\nWho do you call?\n\n1173\n00:54:51,035 --> 00:54:52,180\nNot Ghostbusters.\n\n1174\n00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:53,000\nWho do you call?\n\n1175\n00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,780\nNot Scooby-Doo.\n\n1176\n00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,150\nWho do you call?\n\n1177\n00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:55,970\nYou gotta call somebody.\n\n1178\n00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:58,210\nSo maybe it is the incident\nresponse manager.\n\n1179\n00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:01,828\nMaybe it's the IT response line.\n\n1180\n00:55:01,828 --> 00:55:02,910\nMaybe it's the help line.\n\n1181\n00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:05,370\nMaybe you just go down the hall and\nknock on someone's door, and say listen,\n\n1182\n00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:08,410\nI don't really know who I'm supposed\nto talk to, I'm new here but.\n\n1183\n00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:10,160\nI know that when I walk into the room and\n\n1184\n00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,000\nthere's smoke coming out of the server\ncabinet that's probably a bad thing.\n\n1185\n00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,980\nAnd so I saw that.\n\n1186\n00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,220\nSo I'm not sure who to tell.\n\n1187\n00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,630\nI thought I'd start with you.\n\n1188\n00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:19,090\nMaybe you can tell me who to tell.\n\n1189\n00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:19,780\nRight?\n\n1190\n00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,830\nAnd so whatever it is,\nright, common sense.\n\n1191\n00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,510\nTrain people, make them aware.\n\n1192\n00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:27,600\nThey got to know not to go over.\n\n1193\n00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,475\nAnd listen,\nbad example on my part because yes,\n\n1194\n00:55:29,475 --> 00:55:32,980\nif you see smoke coming\nout of the server cabinet,\n\n1195\n00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:36,280\nyou probably want to make sure you put\nthe fire out before you get somebody.\n\n1196\n00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,060\nThat's probably important, or\nat least make sure you don't endanger\n\n1197\n00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,230\nanybody's life when you\ngo to get somebody.\n\n1198\n00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,623\nBut, my point is that whatever it is,\nif you come in and\n\n1199\n00:55:43,623 --> 00:55:46,967\nfind an office all upside down,\nit looks like somebody tore through there.\n\n1200\n00:55:46,967 --> 00:55:48,626\n>> Hard drives have been\nyanked out of the server.\n\n1201\n00:55:48,626 --> 00:55:49,568\n>> All sorts of stuff.\n\n1202\n00:55:49,568 --> 00:55:53,048\nDon't touch anything, you are not\ngonna do any good By going over and\n\n1203\n00:55:53,048 --> 00:55:54,908\nplaying Inspector Gadget, right?\n\n1204\n00:55:54,908 --> 00:55:56,429\nAll you're going to do\nis make things worse.\n\n1205\n00:55:56,429 --> 00:55:59,150\nSo instead,\ngo get the trained professionals.\n\n1206\n00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,680\nMaybe there's a security guard.\n\n1207\n00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,540\nMaybe there's some sort\nof security function.\n\n1208\n00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:03,350\nGo get them.\n\n1209\n00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,350\nLet them do their job.\n\n1210\n00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:06,830\nThey're trained,\nthat's what they're suppose to do.\n\n1211\n00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,300\nYou're just supposed to report it and\nthen get out of the way.\n\n1212\n00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,360\nAnd so this is really what being\na CISSP is about in this area.\n\n1213\n00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,450\nIt's focusing us and everybody on\nthe idea that incident handling\n\n1214\n00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:20,370\nhas to be something we train around to\nmake people aware of what they should, and\n\n1215\n00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:23,210\nmost importantly,\nshould not do in a situation.\n\n1216\n00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:27,180\nI've been involved in a lot of\ninvestigations where people have come in,\n\n1217\n00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,790\nfound things, but\nunfortunately they got curious.\n\n1218\n00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:33,630\nSo they get curious, they go in there,\nthey play around, and then they realize,\n\n1219\n00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:35,020\noh my God, this really is bad.\n\n1220\n00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,830\nI shouldn't be involved in this.\n\n1221\n00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:39,230\nThey go get somebody, but\nyou know now you've touched something,\n\n1222\n00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,630\nyour fingerprints are all over the place.\n\n1223\n00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,670\n>> Last modified dates have changed.\n\n1224\n00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:43,663\n>> Right all that stuff's changed.\n\n1225\n00:56:43,663 --> 00:56:47,470\nYou may have executed malware or\nsome sort of bot on that machine that's\n\n1226\n00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:51,140\na self-defense mechanism, left by\nthe people that created the attack.\n\n1227\n00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,910\nAnd so now basically it's booby trapped.\n\n1228\n00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,430\nAnd you may have set off the booby trap or\nat least armed it.\n\n1229\n00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:57,240\nAnd now as a forensic examiner,\n\n1230\n00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,890\nwe're gonna have a really tough time\ngetting data out of that machine.\n\n1231\n00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,180\nBecause by the time we get into it,\n\n1232\n00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:04,270\nyou may have inadvertently set it up in\nsuch way that it wipes everything out.\n\n1233\n00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:05,460\n>> Yeah.\n>> Or even worse.\n\n1234\n00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:06,740\nRight.\n\n1235\n00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,854\nOh my god, right, so\nthis crazy thing happened on the machine!\n\n1236\n00:57:08,854 --> 00:57:09,398\nWhat should I do?\n\n1237\n00:57:09,398 --> 00:57:12,267\nPower it, turn the power plug off.\n\n1238\n00:57:12,267 --> 00:57:13,050\nPower it off, no.\n\n1239\n00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,079\nNo, we're going to talk about why, right?\n\n1240\n00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:18,240\nBut that's probably the worst\nthing you can do, actually.\n\n1241\n00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,830\nIf you have to do something,\nin all honesty, right?\n\n1242\n00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:22,930\nPull the network cable out\nof the back of the machine,\n\n1243\n00:57:22,930 --> 00:57:25,110\nturn off the wireless\nswitch on the adapter.\n\n1244\n00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:27,380\nSo the machine is running,\nbut it's isolated,\n\n1245\n00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,880\nit can no longer talk to anything.\n\n1246\n00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,930\nThat is not going to really effect.\n\n1247\n00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:32,010\nIf we say absolutely.\n\n1248\n00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:34,370\nIf we have to do something,\nisolate the machine but\n\n1249\n00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,470\nleave it running because what we\nwant is we want what's in memory.\n\n1250\n00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:37,810\n>> Yes.\n>> Want to know what's in there.\n\n1251\n00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:41,040\nYou have to literally get a scissors and\ncut the network cables.\n\n1252\n00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,280\nIf you can't get it out of the back\nof the machine, cut the cable.\n\n1253\n00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,220\nYou're not gonna hurt yourself or\nanybody by cutting that network cable.\n\n1254\n00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:46,920\nI promise you.\n\n1255\n00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:50,180\nThe IT guys will not scream at you for\nhaving to replace the cable.\n\n1256\n00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:53,390\nEven if it's a fiber optic cable,\ncut the cable, right.\n\n1257\n00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:56,900\nKill the wireless connection\nby turning off wireless, but\n\n1258\n00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,640\ndon't shut off the machine.\n\n1259\n00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:02,020\nBecause if you power off the machine,\nanything going on in there is now lost,\n\n1260\n00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,880\nwe have no way of\nunderstanding what was there.\n\n1261\n00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,580\nIt's very important that you train\npeople on incident handling, right.\n\n1262\n00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,180\nIt's very, very critical.\n\n1263\n00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:07,740\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1264\n00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:10,190\n>> All right so, when we talk about that.\n\n1265\n00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:13,450\nWe talk about incident handling, right,\nthe professionals we just talked about.\n\n1266\n00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,590\nWho are the guys or the girls,\nwho's the people that you're gonna call?\n\n1267\n00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,520\nYou got to call\nthe incident response team.\n\n1268\n00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,130\nAnd so in many companies,\nwe do have these teams.\n\n1269\n00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:25,370\nWe do have these set aside teams, groups\nof professionals trained appropriately\n\n1270\n00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:27,450\nwith computer forensics training and\n\n1271\n00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:30,700\nincident response training, to understand\nhow to really deal with these issues.\n\n1272\n00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:33,030\nNow, again,\nthere's different levels of teams,\n\n1273\n00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:34,920\ndifferent levels of\ncommitments in companies.\n\n1274\n00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,930\nSome companies will have fully funded,\nfree standing,\n\n1275\n00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:40,710\npermanent teams that just are on call,\nin effect, right?\n\n1276\n00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:42,120\nWaiting to deploy.\n\n1277\n00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:44,710\nSome companies will really\nnot need that or have that.\n\n1278\n00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:46,790\nSo they have this idea of\nwhat we call virtual teams.\n\n1279\n00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:47,890\nI call them ghost teams.\n\n1280\n00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:49,970\nTeams that are just kind\nof made up of experts but\n\n1281\n00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:53,710\nthey're not really called in, and\nthey're not standing there all the time.\n\n1282\n00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:56,690\nThey do a lot of other stuff, and then\nif there's something wrong, you go down\n\n1283\n00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:00,920\nthe hall, and say, hey Bob, or Joe, or\nwhoever, Sandy, we kinda need you, right.\n\n1284\n00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,300\nYou're the expert,\nhey come and help us up.\n\n1285\n00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,410\nAnd so that's what they do.\n\n1286\n00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:05,930\nAnd then there's a hybrid team.\n\n1287\n00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:08,780\nThis idea of teams that are kinda\ngonna be a mixture of both, right?\n\n1288\n00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:10,446\nSome virtual, some physical.\n\n1289\n00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:13,080\nYou may have some experts that\nare gonna be working somewhere, but\n\n1290\n00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,150\nare really necessary for other things.\n\n1291\n00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,400\nSo they're not dedicated just\nto incident response, but\n\n1292\n00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,070\nthen there are some people that are.\n\n1293\n00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:22,640\nAnd so, in very large, global,\ngeographically dispersed organizations,\n\n1294\n00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,835\nyou're gonna tend to find virtual teams\nthat may not be ready to drop in,\n\n1295\n00:59:26,835 --> 00:59:27,600\nin a moments notice.\n\n1296\n00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:30,264\nBut can be called on today,\nespecially with things like,\n\n1297\n00:59:30,264 --> 00:59:33,940\nthey build a video conference,\nremotely get into a system.\n\n1298\n00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,300\nThey can react from anywhere.\n\n1299\n00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,450\n>> Yeah makes it a lot easier.\n\n1300\n00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:37,210\n>> Very easy, right.\n\n1301\n00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:37,920\nIn the old days,\n\n1302\n00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,560\nyou tended to have to have permanent teams\nthat would literally just jump on a plane\n\n1303\n00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,500\nand fly somewhere because you didn't\nreally have this remote capability.\n\n1304\n00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,440\nBut today it's a lot different.\n\n1305\n00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,180\nIt's a lot easier today.\n\n1306\n00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,320\nSo we have virtual, we have permanent and\nwe have hybrid teams.\n\n1307\n00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,130\nThese are the three kinds of incident\nresponse teams we want to make sure\n\n1308\n00:59:53,130 --> 00:59:54,100\nwe're aware of.\n\n1309\n00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,390\nAnd then we have this idea of the incident\nresponse procedure, what does the team do?\n\n1310\n00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:02,460\nWe have a six step process here that the\nincident response teams will engage in.\n\n1311\n01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,350\nI just want to walk you through those,\n\n1312\n01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,320\nmake sure you're comfortable\nwith this whole idea.\n\n1313\n01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:08,630\nSo, we've documented them,\ndetailed them out for you, here.\n\n1314\n01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,220\nStep one is simply triage.\n\n1315\n01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,100\nAnd what triage represents is\nthis idea of looking at any and\n\n1316\n01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,040\nall available information,\nright out there in front of you.\n\n1317\n01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:19,620\nYou're looking at the computer,\nlooking at the set up, what's going on?\n\n1318\n01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:22,210\nQuick assessment,\nnot going to spend too much time.\n\n1319\n01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:26,230\nVery quickly looking to prioritize on\nhow we want to deal with the incident.\n\n1320\n01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:30,142\nSo if you think of a medical concept,\nright, we often hear about triage.\n\n1321\n01:00:30,142 --> 01:00:32,560\n>> M.A.S.H\n>> M.A.S.H, right, good example.\n\n1322\n01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:33,670\nOr if you haven't seen M.A.S.H.,\n\n1323\n01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:37,460\nif you just have made a trip to an\nemergency room, or an urgent care clinic.\n\n1324\n01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:40,980\nSo a nurse or a practitioner or somebody\nis gonna come out quickly interview you,\n\n1325\n01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,400\nhave you fill out some paperwork.\n\n1326\n01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,490\nWho are you?\nWhat are you doing?\n\n1327\n01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:44,490\nWhat's going on?\n\n1328\n01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:45,850\nAre you feeling okay?\n\n1329\n01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:49,080\nWhatever it is, ask you some quick\nquestions, and then based on your\n\n1330\n01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:54,372\nanswers or your lack of ability to\nexplain certain things that are going on.\n\n1331\n01:00:54,372 --> 01:00:58,110\nThey're gonna look at you and go well, you\nknow, you may have this issue, that issue.\n\n1332\n01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:00,570\nWe're going to prioritize you,\nget you in front of everybody else,\n\n1333\n01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:03,540\nbecause obviously what you're\ngoing through may be a problem.\n\n1334\n01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:06,170\nOr hey, it's not too serious,\nI understand you're in pain,\n\n1335\n01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:09,440\nbut whatever it is it's just not that\nserious compared to these other people\n\n1336\n01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,110\nthat have some real life\nthreatening issues.\n\n1337\n01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:13,026\nSo we're gonna ask you to sit\ndown there for a little bit and\n\n1338\n01:01:13,026 --> 01:01:14,960\nthen we'll call you in as soon\nas we can get to you, right?\n\n1339\n01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:18,330\nThat's what triage is all about,\nis prioritizing incident response.\n\n1340\n01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:20,845\nRight, so in M.A.S.H.,\nright, the opening episodes.\n\n1341\n01:01:20,845 --> 01:01:21,617\n>> Guy first comes in and.\n\n1342\n01:01:21,617 --> 01:01:24,100\n>> Everybody goes up on the pad and\nthey try to triage everybody, absolutely.\n\n1343\n01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,500\nLove that show, love that show.\n\n1344\n01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,260\nAll right, so investigation.\n\n1345\n01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,750\nPhase two or step two here.\n\n1346\n01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,130\nRight?\nProper collection of relevant\n\n1347\n01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:31,830\ndata to be used in later stages.\n\n1348\n01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:32,706\nSo we're gonna investigate.\n\n1349\n01:01:32,706 --> 01:01:34,900\nOnce we triaged and\nkinda prioritized things,\n\n1350\n01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:38,020\nwe know we're gonna start dealing\nwith the most important things first.\n\n1351\n01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:39,190\nLet's investigate those,\n\n1352\n01:01:39,190 --> 01:01:42,445\nlet's find out what's going on there,\nlet's make sure we know so we're gonna\n\n1353\n01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:46,305\ngather information from this machine\nthat's running in memory in real time.\n\n1354\n01:01:46,305 --> 01:01:47,505\nThose other things over there.\n\n1355\n01:01:47,505 --> 01:01:50,275\nNot too worried about them,\ntake some pictures, get to them later.\n\n1356\n01:01:50,275 --> 01:01:52,015\nBut this is really the primary focus.\n\n1357\n01:01:52,015 --> 01:01:53,935\n>> Yep.\n>> Right, we think this is the nexus,\n\n1358\n01:01:53,935 --> 01:01:57,535\nthe focus point of this particular issue,\nthis investigation.\n\n1359\n01:01:57,535 --> 01:01:59,455\nSo stage three, step three, containment.\n\n1360\n01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,242\nTalked about this when we were\ntalking about incident response.\n\n1361\n01:02:03,242 --> 01:02:05,740\nYou know, damage has to be mitigated,\nhas to be minimized.\n\n1362\n01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:08,720\nAnd we can use physical and\nor logical controls here.\n\n1363\n01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,269\nRight, so maybe, as I said, we isolate the\nmachine by pulling out the network cable,\n\n1364\n01:02:12,269 --> 01:02:13,936\nturning off the wireless network card.\n\n1365\n01:02:13,936 --> 01:02:18,792\nMaybe we isolate that machine at\nthe switch or at the junction somewhere in\n\n1366\n01:02:18,792 --> 01:02:24,490\nthe wiring room or the wiring closet by\ncabling it over to a different network.\n\n1367\n01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:25,800\nPerhaps we just unhook it there.\n\n1368\n01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:26,310\nWe put it on a VLAN.\n\n1369\n01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:29,850\nThere's lots of different ways to think\nabout logically isolating something.\n\n1370\n01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,210\nIf it's a virtual machine,\n\n1371\n01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:34,340\nwe can logically isolate it simply by\ndisconnecting its network interface.\n\n1372\n01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,130\nJust unbind it from\nthe properties of the VM.\n\n1373\n01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:39,460\nSo there's a lot of ways to do\nthis physically or logically.\n\n1374\n01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:42,530\nThe idea is that we just want to bring\nsome sort of control element in there.\n\n1375\n01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:44,610\nStep four, stage four analysis.\n\n1376\n01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:47,080\nLooking at all the data gathered\nto understand root cause.\n\n1377\n01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,760\nRoot cause, very important here.\n\n1378\n01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,855\nWhy is something happening the way it is?\n\n1379\n01:02:50,855 --> 01:02:51,815\nWhat's at the heart of this?\n\n1380\n01:02:51,815 --> 01:02:52,825\nWhat's going on?\n\n1381\n01:02:52,825 --> 01:02:54,295\nWe ask the why question.\n\n1382\n01:02:54,295 --> 01:02:56,012\nWe talked about the root cause and\n\n1383\n01:02:56,012 --> 01:02:59,645\nroot cause analysis by asking why\nin one of our previous discussions.\n\n1384\n01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:02,895\nSo really asking why, getting down\nto root cause, very important.\n\n1385\n01:03:04,020 --> 01:03:08,030\nWe must report findings at an ongoing\nlevel here, to senior management.\n\n1386\n01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:10,150\nReally want to focus on\nthis idea in this stage.\n\n1387\n01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:13,237\nThat as we're going through,\nand doing data gathering,\n\n1388\n01:03:13,237 --> 01:03:17,395\ngetting these reports out kind of at\ncertain key points, key take away areas.\n\n1389\n01:03:17,395 --> 01:03:18,785\nAnd then reporting those up and\n\n1390\n01:03:18,785 --> 01:03:21,895\nout allows us to inform senior\nmanagement as to what we're finding.\n\n1391\n01:03:21,895 --> 01:03:25,084\nCuz there may be certain logical break\npoints where we need to get them in and\n\n1392\n01:03:25,084 --> 01:03:26,690\nhave them make some decisions.\n\n1393\n01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:31,000\nOh, we found all this stuff over here,\nand we found some evidence over here.\n\n1394\n01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,520\nAnd it indicates that these\npeople may be involved, but\n\n1395\n01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,830\nright now they're not really the subject\nof this investigation, you know.\n\n1396\n01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:37,500\nWhat do we wanna do?\n\n1397\n01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,168\nDo we wanna investigate them, do we wanna\nwiden the scope of the investigation?\n\n1398\n01:03:41,168 --> 01:03:43,846\nOr, hey, you know, we understand that,\nwe looked at that,\n\n1399\n01:03:43,846 --> 01:03:47,212\nwe know that person's not really involved,\neven though they look that way.\n\n1400\n01:03:47,212 --> 01:03:48,409\nWe're confident that's not an issue.\n\n1401\n01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:51,810\nLet's ignore them, let's focus on this\nother thing that we've found over here,\n\n1402\n01:03:51,810 --> 01:03:54,192\nand senior management has to\nreally be involved in that and\n\n1403\n01:03:54,192 --> 01:03:55,540\nhelp us to understand that.\n\n1404\n01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,885\nRight.\nSo, that's very important.\n\n1405\n01:03:56,885 --> 01:03:58,410\nThat idea of analyzing and\n\n1406\n01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:02,200\nreally reporting out at key points\nduring analysis, very important,\n\n1407\n01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,990\nmight want to actually put an asterisk\nright next to that for us.\n\n1408\n01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:06,270\nRight.\nIt might just be worth\n\n1409\n01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:08,242\nan asterisk there to signify importance.\n\n1410\n01:04:08,242 --> 01:04:09,450\nAll right.\nVery good.\n\n1411\n01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:11,349\nSo, step five,\nstage five we have tracking.\n\n1412\n01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:16,070\nTracking also want to know could take\nplace in parallel with analysis, meaning,\n\n1413\n01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:19,570\nwe can be doing tracking and analyzing\nin real time, kind of doing both.\n\n1414\n01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:24,400\nAnd determining, at this point,\nwhether sourcing of the incident,\n\n1415\n01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,160\nwhere it was coming from,\nwhere is it going to emanate from?\n\n1416\n01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:28,050\nIs it internal?\n\n1417\n01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:29,330\nIt's an internal job.\n\n1418\n01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:29,980\nIs it external?\n\n1419\n01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,530\nSomebody's outside trying to hack and\nattack in.\n\n1420\n01:04:32,530 --> 01:04:34,260\nWe've got to get that\ndirectional fix on it,\n\n1421\n01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:36,210\nbecause we've got to know\nwhere to focus our energies.\n\n1422\n01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,790\nIn terms of recovery, right.\n\n1423\n01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,440\nCreating the necessary impact,\nand as a result,\n\n1424\n01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,820\nkinda then going through and\npatching and recovering.\n\n1425\n01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,650\nAnd recovery's gonna be what we do.\n\n1426\n01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:46,890\nSo, we're gonna take that\ntracking information and\n\n1427\n01:04:46,890 --> 01:04:49,920\nthen act on it in recovery\nto implement necessary fixes\n\n1428\n01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,370\nto ensure incidents do not happen again or\nthe incident does not happen again.\n\n1429\n01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:56,210\nSo, this is gonna\nhopefully put in a fix or\n\n1430\n01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:58,800\npatch in such a way that it\nstops that from occurring.\n\n1431\n01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,380\nSo, this is the overall incident response\nprocess, incident management process.\n\n1432\n01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:05,000\nAnd what we want to really\ntake away from this,\n\n1433\n01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,620\nkind of the last statement I have\ndown there, very, very important.\n\n1434\n01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:10,930\nAgain, an asterisk there to indicate\nto you it's something to be aware of.\n\n1435\n01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:14,780\nManagement needs to make the decision\nas to whether or not it says there\n\n1436\n01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:18,100\nlaw enforcement should be called in\nto investigate a security breach.\n\n1437\n01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,400\nIt is up to management.\n\n1438\n01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,870\nWe say management, should be senior\nmanagement, to decide whether or\n\n1439\n01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:27,030\nnot to bring law enforcement, external,\nprofessional, law enforcement tin.\n\n1440\n01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:28,780\nOr you're gonna keep it internal.\n\n1441\n01:05:28,780 --> 01:05:30,475\nAnd you're going to deal with\nit on your own, internally.\n\n1442\n01:05:30,475 --> 01:05:34,605\nNow,what often happens a lot of the time,\nis we start out by saying,\n\n1443\n01:05:34,605 --> 01:05:36,792\nyeah we're going to deal\nwith it internally.\n\n1444\n01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:39,650\nAnd then we get to a point where\nwe find there's a lot of stuff,\n\n1445\n01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:43,490\nmaybe too much, and or\nsomething that clearly crosses a line\n\n1446\n01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:47,720\nthat involves either a federal crime or\na state crime or something like that.\n\n1447\n01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:51,050\nAnd then all of a sudden we have to bring\nin law enforcement after we started to\n\n1448\n01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:52,730\nconduct our own investigation.\n\n1449\n01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:53,860\nAnd so that is often the case.\n\n1450\n01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:58,630\nWe don't start out calling up the FBI or\nSecret Service or\n\n1451\n01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:02,700\nthe local law enforcement and say hey,\nsomebody hacked into my machine.\n\n1452\n01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,120\nBut we may very quickly\nwind up being there,\n\n1453\n01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:08,410\nespecially if you find that there is\na certain kind of criminal activity.\n\n1454\n01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:12,610\nAnything having to do with Pornography for\ninstance, illicit trade and\n\n1455\n01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:16,570\nthat kind of stuff, especially with\nchild pornography is automatically.\n\n1456\n01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:17,830\nYou have to call the police in.\n\n1457\n01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:21,120\nIt's a federal crime, it's very,\nvery important that they get involved.\n\n1458\n01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,280\nAnything having to do with financial\nmalfeasance, financial crime.\n\n1459\n01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,550\nManipulation of currency,\nthings like that.\n\n1460\n01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:29,550\nAgainst state, local,\nfederal but definitely federal.\n\n1461\n01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:30,880\nRight.\nYou go right to the top.\n\n1462\n01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,520\nThe secret service gets involved\nwith that, it's a federal crime.\n\n1463\n01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,160\nIf there's things like bond trading,\nor things like that that are going on\n\n1464\n01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,540\nillegally you have insider\ninformation of financial services.\n\n1465\n01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:43,200\nAll those things, immediately, the Feds\nshow up and they have to be told what's\n\n1466\n01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,580\ngoing on, because you no longer have\nthe ability to investigate that yourself.\n\n1467\n01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:47,320\n>> Right.\n>> Because now,\n\n1468\n01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:51,430\nthe crime is going to rise to a level\nwhere there's gonna be prosecution, and\n\n1469\n01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:53,380\nthere's gonna be laws\nthat have been broken.\n\n1470\n01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:54,860\nAnd evidence has to be gathered.\n\n1471\n01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,950\nAnd wrapping this up, thinking about this.\n\n1472\n01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:59,928\nI don't know if you've ever been\ninvolved in one of these situations.\n\n1473\n01:06:59,928 --> 01:07:02,050\nBut you know, I do a lot of work\nin a lot of these companies.\n\n1474\n01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:05,630\nAnd when you see that kind of\ninvestigation taking place.\n\n1475\n01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:08,550\nAnd then if they come\nin looking to actually\n\n1476\n01:07:08,550 --> 01:07:11,610\ngrab people that are engaging in\ncriminal activities on the computer.\n\n1477\n01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:15,080\nSo, you get either Revenue agents showing\nup, ATF agents shows up typically,\n\n1478\n01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:16,730\nyou may have Secret Service.\n\n1479\n01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:19,840\n>> But typically it's under the umbrella\nof the ATF, in the United States.\n\n1480\n01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,570\nIf they show up like\nyou see on the movies.\n\n1481\n01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,330\nThey show up with the windbreakers, right.\n\n1482\n01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:25,610\nThey've got the big federal agent,\nor whatever.\n\n1483\n01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:28,390\nA lot of them may have bullet\nproof vests on and things,\n\n1484\n01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:30,810\nbecause they are worried somebody's\ngonna draw a gun these days.\n\n1485\n01:07:30,810 --> 01:07:34,520\nThey show up with guns, and they run\ninto an entity, wherever they are.\n\n1486\n01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,520\nThey will come in screaming at the top of\ntheir lungs, back away from the computer.\n\n1487\n01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:39,640\nThey've got guns out, and\n\n1488\n01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,500\nthey will tell you in no uncertain terms\n>> If you don't back away we're gonna\n\n1489\n01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,480\nshoot you.\n\n1490\n01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,670\nBecause if you touch the computer and\nit's booby trapped, and you set off\n\n1491\n01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:49,400\nthat booby trap, you could wipe out all\nthe evidence they're coming to get,\n\n1492\n01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,590\nand they take that really seriously.\n\n1493\n01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:52,250\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1494\n01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:54,010\n>> And it's obviously,\nif you're innocent you're just there,\n\n1495\n01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:56,735\nyou do what you're told and you leave\nthe building and that's it, right?\n\n1496\n01:07:56,735 --> 01:07:58,870\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Back away, back away slowly,\n\n1497\n01:07:58,870 --> 01:07:59,810\ndon't touch anything.\n\n1498\n01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:02,930\nBut they will come in, guns drawn,\ntelling you in no uncertain terms,\n\n1499\n01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:06,240\nif you touch anything you know it's going\nto be the very last thing you touch.\n\n1500\n01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,810\nSo, make sure you understand\nhow important and\n\n1501\n01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:12,440\nhow serious this idea of bringing\nin law enforcement can be.\n\n1502\n01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,300\nAlright, very good.\n\n1503\n01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,242\nVery good.\n\n1504\n01:08:14,242 --> 01:08:16,920\n>> All right, well I think that\nbrings us to a good break point.\n\n1505\n01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:20,320\nSo, why don't we take a few and\nwe'll be back with you guys shortly.\n\n1506\n01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,091\nAll right.\nSee you soon.\n\n1507\n01:08:22,091 --> 01:08:29,900\n[SOUND]\n>> All right,\n\n1508\n01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:34,460\nwelcome back everybody to our legal\nepisode and our CISSP program.\n\n1509\n01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:38,910\nWe left off going over some incident\nresponse and some incident management?\n\n1510\n01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:40,540\n>> Incident response and\nsome management, right.\n\n1511\n01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:42,150\n>> Where we gonna head next,\nsome forensics?\n\n1512\n01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:44,730\nI think we're gonna talk a little\nbit about, yeah computer forensics.\n\n1513\n01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:46,270\nTalk a bit about computer forensics,\n\n1514\n01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:48,700\nproper collection of evidence,\nhow we go through all that.\n\n1515\n01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,290\nKinda round out this whole thought\nprocess of incident management,\n\n1516\n01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:54,130\nand really dealing with\nthe incident information we find.\n\n1517\n01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:57,930\nAnd how to safeguard it so we can then\nobviously use it in a court of law later.\n\n1518\n01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:01,640\nWe'll talk later on about different types\nof evidence and things we can see there.\n\n1519\n01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:02,272\nSo, computer forensics.\n\n1520\n01:09:02,272 --> 01:09:05,040\nLet's talk first of all\nabout what forensics is.\n\n1521\n01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,940\nComputer forensics specifically is\ndefined as a science that is focused on\n\n1522\n01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:09,840\nall domains,\n\n1523\n01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:13,620\nas you can see here, in which evidence\nis in a digital or electronic form.\n\n1524\n01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:16,580\nIn other words, anything that is\nin a digital or electronic format\n\n1525\n01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:19,900\nthat we then have to go in and\nfocus on and understand how to manage and\n\n1526\n01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:24,740\nwork with from a forensics perspective\nis considered to be computer forensics.\n\n1527\n01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:26,690\nAnd so\nwhen we talk about computer forensics, or\n\n1528\n01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:28,730\nany forensics examination for that matter,\n\n1529\n01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:32,950\ntalk about criminal activity of some kind,\nwe're always looking at three things.\n\n1530\n01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:37,175\nYou often here in police shows and\nold movies, they talk about these terms.\n\n1531\n01:09:37,175 --> 01:09:42,220\nTalk about motive and opportunity and\nmeans, or modus operandi.\n\n1532\n01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:48,300\nSo, the acronym for this is MOM, this idea\nof motive, of opportunity and of means.\n\n1533\n01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:49,190\nSo, let's define each.\n\n1534\n01:09:49,190 --> 01:09:53,205\nSo, motive, right, is considered\nto be the who and why of a crime.\n\n1535\n01:09:53,205 --> 01:09:54,855\nWe think about questions we ask.\n\n1536\n01:09:54,855 --> 01:09:56,195\nThings we want to uncover.\n\n1537\n01:09:56,195 --> 01:09:57,985\nReally understanding what's going on.\n\n1538\n01:09:57,985 --> 01:09:59,155\nWe're talking about the who and the why.\n\n1539\n01:09:59,155 --> 01:10:03,105\nSo, if we think about motive of a crime,\nwe think about who committed it and\n\n1540\n01:10:03,105 --> 01:10:04,235\nwhy they committed it.\n\n1541\n01:10:04,235 --> 01:10:05,945\nWould help us to understand\nthe reasoning of it,\n\n1542\n01:10:05,945 --> 01:10:08,200\nthe motive of it behind why that was done.\n\n1543\n01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,370\nOpportunity, it's really about\nthe where and the when of a crime.\n\n1544\n01:10:11,370 --> 01:10:13,440\nSo, where was it committed?\n\n1545\n01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:16,934\nWhen was it committed speaks to\nopportunity, because did that person,\n\n1546\n01:10:16,934 --> 01:10:17,800\nwere they there?\n\n1547\n01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,310\nDid they have a reason to be there?\n\n1548\n01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:20,950\nThey weren't supposed to be there but\nthey were.\n\n1549\n01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,298\nA little unusual so\nwhat was going on with that?\n\n1550\n01:10:23,298 --> 01:10:24,960\nRight, 2 o'clock in the morning,\n\n1551\n01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,100\nwhy are you out wandering\naround behind somebody's house?\n\n1552\n01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:28,130\nYou don't belong there.\n\n1553\n01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:29,870\nThat kind of thing, right?\n\n1554\n01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:33,650\nUnless you're sleep walking, taking a dip\nin the pool or something like that.\n\n1555\n01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:35,510\nThat's usually how horror movies start.\n\n1556\n01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:39,060\nHear the ominous music, and\nall of the sudden somebody's dead,\n\n1557\n01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:42,430\nand all sorts of things like that.\n\n1558\n01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:43,270\nSo means, right?\n\n1559\n01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:43,930\nWhat are the means?\n\n1560\n01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:46,530\nMeans are the abilities of\nthe criminal to be successful.\n\n1561\n01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:50,630\nIn other words, what are the skills\nthey bring to the crime if you will,\n\n1562\n01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:53,150\nthat allow them to execute successfully,\nor if not.\n\n1563\n01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:54,620\nWhat were the skills they\nthought they had, but\n\n1564\n01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,280\nobviously didn't execute on very well.\n\n1565\n01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:00,450\nBecause the jails are full of people that\nthought they had more means than they did,\n\n1566\n01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:03,280\nand at the end of the day found\nout that they weren't quite as\n\n1567\n01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,490\nsuccessful as they hoped they had been.\n\n1568\n01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:08,620\nAll right, so just understand motive and\nopportunity and means when we're talking\n\n1569\n01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:12,270\nabout crime, we'll talk about digital\nforensics, or computer forensics.\n\n1570\n01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:16,640\nTry to give you the understanding and\nferreting out, focusing on motive and\n\n1571\n01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,200\nopportunity and means, in order to truly\nunderstand why a crime is being committed.\n\n1572\n01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,580\nHow it's being committed, and as\na result of that, find the guilty party.\n\n1573\n01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,510\nFind the person who is\ncommitting the crime.\n\n1574\n01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:26,280\n>> Absolutely.\n\n1575\n01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:29,290\n>> It's kinda the Where's Waldo concept\nof criminal investigation right?\n\n1576\n01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:30,690\nEver play Where's Waldo?\n\n1577\n01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:31,680\n>> Yeah, yeah.\n\n1578\n01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,200\n>> So, you know, if you've never seen it.\n\n1579\n01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,120\nEspecially if you have kids, you've\never read the book, or played the game.\n\n1580\n01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:36,820\nBut it's really, really cool.\n\n1581\n01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:41,338\nSo, Where's Waldo, the idea of finding\nthis character Waldo in all the mythical\n\n1582\n01:11:41,338 --> 01:11:45,610\nplaces, and sceneries, and things that he,\nor she, becomes involved in.\n\n1583\n01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:48,188\nSo just this idea of basically\nferreting out, right?\n\n1584\n01:11:48,188 --> 01:11:49,721\nFinding all the details,\n\n1585\n01:11:49,721 --> 01:11:54,730\nall the clues that lead us to understand\nwhere Waldo is or who committed the crime.\n\n1586\n01:11:54,730 --> 01:11:56,400\nSame concept in that respect.\n\n1587\n01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:56,970\nAll right very good.\n\n1588\n01:11:56,970 --> 01:12:02,010\nSo we have this thing called Locard's\nprinciple of exchange we want\n\n1589\n01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:03,562\nto quickly talk about with you.\n\n1590\n01:12:03,562 --> 01:12:06,390\nNot Picard if you are a Star Trek fan.\n\n1591\n01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:07,170\n>> [LAUGH] Board version of him.\n\n1592\n01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:08,030\n>> Not Castor Picard.\n\n1593\n01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:10,020\nRight exactly but Lowcard's.\n\n1594\n01:12:10,020 --> 01:12:11,175\nLocard's principle of exchange.\n\n1595\n01:12:11,175 --> 01:12:14,633\nLocard was a famous criminologist,\nhe basically came up with this idea,\n\n1596\n01:12:14,633 --> 01:12:17,368\npsychologists, criminologists\ncame up with this idea,\n\n1597\n01:12:17,368 --> 01:12:19,902\nthat criminals will always\nleave something behind.\n\n1598\n01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:23,305\nAnd will always then take something away\nwith them from the scene of the crime.\n\n1599\n01:12:23,305 --> 01:12:27,366\nIt becomes the underlying,\nunderpinning concept of criminology and\n\n1600\n01:12:27,366 --> 01:12:30,479\nhow we can study crime analysis,\nanalyzing crimes.\n\n1601\n01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:32,292\nThis idea of how we can study them and\n\n1602\n01:12:32,292 --> 01:12:34,657\nthen hopefully lead to\nfinding the criminal.\n\n1603\n01:12:34,657 --> 01:12:38,690\nBecause if we can figure out that they\nleft something figure out what they took.\n\n1604\n01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:41,750\nWe link those two things together\ntypically it helps us to profile and\n\n1605\n01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:45,020\nfigure out what's going on so\nwhen there is a commission of a crime.\n\n1606\n01:12:45,020 --> 01:12:46,110\nWe often look for things,\n\n1607\n01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:48,990\nyou see this in all the TV shows and\nall that kind of stuff.\n\n1608\n01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:51,560\nAll they leave behind evidence,\nmaybe there's a hair, right, or\n\n1609\n01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:56,530\nwe can find DNA, or they left behind\na fingerprint or something like that.\n\n1610\n01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:57,500\nExactly.\nSo\n\n1611\n01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:00,813\nthis is really the idea that as\nan examiner and investigator,\n\n1612\n01:13:00,813 --> 01:13:04,650\nLocard just saw this pattern over time and\nformalized it, and\n\n1613\n01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:07,100\ncame up with this idea of what's\ncalled the principal of exchange.\n\n1614\n01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,650\nSo, just please be aware of that.\n\n1615\n01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:11,738\nAll right, so\nthen forensics investigatory processes,\n\n1616\n01:13:11,738 --> 01:13:15,020\nwhat are the steps involved in\ndoing forensic examination?\n\n1617\n01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:19,090\nWe have seven steps well defined detailed\nout want to understand what they are.\n\n1618\n01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:21,960\nMake sure that we\nare comfortable with them.\n\n1619\n01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,570\nAnd so we can see here.\n\n1620\n01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:26,741\nIdentification, preservation,\niIll just run through all seven quickly.\n\n1621\n01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:31,451\nWe'll talk quickly about them but your\nidentification, preservation, collection,\n\n1622\n01:13:31,451 --> 01:13:34,667\nexamination and\nnow it's just presentation and decision.\n\n1623\n01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:38,061\nAnd so what goes on in each of these areas\nobviously important to think about So\n\n1624\n01:13:38,061 --> 01:13:39,274\nidentification, right?\n\n1625\n01:13:39,274 --> 01:13:42,580\nWhat kind of evidence are we finding and\nseeing when we first show up.\n\n1626\n01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:46,520\nAnd we have to then preserve, identify\nfirst, but then preserve that evidence.\n\n1627\n01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:51,510\nSo, as a result, when we are doing\nidentification we're finding things, and\n\n1628\n01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:55,150\ntaking pictures of them, and tagging them,\nand understanding what they are.\n\n1629\n01:13:55,150 --> 01:13:56,340\nSo that way we know, oh,\n\n1630\n01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:01,540\nlook there's a computer over there,\nthere is a cable on the ground, right?\n\n1631\n01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:02,190\nThose kind of things.\n\n1632\n01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:05,590\nSo identify what kind of crime\nscene we're dealing with,\n\n1633\n01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:08,250\nwhat kind of evidence may\nbe expected as a result.\n\n1634\n01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:13,160\nIf we walk in and\nfind a crime scene that involves, perhaps,\n\n1635\n01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,440\ndead bodies as opposed to just\nan empty room with computer gear,\n\n1636\n01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,590\nwe're going to have very\ndifferent expectations.\n\n1637\n01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:20,810\nWhat kind of forensics we\nhave to bring to the table,\n\n1638\n01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:22,550\nwhat kind of investigatory process.\n\n1639\n01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:24,940\nAnd as a result what kind of\nevidence we're looking to find.\n\n1640\n01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:29,620\nBecause in a room with dead bodies we\nexpect to find some sort of evidence as to\n\n1641\n01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:30,590\nhow they were killed, right?\n\n1642\n01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:34,370\nSo maybe there's gun casings on the floor,\nmaybe shell casings, right?\n\n1643\n01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:34,950\nFrom a gun.\n\n1644\n01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:36,496\nMaybe there's a knife\nbecause there's knife wounds.\n\n1645\n01:14:36,496 --> 01:14:38,783\nMaybe there is none of that.\n\n1646\n01:14:38,783 --> 01:14:41,843\nBut maybe then we do a toxicological\nexamination of the body and\n\n1647\n01:14:41,843 --> 01:14:45,494\nwe find out there were chemicals or\ndrugs involved perhaps in their death.\n\n1648\n01:14:45,494 --> 01:14:47,520\nOr we examine the the body physically, and\n\n1649\n01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,895\nfind out that there's\nbruising around the neck.\n\n1650\n01:14:49,895 --> 01:14:51,787\nMaybe they choked or something like that.\n\n1651\n01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:54,215\nOr who knows what, right?\n\n1652\n01:14:54,215 --> 01:14:57,605\nThey fell from a great height and\nthey're all banged up.\n\n1653\n01:14:57,605 --> 01:14:59,455\nMaybe they broke bones or something.\n\n1654\n01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:01,785\nSo there's lots of different\nways we could find this.\n\n1655\n01:15:01,785 --> 01:15:05,380\nBut the idea is we're not going\nto be looking for malware.\n\n1656\n01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:08,270\nWe're not going to be looking for\ncomputer related stuff.\n\n1657\n01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:10,694\nBecause chances are good the computer\nwasn't really involved in that crime if\n\n1658\n01:15:10,694 --> 01:15:12,370\nthere's a dead body, right.\n\n1659\n01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:15,185\nUnless the computer was used [CROSSTALK]\nto actually bludgeon them to death.\n\n1660\n01:15:15,185 --> 01:15:17,013\nRight?\nIn which case the computer\n\n1661\n01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,860\nwas not incidental to the crime.\n\n1662\n01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:20,860\nIt was the commission\nelement of the crime.\n\n1663\n01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:24,010\nBut so identification's all about\nfiguring out what kinda crime\n\n1664\n01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,020\nscene we're looking at.\n\n1665\n01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,280\nAs a result, what kind of evidence\nare we expecting to find?\n\n1666\n01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,000\nReally that.\n\n1667\n01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,460\nAnd then preservation is, okay now we've\nfigured out okay, we're looking for\n\n1668\n01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:32,630\nthis kind of evidence.\n\n1669\n01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:36,100\nSo if we find the gun,\nhow do we preserve the gun to make sure\n\n1670\n01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:39,320\nthat we are going to safeguard it\nwith a chain of custody of evidence.\n\n1671\n01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,260\nVery important.\n\n1672\n01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:45,635\nSo we are going to make sure that\nthe evidence is going to be secured,\n\n1673\n01:15:45,635 --> 01:15:48,100\nright, in such a way\nthat it's obviously gonna\n\n1674\n01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:51,020\nthen remain in the state that\nit's in at the crime scene.\n\n1675\n01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:52,590\nSo we're going to preserve that evidence.\n\n1676\n01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:55,140\nAnd again, there are different techniques\ndepending on the kind of evidence\n\n1677\n01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:56,030\nwe're dealing with.\n\n1678\n01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:59,330\nIf it is electronic evidence from\na machine that's running in memory it's\n\n1679\n01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:02,560\nvery different than finding a physical\nitem like a shell casing or\n\n1680\n01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:04,170\na knife on the floor.\n\n1681\n01:16:04,170 --> 01:16:05,390\nWe have to preserve both, but\n\n1682\n01:16:05,390 --> 01:16:08,420\nwe preserve both differently\nusing different mechanisms.\n\n1683\n01:16:08,420 --> 01:16:08,980\nRight?\n\n1684\n01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:10,690\nSo just make sure we're aware of that.\n\n1685\n01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:14,680\nA collection is really about them safely\ncollecting the evidence, bagging and\n\n1686\n01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:17,958\ntagging as we call it,\nfollowing standard procedures.\n\n1687\n01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:20,890\nEvery item that we collect,\nwe have to take pictures of to understand\n\n1688\n01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:25,590\nthe context, have a numerical identifier\nuniquely for that piece of evidence.\n\n1689\n01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:26,780\nWe have to tag it.\n\n1690\n01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:30,860\nHave a description on the tag, tell what\nit was, where it was found, what it is.\n\n1691\n01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:34,515\nAnd then as a result of that, we bag\nall that up take it back to the lab or\n\n1692\n01:16:34,515 --> 01:16:36,040\nwherever we are going.\n\n1693\n01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:39,460\nAnd then we have this literally,\nthis box of evidence that we work with.\n\n1694\n01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:40,180\nExamination.\n\n1695\n01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:44,700\nWe go through and\nforensically examine the evidence.\n\n1696\n01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:50,840\nWe do so by making sure that we are going\nto look at it on the outside first,\n\n1697\n01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:54,300\nunderstand what's there, maybe probe and\npoke around a little bit.\n\n1698\n01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:57,790\nWe're going to make sure that we\nin no way modify the evidence.\n\n1699\n01:16:57,790 --> 01:17:00,920\nSo again, if it's physical evidence\nwe may pick up a shell casing.\n\n1700\n01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:03,865\nWe have to use gloves to make sure we\ndon't in any way modify fingerprints or\n\n1701\n01:17:03,865 --> 01:17:05,431\nthings that may have been found there.\n\n1702\n01:17:05,431 --> 01:17:07,515\nWe do this in a clean room.\n\n1703\n01:17:07,515 --> 01:17:12,485\nSo that we don't introduce any\nexternal material that may come into\n\n1704\n01:17:12,485 --> 01:17:13,800\ncontact with it.\n\n1705\n01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:14,590\nThat kind of thing.\n\n1706\n01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:17,840\nIt's computer evidence, we're going to\nmake sure that we make and we have these\n\n1707\n01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,880\nprimary and working image definitions\nthat I want to quickly touch on.\n\n1708\n01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:26,050\nSo if it's computer evidence, electronic\nevidence, we're gonna make sure we go in,\n\n1709\n01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:29,290\nand we have a primary image,\nwhich is the evidentiary image,\n\n1710\n01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:32,800\nthe initial image that was\ncataloged into evidence.\n\n1711\n01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,695\nSo that is the primary\nevidence that we find.\n\n1712\n01:17:34,695 --> 01:17:42,120\nEvidentiary a TIAI, TI, TI, AI, RY.\n\n1713\n01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:43,449\nEvidentiary.\n\n1714\n01:17:43,449 --> 01:17:44,064\nRight?\n\n1715\n01:17:44,064 --> 01:17:48,652\nOkay the evidentiary evidence that\nis basically a double entendre,\n\n1716\n01:17:48,652 --> 01:17:49,926\nit's redundant.\n\n1717\n01:17:49,926 --> 01:17:54,214\nSo it's basically the initial piece of\nevidence that's what we're saying there.\n\n1718\n01:17:54,214 --> 01:17:56,072\nRight, the initial piece of evidence.\n\n1719\n01:17:56,072 --> 01:18:01,662\nAnd then what we do is the working image\nis an exact duplicate, a bitstream image\n\n1720\n01:18:01,662 --> 01:18:07,348\ncopy of the primary image, hashed, so\nthat way we know there has been no change.\n\n1721\n01:18:07,348 --> 01:18:09,720\nSo we digitally hash the working image,\n\n1722\n01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:13,080\nwe hash both the primary and\nthe working image of course.\n\n1723\n01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:18,051\nWe don't examine or in any way touch\nthe primary image, we simply work on and\n\n1724\n01:18:18,051 --> 01:18:19,929\nexamine the working image.\n\n1725\n01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:26,150\nAnd so when we do the examination and\nthe analysis, we are going to be doing so\n\n1726\n01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:27,540\non a copy of the data.\n\n1727\n01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:31,390\nIn other words, not the original data,\nto safeguard the integrity of the original\n\n1728\n01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:35,300\ndata to then be able to enter into\nevidence later and potentially show it in\n\n1729\n01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:38,412\na court of law and prove that it\nhas not been modified in any way.\n\n1730\n01:18:38,412 --> 01:18:39,395\nCuz if we can't do that,\n\n1731\n01:18:39,395 --> 01:18:43,520\nthen we can potentially introduce\nsome sort of manipulation\n\n1732\n01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,780\nthat potentially can lead to the evidence\nnot being seen as being legitimate.\n\n1733\n01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:47,341\nAll right.\nSo\n\n1734\n01:18:47,341 --> 01:18:49,179\nwe wanna make sure we are aware of that.\n\n1735\n01:18:49,179 --> 01:18:52,459\nSo we hash it to prove it is has not been\nmodified, we hash both the primary and\n\n1736\n01:18:52,459 --> 01:18:54,210\nthe working image.\n\n1737\n01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:56,704\nBecause obviously if\nwe compare the two and\n\n1738\n01:18:56,704 --> 01:19:00,030\nwe understand the hashes have\nnot changed then we know for\n\n1739\n01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:04,280\na fact that evidence is going to\nstill be considered to be sound.\n\n1740\n01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,360\nThere's nothing wrong it.\n\n1741\n01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:06,040\nRight?\n\n1742\n01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:06,880\nSo we have both there.\nBoth of those\n\n1743\n01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,128\nare really going to be\nfound up under examination.\n\n1744\n01:19:09,128 --> 01:19:12,702\nWe're going to be using those under\nthe examination and maybe analysis phase.\n\n1745\n01:19:15,088 --> 01:19:17,718\nIs performed on, right, the working image.\n\n1746\n01:19:17,718 --> 01:19:18,365\nRight.\n\n1747\n01:19:18,365 --> 01:19:20,055\nNot on, never on the primary image.\n\n1748\n01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,165\nAbsolutely correct.\n\n1749\n01:19:21,165 --> 01:19:21,755\nAll right.\nVery good.\n\n1750\n01:19:21,755 --> 01:19:22,550\nSo, that's there.\n\n1751\n01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:25,145\nAnalysis, we're gonna look at what\nwe found during the examination.\n\n1752\n01:19:25,145 --> 01:19:27,690\nWe're gonna delve in.\nCheck the data, do a bunch of tests on it,\n\n1753\n01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:30,358\nfigure out what's there,\nlook for patterns.\n\n1754\n01:19:30,358 --> 01:19:33,677\nAny of those kinda things that we would\nthink of that are gonna be important\n\n1755\n01:19:33,677 --> 01:19:34,758\nare gonna be done here.\n\n1756\n01:19:34,758 --> 01:19:38,415\nSo we're gonna finish examining it and\nthen really dive deep,\n\n1757\n01:19:38,415 --> 01:19:42,014\nif you will To understand what may,\nor may not have happened.\n\n1758\n01:19:42,014 --> 01:19:44,990\nAnd so, more thorough.\n\n1759\n01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:46,970\nO, R, O.\n>> Is that the way you want to put it?\n\n1760\n01:19:46,970 --> 01:19:47,640\n>> Yeah, more thorough.\n\n1761\n01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:48,970\nYeah, there we go, more thorough.\n\n1762\n01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:50,450\nSure.\n>> [COUGH]\n\n1763\n01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:51,960\n>> More thorough examination, or\n\n1764\n01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:53,290\ninvestigation.\n\n1765\n01:19:53,290 --> 01:19:54,590\nAbsolutely, good.\n\n1766\n01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:58,430\nAll right, so then in presentation we're\ngonna sum up everything we found in\n\n1767\n01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:00,670\nthe examination in the analysis phases.\n\n1768\n01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:04,530\nWe're gonna report out on that,\nkinda present our findings, if you will.\n\n1769\n01:20:04,530 --> 01:20:09,330\nTypically written up to the interested\nparties, the lawyers, senior management,\n\n1770\n01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:11,180\nit depends on who it is and\nwhat we're talking about.\n\n1771\n01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:16,820\nAnd then in decision,\ndown at the bottom there.\n\n1772\n01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:17,580\nYou know, in decision.\n\n1773\n01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:20,976\nWhat we're really going to do\nis we're going to go in and\n\n1774\n01:20:20,976 --> 01:20:24,140\nwe're going to have somebody look at those\nfindings and then decide whether or not\n\n1775\n01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:27,500\nwe're going to go to trial with it, we're\ngoing to use it as evidence, what's going\n\n1776\n01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:31,220\nto happen with it in other words, what is\nthe outcome of our forensic investigation?\n\n1777\n01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:33,176\nThat's really what decision is all about.\n\n1778\n01:20:33,176 --> 01:20:38,680\n[COUGH] All right.\n\n1779\n01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:42,670\nSo, where we actually make those\nprimary image and working image,\n\n1780\n01:20:42,670 --> 01:20:45,930\nwell where we tag the primary image,\nhash it, but make the working image copy.\n\n1781\n01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:46,840\nSo let's go back up.\n\n1782\n01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,160\nWe're gonna want to go to preservation.\n\n1783\n01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,620\nCuz that's really where that happens.\n\n1784\n01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:50,720\nSo just make a note there.\n\n1785\n01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,410\nMaking the evidence secure,\nmake sure it's secure and preserved.\n\n1786\n01:20:53,410 --> 01:20:57,050\nSo one of the things we would do\nthere would be to make a cloned image\n\n1787\n01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:59,720\nof the primary drive or\nthe primary evidence.\n\n1788\n01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:02,125\nWe'd use imaging technologies to do that.\n\n1789\n01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:06,065\nForensically approved to be able to\ndo that without modifying in any way,\n\n1790\n01:21:06,065 --> 01:21:08,995\nwe would look at chain of custody\nof evidence there, under.\n\n1791\n01:21:08,995 --> 01:21:13,145\nWe already kind of said that, but chain of\ncustody, just call that out specifically.\n\n1792\n01:21:13,145 --> 01:21:16,582\nWe want to make sure that we know\nthat under preservation, and\n\n1793\n01:21:16,582 --> 01:21:20,612\nthings like time synchronization would\nbe important with preservation there.\n\n1794\n01:21:20,612 --> 01:21:24,872\nTo make sure that if we look at evidence,\nwe have a time stamp for it,\n\n1795\n01:21:24,872 --> 01:21:26,352\nwe know what's going on there.\n\n1796\n01:21:26,352 --> 01:21:28,000\nSo all that stuff is gonna be there.\n\n1797\n01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,040\nJust wanna make sure we\nare looking at that.\n\n1798\n01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,270\nTime synchronization, very good.\n\n1799\n01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:37,820\nUnder collection, we are thinking\nabout different ways of doing this.\n\n1800\n01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:39,880\nWe're thinking about safely\ncollecting the evidence.\n\n1801\n01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,320\nAre there legal standards or\n\n1802\n01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:44,100\nlegal requirements,\nthat we have to kind of align with here?\n\n1803\n01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,860\nJust some extra stuff to throw in.\n\n1804\n01:21:45,860 --> 01:21:48,260\nJust make sure that we're thinking\nof legal requirements, and so\n\n1805\n01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:48,970\nare we aware of them?\n\n1806\n01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:50,110\nAre we using them?\n\n1807\n01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:52,570\nAre we gonna be sampling the data?\n\n1808\n01:21:52,570 --> 01:21:55,250\nWhen we collect it to make\nsure we know what's there.\n\n1809\n01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:57,540\nAre we going to be using\napprove recovery techniques?\n\n1810\n01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:59,590\nThese are the kind of\nthings we think about.\n\n1811\n01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:03,830\nUnder examination, wanna make sure that we\nare forensically examining the evidence\n\n1812\n01:22:03,830 --> 01:22:04,810\nwithout modifying it.\n\n1813\n01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:08,870\nWe wanna make sure we're using or looking\nfor things like hidden data discovery.\n\n1814\n01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:12,060\nSo we may be looking at steganography,\nseeing if there's any hidden data.\n\n1815\n01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:16,130\nIf there is try to uncover it,\nthen we want to extract the hidden data.\n\n1816\n01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:18,400\nSo, if we do find it,\nwe want to extract it.\n\n1817\n01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,710\nSo, looking for hidden evidence, and\n\n1818\n01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:22,220\nextracting it would be\nsomething to consider there.\n\n1819\n01:22:22,220 --> 01:22:25,270\nWe may want to do pattern matching, right?\n\n1820\n01:22:25,270 --> 01:22:26,270\nTo understand whether or\n\n1821\n01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:28,980\nnot there's certain patterns\nof data that may be important.\n\n1822\n01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,490\nThese are things that will occur.\n\n1823\n01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:33,120\nYou know activities that may\noccur in each of these areas.\n\n1824\n01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:37,190\nUnder analysis you know we said\nexamine the evidence more thorough.\n\n1825\n01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:41,025\nWe're gonna look at\nthings like traceability.\n\n1826\n01:22:41,025 --> 01:22:46,445\nWe're gonna look at data mining, so these\nmight be activities we would engage in.\n\n1827\n01:22:46,445 --> 01:22:52,765\nWe may look at protocols or\nstatistical analysis that will take place.\n\n1828\n01:22:52,765 --> 01:22:54,915\nSo you look at the frequency\nof certain protocols.\n\n1829\n01:22:54,915 --> 01:22:55,735\nWhat kinda of traffic is it?\n\n1830\n01:22:55,735 --> 01:22:56,755\nWhat does that mean?\n\n1831\n01:22:56,755 --> 01:22:59,205\nLook at statistical analysis of the data.\n\n1832\n01:22:59,205 --> 01:23:02,415\nHow many times does something happen\nin such and such an amount of time?\n\n1833\n01:23:02,415 --> 01:23:04,645\nAnd these are the kinds of\nthings we will look at there.\n\n1834\n01:23:04,645 --> 01:23:05,190\nRight?\n\n1835\n01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:09,140\nSo just giving you some more ideas about\nthings that happened in these phases,\n\n1836\n01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,980\nwould be what we're trying to do,\nis we draw this out.\n\n1837\n01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:11,950\nAll right?\n\n1838\n01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:12,650\nVery good.\n\n1839\n01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:15,980\nSo having said that, we've done primary\nimage, working image, very good.\n\n1840\n01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:17,915\nSo where is volatile data found?\n\n1841\n01:23:17,915 --> 01:23:20,065\nLets maybe just hit that down one line.\n\n1842\n01:23:20,065 --> 01:23:21,495\nMake a little space.\n\n1843\n01:23:21,495 --> 01:23:24,795\nJust enter to create\na little separation there.\n\n1844\n01:23:24,795 --> 01:23:25,865\nAll right, very good.\n\n1845\n01:23:25,865 --> 01:23:27,825\nSo where would volatile data be found?\n\n1846\n01:23:27,825 --> 01:23:30,337\nSo when we go through and\nthink about volatile data.\n\n1847\n01:23:30,337 --> 01:23:34,027\nVolatile data is data that is going\nto be electronic in nature typically.\n\n1848\n01:23:34,027 --> 01:23:38,977\nIt's going to be unfortunately not easy\nto preserve because of it's nature.\n\n1849\n01:23:38,977 --> 01:23:40,689\nIt's fleeting, we often call it.\n\n1850\n01:23:40,689 --> 01:23:43,210\nSo it's simply tied to\na system that is powered on.\n\n1851\n01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,940\nMeaning if the power goes away\ntypically the data disappears.\n\n1852\n01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:50,380\nAnd so, we have this in running memory and\nrunning configs and things like that.\n\n1853\n01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:52,890\nCaches and registers,\nthings of that nature.\n\n1854\n01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:56,730\nAnd if we shut down the machine we\nlose all of this valuable data.\n\n1855\n01:23:56,730 --> 01:23:59,610\nAnd this is often the most important data.\n\n1856\n01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:02,360\nCuz this is the data that we\nreally have to focus on, right?\n\n1857\n01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,200\nSo I want to make sure\nthat we are aware of that.\n\n1858\n01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,420\nSo where do we find it?\n\n1859\n01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:08,820\nLots of places,\nregisters and caches, right?\n\n1860\n01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:11,880\nRegisters will be in memory typically,\ncaches will be memory caches.\n\n1861\n01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:12,930\n>> Right.\n>> Process tables,\n\n1862\n01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:14,670\nwhat's going on inside the computer.\n\n1863\n01:24:14,670 --> 01:24:20,790\nSo if we do a top array,\na running process look in Linux.\n\n1864\n01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:21,900\nSo we use top.\n\n1865\n01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:22,940\nWe would see it there.\n\n1866\n01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:26,700\nTop is a command that will show us\nall the processes running in Linux.\n\n1867\n01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:30,580\nIf we do something like\nProcess Explorer or\n\n1868\n01:24:30,580 --> 01:24:33,280\none of the Windows ports of top or Proc.\n\n1869\n01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:37,040\nProc's another Unix Linux tool that\nbasically shows us those processes.\n\n1870\n01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:40,330\nWe can use Task Manager in Windows but\nit doesn't give us everything.\n\n1871\n01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:43,850\nSome may use Process Explorer,\none of those other tools to dig deep.\n\n1872\n01:24:43,850 --> 01:24:46,770\nWe would see the process tables to\nunderstand what's going on there.\n\n1873\n01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:49,440\nArp cache, we had a thing in\none of our prior discussions,\n\n1874\n01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:53,380\nlooked at the arp cache, so\nthat would be arp minus a, lowercase a,\n\n1875\n01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:55,930\nsee the arp cache, what's going on there.\n\n1876\n01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:58,280\nSystem memory, what's in memory itself.\n\n1877\n01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:00,810\nAnd there maybe different kinds of memory,\nRam and Rom.\n\n1878\n01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:02,850\nRam is volatile, Rom is typically is not.\n\n1879\n01:25:02,850 --> 01:25:05,610\nAlthough certain kinds of Rom can\nbe wiped out, they're rewriteable.\n\n1880\n01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:10,140\nSo you may see that booby trap where\nwe write data to the Rom chip and\n\n1881\n01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:13,050\nthen we have a system set up where\nif some sort of special key stroke\n\n1882\n01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:16,050\nis not entered on shut down or\nsomething like that.\n\n1883\n01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:19,290\nThat the Rom chip is wiped and\nas a result all evidence goes away.\n\n1884\n01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:21,220\nSo you know hackers will hide.\n\n1885\n01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:23,315\nLike keystroke logging tables there.\n\n1886\n01:25:23,315 --> 01:25:24,630\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> They'll do all sorts of crazy stuff.\n\n1887\n01:25:24,630 --> 01:25:27,240\nAnd then they wipe the memory if no sort\n\n1888\n01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:30,315\nof de-booby trap\nthe machine code is put in.\n\n1889\n01:25:30,315 --> 01:25:31,160\n>> [LAUGH] Right.\n\n1890\n01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,320\n>> Temporary file system.\n\n1891\n01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,310\nSo we may have temporary\nfile systems like.\n\n1892\n01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:37,820\nYou'll plug in usb drive or\nsomething like that where we're adding\n\n1893\n01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:41,078\nadditional storage and writing memory\nthere or writing stuff to there.\n\n1894\n01:25:41,078 --> 01:25:43,440\nAnd special dissectors.\n\n1895\n01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,560\nWe may be using what's\ncalled white space or\n\n1896\n01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:48,100\nslack space often here\nreferred to either way.\n\n1897\n01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:51,120\nWhat we call LSB, least significant bits.\n\n1898\n01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,300\nWe'll talk about stenography.\n\n1899\n01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:55,700\nAnd this idea of using these areas of\nthe drive that are not normally used, or\n\n1900\n01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:58,440\nmaybe marked as really bad,\nbut are really good.\n\n1901\n01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:01,580\nThose kind of things you may rewrite\nthe partition table on a disk.\n\n1902\n01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:04,960\nHackers do this as well, Malware does\nthis, where we go in and mark certain\n\n1903\n01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,700\nsectors of the disk bad, so the system\ndoesn't read them, doesn't write to them.\n\n1904\n01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:09,790\nExcept when we want it to.\n\n1905\n01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:10,970\nSo we put data there.\n\n1906\n01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:13,450\nThat we mark it as bad\nusing special software.\n\n1907\n01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:17,470\nSo there's data stored there, but\na traditional system, traditional analysis\n\n1908\n01:26:17,470 --> 01:26:20,450\nwould not find it because it\nlooks at those as bad sectors and\n\n1909\n01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:22,620\nwe don't think there's any data there,\nit's unusable.\n\n1910\n01:26:22,620 --> 01:26:25,210\nSo forensic examination would go in and\nlook for this stuff.\n\n1911\n01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:29,130\nAnd so here we have tools that go in,\nput up the entire map of the drive,\n\n1912\n01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:30,840\nshow us the good and the bad sectors.\n\n1913\n01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:33,020\nOh, look there's like this whole\ncluster of sectors over there.\n\n1914\n01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:34,430\n>> Right.\n>> It doesn't seem like it would be bad.\n\n1915\n01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:35,210\nWhat's going on with that?\n\n1916\n01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:37,340\nSo one of the things we do is\nwe probe those bad sectors,\n\n1917\n01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:39,000\nsee if it's really recoverable data.\n\n1918\n01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:42,040\nAnd if there is, we find out that\nspecial disk sectors have been used.\n\n1919\n01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:46,700\nSo this is really what we do there, and so\nthis is where volatile data can be found,\n\n1920\n01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:49,870\nthese are the kind of places\nwhere we will find volatile data.\n\n1921\n01:26:49,870 --> 01:26:52,440\nSo just think about, for\ninstance, somebody's cell phone.\n\n1922\n01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,350\n>> Yeah.\n\n1923\n01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:55,264\n>> We want to get the call\nlog out of their cell phone.\n\n1924\n01:26:55,264 --> 01:26:57,122\n>> [CROSSTALK]\n>> Who to call, their chat,\n\n1925\n01:26:57,122 --> 01:27:00,909\nall that stuff, now that stuff\nis being logged by the ISP or\n\n1926\n01:27:00,909 --> 01:27:02,940\nby the phone company carrier.\n\n1927\n01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:06,770\nSo there is a record of chats that\nare sent, texts that are sent, so\n\n1928\n01:27:06,770 --> 01:27:07,792\nwe can get that anyway.\n\n1929\n01:27:07,792 --> 01:27:08,880\n>> Wait, what?\n\n1930\n01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,295\n>> Yeah, right, I hope we got.\n\n1931\n01:27:10,295 --> 01:27:13,240\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Got to stop sending those texts right,\n\n1932\n01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,040\nso you know we have all\nthat stuff right there, so\n\n1933\n01:27:15,040 --> 01:27:16,970\nit's not as if we can't get them, right?\n\n1934\n01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:20,880\nBut the idea is that the forensic examiner\nmay want them in real time off the device\n\n1935\n01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:24,330\nright there as opposed to having to get\na subpoena to go to the carrier and\n\n1936\n01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:25,959\ngo through all that to try to get them and\nyou know,\n\n1937\n01:27:25,959 --> 01:27:27,140\nyou may not be successful by the way.\n\n1938\n01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:28,216\n>> Right.\n>> Right, they may be told sorry,\n\n1939\n01:27:28,216 --> 01:27:29,646\nwe're not going to give them to you right?\n\n1940\n01:27:29,646 --> 01:27:33,407\nSo, but if you can get them off\nthe phone then you can get them.\n\n1941\n01:27:33,407 --> 01:27:36,983\nAnd so a lot of people say oh, well I'll\njust, I kinda clear it every so often.\n\n1942\n01:27:36,983 --> 01:27:39,980\nYeah, but there's still a record of it,\nor I'm gonna put a passcode on there.\n\n1943\n01:27:39,980 --> 01:27:41,735\nAnd they can't get in\nwithout my permission.\n\n1944\n01:27:41,735 --> 01:27:43,170\nWell yeah, but guess what?\n\n1945\n01:27:43,170 --> 01:27:45,150\nWe have tools that will crack\nthat four digit passcode.\n\n1946\n01:27:45,150 --> 01:27:46,001\n>> It's four digits.\n\n1947\n01:27:46,001 --> 01:27:46,997\n>> It's not hard.\n\n1948\n01:27:46,997 --> 01:27:49,346\nRight?\nTakes us a couple minutes run it through\n\n1949\n01:27:49,346 --> 01:27:51,610\na random number sequence generator.\n\n1950\n01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:54,422\nHook it up, and just like in\nthe movies bip, bip, bip, bip.\n\n1951\n01:27:54,422 --> 01:27:55,720\nWe're in, right?\n\n1952\n01:27:55,720 --> 01:28:00,170\nIt's not hard to do,\neven if it's a picture pass.\n\n1953\n01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:03,210\nWe can just look at that screen,\nif you don't give us rights,\n\n1954\n01:28:03,210 --> 01:28:05,160\nyou don't tell us yeah,\nwe're going to let you do this.\n\n1955\n01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:08,230\nIf we then take that device because\nit's impounded as part of the custody\n\n1956\n01:28:08,230 --> 01:28:09,370\nof the evidence.\n\n1957\n01:28:09,370 --> 01:28:12,270\nSomebody will just examine that screen,\nlook for those touch points or\n\n1958\n01:28:12,270 --> 01:28:14,800\nthose pressure points that are hit\nover and over and over again, and\n\n1959\n01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,620\nI promise you very quickly we will\nbypass that and it's not hard to do.\n\n1960\n01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:19,200\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1961\n01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,050\nAll right.\n\n1962\n01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:22,672\nSo we talked a lot about chain\nof custody of evidence already.\n\n1963\n01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:23,230\n>> Mm hm.\n\n1964\n01:28:23,230 --> 01:28:27,740\n>> The idea here is that basically just to\nunderstand this is a history of everything\n\n1965\n01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:32,320\nthat happens with the evidence from the\ntime it is identified until the time it is\n\n1966\n01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:36,750\ngiven back through the life cycle of\nevidence there at the end of this process.\n\n1967\n01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:40,856\nThe history of everything that\nis done to this evidence.\n\n1968\n01:28:40,856 --> 01:28:45,610\nAnd if we cannot account for\neverything, everyone and everything,\n\n1969\n01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:48,310\nwe don't have a good or what we call\na solid chain of custody of evidence.\n\n1970\n01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:49,320\nVery important.\n\n1971\n01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:50,932\nSo the chain of custody of evidence,\n\n1972\n01:28:50,932 --> 01:28:54,540\nprobably the most critical thing we've\nfocus on in forensic examination.\n\n1973\n01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:58,560\nBecause it identifies every time somebody\ncomes into contact with the evidence.\n\n1974\n01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,630\nWhat they did and for what reason.\n\n1975\n01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:03,030\nSo we have a log in effect,\nwhere everybody signs.\n\n1976\n01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:04,100\nIn order to work with this.\n\n1977\n01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:08,270\nIf we can prove historically to a court\nof law at some point in the future if\n\n1978\n01:29:08,270 --> 01:29:13,200\nasked to that you accessed\nit on Tuesday at 5:00 and\n\n1979\n01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,930\ndid this with it, and then put it back.\n\n1980\n01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:17,510\nAnd then two days later somebody\nelse came and did that, but\n\n1981\n01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:19,800\nin between it was in\nan evidence locker locked up.\n\n1982\n01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:23,732\nUnder lock and key, then we can be pretty\nconfident that the integrity of that\n\n1983\n01:29:23,732 --> 01:29:26,550\ndata's there,\nespecially if you're hashing.\n\n1984\n01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:29,390\nWe can validate with hashes that\nthe data has not been modified.\n\n1985\n01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:31,250\n>> Yep.\n>> All right, this becomes important.\n\n1986\n01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:31,850\nSo we have that.\n\n1987\n01:29:31,850 --> 01:29:35,010\nSo life cycle of evidence, let's think\nabout the life cycle of evidence,\n\n1988\n01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:36,390\nwhat does this represent?\n\n1989\n01:29:36,390 --> 01:29:38,770\nThe idea of the life cycle of\nevidence is really this idea.\n\n1990\n01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:42,090\nExcuse me, of being able to go in and\n\n1991\n01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:45,910\nhave these four stages we clearly identify\nas to what happens with evidence.\n\n1992\n01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:48,190\nKind of what does it go\nthrough as a process and so\n\n1993\n01:29:48,190 --> 01:29:52,320\nwe talked about forensic examination\nthe idea that initially identifying and\n\n1994\n01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:56,030\nunderstanding what's there so we collect\nand identify the evidence first.\n\n1995\n01:29:56,030 --> 01:29:58,260\nThat's the whole bag and tag kinda thing.\n\n1996\n01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:01,200\nWe then store, preserve and transport.\n\n1997\n01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:05,870\nSo we take it and put it in a secure area,\nlock it up, transport it safely and\n\n1998\n01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:07,940\nmake sure it is being stored adequately.\n\n1999\n01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:09,570\nIt's hashed with chain and custody,\n\n2000\n01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:12,500\nall that,\npresentation in court if we get that far.\n\n2001\n01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:16,688\nWe may get no further than step two, but\nif we get that far if it does go to court,\n\n2002\n01:30:16,688 --> 01:30:20,190\nwe preserve the evidence and\nthen present it in court.\n\n2003\n01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:22,100\nAnd then when we're done, at some point,\n\n2004\n01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,910\nno matter how long a case runs,\neventually it is over.\n\n2005\n01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:28,280\nEventually we will be able\nto return that evidence.\n\n2006\n01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:29,400\nIt may go back to the owner.\n\n2007\n01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:33,310\nIf the owner is no longer around for\nany reason, then it goes back to whoever\n\n2008\n01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:37,940\nit passes to, but ultimately we return\nthat to whoever the owner of that is, or\n\n2009\n01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:39,790\nthe victim, if it was the victim,\nwhatever it is.\n\n2010\n01:30:39,790 --> 01:30:41,730\nBut ultimately we return that evidence.\n\n2011\n01:30:41,730 --> 01:30:44,580\nSo this is what's called the life\ncycle of evidence, right?\n\n2012\n01:30:44,580 --> 01:30:47,320\nWant to make sure we understand the life\ncycle of evidence, very important.\n\n2013\n01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,976\nI want to make sure that we\nunderstand these four stages and\n\n2014\n01:30:49,976 --> 01:30:51,720\nkind of understand them in sequence.\n\n2015\n01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:53,350\n>> Yes.\n>> And prioritize presentation order,\n\n2016\n01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:55,390\nit would be very important for\nus to do that.\n\n2017\n01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:00,890\nAll right so I think we have done a good\njob of laying out again, another layer.\n\n2018\n01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:04,020\nOf some of the complexities\naround how we deal with legal\n\n2019\n01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:08,390\nregulatory compliance investigation\nareas in the legal discussion here.\n\n2020\n01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:11,600\nI think at this point, probably\na good place for us to call it a day.\n\n2021\n01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,280\n>> Call it a day.\n\n2022\n01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:12,780\nAll right.\n\n2023\n01:31:12,780

and welcome back to\nanother exciting episode of ITProTV.\n\n4\n00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:40,910\nI'm your host, Don Pezet.\n\n5\n00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,920\nToday, with Mr. Adam Gordon.\n\n6\n00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,080\nHow's it going, Adam?\n\n7\n00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,680\n>> Good, Don.\n\n8\n00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840\n>> You've got to do the finger guns,\nyou know.\n\n9\n00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,215\nThat's really how you show people\nyour committment to a topic.\n\n10\n00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:52,060\n[LAUGH]\nI've learned this through, you know,\n\n11\n00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:56,440\nthousand of hours of customer research and\nfocus groups and.\n\n12\n00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,200\nYeah.\n\n13\n00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,260\nNot really.\n\n14\n00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,228\nSo I am picking up in the middle\nof a topic which I love to do,\n\n15\n00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,336\nbecause that means I didn't have\nto do the other topic part.\n\n16\n00:01:05,336 --> 00:01:08,274\nBut you and\nMike had started talking about legal and\n\n17\n00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:10,330\nyou really got through a big chunk.\n\n18\n00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,200\nSo we just have a little bit left\nto kind of round off the legal\n\n19\n00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,090\ntopics that might show up on the exam.\n\n20\n00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,295\nAnd that's what we're gonna\npick up with this morning.\n\n21\n00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:18,378\n>> All right, very good.\n\n22\n00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:21,350\nWe wanna talk a bit\nabout types of evidence.\n\n23\n00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,180\nWhat can be introduced into a court\nof law in terms of evidence?\n\n24\n00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,340\nWhat kind of evidence is there?\n\n25\n00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,850\nThere's many categories.\n\n26\n00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,780\nGo through them with you and\nmake sure you're familiar with them.\n\n27\n00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,930\nAnd we'll talk a little bit along the way,\n\n28\n00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,760\nabout some of the other\nstuff that supports that.\n\n29\n00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,420\nSome of the attacks you may\nsee that you may have to deal\n\n30\n00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,550\nwith as a CISSP in the wild.\n\n31\n00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,670\nI'll remind you of some of those.\n\n32\n00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,780\nSome we've talked about before.\n\n33\n00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,950\nSome may be new.\n\n34\n00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,790\nSome are funny.\n\n35\n00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,255\nWe'll talk about some of those.\n\n36\n00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:47,550\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Don had a laugh this morning as we were\n\n37\n00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,820\ngetting ready for those, and he'll\nshare some thoughts for you on one or\n\n38\n00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,100\ntwo of them, I'm sure, along the way.\n\n39\n00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,570\nAll right,\nlet's get into types of evidence.\n\n40\n00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,230\nLet's talk a little bit about them and\nwhat they are.\n\n41\n00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,140\nWhen we talk about evidence, the goal\nhere is to take the thoughts we've\n\n42\n00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,040\ntalked about in some of\nthe prior discussions.\n\n43\n00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,560\nThings like forensic investigation\nspecifically chain of custody of evidence.\n\n44\n00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,220\nHow do we gather that evidence?\n\n45\n00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,990\nWhat procedures have we used?\n\n46\n00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,690\nHow do we document it through a lifecycle?\n\n47\n00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,590\nHow do we ensure with\nthings like integrity that\n\n48\n00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,230\nthe evidence has not been\ncompromised in anyway and\n\n49\n00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,320\nthen bring that entire thought process\ninto a court of law if and when it's\n\n50\n00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,500\nappropriate because not every crime\nwill be prosecuted in a court of law.\n\n51\n00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,490\nNot all evidence will ever see\nthe inside of a courtroom, so it may or\n\n52\n00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,680\nmay not need to be presented there.\n\n53\n00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,460\nSo it may or may not be relevant, and\n\n54\n00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,270\nas a result, appropriate,\nto bring into a court of law.\n\n55\n00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,060\nSo just because we talk\nabout gathering evidence,\n\n56\n00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,300\ndoesn't automatically mean that\nevidence shows up at a trial.\n\n57\n00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,780\nAnd just because we have evidence\nof some sort of activity.\n\n58\n00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,970\nAgain, we may not know\nwhat activity it is, and\n\n59\n00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,580\nby the way, people are presumed to\nbe innocent until proven guilty.\n\n60\n00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,500\nAnd so as a result of that,\nwe have evidence but\n\n61\n00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,570\nthat doesn't necessarily mean that we\nare looking at a crime that we can\n\n62\n00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,990\nprove beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that has been committed.\n\n63\n00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,740\nWe simply have a lot of facts and\nitems that point to some sort of activity.\n\n64\n00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,570\nBut then we need to take all that\ninto a court of law and let,\n\n65\n00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,280\nin the common law system,\na judge and or jury figure that out.\n\n66\n00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,130\nIn a civil system, the judge or judges\nwill figure that out based on written law.\n\n67\n00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,370\nAnd so we have to be prepared to\npresent the thought process, right,\n\n68\n00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,230\nall the information and all the things\nassociated with that in a court of law,\n\n69\n00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,290\nif asked to, if called on to.\n\n70\n00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,220\nBut that doesn't mean we necessarily will.\n\n71\n00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,050\nKnowing the kinds of evidence,\nthe categorization of evidence that we may\n\n72\n00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:46,520\nhave to produce for CISSP so we have\na better sense of what we're looking at,\n\n73\n00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,100\npotentially ways to interact with it.\n\n74\n00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,470\nBest evidence there is considered to be\nprimary evidence that could be used in\n\n75\n00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,300\na trial.\n\n76\n00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,140\nIt proves to be or\nprovides the most reliability.\n\n77\n00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,756\nSo as a result, we always shoot to\ntry to have best evidence if we can\n\n78\n00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:04,695\ngather evidence, classify it in such\na way, handle it in such a way, and\n\n79\n00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:08,572\nmanage it, maintain it, store it,\nand monitor it, and now analyze it\n\n80\n00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:12,900\nin such a way that it can be classified\nand considered to be best evidence.\n\n81\n00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,560\nJust a word of caution here, or\n\n82\n00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,700\nat least a thought, as the practitioner,\nas a forensic examiner,\n\n83\n00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,080\nwhoever you may be in this process,\nyou don't get to rate evidence.\n\n84\n00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,970\nSo it'd be great if we just said,\noh everything is vast.\n\n85\n00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,020\nYou know just take that all in there.\n\n86\n00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,770\nOh absolutely.\n\n87\n00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,878\nRight it's all good,\nit doesn't work that way right?\n\n88\n00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:33,280\nWe as the providers of that evidence\ndon't get to categorize or rate it.\n\n89\n00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,610\nThe court,\nwe always refer to the court but\n\n90\n00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,520\nwhat we mean ultimately is\nthe judge representing the court.\n\n91\n00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,370\nGets to weigh in ultimately and decide on\nwhat category of evidence this will be.\n\n92\n00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,710\nThere are very specific rules and\n\n93\n00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,240\nstandards that are setup\nto help us do this.\n\n94\n00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,270\nBut typically the judge decides or\nrules on the kind of evidence and\n\n95\n00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,880\nwhat categorization it will have.\n\n96\n00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,910\nWhether it is gonna be direct or\nsecondary or corroborative or\n\n97\n00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,730\ncircumstantial is really a function\nof where the evidence comes from,\n\n98\n00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,200\nhow it was treated,\nthe circumstances that it comes in under.\n\n99\n00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,250\nAnd the judge makes a ruling on that.\n\n100\n00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,180\nUnfortunately, we don't get to\ndecide at the end of the day and\n\n101\n00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,200\nticket everything ourselves.\n\n102\n00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,710\nWe just provide it, and then have\nto go with the flow, if you will.\n\n103\n00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,970\nSo we have best evidence,\nsecondary evidence [COUGH] excuse me.\n\n104\n00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,240\nSecondary evidence is oral and or copies\nof original documents, meaning somebody\n\n105\n00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,320\nwho is going to provide secondary evidence\nwill be giving testimony about something\n\n106\n00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,730\nthat they have first hand knowledge of so\nthey are seeing it or they have seen it.\n\n107\n00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,280\nThey may have written documents or\nbe asked to examine them in real time and\n\n108\n00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,440\nthen talk about them.\n\n109\n00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,190\nSo an expert, for instance.\n\n110\n00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,480\nThat is an expert in some sort of area\nmay come in and take a look at original\n\n111\n00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,750\ndocuments found during the gathering of\nevidence and be asked to speak about them.\n\n112\n00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,250\nThis will be considered\nsecondary evidence.\n\n113\n00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,770\nAnd so this is the kind of\nthing we would think of there.\n\n114\n00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,490\nDirect evidence can prove a fact all by\nitself and really does not need any what\n\n115\n00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,495\nwe would call corroborative or\nbackup information to do so.\n\n116\n00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:07,030\nSo if we have this kind of\nevidence we say typically,\n\n117\n00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,820\nit is evidence that stands on its own,\nif you will.\n\n118\n00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,640\nIrrefutably proves this fact.\n\n119\n00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,120\nA picture of a clock with\na certain time on it.\n\n120\n00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,590\nWith a day stamp, for instance.\n\n121\n00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,720\nDate and time stamp.\n\n122\n00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,650\nCould be direct evidence to\nprove that something went on at\n\n123\n00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,070\nthat particular moment if\nit's a video of something.\n\n124\n00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,510\nWe have time stamps in it.\n\n125\n00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,030\nWe could say, unequivocably,\n\n126\n00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,110\nthat particular moment in time\nis when that thing happened.\n\n127\n00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,200\nRight.\nThat's direct evidence in that respect.\n\n128\n00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,680\nConclusive evidence can\nnot be contradicted.\n\n129\n00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,330\nConclusive evidence, in effect,\nis evidence that is just so forthright.\n\n130\n00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:41,515\nRight or so self evident in\nthe sense that you look at it and\n\n131\n00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:42,885\ngo there's possibly no\nother way to look at it and\n\n132\n00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:45,295\ngo there's no other way to interpret that,\njust it is what it is.\n\n133\n00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:48,015\nThat we really can't come up with\nany other interpretation and\n\n134\n00:06:48,015 --> 00:06:50,717\ncan not be contradicted\nin any way shape or form.\n\n135\n00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:52,487\nDoes the key fit the lock?\n\n136\n00:06:52,487 --> 00:06:54,687\nIs that your fingerprint Mr. Jones?\n\n137\n00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:55,947\nYou know, that kind of thing.\n\n138\n00:06:55,947 --> 00:06:58,487\nI mean,\nit's really hard to come up with any other\n\n139\n00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,357\nstatement other than yes\nit's my fingerprint.\n\n140\n00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:01,757\nYou showed it's mine.\n\n141\n00:07:01,757 --> 00:07:04,038\nYou took it, we compared the two\nin real time, it's mine.\n\n142\n00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:07,398\nThere's really no way to counteract\nthat or contradict that in any way.\n\n143\n00:07:07,398 --> 00:07:08,768\nCircumstantial evidence,\n\n144\n00:07:08,768 --> 00:07:12,328\nthis is able to prove what we're\nreferred to as an intermediate fact,\n\n145\n00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:16,488\na fact that then helps us to effectively\nprove or deduce another fact.\n\n146\n00:07:16,488 --> 00:07:18,728\nThat may be more important to a case or\n\n147\n00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:22,868\nlead us down a logical road to\nthen prove something ultimately.\n\n148\n00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:25,938\nBut in and of itself it is\nnot the primary evidence, but\n\n149\n00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:30,870\nit helps us to then prove other things\nby establishing some sort of idea or\n\n150\n00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,310\nthought and then creating a logical\npath for us to trod down.\n\n151\n00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,570\nCorroborative evidence,\n\n152\n00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,960\nsupporting evidence that's used to help\nprove an idea or point in some kind.\n\n153\n00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,880\nIt is supplementary to primary evidence.\n\n154\n00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,875\nSupplementary meaning it is\nsecondary to primary evidence.\n\n155\n00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:51,211\nSo primary evidence really needs to have\ncorroborative evidence to stand up and\n\n156\n00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:54,962\nreally show that it is very strong,\nbut this'll be the second tier,\n\n157\n00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:58,543\nkind of secondary evidence that\nsupports the primary evidence.\n\n158\n00:07:58,543 --> 00:08:01,176\nSo, if we had perhaps,\n\n159\n00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:06,590\n[COUGH] something like\na gun that was in question.\n\n160\n00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:10,076\nWho owned the gun, for instance,\nwho owned the laptop or\n\n161\n00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:14,030\nthe computer that was in question,\nif this was some sort of IT-based crime.\n\n162\n00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:18,030\nAnd we could show beyond any\nreasonable doubt that proof of\n\n163\n00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,540\nownership based on a registration\nof the computer with a vendor.\n\n164\n00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:26,040\nAnd a sales receipt that had someone's\ncredit card number on it with their\n\n165\n00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,970\nsignature.\n\n166\n00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,800\nThese are the corroborative evidence\nitems that showed and established,\n\n167\n00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,200\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that Don\nindeed, owned the laptop or owned,\n\n168\n00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,530\nwhatever the item is in question.\n\n169\n00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,090\nIt would have the supplementary or\n\n170\n00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,400\nsecondary corroborative pieces that\ncome together to help support that.\n\n171\n00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,030\nOpinion evidence,\n\n172\n00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,500\nopinion evidence is gonna be basically\nbased on the idea of the opinion rule.\n\n173\n00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,640\nSo what we say is the opinion rule says,\nif you can see here,\n\n174\n00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,480\nthat witnesses must testify.\n\n175\n00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,790\nBut testify only to the facts and issues,\nand not their opinion of the facts.\n\n176\n00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,330\nSo somebody can get up and say,\nthis is what did or did not happen.\n\n177\n00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,100\nBut they can't get up and\n\n178\n00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,660\nsay, I think that person is\nguilty of doing this or that.\n\n179\n00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,330\nBecause that's an opinion,\nthey can't testify to opinion,\n\n180\n00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,260\nthey can only testify to fact.\n\n181\n00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,858\nAnd you see this a lot\nin the crime dramas.\n\n182\n00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:16,690\nMr. and Mrs. so and so,\nyou're an expert on this or\n\n183\n00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:20,080\nthat, and they will then talk\nabout what they're an expert in.\n\n184\n00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,660\nBut they can't offer testimony in\nareas that they're not experts in,\n\n185\n00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,410\nbecause it would be opinion.\n\n186\n00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,740\nHearsay evidence, secondhand evidence that\nhas no firsthand proof of accuracy or\n\n187\n00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,050\nliability on its own.\n\n188\n00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,150\nSo hearsay evidence is not\nconsidered to be very good evidence.\n\n189\n00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,770\nSecondhand evidence in general is not\nreally considered to be very reliable or\n\n190\n00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,770\nvery good overall, typically.\n\n191\n00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,760\nAnd so, if there's really no firsthand\nproof of something, we're almost saying,\n\n192\n00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,710\nDon, you weren't there, but\naccording to what you heard from somebody.\n\n193\n00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,735\nYou're telling me this or that happened,\nthat would be second hand or\n\n194\n00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:53,110\nhearsay evidence,\nit's almost like playing telephone.\n\n195\n00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,600\nBy the time you get done, you start out\nwith something like the dog is blue,\n\n196\n00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,630\nyou wind up three, or\nfour levels down with what time is lunch.\n\n197\n00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,550\nSo, the whole thing changes, and\n\n198\n00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,990\nas a result of that, it's not really\nconsidered to be really good evidence.\n\n199\n00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,540\nWe may allow it,\nit may be heard in a court room.\n\n200\n00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,990\nBut it's not something that anybody is\ngoing to take very seriously depending on\n\n201\n00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,970\nthe context more often than not.\n\n202\n00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,650\nJust be aware of that, so\nthe kinds of evidence that we have.\n\n203\n00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,880\nThe kinds of evidence that we deal with,\n\n204\n00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,890\nis really important\nbecause it sets the tone.\n\n205\n00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:25,690\nIt frames for us the way in which\nthe information that we have gathered,\n\n206\n00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,060\nthe evidence that we have gathered.\n\n207\n00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,440\nCan be presented in the light\nof a legal proceeding,\n\n208\n00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,030\nin the light of a court proceeding.\n\n209\n00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,760\nTo prove guilt or innocence or to support\nwhat ever assertions the defense or\n\n210\n00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,780\nthe prosecution are making around.\n\n211\n00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,560\nThe particular importance of an item, and\nwhat it is or is not, that kind of thing.\n\n212\n00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,200\nWe often see if evidence is mishandled,\n\n213\n00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,790\nthat clearly things go\nbadly in a court room.\n\n214\n00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,510\nBecause if evidence is mishandled,\n\n215\n00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,060\nit's very difficult to prove that\nthat evidence has any worth.\n\n216\n00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,360\nAnd indeed,\nnaturally establish the exact opposite,\n\n217\n00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,510\nthat not only is the evidence\nitself not worthwhile.\n\n218\n00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,070\nPerhaps is not really gonna\nsupport the case, but\n\n219\n00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,060\nmay actually go to the opposite\nextreme and help to disprove the case.\n\n220\n00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,260\nNot because the person is or\nis not guilty of the crime, but\n\n221\n00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,170\nrather because the evidence\nitself was handled poorly.\n\n222\n00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,470\nIt establishes doubt and\n\n223\n00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,550\nas a result of establishing doubt,\nif there's enough doubt in a system,\n\n224\n00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,660\nin this case in a courtroom,\naround a particular series of events.\n\n225\n00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:22,660\nIf we can nibble away at the edges in\neffect, establishing doubt around some of\n\n226\n00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,600\nthe key evidence, that we use and we think\nof as establishing guilt or innocence.\n\n227\n00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,230\nWe may then actually be able to sway,\nin the mind of the jury and or\n\n228\n00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,870\nthe judge, that there is or is not a case.\n\n229\n00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,850\nAnd as a result may\nfind somebody guilty or\n\n230\n00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,470\ninnocent when in fact, they may be one or\nthe other, we just don't know.\n\n231\n00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,940\nBut it's very unlikely that bad\nevidence is gonna help us is,\n\n232\n00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,420\nI guess the way to think of that going\ndown that road to get the proper outcome.\n\n233\n00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,210\nThe outcome that we are seeking, based on\nbeing on the defense or the prosecution.\n\n234\n00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,462\nI guess it is relative, right?\n\n235\n00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,000\nCuz spending on the side drawn,\n\n236\n00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,200\nthe outcome that won is clearly not\nthe same outcome of the other one.\n\n237\n00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,970\nSo, I guess it's all a question of\nwhere you stand and where you sit.\n\n238\n00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,665\n>> And then it goes up to appeal.\n\n239\n00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:03,650\n[LAUGH]\n>> And\n\n240\n00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,870\nthen there's a whole other group\nof people to get to weigh in and\n\n241\n00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,710\nhave their opinion about it as well,\nvery true.\n\n242\n00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,090\nSo, always wanna consider that opinions,\n\n243\n00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,040\nas we often say,\neverybody's entitled to have one.\n\n244\n00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,440\nDoesn't mean their right or wrong,\nit just means that it's your own and\n\n245\n00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,550\nyou can call it that but not much more.\n\n246\n00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,956\nAt least that's the clean way\nof referring to that anyway.\n\n247\n00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:20,506\n>> [LAUGH] Correct.\n\n248\n00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,800\n>> All right, so when we talk about types\nof evidence, now what we wanna do is\n\n249\n00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,660\nreally circle back and just summarize the\nfoundation of immiscibility for evidence.\n\n250\n00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,650\nIn other words, what really are the check\nboxes or the things we have to\n\n251\n00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,965\nunderstand about evidence to make sure\nwe understand that it is admissible.\n\n252\n00:12:34,965 --> 00:12:37,765\nPotentially will meet the criteria,\nthe bar for\n\n253\n00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:40,445\nbeing admissible in a court of law.\n\n254\n00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:43,096\nAnd so, things like procedures\nthat are used to collect and\n\n255\n00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,065\nmaintain the evidence are very important.\n\n256\n00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:49,477\nWe've talked a lot about\nthe forensic investigative process,\n\n257\n00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,227\nthe chain of custody of evidence.\n\n258\n00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:55,377\nHow we go through, and really deal with\nthat whole life cycle from investigate.\n\n259\n00:12:55,377 --> 00:12:58,507\nAnd then analyze, and\ngather, and report out, and\n\n260\n00:12:58,507 --> 00:12:59,957\nall this stuff that we talked about.\n\n261\n00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:02,787\nSo, make sure we have a sense of that,\nobviously,\n\n262\n00:13:02,787 --> 00:13:04,897\nif we do it good up front,\nwe do the right things up front.\n\n263\n00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:06,047\nAnd from the very beginning,\n\n264\n00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:09,450\nmuch more likely evidence will\nbe found to be immiscible.\n\n265\n00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,570\nProof of how errors were voided, it's not\nenough to say what you did right, you also\n\n266\n00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,630\nhave to also explain what you didn't do to\nshow that you didn't do anything wrong.\n\n267\n00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,150\nSo, if you picked up evidence\nbefore you took a photograph of it,\n\n268\n00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,100\ndidn't have the context to place it.\n\n269\n00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,550\nThen put it back said,\nI forgot to do that, put it back,\n\n270\n00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,750\nare you putting it back where it was,\nwe have no way of knowing.\n\n271\n00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,380\nAnd so you made a mistake, and\nthat can impact the quality and\n\n272\n00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,940\ntherefore the value of that evidence.\n\n273\n00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,070\nSo understand that identification of\nthe custodian or the custodial function.\n\n274\n00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,470\nThis chain of custody of evidence that we\nspeak about is really about identifying\n\n275\n00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,600\nwho the custodian of that evidence is or\nwho were the custodians.\n\n276\n00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,290\nBecause there could obviously\nbe more than one person\n\n277\n00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,690\nwho is working with that evidence\nduring the course of an investigation.\n\n278\n00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,400\nBut having that historical reference,\n\n279\n00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,510\nthat chain, that documentation about who\ntouched it when, what they did with it,\n\n280\n00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,060\nwhen they put it back,\nthat whole thing, very important.\n\n281\n00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,490\nIf we don't have that, you might as\nwell forget about you'll never gonna see\n\n282\n00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,070\nthe light of day, so you'll never\ngonna see the inside of a court room.\n\n283\n00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,280\nWe can't establish providence as they say,\nor the chain of custody of evidence,\n\n284\n00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,150\nthere is no way for us to be able to\nbring that evidence into a court of law.\n\n285\n00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,230\nBecause there's no way to establish,\n\n286\n00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,100\nbeyond a reasonable doubt,\nthat that evidence was handled properly.\n\n287\n00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,550\nAnd has not been contaminated in some\nway through the handling process.\n\n288\n00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,530\nExplanations need to be provided for\nthings like why, as we just talked about,\n\n289\n00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,720\nwith errors and how you avoided them.\n\n290\n00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,210\nWhy certain actions were taken?\n\n291\n00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,120\nWhat did you do?\n\n292\n00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,640\nWhy did you do it this way?\n\n293\n00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,280\nYou often get questions when you\nare testifying about things like this.\n\n294\n00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,050\nIf you're the forensic expert,\nor examiner, or\n\n295\n00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:39,990\nwhoever you may be in\nrelation to the evidence.\n\n296\n00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,520\nIf you're one of the people that is in the\nchain of custody, you're gonna be asked,\n\n297\n00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,980\nwhy did you do a certain\nthing at a certain time?\n\n298\n00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,670\nWhy was it important that you took this\npicture, then did this, then put on\n\n299\n00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,420\nthis particular thing, then you went ahead\nand took the evidence, put it over here?\n\n300\n00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,430\nWhat was that chain, and why did you\nengage in those activities in this order?\n\n301\n00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,120\nBecause we're trying to establish\nthat you are a professional.\n\n302\n00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,170\nYou understand how to do this properly.\n\n303\n00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,720\nYou engaged in this practice.\n\n304\n00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,830\nYou did it the right way,\nand you documented it,\n\n305\n00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,919\nthat's gonna be very important.\n\n306\n00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,960\nWhy specific procedures were bypassed?\n\n307\n00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,310\nAlso questions you may be asked.\n\n308\n00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,850\nIn other words, why didn't you do certain\nthings, but did you do others and\n\n309\n00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,020\nif so why?\n\n310\n00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,600\nWe're gonna be asked about this,\nboth from the prosecution and\n\n311\n00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,930\nthe defense perspective.\n\n312\n00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,760\nOne remember is trying to establish in the\nmind of the judge and the jury that you\n\n313\n00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:29,360\ndid the right thing, acted professionally,\nno question about the efficacy there.\n\n314\n00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,370\nAnd as a result the reliability\nof the evidence, the other party\n\n315\n00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:36,490\nis typically gonna try to establish doubt\nin the mind of the judge and, or the jury.\n\n316\n00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,800\nYou did certain things, but maybe there\nis this question about doing it this way,\n\n317\n00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,760\nalthough it may be acceptable\nto do it this way.\n\n318\n00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,250\nIt's not normally done that way, so\ndoes that mean that maybe something else\n\n319\n00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,400\ncould've been done incorrectly or\nperhaps not by the book, right?\n\n320\n00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,667\nI don't want to see that,\nyou hear people say, it's by the book.\n\n321\n00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:53,958\nWhat book?\n\n322\n00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,375\nI mean, do you have that book?\n\n323\n00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:56,417\nCan I take a look at it?\n\n324\n00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:58,042\nHas anyone ever shown it to you?\n\n325\n00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:01,250\nIt's the book that's behind every\nattorney in their commercials.\n\n326\n00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,588\n>> It is.\n>> You notice the giant book?\n\n327\n00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:04,035\n>> It's that book, that set of books.\n\n328\n00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:05,772\nRight?\nCuz I think about that.\n\n329\n00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:06,530\nRight?\n\n330\n00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:11,060\nAnd I often remember that\nscene form A Few Good Men.\n\n331\n00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,450\nRight?\nYou know the movie?\n\n332\n00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,030\nSo when they're in the court room\nultimately coming down to the end of this\n\n333\n00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,390\nwhole movie.\n\n334\n00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,100\nAll right.\n\n335\n00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,520\nAnd again spoiler alert if\nyou have not seen the movie.\n\n336\n00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,697\nRight?\nStop watching for a minute.\n\n337\n00:16:21,697 --> 00:16:22,500\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Just so you know.\n\n338\n00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,310\nAll right?\n\n339\n00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,690\nBut if you remember the movie,\nso they're going back and forth.\n\n340\n00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,645\nYou have Kevin Bacon.\n\n341\n00:16:27,645 --> 00:16:28,741\nRight?\nFor the prosecution.\n\n342\n00:16:28,741 --> 00:16:30,750\nRight?\nProsecuting the US government's case.\n\n343\n00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,140\nYou have Tom Cruise at this point\nthe lead attorney for the defense,\n\n344\n00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,360\ndefending these two marines.\n\n345\n00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,790\nSo they're going back and forth, and\nhe's got one of the Marines on the stand.\n\n346\n00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,280\nThey're interviewing all the Marines from\nBravo company to establish the course of\n\n347\n00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,972\nactions around Private Santiago\nbeing murdered and what happened.\n\n348\n00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:52,180\nAnd so at one point, he's get hem up on,\nKevin Bacon has them up on the stand, and\n\n349\n00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,150\nhe gets the US Marine Corps manual.\n\n350\n00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,340\nRight?\nKind of the bible for US Marines, and\n\n351\n00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,670\nhe pulls it out and\nhe's talking to the guy.\n\n352\n00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,230\nAnd he says, okay, show me in the book,\ntell me in the book,\n\n353\n00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,910\nwhere it says that you're gonna\ngo through this and that.\n\n354\n00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,020\nDoes it explain a code red?\n\n355\n00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,430\nDoes it define a code red?\n\n356\n00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,180\nAnd he says, well, no sir.\n\n357\n00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,320\nIt's not in the book.\n\n358\n00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,710\nRight?\nIt's referring to the book,\n\n359\n00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:12,880\nwhich you actually see the book.\n\n360\n00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,380\nRight?\n>> Yep.\n\n361\n00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:13,950\n>> The book is there.\n\n362\n00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,640\nHe's holding the book.\n\n363\n00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,570\nAnd then,\n\n364\n00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:19,260\nthe Tom Cruise character turns it around\nwhere he takes the book out of his hands.\n\n365\n00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:19,950\nGreat scene.\n\n366\n00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,570\nIf you remember,\nhe's walking away, grabs the book.\n\n367\n00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,410\nComes back up and he says to the guy.\n\n368\n00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,870\nShow me where it says,\nyou're gonna go to the mess hall and\n\n369\n00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,270\nshow me where, is to say where\nthe mess hall is in the book.\n\n370\n00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,850\nHe says, no, no, no.\n\n371\n00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,220\nIt doesn't show you where the mess hall\nis, but I get three square meals a day.\n\n372\n00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,040\nHe says, how do you know?\n\n373\n00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,250\nHe says, I just follow everybody\nelse when I'm hungry and\n\n374\n00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,690\neverybody winds up at the mess hall.\n\n375\n00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,360\nSo you know the idea was\nbasically this plan works it.\n\n376\n00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,910\nNot everything is in the book.\n\n377\n00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,420\nCertain things are self-evident,\nbut that doesn't mean that when\n\n378\n00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,710\nwe come to a court of law and a code of\nethics around how we manage, in this case,\n\n379\n00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,890\nevidence and chain of custody,\nthat stuff is irrefutable.\n\n380\n00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,960\nRight?\nIt's gotta be in the book.\n\n381\n00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,260\nYou've gotta write it down and\n\n382\n00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,640\nif you don't do it the right way,\nit's considered to be just invalid.\n\n383\n00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,070\nCan't really mess with that or\n\n384\n00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:00,830\nin any way imply something as\nthey were doing in the movie.\n\n385\n00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,540\nThat certain things are implied knowledge.\n\n386\n00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,230\nThere's no such thing as implied\nknowledge or in handling evidence.\n\n387\n00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,290\nIt either is or is not a certain way.\n\n388\n00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,640\nMust follow those rules, the rules of\nevidence, as we often talk about them.\n\n389\n00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,080\nSo, that's why we\nquestion on these things.\n\n390\n00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,610\nAlso for\n\n391\n00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,900\nevidence to be considered complete, it\nmust present the whole truth of an issue.\n\n392\n00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,990\nIn other words, really give an accurate\nrepresentation of the entire picture,\n\n393\n00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,670\nleave nothing in effect really unspoken or\nunviewed.\n\n394\n00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:29,320\nFor the evidence to be sufficient,\nthese are key words we kind of turn on,\n\n395\n00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,612\ncomplete, sufficient, reliable,\nin the case the last one.\n\n396\n00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:35,530\nAnd so, for\nit to be considered sufficient,\n\n397\n00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,710\nit must be persuasive enough to\nconvince a reasonable person.\n\n398\n00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,070\nThis is the reasonable man test that\nwe often hear about or talk about.\n\n399\n00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,388\nIf the average person on the street would\nlook at it, hear it, or somehow see it,\n\n400\n00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:49,897\nand think about it and kinda come\nup with the idea that they get it.\n\n401\n00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:52,610\nThen it's considered to be\na reasonable expectation.\n\n402\n00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,680\nSo we're talking about\nthe reasonable person.\n\n403\n00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,760\nAnd then for\nthe evidence to be reliable, reliable,\n\n404\n00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,780\nit must be consistent with the facts.\n\n405\n00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,560\nSo we consider that to be factual\nevidence, not circumstantial.\n\n406\n00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,180\nSo we can't say we imply something,\nwe could simply say these are the facts.\n\n407\n00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,040\nAnd the facts are not in dispute.\n\n408\n00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,970\nRight?\nWe can really not\n\n409\n00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,995\nargue with the fact that\nit is Tuesday today.\n\n410\n00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:14,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Although it is not actually, it is.\n\n411\n00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,795\n>> Wednesday.\n\n412\n00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:15,930\n>> Wednesday today.\n>> Good job, Adam.\n\n413\n00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,625\n>> Right?\nGood job.\n\n414\n00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:20,140\n[LAUGH] Good example, right,\npat myself on the back, good.\n\n415\n00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,330\nAll right.\nSo, were in a little bit of\n\n416\n00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,270\na time warp here.\n\n417\n00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,035\nThe Bermuda Triangle of IT TV.\n\n418\n00:19:24,035 --> 00:19:28,220\nBut we can't argue with the fact at the\nend of the day that certain things like\n\n419\n00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,080\nthat, what's today's date, whatever\ndate it is, what is the day today,\n\n420\n00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,300\nit's this time right now,\nthat kind of stuff's factual.\n\n421\n00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,480\nRight?\nWe can establish that\n\n422\n00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,130\nbeyond what we call reasonable doubt.\n\n423\n00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,830\nAnd, that's what we're\ntalking about there.\n\n424\n00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:42,800\nSo, those three statements for\nevidence to be considered either,\n\n425\n00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,680\ncomplete, to be sufficient or\nto be reliable.\n\n426\n00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,710\nVery important.\n\n427\n00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,430\nWant to understand how we classify\nevidence and think of it that way.\n\n428\n00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,850\nAll right.\nWe have a few terms we just\n\n429\n00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,440\nwant to identify.\n\n430\n00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,990\nSome vocabulary here,\nthat we wanna speak about.\n\n431\n00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:57,550\nAnd we have some attack types we\nwanna go through here as well.\n\n432\n00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,970\nSo this idea of exigent circumstances.\n\n433\n00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,500\nI love exigent circumstances.\n\n434\n00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,795\nI always thought that word was so\ncool, exigent.\n\n435\n00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:04,340\nRight?\n\n436\n00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,110\nAnd so the idea of exigent circumstances\n\n437\n00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,040\nis basically this idea that from\na law enforcement perspective,\n\n438\n00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:15,710\nif a law enforcement officer\nrepresentation of the law, whoever it is.\n\n439\n00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,695\nBut typically we're talking about police.\n\n440\n00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:19,630\nRight?\nMaybe a federal agent of some kind,\n\n441\n00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,480\nlike a federal marshal, whoever it may be.\n\n442\n00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,860\nBut a law enforcement officer,\nif they have reason to suspect\n\n443\n00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,790\nthat evidence may be destroyed\nduring something that's going on.\n\n444\n00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,200\nSome sort of activity that's going on.\n\n445\n00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,940\nThey have the ability to go and\nseize that evidence.\n\n446\n00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,580\nPrevent it from being destroyed.\n\n447\n00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,260\nThey don't need a warrant, for instance.\n\n448\n00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,597\nThey don't need anything other than this\nreasonable idea the exigent circumstances,\n\n449\n00:20:43,597 --> 00:20:47,010\nthe court will then sort out later\nwhether or not that was a good idea.\n\n450\n00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,863\nRight?\nIn certain cases, they may say, yeah,\n\n451\n00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:49,510\nno, good idea.\n\n452\n00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,550\nYou did that.\nYou stopped it.\n\n453\n00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,500\nWe'll allow it in.\n\n454\n00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,000\nOther times they'll say, sorry,\nyou violated this person's rights,\n\n455\n00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,860\ntheir Miranda rights, or their\nFirst Amendment rights, or whatever, and\n\n456\n00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,560\nas a result, the right to search and\nseizure, were violated so as a result, no.\n\n457\n00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,550\nThat's gonna effectively\nnot be allowed in.\n\n458\n00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:06,050\nRight?\nIt was private you weren't able to\n\n459\n00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:06,990\ndo that.\n\n460\n00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,480\nSo they may not necessarily be able to\ntake that evidence and wind up with it in\n\n461\n00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,590\na court of law, but they are allowed\nto act to safe-guard the evidence and\n\n462\n00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,510\nthen have a court figure whether\nwhat they did was legal or not.\n\n463\n00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,720\nIf it turns out to be not legal,\n\n464\n00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,870\nthen obviously the evidence is not used\nin the court during the court trial and\n\n465\n00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,950\nultimately makes it's way back to whoever\nthe owner was regardless of the outcome.\n\n466\n00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,900\nBut this is not about whether\nit's legal to do that.\n\n467\n00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,240\nIt's about the idea that you have to\nstop the destruction of evidence, and\n\n468\n00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,420\nthen a court decides if what\nyou did was legal or illegal.\n\n469\n00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,230\nSo you see this a lot when people are like\npulled over on the side of the road.\n\n470\n00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,830\nIf they're searching someones car.\n\n471\n00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,330\nIf a police officer has a reason to think\n\n472\n00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,720\nthat you maybe hiding you\nmaybe hiding something.\n\n473\n00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,020\nThey then have the right to search\nthe car and try and find it.\n\n474\n00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,860\nBecause that way if you get back in\nthe car you may destroy that evidence,\n\n475\n00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,880\nthat kind of thing.\n\n476\n00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,290\nWhen federal officers, if there is, for\n\n477\n00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:01,760\ninstance, computer crime being committed\nand they come in usually it's the ATF and\n\n478\n00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,650\nor the Secret Service that will\nshow up to do this kind of stuff.\n\n479\n00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,130\nIf they come into a business to\nseize it and seize computers and\n\n480\n00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,320\nassets, they will come in with guns drawn,\ntypically.\n\n481\n00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,810\nUntil you back away from the computer,\nfederal agents, whatever, but\n\n482\n00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:19,131\nthey will make it very clear to you\nthat they are, number one, very serious.\n\n483\n00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,718\nRight?\nBecause anyone pointing a gun at you\n\n484\n00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:22,130\nis somebody you wanna take seriously.\n\n485\n00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,190\nAnd number two, they're doing so because\nthey want you to understand that they\n\n486\n00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:32,350\nare acting in the best way from their\nperspective to protect evidence.\n\n487\n00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,080\nAnd so they think if they tell you\nto move away from the computer,\n\n488\n00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,800\nmay be booby trapped, that kind of thing.\n\n489\n00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,470\nSo they're acting with this\nidea of exigent circumstance\n\n490\n00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,410\nin mind typically when they do that.\n\n491\n00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,070\nAnd you never want to put that\nto the test by the way because\n\n492\n00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,245\ntypically that winds up with\na lot of bad things happening.\n\n493\n00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:49,690\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So Enticement versus Entrapment,\n\n494\n00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:51,870\nlet's just talk about these terms.\n\n495\n00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,620\nLet's define what they are.\n\n496\n00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,350\nWe have spoken about enticement and\nentrapment before.\n\n497\n00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,080\nWe also spoke about it in the SSCP shows\nand talked about it there as well because\n\n498\n00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,480\nit is an important criteria for\nyou to be aware of.\n\n499\n00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,860\nSo the idea of enticement is\nthat something is legal and\n\n500\n00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,270\nconsidered to be ethical.\n\n501\n00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:09,480\nMeaning, we give somebody the opportunity\nthrough kind of the setup or the situation\n\n502\n00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,300\nto make bad decisions if they choose to,\nbut we don't force them to do it.\n\n503\n00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,170\nIn other words we don't\ntrick them into doing it.\n\n504\n00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,180\nWe give them the opportunity to walk up to\nthe door, but they have to choose to open\n\n505\n00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,610\nthe door, unlock it, and walk through it,\nin effect is what we said.\n\n506\n00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,920\nSo enticement is legal,\nit is considered legal and ethical.\n\n507\n00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,010\nEntrapment on the other hand, not legal.\n\n508\n00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,030\nNot ethical.\n\n509\n00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,410\nIf you entrap somebody, they basically,\nget a get out of jail free card.\n\n510\n00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,760\nThey can not be prosecuted for\n\n511\n00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,880\nwhatever activities they engaged in if\nyou entrap them into doing something.\n\n512\n00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,410\nEffectively, entrapping\nsomebody is effectively,\n\n513\n00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:43,460\ntricking them into making a bad decision.\n\n514\n00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,730\nSo, it's not about letting them walk up\nto the door and make their own decision.\n\n515\n00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,634\nIt's about pushing them, in effect,\nthrough the door and saying on the other\n\n516\n00:23:49,634 --> 00:23:52,424\nside of the door, hey, you've\ntrespassed and now you're under arrest.\n\n517\n00:23:52,424 --> 00:23:53,430\nRight?\nThat kind of thing.\n\n518\n00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,289\nYou can't do that.\nSo entrapment is illegal but\n\n519\n00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:57,410\nenticement is seen as being legal.\n\n520\n00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:00,275\nPlease make sure you are comfortable\nwith the difference between the two.\n\n521\n00:24:00,275 --> 00:24:04,701\nWanna make sure, even though we may not\nreally see this distinction very often,\n\n522\n00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:09,194\nin practice especially, unless you're\nengaging in things like either on the law\n\n523\n00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:13,297\nenforcement side or occasionally having\nto testify as an expert witness or\n\n524\n00:24:13,297 --> 00:24:15,600\nthings like to somebody's activities.\n\n525\n00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,760\nYou may never see this distinction\nin production in other words.\n\n526\n00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,690\nBut it is important to understand it and\njust be aware of it.\n\n527\n00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,830\nSo wanna make sure we do that.\n\n528\n00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,670\nAnd then,\nwe wanna talk a bit about attack types.\n\n529\n00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,020\nSo the idea with attack types is really\njust quickly going through and kind of\n\n530\n00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,900\nhelping us to understand that there are\ndifferent kinds of attacks we may face.\n\n531\n00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,170\nAnd so we just wanna review them,\njust be aware of them.\n\n532\n00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,750\nSomething called a Salami Attack.\n\n533\n00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,030\nThis is where we take\na bunch of small attacks and\n\n534\n00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,890\nkind of roll them up,\nlittle by little, nibble away here and\n\n535\n00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,580\nthere, with the hopes that the larger\ngoal of the overall attack type\n\n536\n00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,525\nis not gonna be seen because we break it\nup in effects like a fragmentation attack.\n\n537\n00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:51,025\nBut we call it a Salami Attack.\n\n538\n00:24:51,025 --> 00:24:53,975\nIt's often gonna happen\nin financial areas.\n\n539\n00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:56,165\nSo that old, urban myth and legend about,\n\n540\n00:24:56,165 --> 00:25:00,265\nif we just knock a penny off each\ntransaction or just skim it off the top,\n\n541\n00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:04,745\nthat kind of thing,\na roundup to the next whole number.\n\n542\n00:25:04,745 --> 00:25:09,165\nIn a financial system we skim all that off\nthe top, we could become billionaires,\n\n543\n00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:10,870\nliterally if it goes on long enough.\n\n544\n00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:13,500\nAnd there have been evidence of\nthese kinds of attacks in the past.\n\n545\n00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,360\nCertain well-known documented stories\nabout certain kinds of attacks that have\n\n546\n00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,510\noccurred in this light over the years.\n\n547\n00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,380\nBut generically, we call this\na Salami Attack, so just be aware of that.\n\n548\n00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,870\nData Diddling.\n\n549\n00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:28,520\nData Diddling is the idea of\naltering existing data in some way.\n\n550\n00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,700\nSo if we go in and modify data, we refer\nto that as a Data Diddling attack.\n\n551\n00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,187\nWe'd try to say that with a straight face\n\n552\n00:25:34,187 --> 00:25:34,772\nat all times-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n553\n00:25:34,772 --> 00:25:36,410\n>> And never laugh, while we say that.\n\n554\n00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,390\nOr it's like a tickle me\nemo kind of attack, but\n\n555\n00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,430\nthat's what we talk about there.\n\n556\n00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:45,830\nPassword sniffing, effectively monitoring\na network to gather passwords.\n\n557\n00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,870\nSo whatever software there may\nbe that you will use to do that.\n\n558\n00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:52,330\nHence, the reason we often talk about\nconfidentiality and encrypting data, so\n\n559\n00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,350\nwe don't send our passwords in the clear.\n\n560\n00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,720\nIP Spoofing, this is also sometimes\nreferred to as a masquerading or\n\n561\n00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,740\nat least a form of a masquerade attack.\n\n562\n00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,020\nWe effectively take on the guise\nof somebody else's IP address.\n\n563\n00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,672\nSo we use it and\npretend to be them, in effect.\n\n564\n00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:07,760\nWe could do this with MAC\naddresses as well, by the way.\n\n565\n00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,550\nWe have MAC address spoofing attacks and\ntools that will help you to do that.\n\n566\n00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:15,360\nI'm not very common, but\noften we do see this in some kinds and\n\n567\n00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,860\nsome forms of attacks.\n\n568\n00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,810\nDumpster Diving where we go and basically\nrummage through the trash looking for\n\n569\n00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:23,530\nunshredded documents, thrown away manuals,\n\n570\n00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:28,360\nperhaps discarded media that may have\ndata remnants on it, whatever it may be.\n\n571\n00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,650\nForm of social engineering,\n\n572\n00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:32,940\nwe do consider dumpster diving to\nbe a form of social engineering.\n\n573\n00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,925\nSo please make that connection and\nbe aware of that distinction.\n\n574\n00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:39,970\nWire-tapping, where we effectively\ntap either the phone line or\n\n575\n00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:42,910\nthese days it may be Internet related\ntraffic that's going back and\n\n576\n00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,090\nforth, like void traffic,\nsomething like that.\n\n577\n00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,155\nBut however we get there,\n\n578\n00:26:46,155 --> 00:26:49,640\nwire-tapping traditionally used to\nrefer to tapping analog phone lines.\n\n579\n00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,060\nThat's kind of where we got it from.\n\n580\n00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,020\nCuz you used to have to go down\nto the switching office, and\n\n581\n00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,280\nactually tap into the line\nin order to listen to.\n\n582\n00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,340\nAnd that's where the name came from.\n\n583\n00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,200\nBut the ideas are considered\nto be a passive attack.\n\n584\n00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,540\nSo it's an attack that does\nnot actively do anything.\n\n585\n00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,690\nWe're just kind of recording and\npassively listening.\n\n586\n00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,890\nAnd then we have this\nidea of cyber squatting.\n\n587\n00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:11,360\nCyber Squatting is this\nidea of taking over a name,\n\n588\n00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,060\na fully qualified domain name, or a name\nregistration, either on the Internet or\n\n589\n00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,530\nWorld Wide Web or\nperhaps in a network of some kind.\n\n590\n00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:23,260\nAnd using it to your advantage meaning,\nin effect either blackmailing\n\n591\n00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:27,190\nthe person who owns it to get it back or\ncharging them or something like that.\n\n592\n00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,530\nIt is now,\nthere are laws that make this illegal.\n\n593\n00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,190\nEarly on, in the kind of Wild West days\nof the Internet, the World Wide Web,\n\n594\n00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,840\nespecially, this was done a lot, and there\nwas really no way to defend against it,\n\n595\n00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,400\ncuz there were no laws that said\nit was illegal for you to register\n\n596\n00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,760\nsomeone else's namespace if it was\navailable and you got to it first.\n\n597\n00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,370\nYou didn't have to use\nit in order to own it.\n\n598\n00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,500\nYou just had to own it.\n\n599\n00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,990\nNow, we say you have to register it, but\nyou have to show commercial use of it.\n\n600\n00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,710\nIf you don't really have\na viable reason for\n\n601\n00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,950\nowning it,\nwe effectively can take it away from you.\n\n602\n00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,690\nThe courts can basically mandate\nyou have to give it back.\n\n603\n00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:01,540\nSo this was all the rage a few years ago,\nand it does come up again pretty\n\n604\n00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,380\nmuch every four years, around\nelections in the United States anyway.\n\n605\n00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,750\nPresidential elections, people go out and\nregister all the domain derivatives for\n\n606\n00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:09,790\nthe candidates.\n\n607\n00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,010\nAnd if one becomes president they\ntry to then effectively own that.\n\n608\n00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,710\nSo it happened to George W.Bush,\na little bit,\n\n609\n00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,290\nwhere everybody was trying to\nregister stuff around him.\n\n610\n00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,630\nSo that kind of thing, and\nthat's why we talk about that.\n\n611\n00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,980\nSo then we have, just the last item we\nwant to talk about the code of ethics.\n\n612\n00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:30,600\nSo the ISC squared Code of Ethics is\nvery important as a CISSP candidate.\n\n613\n00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,420\nWanna make sure you are aware of\nthe Code of Ethics, the URL for\n\n614\n00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,500\nthe Code of Ethics on\nthe landing page is there.\n\n615\n00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,640\nAnd we would encourage you to go out and\ntake a look,\n\n616\n00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,880\nyou will definitely wanna make sure\nyou understand the Code of Ethics.\n\n617\n00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,600\nYou will be asked to adhere to it.\n\n618\n00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,260\nOnce you pass the exam and\nyou then go to apply to become a CISSP,\n\n619\n00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,530\nyou will have to basically electronically\nsign as part of your application process\n\n620\n00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,480\nthat you understand, have read, and\nwill adhere to the Code of Ethics, so\n\n621\n00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,638\nyou do wanna be familiar with it.\n\n622\n00:28:55,638 --> 00:28:58,185\nIt has a preamble as you could see there,\n\n623\n00:28:58,185 --> 00:29:00,975\nalong with what are called\nthe Code of Ethics Cannons.\n\n624\n00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:05,495\nAnd so you want to be familiar with the\npreamble understand that the safety and\n\n625\n00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:10,340\nwelfare of society is really our common\ngood and we ultimately act therefore.\n\n626\n00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,360\nTo not only safeguard that, and\nfurther that, but we strictly adhere to\n\n627\n00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,620\nthe Code of Ethics Canons which\nare listed below the preamble.\n\n628\n00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:20,670\nAnd the most important Code of\nEthic Canon, you can see there\n\n629\n00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:24,810\nis ultimately to protect society,\nthe common good, public trust, etc.\n\n630\n00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:29,160\nBut to act honorably, act justly,\nact legally, provide diligent and\n\n631\n00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,970\ncompetent service, and to advance and\nprotect the profession.\n\n632\n00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,940\nThe most important thing,\nit's stated there, but\n\n633\n00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,300\nit may not be 100% clear, so\nlet me just come right out and tell you.\n\n634\n00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,040\nThe most important thing with the Code\nof Ethics is to ensure life safety.\n\n635\n00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,690\nTo make sure that anybody who we\nultimately have in our charge,\n\n636\n00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,890\nas an individual, a coworker whatever,\n\n637\n00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:52,910\nwe always focus on their safety before\nwe focus on the safety of information.\n\n638\n00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:55,980\nIf it ever comes down to a choice,\nwe always wanna save people and\n\n639\n00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,070\nnot save infrastructure.\n\n640\n00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,630\nI guess, is the right way of putting that.\n\n641\n00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,815\nCode of Ethics is really about making\nsure that a security practitioner,\n\n642\n00:30:01,815 --> 00:30:04,775\nmembers of the Info Sec Community\nthat we understand how to act?\n\n643\n00:30:04,775 --> 00:30:08,465\nAnd to represent our profession in\nsuch a way that we always bring\n\n644\n00:30:08,465 --> 00:30:11,695\na good light to that, and\nwe always act honorably and ethically, and\n\n645\n00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:13,805\ndon't engage in unethical behavior.\n\n646\n00:30:13,805 --> 00:30:17,925\nSo very important, hopefully that will\nhelp you to be focused as a professional\n\n647\n00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:20,205\nand really understand\nwhere you need to be, but\n\n648\n00:30:20,205 --> 00:30:21,815\ndo make sure you're familiar\nwith the Code of Ethics.\n\n649\n00:30:21,815 --> 00:30:23,535\nDefinitely something to look at.\n\n650\n00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:26,720\nSo I think that pretty much wraps up\nour discussion in the legal area.\n\n651\n00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,395\n>> Yeah, Absolutely.\n\n652\n00:30:27,395 --> 00:30:31,080\nAnd most of you have probably\nnot gone to Law School.\n\n653\n00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,060\nIn fact, I would imagine\nthe majority of you haven't.\n\n654\n00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,680\nSo you are not expected to be\nan attorney on the exam, but\n\n655\n00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,340\nyou do need to have a grasp of these\nconcepts because they come into play.\n\n656\n00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,505\nWhen we deal with security we\nare dealing with illegal activities,\n\n657\n00:30:42,505 --> 00:30:45,219\nthat's why this job position even exists.\n\n658\n00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:46,870\nPeople are doing things illegal.\n\n659\n00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,360\nWe need to be able to recognize that,\nand know how to properly handle this so.\n\n660\n00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:49,980\n>> Correct.\n\n661\n00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,679\n>> I think we're getting pretty thorough\non it, so that probably wraps it up.\n\n662\n00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:54,170\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n663\n00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,050\n>> I want to remind everybody,\n\n664\n00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,620\nif you ever have any questions on\nthis stuff, be sure to check us out.\n\n665\n00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,673\nIf you're watching live on

00:00:51,180\n>> So\nwe're going to talk a little bit, and\n\n12\n00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,860\nabsolutely correct we\nare going to hit those.\n\n13\n00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,790\nWe'll talk a little bit about this idea of\n\n14\n00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,600\nhow do we deal with\nthe aspects of security design.\n\n15\n00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,010\nThey're going to help us to understand\nhow to build better systems.\n\n16\n00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,060\nBut look at it from the, as we said,\nthe physical design perspective,\n\n17\n00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,650\nthe environmental design perspective.\n\n18\n00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,510\nSo what are we going to\ndo with those things and\n\n19\n00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,430\nhow are we going to deal with them?\n\n20\n00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,070\nSo we've talked in some of our prior\nshows about the building blocks.\n\n21\n00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,720\nFrom a logical standpoint.\n\n22\n00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,480\nAccess control, for instance.\n\n23\n00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,530\nAnd building a better mousetrap\nwhen it comes to things like\n\n24\n00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,100\nfiguring out how to monitor.\n\n25\n00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,330\nHow to maintain system integrity.\n\n26\n00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,110\nIn this discussion we're going to really\nbe focused on the Physicality of security.\n\n27\n00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,660\nSo, how do we design buildings and\n\n28\n00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,570\nplace buildings to ensure that we\nhave more secure entry points?\n\n29\n00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,250\nMonitor these entry points.\n\n30\n00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,270\nHow do we place guards and\nlocks on doors and close-circuit TV and\n\n31\n00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,740\nlighting to advantage to make sure we\ndon't leave, you know, basically spots\n\n32\n00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,420\nthat are unmonitored and potentially\nleave room for people to sneak in, right?\n\n33\n00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:52,240\nSo, generically,\nwe call this whole idea Crime prevention\n\n34\n00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,740\nthrough environmental design, or\nwhat is known as CPTED, or CP TED.\n\n35\n00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,270\nWhich is the acronym simply for\nthis idea, better design prevents crime.\n\n36\n00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,230\nBecause if we build buildings\nthat are at ground level.\n\n37\n00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,350\nKind of raised up, above the surrounding\nareas you drive up to them and\n\n38\n00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,080\nwe leave an open field around\nthem to see what's coming.\n\n39\n00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,600\nIt's a lot less likely people can\nsneak up than if we build it,\n\n40\n00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,520\neither at ground level or\nmaybe even slightly below ground level so\n\n41\n00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,810\nyou drive up but it's hard to see\nbecause there's, land spray, shrubs and\n\n42\n00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,610\nall that kind of stuff around it and\nthere's a lot of hiding spots,\n\n43\n00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,880\npeople may be able to hide in\nthe bushes outside may be able to\n\n44\n00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,190\ntake advantage of a parking garages that\nare closed in and dark things like that.\n\n45\n00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,060\nThose are the kinds of things that we will\nbe talking about in this particular area.\n\n46\n00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,050\nSo, as a thought process, as\na methodology, just something to consider.\n\n47\n00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,680\nRight?\n\n48\n00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,780\nCircle back for just a minute think\nabout the three building blocks,\n\n49\n00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,720\nthe three pillars of information security.\n\n50\n00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,300\nWe often spend time talking about we talk\nabout confidentiality, we talk about\n\n51\n00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,600\nintegrity, we talk about availability in\nrelation to everything we do in any of\n\n52\n00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,360\nthe areas of information security and\ninformation security management.\n\n53\n00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,000\nAnd so this idea or\nthese ideas of confidentiality and\n\n54\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,730\nintegrity, they're important.\n\n55\n00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,779\nDon't get me wrong, want to focus on them,\nbut, in this area, we're not going really\n\n56\n00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:11,030\nnot going to talk as much about\nthings that provide confidentiality.\n\n57\n00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,860\nReally not talk about things\nthat provide integrity.\n\n58\n00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,360\nWe're focusing on things that provide or\n\n59\n00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,330\ndeal with the way in which we\nmake information available\n\n60\n00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,660\nbecause we're focused on design that\nwill help us to safeguard information.\n\n61\n00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,950\n>> Right.\n>> And so all three are there, but\n\n62\n00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,260\nreally we're kind of subtly\ntalking about all three,\n\n63\n00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,250\nmaybe leaning more around availability\nbased on design than confidentiality or\n\n64\n00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,580\nintegrity, just to put that in\nperspective to be aware of that.\n\n65\n00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,420\nSo as we begin talking\nabout some things and\n\n66\n00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,910\nthen we're going to probably\nmake some notes as we go here.\n\n67\n00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,680\nSo as we begin talking\nabout some of these things,\n\n68\n00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,460\nlet's throw some vocabulary out there for\nyou.\n\n69\n00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,260\nLet's talk about some terminology.\n\n70\n00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,970\nLet's start with things like bollards.\n\n71\n00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:47,470\nRight.\n>> Okay.\n\n72\n00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,460\n>> So, let's define what a bollard is.\n\n73\n00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,320\nA bollard is going to\nbe a concrete barrier.\n\n74\n00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,500\nA crash barrier is what\nwe often refer to it as\n\n75\n00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,080\nthat will be used to block access\nup close to buildings or areas.\n\n76\n00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,290\nSo you may see these\nout in front of malls.\n\n77\n00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,080\nYou may see them in front\nof secure buildings where\n\n78\n00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,710\neither they have what\nlook like light posts or\n\n79\n00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,390\nsomehow concrete tubular forms that\nare coming up out of the ground.\n\n80\n00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,730\nThey may have those huge planters that\nthey put in front of doors or the big\n\n81\n00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,720\nballs that look like, those bouncy balls\nyou see in gyms that you exercise on, but\n\n82\n00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,150\nthey're made out of concrete.\n\n83\n00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,050\nThese are all types of bollards\nthat are basically used.\n\n84\n00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,850\nThey may have these big gates that come\ndown, like retail stores have that,\n\n85\n00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,740\nwhere they have the barrier that\nwill prevent you from getting in.\n\n86\n00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,600\nAll these things are considered to\nbe one form or another of a bollard.\n\n87\n00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,690\nThis is the idea where basically we're\njust going to have some sort of device\n\n88\n00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,270\nthat will prevent direct drive up access.\n\n89\n00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:40,835\n>> Right.\n\n90\n00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:44,840\n>> So, you've probably all,\nwe've all seen them at some point and\n\n91\n00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,360\nmaybe interacted with them and\nmay not realized what they are, but\n\n92\n00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,430\nany of these kinds of things\nare what we're going to talk about.\n\n93\n00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,030\nYou got to remember, do a lot of work\nin various places all over and, yes,\n\n94\n00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,700\nI remember doing some work for a customer,\n\n95\n00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,390\none of the customers that I have happens\nto be a military like installation,\n\n96\n00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:07,320\na base, and so when you go through and\nyou are clearing security at the huge\n\n97\n00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,430\nguard gate, the armed guards come out,\nthey've got the dogs,\n\n98\n00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,490\ndo the bomb sniff, the whole nine yards\nand you're held in this almost like\n\n99\n00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,980\nman trapped area where they have to\nclear you before they let you through.\n\n100\n00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,530\nSo they have the bollards, the crash\ngates there as well where there's a guy\n\n101\n00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,570\nwho sits on the button or basically.\n\n102\n00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,010\nTo the trigger inside of a guard gate.\n\n103\n00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,190\nAnd these things are hydraulic if they\ncome up out of the ground, right?\n\n104\n00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,530\n>> Right.\n>> So they're going to be spring loaded.\n\n105\n00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,300\nWith hydraulics.\n\n106\n00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,010\nAnd these things will come up out of\nthe ground in a tenth of a second.\n\n107\n00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:36,550\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n108\n00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,408\n>> Just they hit the button,\n\n109\n00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:38,151\nand boom up they come.\n\n110\n00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:41,878\n.And so there's somebody who typically\nis going to be sitting there, and\n\n111\n00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:43,630\nis going to be in the gate.\n\n112\n00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,780\nReally specifically designed to just be\nthe trigger person on these in high secure\n\n113\n00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,040\ninstallations where, if there's\nanything that may be going wrong,\n\n114\n00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,870\nsomebody's trying to get out, off base\nwhen they're not supposed to, trying to\n\n115\n00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,070\nget in, they potentially can trigger\nthese things and try to stop the car.\n\n116\n00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,642\n>> Right.\n>> Stop the truck, whatever it may be.\n\n117\n00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:01,380\nThese are very,\nvery heavy duty crash barriers,\n\n118\n00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,400\nso this is the kind of thing we\ntalk about when we talk about these\n\n119\n00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800\nparticular solutions just\nto be aware of those.\n\n120\n00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,330\nWe also talk about the idea\nof natural surveillance.\n\n121\n00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,750\nI mentioned this where we talk about\ncrime prevention through environmental so\n\n122\n00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,251\nideal of natural surveillance which is,\nI don't know how to spell that either.\n\n123\n00:06:18,251 --> 00:06:19,930\n>> [LAUGH] I knew that was\ngoing to be a rough one.\n\n124\n00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,770\n>> I don't know how to do it,\nmaybe you ask something like that.\n\n125\n00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,700\n>> Something for the notes.\n\n126\n00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,850\n>> Absolutely we can clean it up.\n\n127\n00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:30,690\nSo natural surveillance is this idea of\nthis environmental design concept where\n\n128\n00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,320\nwe use the landscape to our advantage,\nso if a building is built and we\n\n129\n00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,450\nhave the ability to be able to, clear some\nof the landscape around it maybe knockdown\n\n130\n00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,060\nsome of the shrubs, get it a little bit\nlower so we could see what's going on.\n\n131\n00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,830\nWe could obviously then see people\napproaching, we put the building up,\n\n132\n00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,160\nmaybe there's a hill,\nwe build the building up on the hill so\n\n133\n00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,740\npeople have to drive up to it we can\nsee them coming from a far distance,\n\n134\n00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,430\nthat kind of thing as well\nmay be something to consider.\n\n135\n00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,190\nSo these are the ideas that we basically\ncan see and use the natural surrounding\n\n136\n00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,940\nenvironment to be able to see what's going\non,to be able to deal with it in some way.\n\n137\n00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,700\nThis idea of natural surveillance\nwe often talk about.\n\n138\n00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,900\nSo just be aware of that and\njust think about that as well.\n\n139\n00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,025\nShedding here in real time.\n\n140\n00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:15,720\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So we also talk about study of\n\n141\n00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,520\ndesigning a physical security program\nby looking at the elements that we\n\n142\n00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,040\nare building into our buildings and\nthen how are we going to use them.\n\n143\n00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,140\nTo our advantage, so do we have a common\nlobby, a greeting area, maybe right?\n\n144\n00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,780\nWhere people coming in, and if so,\ndo we put a security guard or\n\n145\n00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,020\nsome sort of guard down there?\n\n146\n00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,420\nMaybe in plain clothes,\nobviously maybe not wearing a uniform.\n\n147\n00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,030\nWe've all walked into this office building\nor whatever office building it may be\n\n148\n00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,880\nwhere we see there's the person who greets\neverybody in the lobby, has you sign in,\n\n149\n00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,250\nmay offer directions, things like that.\n\n150\n00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,660\nSo this is something that what happens,\nthat we we don't let people just come and\n\n151\n00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,800\ngo without knowing who they are and\nwhat they're doing.\n\n152\n00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,733\n>> Right.\n>> If we have an elevator lobby down\n\n153\n00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:57,628\nthere in some of these larger\noffice buildings where\n\n154\n00:07:57,628 --> 00:08:00,480\nthey have different tenants\non different floors.\n\n155\n00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,819\nYou see this in bigger cities,\nmaybe New York Lost and things like that,\n\n156\n00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:07,125\nwhere there's different elevator\nlobbies for different companies.\n\n157\n00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:07,740\n>> Yeah.\n\n158\n00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,280\n>> And so if they rent all those floors,\nyou have to have a card key access,\n\n159\n00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,220\nor something, to get into that elevator\nlobby, to go up to their floors.\n\n160\n00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,212\nAnd there are guards typically posted,\nkeeping an eye on those that may have\n\n161\n00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:21,500\nsome sort of access control, the cattle\nshoots with the doors, things like that.\n\n162\n00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,360\n>> I used to work with a local power\ncompany, and went down to their building.\n\n163\n00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,940\nAnd they handled nuclear plants.\n\n164\n00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,250\n>> Oh, that's always fun.\n\n165\n00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,190\n>> One of the things was,\nwhen you went into their building,\n\n166\n00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,240\nI didn't handle it directly\nfrom this facility but\n\n167\n00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,390\nthey've got the systems there\nthat would access that.\n\n168\n00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,790\nWhen you walked in,\nyou had to go to the gentleman,\n\n169\n00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:41,280\nthe guard up there at the front desk,\ntell him what floor you were going to.\n\n170\n00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,670\nHe told you which elevator to get on,\n>> Right.\n\n171\n00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,950\n>> And\nthere were no buttons in the elevator.\n\n172\n00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,620\nYou couldn't choose which\nfloor you wanted to go to.\n\n173\n00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,140\nSo you got on the elevator and he directed\nit to the appropriate floor after he\n\n174\n00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,640\nverified your credentials and that you\nwere authorized to go to that floor.\n\n175\n00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,540\nAnd then when you got off the elevator,\nyou still weren't in.\n\n176\n00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,990\nThere was another layer of a man trap,\n\n177\n00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,720\nwhich we're going to talk\nabout later where somebody up\n\n178\n00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,390\nthere had to be expecting your arrival\nto allow you into the actual facility.\n\n179\n00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:04,890\nSo well.\n\n180\n00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,420\nGood example of that.\n\n181\n00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,900\n>> All that so\nyou can pay your power bill.\n\n182\n00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,970\n>> Yes.\nExactly.\n\n183\n00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,980\nHad to teach them the latest version\nof Office I think or something.\n\n184\n00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,330\nSo that's kind of good, those are always\nfun when you get to, at least for us,\n\n185\n00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,740\nthe kind of things we do and certainly any\nof you that are watching if you do this\n\n186\n00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,330\nkind of stuff, security related obviously,\nbut if you get to travel around and\n\n187\n00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,690\ndeal with different customers as opposed\nto maybe working only for one company,\n\n188\n00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,890\nwhat we do, the line of work Mike and\n\n189\n00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,990\nI are in where we're either training or\ndealing with a variety of different\n\n190\n00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,150\ncustomers around these ideas we tend\nto see a lot of different environments.\n\n191\n00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,250\nWe get to travel to and\nwork with a lot of different customers and\n\n192\n00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,980\nso I see a variety of things I would never\nsee otherwise, because I don't work for\n\n193\n00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,190\njust one company building\none protection profile.\n\n194\n00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,290\nSo it's a little bit more\ninteresting in that respect,\n\n195\n00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,670\nas I get to see a lot of this\nstuff out in the real world.\n\n196\n00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,660\nPlus I get a lot of cool stories\nI get to talk about as well.\n\n197\n00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,380\nAll right, so, yeah,\n\n198\n00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,750\nwhat are some of the issues we face when\nwe're trying to set up and select a site?\n\n199\n00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,730\nObviously visibility,\nwe've talked a bit about this.\n\n200\n00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,780\nWhere is the building?\n\n201\n00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,350\nDo we want it to be out in plain sight,\nput a sign on the wall and\n\n202\n00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,070\nsay this is where we run\nthe nuclear power from?\n\n203\n00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,230\nOr do we want it to be a little\nbit les less opportunistic,\n\n204\n00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,190\na little less likely to be seen.\n\n205\n00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,150\nA lot of times data centers, right.\n\n206\n00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,850\nYou may find them in industrial warehouse\nareas where they are being set up, but\n\n207\n00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:21,830\nyou don't see signs on\nthe outside of the wall saying.\n\n208\n00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,710\nThis is Data Vault 2000 or\n\n209\n00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,710\nwhatever because we don't want people\nto know what's goes on in there.\n\n210\n00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,190\nAnd it's a question of visibility.\n\n211\n00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,800\nJust how visible do we want to be?\n\n212\n00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,520\nAlso, surrounding external areas and\nexternal sites, what's around us, not\n\n213\n00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,860\nenough to say we're secure, because we're\nin this building, and this is what it is.\n\n214\n00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,130\nWhat's the area around us?\n\n215\n00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,950\nAre we in the middle of an area that may\nattract a certain kind of activity, and\n\n216\n00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,360\nas a result, is that good or\nbad for us, right?\n\n217\n00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360\nWant to think about that.\n\n218\n00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,400\nAre we near police,\n\n219\n00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,040\nare we near fire, how close are we to\nthose kind of issues, those kind of areas.\n\n220\n00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,530\nA lot of data centers are sighted in,\nbig data centers,\n\n221\n00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,160\nI'm talking about huge, really big ones,\nare sighted right near or\n\n222\n00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,044\nvery, very close to emergency services,\nso that if there's a fire,\n\n223\n00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:08,380\nsomething like that they can roll out and\nbe there very, very quickly.\n\n224\n00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,270\nThey are sited very close to\nmain switching stations and\n\n225\n00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,670\npower junction areas.\n\n226\n00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,250\nWhere there's a lot of this\nkind of infrastructure.\n\n227\n00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,115\nSo you kind of see them in city cores\nas opposed to out in residential.\n\n228\n00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:25,025\nAreas where there might not be as heavy\nan emphasis on some of these systems,\n\n229\n00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:26,035\nthat kind of thing.\n\n230\n00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:27,145\nWhat about accessibility?\n\n231\n00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:30,760\nYou know, are we near or\noff a main road for instance, right?\n\n232\n00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,840\nHow do we get to this location?\n\n233\n00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,660\nIs there signage?\n\n234\n00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,130\nSo when you go and try to find the NSA or\nthe CIA on the belt loop in Washington,\n\n235\n00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,650\nfor years the joke was everybody\nknew they were there, but\n\n236\n00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:45,810\nthere was no sign that said the NSA is\nright off this exit right over here,\n\n237\n00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,440\nbecause it was just a well kept not so\nwell kept.\n\n238\n00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,970\n>> Right.\n>> But basically just a secret in\n\n239\n00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,080\nthe sense they didn't want to announce\nthe presence of this embassy.\n\n240\n00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,660\n>> Right.\n>> But\n\n241\n00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,765\nthe fact they have this massive,\nblack, monolithic building, right?\n\n242\n00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:56,770\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Sitting out there in\n\n243\n00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,640\nthe middle of nothing.\n\n244\n00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,085\n>> Right.\n>> Kind of gave it away, right?\n\n245\n00:11:59,085 --> 00:11:59,930\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n246\n00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,330\nthe idea about some of this stuff is,\njust how visible do we want to be?\n\n247\n00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,930\nRight, security through obscurity,\nsecurity through design,\n\n248\n00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,880\nhide in plain sight,\ntalk about all these different concepts.\n\n249\n00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,670\nBut at the end of the day, some things we\nhave to consider when we talk about how\n\n250\n00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,770\nwe're going to build our infrastructure,\nwhat we're going to do with it.\n\n251\n00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,560\nSo just be aware of some of that.\n\n252\n00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,400\nAlso things like natural disasters,\nhow prone,\n\n253\n00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,380\nis the area that we are building it and\ngoing to host it, to these things.\n\n254\n00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,920\nAre you putting your data center down\nin the middle of tornado alley in\n\n255\n00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,650\nthe midwest?\n\n256\n00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,445\nAre you dropping it on the west coast\nwhere you got to deal with landslides?\n\n257\n00:12:30,445 --> 00:12:34,540\nLike fire,\nnatural issues like forest fires,\n\n258\n00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,190\nwe're going to deal with\npotentially earthquakes.\n\n259\n00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,530\nHow about on the east coast where we are,\nwe don't have a lot of that, but\n\n260\n00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,360\nwe do have hurricanes certainly, floods,\n\n261\n00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,830\nthings like that from torrential rains,\nso there's really no good play per se.\n\n262\n00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,225\nI'm thinking personally like maybe\nfloating an orbit above the planet below.\n\n263\n00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:54,290\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> Horizon, something like that.\n\n264\n00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,930\nBut then you've got to worry about all\nthat space junk floating around out there.\n\n265\n00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,110\nRight?\n>> True you might have your own set of\n\n266\n00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,110\nhazards out there.\n\n267\n00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,940\n>> Yeah 50 years worth of garbage\nsatellites that nobody wants anymore.\n\n268\n00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,200\nSo these are all things that we,\nas security professionals,\n\n269\n00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,110\nCISSP candidates for some of you,\nif not all of you ultimately.\n\n270\n00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,800\nCertainly for somebody like myself,\nwho is a practicing CISSP.\n\n271\n00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,050\nThese are things we\nhave to think about and\n\n272\n00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:17,690\nwe're often asked to provide guidance on.\n\n273\n00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,540\nThe company and\nthe business we do work with.\n\n274\n00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,330\nIf that were,\n\n275\n00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:25,050\nadvising about security, maybe looking for\nguidance on some of these items.\n\n276\n00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,650\nThis is the time to throw that knowledge\nout on the table to talk about some of\n\n277\n00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,790\nthese things and make sure you bring them\nup and make sure people are aware of them,\n\n278\n00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,015\nso it's very important to\nbe thinking of about that.\n\n279\n00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,135\nMike mentioned man traps earlier.\n\n280\n00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:39,305\nSo let's talk about man trap and\nwhat they are.\n\n281\n00:13:39,305 --> 00:13:42,045\nMay actually want to see if we can\nget a picture of one up real quick.\n\n282\n00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:44,795\nJust while we're talking,\nI'll kind of narrate what it is.\n\n283\n00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:45,802\n>> All right.\n>> If not, we could draw one.\n\n284\n00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:46,432\nOne real quickly.\n\n285\n00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:49,272\nPut a little stick figure\nin there in the boxes.\n\n286\n00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:53,522\nA mantrap is basically a two sided box and\nthe idea behind it is\n\n287\n00:13:53,522 --> 00:13:58,870\nthat you walk into this cage from one end\nand it's a guarded entrance of some kind.\n\n288\n00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,380\nYou're buzzed in, you sit in the middle\nof the box, and then you are observed and\n\n289\n00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,060\nsomehow provide credentials.\n\n290\n00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,920\nAnd then on the back end, you're let\nout once the person on the other end of\n\n291\n00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,660\nthe automated system authenticates you and\nunderstands who you are.\n\n292\n00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,590\nAnd so the idea would be if\nyou literally imagine a box\n\n293\n00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:20,600\nwith two entry points- one exit, one entry\nand we can then control access to it\n\n294\n00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,860\nthrough some sort of secure system,\nthis is what a man trap will be.\n\n295\n00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,340\nThey have them in hospitals, you see\nthem on the labor and delivery floors.\n\n296\n00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,140\n>> A couple of the credit unions here\nin town have actually input them.\n\n297\n00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,510\n>> Oh they have that lobby where you go in\n>> They had a few break ins and things or\n\n298\n00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,120\nsome robbery attempts, so they've got this\nthing where you open that first door,\n\n299\n00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,410\nyou can not get through the second door\nuntil the first one closes behind you.\n\n300\n00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,570\nOne person at a time,\nno glasses no hats, things like that,\n\n301\n00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,530\nand then they have to buzz you in for that\nsecond door before you get in, so, right.\n\n302\n00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,570\n>> Now, we could add another layer,\n\n303\n00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,555\nanother defensive layer to these where\nwe can have metal scanning built in,\n\n304\n00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:56,530\nX-ray scanning built in to\nthe frame where literally you can.\n\n305\n00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,060\nWalk through and\n\n306\n00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,920\nwe have a metal detector, so banks will do\nthis sometimes where you walk through and\n\n307\n00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,340\nthey will find out you may be carrying\na weapon or something like that.\n\n308\n00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,575\nThey can keep you in the box,\nthe box may be made of bulletproof,\n\n309\n00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:09,515\nbecause typically they're glass right,\nyou can see they're glass.\n\n310\n00:15:09,515 --> 00:15:12,635\nGlass in really secure environments\nthey'll be bulletproof glass.\n\n311\n00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:15,125\nSo, even if you walk in with a weapon,\nwalk in with,\n\n312\n00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:19,855\nperhaps an explosive device you may not be\nable to discharge it and get out of it,\n\n313\n00:15:19,855 --> 00:15:22,737\nsome of these really secure data centers,\nthe one that.\n\n314\n00:15:22,737 --> 00:15:25,867\nSome of the customers I do business\nwith host in California, for\n\n315\n00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:29,937\ninstance, is going to be not only all\nthat, but they're actually going to\n\n316\n00:15:29,937 --> 00:15:33,657\nhave pressure sensitive plates in\nthe man trap so you can only come in.\n\n317\n00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:37,937\nAnd we look at you and say okay,\none person in, one person out.\n\n318\n00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,077\nThey have basically a weight\nprofile more or less on everybody.\n\n319\n00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:43,757\nSo you register as a user to\ncome into the data center.\n\n320\n00:15:43,757 --> 00:15:46,832\nThey build up a whole profile on you and\nwho you are to get in and\n\n321\n00:15:46,832 --> 00:15:50,810\nthey scan you in through this, you go in\non the pressure pad and it's like the,\n\n322\n00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,250\nalmost like the beam out\nchambers on Star Trek.\n\n323\n00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,584\nSo, you walk in, it's a cylindrical\nobject, the tube slides shut,\n\n324\n00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:59,920\nyou're standing there on the plate and\nthey're measuring you to make\n\n325\n00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,710\nsure you're not carrying equipment or\nthings like that.\n\n326\n00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:04,397\nRight, if you're like 100\npounds overweight they\n\n327\n00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,540\nwant to know what the hell you got on.\n\n328\n00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,219\nSo the other side only opens up only if\nyou meet the weight-scan requirement on\n\n329\n00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,560\nthe pressure plate.\n\n330\n00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,750\nSo you can't carry out equipment and\nthings like that.\n\n331\n00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,980\nIt's not so much we don't care about what\nyou weigh, we just wanna make sure you\n\n332\n00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,190\ndon't carry out servers and\nthings like that when nobody's looking.\n\n333\n00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:25,390\nIn addition, the walls of this\ndata center are lined with Kevlar.\n\n334\n00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:30,000\nAnd so it's like a level-four lining\nfrom the protection standpoint, or\n\n335\n00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,400\nhowever they refer to it.\n\n336\n00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,790\nAnd as a result of that you actually, not\nonly can you set off a gun in the lobby,\n\n337\n00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,170\nlet's say,\nbecause it's all bulletproof glass.\n\n338\n00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,470\n>> Right.\n>> You can shoot at the walls.\n\n339\n00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,500\nThe walls are lined with Kevlar.\n\n340\n00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,630\nThe bullets aren't gonna go through.\n\n341\n00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,140\n>> Right.\n>> So\n\n342\n00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,220\nnobody can be potentially inadvertently\nshot because the building,\n\n343\n00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,330\nthe bullet goes outside.\n\n344\n00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,580\nThey tell you, these things are rated.\n\n345\n00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,640\nYou could actually set off an anti-tank\nweapon inside the lobby of one of these\n\n346\n00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,980\ndata centers at the wall, so you could\nshoot, in effect, from outside, try to\n\n347\n00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,410\nblow through the wall, and it will absorb\nthe impact and there'll be a mess, right?\n\n348\n00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,210\nYou're probably not gonna survive\nthe explosion inside, but the reality is,\n\n349\n00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,930\nit will not,\nyou won't be able to breach the wall.\n\n350\n00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,470\nWow.\n\n351\n00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,780\n>> So it's kinda interesting, right?\n\n352\n00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,060\n>> Yeah, it is fascinating.\n\n353\n00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,290\n>> Yeah, I want that for my man cave.\n\n354\n00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:09,900\n>> Right?\n\n355\n00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,670\n>> Be able to set off a small yield\nnuclear thermal device inside and\n\n356\n00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,650\nbe no bleed to the outside.\n\n357\n00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,905\n>> For when I'm doing my\nresearch on those EMP devices.\n\n358\n00:17:17,905 --> 00:17:19,365\nI need to have that layer of preferences.\n\n359\n00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:20,105\n>> Right.\nExactly.\n\n360\n00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:23,315\n>> You don't want to blow up the cable\nwhile you're trying to figure out\n\n361\n00:17:23,315 --> 00:17:25,475\nhow to take everybody\nelse around you offline.\n\n362\n00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:28,955\nSo these are the kinds of things we\nsee when we talk about man traps, and\n\n363\n00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:29,875\njust think about that.\n\n364\n00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:30,980\nNow having said that.\n\n365\n00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,630\nLet's talk about those doors for\njust a minute.\n\n366\n00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,470\nLet's go back if you could.\n\n367\n00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,840\nYeah, just cuz I wanna use it as\nan example for fail-safe and fail-secure.\n\n368\n00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,530\nSo, what we would see there is the outer\ndoor that when we come in right,\n\n369\n00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:45,270\nthat door, and this is not how man traps\nare designed, by the way, necessarily.\n\n370\n00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,200\nBut just using this as an example, so\nwe have two kinds of doors that we can\n\n371\n00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,270\ntalk about when we rate them\nfrom a security standpoint.\n\n372\n00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,250\nWe have what are called fail-safe and\nfail-secure, right?\n\n373\n00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,390\nAnd so when we talk about a door that\nfails safe, we talk about a door\n\n374\n00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,185\nthat would potentially allow you out if\npower was lost and there was a fire or\n\n375\n00:18:02,185 --> 00:18:03,365\nsomething like that.\n\n376\n00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:07,085\nSo in hospitals for instance and\nhotels you walk down the hallway you\n\n377\n00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:10,235\nsee these doors that tend to\nbe propped open on maglocks.\n\n378\n00:18:10,235 --> 00:18:13,335\nYou know the big steel doors are sitting\nopen in the hallways like half way\n\n379\n00:18:13,335 --> 00:18:17,015\ndown he floors typically, they swing\nclosed they come off of the maglocks.\n\n380\n00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:20,100\nWhen the power is cut they swing closed,\nthey're smoke doors.\n\n381\n00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,880\nAnd they close but they don't lock.\n\n382\n00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,035\n>> Right.\n>> So they fail safe.\n\n383\n00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,145\nMeaning you could hit the exit bar.\n\n384\n00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> And open the door from inside and\n\n385\n00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,220\nget out, and we would allow you out.\n\n386\n00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,160\nSo they fail safe.\n\n387\n00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,310\nThey safeguard life.\n\n388\n00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,860\nBut they prevent smoke from spread.\n\n389\n00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,755\n>> Right, right. Fire.\n>> Fire from spreading, things like that.\n\n390\n00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:35,500\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n391\n00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,210\n>> Fail-secure doors are doors\nthat fail closed and are locked.\n\n392\n00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,950\nSo, a vault, for instance,\nwill fail-secure.\n\n393\n00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,580\nIf the vault is closed and\nthe power is cut,\n\n394\n00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,850\nyou won't be able to open it with\nthe time lock until power is restored.\n\n395\n00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,331\nSo we want to make sure we understand\nthe difference between fail-safe and\n\n396\n00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,360\nfail-secure, right?\n\n397\n00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,200\nThe default behind there is that\nthat door will be locked, right?\n\n398\n00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,820\nAnd if there are any problems with that,\n\n399\n00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,460\nthen as a result the door will,\na little visitor.\n\n400\n00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,374\n>> Yeah.\n[LAUGH]\n\n401\n00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:02,970\n>> The door will\n\n402\n00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,590\nfail secure as a result, right?\n\n403\n00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,630\nSo just be aware of that and\nmake sure you think about that.\n\n404\n00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,160\nAgain, not specific to the design of\nman traps, I wanna be clear, just using\n\n405\n00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,190\nthe door as an example to illustrate what\nwe're talking about in this diagram,\n\n406\n00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,870\nnot implying the man traps are designed\nto either fail-safe, or fail-secure.\n\n407\n00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,250\nWe're not talking about that\nin relation to man traps.\n\n408\n00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,030\nWe're merely explaining the two types of\ndoors that we would traditionally see.\n\n409\n00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,880\nSo I know we wanted to just quickly maybe\ncapture some notes while we're talking.\n\n410\n00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,375\n>> Yep.\n>> So we could put down fail-safe and\n\n411\n00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:32,205\nfail-secure for door types.\n\n412\n00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:32,880\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n413\n00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,253\n>> And\njust have a reference to that as well.\n\n414\n00:19:37,748 --> 00:19:40,780\n>> So let Mike just catch up\nwith us there for just a minute.\n\n415\n00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,060\nYeah we also want to\nthink about placement.\n\n416\n00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,380\nMike and I were joking about the fact\nthat you don't want to put your wiring\n\n417\n00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,000\nclosets and\nthings like that in insecure locations.\n\n418\n00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,630\n>> Right.\n>> Right, so just be aware of that.\n\n419\n00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,760\nBut you know you think about these\ndrop ceilings we often seen in office\n\n420\n00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,300\nbuildings right?\n\n421\n00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,510\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> A lot of us have them in our\n\n422\n00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,150\nbuildings today.\n\n423\n00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,780\n>> Right\n>> And there's typically 5 to\n\n424\n00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,000\nmaybe as much as 20 feet\nof space above there\n\n425\n00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,850\nthat we don't see\n>> Yep.\n\n426\n00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,020\n>> When you have the acoustical\ntiles being dangled down below.\n\n427\n00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,090\nSomebody could easily put a ladder up,\n\n428\n00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,090\npop that tile up, see what's up\nabove there and if they could\n\n429\n00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,380\nget to a wall where they could drop\ndown back into another secure room.\n\n430\n00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,030\n>> Yeah.\n>> They could\n\n431\n00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,670\nbypass the door\n>> Yep.\n\n432\n00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:15,880\n>> And bypass the lock.\n\n433\n00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,680\nSo you don't wanna make sure that your\nsecure rooms are going to be right up\n\n434\n00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,010\nagainst an open area where somebody\ncould prop a ladder for instance, right?\n\n435\n00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,170\nThat could be a problem, so\n\n436\n00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:28,650\nwe wanna see these firewalls that\nwe build go all the way up, right?\n\n437\n00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:30,190\nYou wanna have a room, if it's secure.\n\n438\n00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:33,540\nThat has brick wall literally going\nall the way up to the ceiling, right?\n\n439\n00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,970\nI'll do it this way so\nyou can see me in the frame.\n\n440\n00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,510\n>> Right.\n>> All the way up to the ceiling.\n\n441\n00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,305\nWe wanna have that go all the way up.\n\n442\n00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:39,970\nIf we have these drop ceilings,\n\n443\n00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,010\nwe may have an open space that somebody\ncould literally just shimmy over and\n\n444\n00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,826\ndrop right into to effectively get\naround that security solution.\n\n445\n00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:50,797\nSo then we would want to have layered\ndefenses where we have maybe acoustical\n\n446\n00:20:50,797 --> 00:20:54,520\nmonitoring, we may have closed-circuit\nTV camera inside that room,\n\n447\n00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,513\nprevent anybody from seeing what's\ngoing on in there, that kind of thing.\n\n448\n00:20:58,513 --> 00:21:00,210\nSo then we'd want to monitor that.\n\n449\n00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,180\nWe could have audio monitoring so\nwe can hear somebody doing that.\n\n450\n00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,530\nWe could have motion sensors.\n\n451\n00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,400\nLots of different ways to add to that.\n\n452\n00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,990\nBut that would be important, right?\n\n453\n00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,035\nYou wanna make sure that\nour wiring closets,\n\n454\n00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,810\nour internal closets, secured, right?\n\n455\n00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,550\nSo there's one doorway in,\none doorway out kind of thing.\n\n456\n00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,880\nMay put an alarm on that door so\nyou know when it's opened.\n\n457\n00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,620\nYou may wanna put a lock on there.\n\n458\n00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,000\nMaybe a more secure kind of lock.\n\n459\n00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,640\nWe'll talk about those lock\npoints at some point here.\n\n460\n00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,800\nWe wanna make sure again that we keep\nan eye of what's going on in there.\n\n461\n00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,150\nSo we may want to have an infrared IP\ncamera in there, so that it'll pick up,\n\n462\n00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,830\neven in the dark, and see what's going on,\nif somebody opens it.\n\n463\n00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,650\nThese are the kinds of things\nwe want to think about and,\n\n464\n00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,140\nagain, just be aware of, right?\n\n465\n00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,770\nAll right, so as we're talking about\ninternally protecting assets and thinking\n\n466\n00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:46,510\nabout how we do that, we also have to\nthink about things like power, right?\n\n467\n00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,570\nHow do we bring power in,\nhow do we use power, how do we consume it?\n\n468\n00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,620\nAnd so electrical power can\nlead to some issues, right?\n\n469\n00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,410\nWe may have electro-magnetic interference,\nwhat we call EMI.\n\n470\n00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,670\nAnd we may also have what's known as RFI,\n\n471\n00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:02,930\nradio frequency interference emanating\nfrom these devices that we use.\n\n472\n00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,190\nSo for instance,\nI'm looking around our studio here,\n\n473\n00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,220\nwe have different lights\nthat are hanging around,\n\n474\n00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,790\ngive us this nice soft healthy glow that\nyou see on our faces while we're talking.\n\n475\n00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,340\nAnd so, you know in traditional\nenvironments like this,\n\n476\n00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,900\nwe're not really looking at the kinda\nlighting that may have electro-magnetic\n\n477\n00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,020\ninterference associated with it,\nor radio-frequency interference,\n\n478\n00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,930\nin this case RFI, associated with it.\n\n479\n00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,110\nBut, we could look at traditional\nfluorescent lighting in most office\n\n480\n00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:29,905\nbuildings, and we have some of\nthat laying around here as well.\n\n481\n00:22:29,905 --> 00:22:31,940\nFluorescent lighting will put off RFI.\n\n482\n00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,880\nThe ballasts, right?\n\n483\n00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,160\nThe electrical devices\nthat spin up in effect and\n\n484\n00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,070\npower up those bulbs are gonna give\noff RFI, radio frequency interference.\n\n485\n00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,640\nSo we have to be aware of that.\n\n486\n00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,850\nAlso any kind of motor will give off\nelectromagnetic interference, EMI, right?\n\n487\n00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:53,140\nAnd so we wanna make sure things like Oh,\nGod, what am I thinking of?\n\n488\n00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,930\nCordless phones, right?\n\n489\n00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,200\nCordless phones good example of this.\n\n490\n00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,960\nMicrowave ovens are a good\nexample of this as well, right?\n\n491\n00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,050\nAnd if we think about those kind\nof things, they all give off EMI.\n\n492\n00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:01,740\nAnd so\n\n493\n00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:06,780\nyou would, several years back in the older\ndays, see warning signs in gas stations.\n\n494\n00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,410\nYou may still see them depending on where\nyou go where it says microwave in use.\n\n495\n00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,610\n>> Yeah.\n>> And if you have a pacemaker,\n\n496\n00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,250\n>> Pacemaker or something, yep\n\n497\n00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,300\n>> Don't walk in here because the last\n\n498\n00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,882\nthing you want to do is\nmicrowave a burrito,\n\n499\n00:23:16,882 --> 00:23:17,640\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n500\n00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,120\n>> Drop dead of a heart attack while\n\n501\n00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,840\nyou're waiting.\n\n502\n00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,300\n>> Which you might do after\neating the burrito anyway.\n\n503\n00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,900\n>> You could.\nBut you want to do that as a result.\n\n504\n00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,010\n>> At least it was.\n\n505\n00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,010\n>> So you want to be aware of that\nbecause that would be a very bad way to\n\n506\n00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:27,980\nend your day.\n\n507\n00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,860\nAnd so this is the kind of thing we\nthink about because pacemakers can\n\n508\n00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,830\nbe interrupted.\n\n509\n00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:36,010\nBasically the electric signaling\nthat monitors the heart and\n\n510\n00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:40,870\nkeeps it doing the right things could\nbe interrupted by the electromagnetic\n\n511\n00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,940\nfield that's put out by the microwave.\n\n512\n00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,900\n>> Elevators, sometimes.\n\n513\n00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,860\n>> Elevators could as well,\nright, these different things.\n\n514\n00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,510\nSo.\n>> We talked about that in one of our\n\n515\n00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,885\nsegments, about maybe changing the wiring\ntypes mid-stream cuz a lot of the times\n\n516\n00:23:50,885 --> 00:23:54,335\nyour elevator shaft is a convenient place\nto get wiring from one floor to the other.\n\n517\n00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:56,333\n>> Oh, absolutely cuz it's the central\ncore of the building, sure.\n\n518\n00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,883\n>> But then you gotta worry about\nthe interference that's being generated by\n\n519\n00:23:58,883 --> 00:23:59,418\nthat guy, so.\n\n520\n00:23:59,418 --> 00:24:00,667\n>> Yep, exactly.\n\n521\n00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,941\nSo that's why you guys always\nthought we closed the doors,\n\n522\n00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:05,396\nwe don't get a signal in the Elevator\nbecause we're in a tube and\n\n523\n00:24:05,396 --> 00:24:08,417\neverything else, and that's because of\nall the wiring they put in the thing.\n\n524\n00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,101\nI'm kidding,\nit's not because of all the wires,\n\n525\n00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:11,760\nthose are in the middle\nof the concrete cylinder.\n\n526\n00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,612\nThat's why you don't get any signal right.\n\n527\n00:24:13,612 --> 00:24:16,850\nAll right, so let's talk about different\npower issues associated from EMI but\n\n528\n00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,330\ndifferent from EMI and RFI.\n\n529\n00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,130\nRight, but let's also just\nidentify some other things, so\n\n530\n00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,170\ndifferent kinds of power fluctuations,\nissues that we have to be aware of.\n\n531\n00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:29,100\nWe divide this up into three different\ncategories: power excess, so\n\n532\n00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,240\nwhen we have excess power flowing in,\nlet's talk about different things there.\n\n533\n00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,010\nWe have a spike and a surge.\n\n534\n00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,390\nJust want to make sure we're aware of the\nfact that we talk about power excess we\n\n535\n00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,060\ncan have a spike a momentary\njump in current.\n\n536\n00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,230\nA surge, a overall wave like\na huge amount coming in.\n\n537\n00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:43,760\n>> Right\n>> Right so\n\n538\n00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,530\nthose are the things we\n>> Talk about their prolonged high voltage\n\n539\n00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,570\nwill be a search.\n\n540\n00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,510\nPower loss will be the next category.\n\n541\n00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:53,800\nSo under power loss we could have a fault.\n\n542\n00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,220\nFault being a momentary power outage.\n\n543\n00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,358\nJust trips for a second and\nthen comes back.\n\n544\n00:24:57,358 --> 00:25:00,195\nA\n>> Blackout is a prolonged loss of power.\n\n545\n00:25:00,195 --> 00:25:01,555\nSo we have a blackout.\n\n546\n00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:04,765\nA brown out would be under\nthe last power category.\n\n547\n00:25:04,765 --> 00:25:05,495\nSo yes, brown out.\n\n548\n00:25:05,495 --> 00:25:08,195\nBut power degradation that\nwill be our third category.\n\n549\n00:25:08,195 --> 00:25:10,587\nSo when we degrade\nthe quality of the power.\n\n550\n00:25:10,587 --> 00:25:14,157\n>> That will be a brown out where\nit sags but doesn't go out fully.\n\n551\n00:25:14,157 --> 00:25:17,447\nPower degradation, so\nwe will have a sag or dip, right,\n\n552\n00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:20,837\na drop in effectively\nthe electrical current.\n\n553\n00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:23,517\nA brown out will be where\nwe have a prolonged sag.\n\n554\n00:25:23,517 --> 00:25:25,127\nA sag is momentary in effect.\n\n555\n00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:28,817\nA brown out is a prolonged\nperiod of sagging.\n\n556\n00:25:28,817 --> 00:25:30,977\nAnd then in rush current is going to be,\nand\n\n557\n00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:33,367\nthis is something that is\nprevalent in the south here for\n\n558\n00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:36,640\ninstance southeast where we have\nhurricanes, things like that.\n\n559\n00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,740\nIn rush current is what you get\nwhen the power comes back on.\n\n560\n00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,300\nAnd that's what can blow up your\nappliances and damage your home.\n\n561\n00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,250\nAnd then let's say you have your generator\nhooked up, turn the power back on,\n\n562\n00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,545\nthe generator's on, boom,\nit blows up the generator.\n\n563\n00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,040\nCause you get all this\ncurrent rushing back in\n\n564\n00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,500\nfrom the power company across the grid.\n\n565\n00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,580\nAnd it hits, basically, your house, and\neverything turns back on all at once.\n\n566\n00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,470\nSo you have to put in special protective\nline conditioners on the lines that\n\n567\n00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,570\nwill basically kick out and prevent the in\nrush current from breaking everything.\n\n568\n00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,696\nSo you want to be aware of this.\n\n569\n00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:09,660\nSo you want to make sure you're familiar\nwith these areas in terms of how we\n\n570\n00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:13,660\ndeal with power types, what happens\nwith them, rights tie up power excess,\n\n571\n00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,350\npower loss, power degradation.\n\n572\n00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,150\nWhat are the examples in each of these.\n\n573\n00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,840\nBelieve or not, these will be things that\nyou want to make sure you're familiar with\n\n574\n00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,630\nas you get ready.\n\n575\n00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,060\nTo answer some questions.\n\n576\n00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,490\nAnd again,\nif you put this in perspective as CISSP,\n\n577\n00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:29,230\nas you are practicing every day\nin the field in a business.\n\n578\n00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,950\nWe've all dealt with power outages before,\nwe've all dealt with these issues.\n\n579\n00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,574\nWe just don't really\nthink about them per say,\n\n580\n00:26:34,574 --> 00:26:36,230\nwe just kind of work our way through them.\n\n581\n00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,670\n>> We may have UPS devices that are hooked\nup to power up certain things and\n\n582\n00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,540\nkeep them running.\n\n583\n00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,410\nWe may have generators hooked up that\nare going to kick in automatically, and\n\n584\n00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,530\nthey have flashlights with batteries\npositioned strategically, right,\n\n585\n00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,610\nin places, whatever it is.\n\n586\n00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,110\nWe deal with these things all the time,\n\n587\n00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,750\nso we just want to make sure you're\nformally aware of that knowledge,\n\n588\n00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,520\naround the kind of ways we talk about\nthese things and what's important.\n\n589\n00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,235\nAnd then, we can you know, obviously\nfrom that point become a little bit more\n\n590\n00:27:00,235 --> 00:27:01,450\nknowledgeable about things, right.\n\n591\n00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,890\nPlus, gives you something to talk\nabout when the power goes out.\n\n592\n00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,770\nHey, was that a brown out or a black out?\n\n593\n00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,440\nWhat was that?\n\n594\n00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,120\nRight.\nWe're sitting here with no lights.\n\n595\n00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,050\nProbably a black out, right?\n\n596\n00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,855\nSo that's something else to consider,\nright.\n\n597\n00:27:11,855 --> 00:27:14,600\n[LAUGH] Got to look for\nthe silver lining in those clouds, people.\n\n598\n00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,820\nRight.\nIt's very important.\n\n599\n00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,470\nAll right.\nSo environmental issues right.\n\n600\n00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,040\nWe've been talking about power that's kind\nof continue on with that whole thought\n\n601\n00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,410\nprocess so when we talk about\nsetting up the data center, setting\n\n602\n00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:27,580\nup the wiring closet or whatever it may be\n>> Mm-hm\n\n603\n00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,350\n>> You'll talk about power side, so\n\n604\n00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,930\nwhat about the water side\nyou got to be aware of\n\n605\n00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:32,820\nthat\n>> So\n\n606\n00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,425\nwhen we're talking about\nthings like fluid.\n\n607\n00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:35,600\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n608\n00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,530\n>> If we have to deal with things\nthat may be running in pipes and\n\n609\n00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:40,630\nif it doesn't stay in the pipe\nhow do we get rid of it?\n\n610\n00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:41,620\n>> Right.\n>> So we want to have\n\n611\n00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,290\npositive pressure drains, so\nif we have broken pipes or\n\n612\n00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:48,310\nthings like that we want to make sure that\nwe have drains that are positive pressure.\n\n613\n00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,010\nAnd the idea behind that is\nthat drains don't back flow.\n\n614\n00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,890\nThey don't flow up in case there's\na flood, when they have positive\n\n615\n00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:58,740\npressure we keep more air pressure in\nthe drain that keeps everything down.\n\n616\n00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,630\nSo water will not flow backwards.\n\n617\n00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,190\nIf there's stuff in the room it will flow\ndown the drain, so a lot of times you see\n\n618\n00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,540\nsome of these systems You know\nrestaurants have this as well.\n\n619\n00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,670\nBars have it, right?\n\n620\n00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:10,240\nWhere, cause you do your best like you\nwork in a restaurant or a bar, right?\n\n621\n00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,850\n>> Absolutely.\n\n622\n00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:11,580\nAbsolutely.\n>> So\n\n623\n00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,330\nthe idea is that you see\neverything back there,\n\n624\n00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,810\nand the floor is kind of going\nto slant down a little bit.\n\n625\n00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:20,310\nSo it's going to be a concave\nas opposed to convex design.\n\n626\n00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:23,330\nAnd it's going to flow down, in the middle\nof the floor is typically a drain.\n\n627\n00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,420\nSo they could just push all the water and\nall that stuff down the drain.\n\n628\n00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,096\nBut it's a positive pressure drain so\nstuff doesn't back flow.\n\n629\n00:28:29,096 --> 00:28:32,500\nSo you want to make sure you associate\nthat idea how a drain should be dealt with\n\n630\n00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:35,790\nand how we should build those\nsystems as being positive pressure.\n\n631\n00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,310\nSame concept when we talk about\nenvironments where we walk in, and\n\n632\n00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,947\nwe have positive pressure\nin the data center keeping\n\n633\n00:28:41,947 --> 00:28:44,290\nthe the flow of air from the outside, out.\n\n634\n00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:47,500\nWe want you to simply walk through\na blower of some kind to get dust and\n\n635\n00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,590\ndebris off you.\n\n636\n00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,400\nSo we want to pressure the air pressure\nfrom the data center, the clean room,\n\n637\n00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,420\nbeing blown out of the room to\nkeep the air going this way so\n\n638\n00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,160\nthat you don't walk in with air from\nthe outside that could have smoke and\n\n639\n00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,560\ndust and particulates and\nthings like that.\n\n640\n00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,670\nSo we have over-pressure,\nwhat we call positive pressure,\n\n641\n00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,990\nin the data center, which blows the air\nout as opposed to sucking air in.\n\n642\n00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:10,669\nThis is the other idea that we want\nto make sure we're aware of here.\n\n643\n00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:16,400\nSo thinking about that, we also want to\nmake sure that we measure for humidity.\n\n644\n00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,840\nRight.\nWe want to measure for humidity and\n\n645\n00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,900\ntemperature in these systems.\n\n646\n00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,540\nAnd so, we want to make sure that we\nunderstand that we are going to strive for\n\n647\n00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:29,310\na certain temperature and a certain\nhumidity function inside of these systems,\n\n648\n00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,880\ninside again, it's simply data centers.\n\n649\n00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,400\nSo first thing to understand is we want\nto talk about how we measure humidity.\n\n650\n00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,950\nWe measure humidity with what\nis known as a hygrometer, right.\n\n651\n00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,140\nA hygrometer is just simply\na device that measures humidity.\n\n652\n00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,640\nIt's typically a little box,\n\n653\n00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,960\nit's got a little probe on it for just\nmeasuring the ambient humidity in the air.\n\n654\n00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,160\nYou leave it in the data center and\n\n655\n00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,430\nit tells you we're at such and\nsuch percentage of humidity.\n\n656\n00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,830\nSo we do have a range we shoot for,\nby the way.\n\n657\n00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:58,710\nThat range for humidity would be somewhere\nbetween 40 to 60% ambient humidity in\n\n658\n00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:03,790\nthe air, so somewhere between\n40 to 60% will be important for\n\n659\n00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,860\nus there to understand\nas a humidity range.\n\n660\n00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:10,230\nAnd then for temperature, well we're going\nto use a thermometer of some kind to\n\n661\n00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,770\nmeasure temperature, our range there\nis going to be somewhere between 70 and\n\n662\n00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:19,731\n74 degrees, and this is going to be in\nFahrenheit, by the way, not in Celsius.\n\n663\n00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:23,740\n[LAUGH] Cause it would be one hell of\na warm room if it was 70 degrees Celsius.\n\n664\n00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,420\nSo 70 to 74 degrees, we want to make\nsure we know that that's our range.\n\n665\n00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,410\nAnd that's what again, the ambient\ntemperature we're kind of shooting for\n\n666\n00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,750\nin the data center to keep the systems\ncool, like cool enough, and\n\n667\n00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,140\nto make sure they're not overheating,\nthat kind of thing.\n\n668\n00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,060\nIt doesn't mean it can't\ngo higher than that.\n\n669\n00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:41,870\nIt just means that for human comfort as\nwell as for machine comfort we want to try\n\n670\n00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:44,550\nand typically shoot for\nthat kind of temperature range.\n\n671\n00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,660\nBut obviously there could be different\nranges we could heat up to and\n\n672\n00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:51,120\nor, we could see potentially,\nbecoming a problem.\n\n673\n00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,860\nFlash point, for electronics versus paper,\nfor instance, right?\n\n674\n00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,400\nThings can get hot, all long as they don't\nrun that way all the time it's okay.\n\n675\n00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,050\nBut you can run a computer\nup well past 100 degrees,\n\n676\n00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:03,510\nit'll be fine as long as you don't\ndo it for hours and hours on end.\n\n677\n00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:06,630\nThat kind of thing, so\njust be aware of that.\n\n678\n00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:11,830\nSo obviously making sure we have the good\nair pressure, good ventilation or HVAC\n\n679\n00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:16,220\nis what we often talk about this as being,\nour HVAC systems are in line, everything's\n\n680\n00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,300\ngood that's heating and ventilation right,\nso air conditioning, things like that,\n\n681\n00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,460\nit's what we talk about with our\nsystems quite better, our HVAC systems.\n\n682\n00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,670\nSo just making sure we're aware of all\nthose things will be very important\n\n683\n00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:31,310\nbecause as a security professional, as\na CISSP again, you're going to be asked to\n\n684\n00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:35,980\nmake sure you are keeping an eye on these\nsystems, you're safeguarding information.\n\n685\n00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,310\nYou may not manage HVAC directly,\ntypically the building facility manager,\n\n686\n00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:43,840\nthe supervisor that does maintenance, that\nkind of thing is going to manage that.\n\n687\n00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,950\nBut you need to interact with them and\nbe aware of what's going on,\n\n688\n00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,880\nshare your concerns about\nhaving too much or not enough.\n\n689\n00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,900\nAir pressure.\n\n690\n00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,620\nNeeding the right amount of cold\nair flowing into the data center.\n\n691\n00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,440\n>> Right.\n>> All these\n\n692\n00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,600\nkind of things are things you'll\ninteract with them around.\n\n693\n00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,690\nAnd so\nyou have to be that voice of reason, and\n\n694\n00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,210\nunderstand how these things are working.\n\n695\n00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:01,920\n>> Absolutely.\n\n696\n00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,620\n>> All right, very good.\n\n697\n00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,988\n>> All right.\nWell I think that brings us\n\n698\n00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:05,125\nto our first break point.\n\n699\n00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,000\nSo we're gonna take a quick break,\nstep away.\n\n700\n00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,042\nYou guys get up, stretch your legs, and\nrefill the beverage of your choice.\n\n701\n00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:11,419\nAnd we'll see you back here in a few.\n\n702\n00:32:11,419 --> 00:32:12,333\n>> Okay, see you soon.\n\n703\n00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:20,072\n[MUSIC]\n\n704\n00:32:20,072 --> 00:32:23,096\n>> All right, welcome back everybody,\nto our physical and\n\n705\n00:32:23,096 --> 00:32:25,751\nenvironmental security\nepisode with our CISSP.\n\n706\n00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:30,006\nWe're gonna jump back in and I think we're\nheading over to some more physical and\n\n707\n00:32:30,006 --> 00:32:33,835\nenvironmental security,\nwe're going to talk about fire prevention.\n\n708\n00:32:33,835 --> 00:32:35,335\n>> Fire prevention.\n\n709\n00:32:35,335 --> 00:32:38,285\n>> Yeah, or fire starting, no,\nwe're going to prevent the fire.\n\n710\n00:32:38,285 --> 00:32:39,900\n>> There was a movie, Fire Starter.\n\n711\n00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,615\nAll right, so\nlet's talk a little about fire prevention,\n\n712\n00:32:42,615 --> 00:32:46,253\nlet's talk about protection and\nsuppression, how we deal with fire, again,\n\n713\n00:32:46,253 --> 00:32:48,225\nobviously very important in life safety.\n\n714\n00:32:48,225 --> 00:32:52,272\nNumber one thing we always focus on when\nwe're talking about information security\n\n715\n00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:56,143\nmanagement, act ethically, make sure we\nprotect life as part of the adherence\n\n716\n00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:59,930\nto the Code of Ethics, and so this is\ngoing to be a very important topic for us.\n\n717\n00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,230\nLife always comes first.\n\n718\n00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,630\nSo when we talk about fire prevention,\n\n719\n00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,485\nthis idea of being able to educate\neverybody about common sense stuff, right?\n\n720\n00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,720\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> Don't smoke inside the building.\n\n721\n00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,220\nDon't throw out the lit cigarette\nbutts in a trash can full of paper.\n\n722\n00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,520\n>> Right.\n>> This kind of stuff,\n\n723\n00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,160\nobviously is important.\n\n724\n00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,130\nSo, want to make sure we have\nawareness around that kind of stuff.\n\n725\n00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,520\nAnd fire prevention is all about that.\n\n726\n00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,780\nFire detection is about making sure that\nwe have systems in place that will detect\n\n727\n00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,950\na fire should prevention fail, right?\n\n728\n00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,610\nSo somebody does throw the lit\ncigarette butt in the receptacle of\n\n729\n00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,550\nflammable liquids.\n\n730\n00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:35,640\nWanna make sure we detect a fire as it\nflares up and engulfs our building.\n\n731\n00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,710\nAnd then suppression is going to be\nabout making sure that we stop the fire\n\n732\n00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,680\nthat has broken out as quickly\nas possible to minimize damage.\n\n733\n00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,530\nSo things like sprinkler systems here,\nwe'll talking about those and\n\n734\n00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,150\nwhat those are.\n\n735\n00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,840\n[COUGH] So let's start by talking about,\npardon me,\n\n736\n00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,790\nlet's start by talking about things\nthat are common sense things, right?\n\n737\n00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:57,580\nSo something like prevention would\nobviously be with said education but\n\n738\n00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,920\nthere could be more than that, right?\n\n739\n00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,950\nSo we may have drills, and\ntests associated with that, right?\n\n740\n00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,810\nTo make sure that people know what to do,\nand\n\n741\n00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:09,820\nif something does go wrong we may have the\nability to then be able to react quickly.\n\n742\n00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,460\nSo let's talk about detection.\n\n743\n00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,250\n>> Okay.\n\n744\n00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,370\n>> So,\nwe have different kinds of detectors.\n\n745\n00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:19,370\nAll right, we may have smoke activated or\nheat activated detectors.\n\n746\n00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:22,840\nSmoke activated detectors and\nheat activated detectors.\n\n747\n00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:26,630\nSmoke activated detectors will be things\nlike a beam of light, for instance,\n\n748\n00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,700\nthat may be shot between two detectors\nwhen smoke clouds a room to a certain\n\n749\n00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:34,410\ndegree, obscures the beam of light, all\nof a sudden, you know, an alarm goes off.\n\n750\n00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:39,600\nSo that's typically what we call\na photoelectric detector, of some kind.\n\n751\n00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,280\nWe may also have the ability\nto be able to be able\n\n752\n00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:48,265\nto do the standard fire alarm that is at\nhome, the smoke activated fire alarm.\n\n753\n00:34:48,265 --> 00:34:49,490\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> The one's we often have in\n\n754\n00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,140\njust our residences, right?\n\n755\n00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,010\nWhere smoke comes up, hits the detector,\nenough smoke hits it,\n\n756\n00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,160\nit sets off the alarm,\nvery standard thing.\n\n757\n00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,670\nWe also have heat activated detectors,\nthese are gonna be temperature based so\n\n758\n00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,440\nrise of temperature, or\nrate of temperature rise.\n\n759\n00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,450\nSo we'll see a certain amount of\ntemperature over a certain amount of time\n\n760\n00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,840\ngoing up in a room,\ncausing this to effectively go off.\n\n761\n00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,190\nWe may have, with rate of rise\ntemperature, or rate of rise detectors and\n\n762\n00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,570\nwe also have just the standard ones with\nsprinkler heads where we have the colored\n\n763\n00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:20,870\nliquid right, that holds the pin or\nthe piston open in the sprinkler head and\n\n764\n00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,730\nthose liquids boil at\ndifferent temperatures.\n\n765\n00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,560\n>> Right.\n>> Effectively breaking the glass,\n\n766\n00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,420\ndropping the pin, dropping the piston\nin the sprinkler head, and\n\n767\n00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,600\nallowing the water to flow out.\n\n768\n00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,986\n>> Right.\nSo you see in all these movies,\n\n769\n00:35:29,986 --> 00:35:32,170\nsomebody gets trapped like in the vault or\nin the building.\n\n770\n00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:35,340\nThey get up with the lighter,\nset it off, and all of a sudden,\n\n771\n00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,120\nall the water comes down.\n\n772\n00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,080\nOh yay, we're saved.\n\n773\n00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,920\nThe alarm goes off.\n\n774\n00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,890\nWell, duh, you're in a box with no outlet,\nand there's all this water streaming down,\n\n775\n00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,110\nnow it's a horse race to see whether\nthey get to you before you drown, right?\n\n776\n00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,460\n>> Yeah, yeah,\ndidn't really think that one through.\n\n777\n00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,190\n>> Right.\nBecause a sprinkler's not designed to shut\n\n778\n00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:51,205\noff, it's designed to keep going, right?\n\n779\n00:35:51,205 --> 00:35:51,850\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So\n\n780\n00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,810\nyou gotta start thinking about this stuff.\n\n781\n00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,240\nBut the other interesting thing I love,\n\n782\n00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,950\nI do a lot of traveling, as we've talked\nabout in some of our discussions.\n\n783\n00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,700\n>> Right.\n>> And stay in a lot of hotels, right?\n\n784\n00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,610\n>> Yeah.\n>> And so you see this in hotels.\n\n785\n00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,530\nAnd this is kinda interesting, and\n\n786\n00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,960\nlook for this, by the way,\nthe next time you're in a hotel.\n\n787\n00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,730\nThis is that whole common sense thing\nwe sometimes talk about with security.\n\n788\n00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,020\nSo when you get the cup of\ncoffee from McDonald's,\n\n789\n00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,140\nit says caution, hot beverage on it.\n\n790\n00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,360\nYou know why it says caution hot beverage?\n\n791\n00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,390\nCuz some idiot put it between their\nlegs in a car, drove away with it\n\n792\n00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:23,640\nwhen it didn't say caution hot beverage,\nand sued McDonald's or\n\n793\n00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,170\nwhoever the vendor would have been to\nbasically say hey, listen, I'm dumb.\n\n794\n00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,556\nBut you should have warned me.\n\n795\n00:36:28,556 --> 00:36:29,969\n[CROSSTALK]\n>> Should have told me my coffee was\n\n796\n00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:30,540\ngoing to be hot.\n\n797\n00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,460\n>> Right.\nTold me that your coffee\n\n798\n00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,030\nwas going to be hot.\n\n799\n00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,470\nI shouldn't put it between my legs and\ndrive.\n\n800\n00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:36,920\nSo the same thing with\nelectrical devices and water.\n\n801\n00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,970\nSo you see on a hairdryer,\nyou see the warning sticker.\n\n802\n00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:44,310\nIt has the big X on you and\nthe person in the bathtub and\n\n803\n00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,710\nyou throwing the hairdryer in the bathtub.\n\n804\n00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,180\nJust some of this stuff is so\nfunny it just boggles the mind.\n\n805\n00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:55,430\nAnd so what you see in hotels around this,\nbringing this full circle,\n\n806\n00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:58,640\nback to where we were, when you see\nthis in hotels what do you see?\n\n807\n00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,080\nYou see the sprinkler heads in the hotel,\nbut now you start,\n\n808\n00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,130\nI've started to see this\nthe last couple of years,\n\n809\n00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,160\nyou actually see they have\nsigns underneath this thing.\n\n810\n00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,510\nLook for this when you travel.\n\n811\n00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,270\nI promise you will see these.\n\n812\n00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:13,100\nYou see signs, big red circle, do not\ndo this with a hanger in the middle.\n\n813\n00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:13,620\n>> Yes.\n\n814\n00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,070\n>> That says don't hang your\nclothes on the sprinkler head.\n\n815\n00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,940\nBecause some idiot hung their\nclothes up there, broke,\n\n816\n00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,830\nI'm sure more than once, broke the fluid\ncylinder and set off the sprinklers.\n\n817\n00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:29,710\nI mean you've got to wonder what kind of\na rocket scientist are we dealing with\n\n818\n00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:33,360\nthat thinks that that thing that's\ncoming out of the wall is an extension.\n\n819\n00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,340\nAnd think about it.\n\n820\n00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,220\nThese are like six, eight,\nnine feet up in the air.\n\n821\n00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,850\n>> Right.\nYeah.\n\n822\n00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:37,630\n>> This is not like.\n\n823\n00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,720\n>> Not the most convenient thing.\n\n824\n00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,310\n>> You've got to get up on a chair.\n\n825\n00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,400\nYou've got to plan.\n\n826\n00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,690\nThis is not just a spur\nof the moment kind of.\n\n827\n00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,095\nYeah.\nI'm unpacking and\n\n828\n00:37:46,095 --> 00:37:48,680\nwell I'm out of space,\nlet me hang my suit up there.\n\n829\n00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,415\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> You've gotta plan for this.\n\n830\n00:37:50,415 --> 00:37:51,315\nAll right?\n\n831\n00:37:51,315 --> 00:37:53,495\nSo you gotta actually set out to do this.\n\n832\n00:37:53,495 --> 00:37:55,385\nAnd they hang their stuff on there.\n\n833\n00:37:55,385 --> 00:37:57,645\nI'm constantly amazed at what goes on.\n\n834\n00:37:57,645 --> 00:37:58,585\n>> It is amazing.\n\n835\n00:37:58,585 --> 00:37:59,826\n>> So you do see this stuff and\n\n836\n00:37:59,826 --> 00:38:02,543\nobviously if you do that you\nbreak the cylinder, right?\n\n837\n00:38:02,543 --> 00:38:05,129\nYou get the $250 bill for\nthe cleanup services,\n\n838\n00:38:05,129 --> 00:38:08,340\nplus probably you don't get\nanother room in the hotel.\n\n839\n00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,370\nAnd so just be aware of that,\n\n840\n00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,960\nthat's what we are talking about\nwith these kind of things, right?\n\n841\n00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,876\nSo-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n842\n00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:14,376\n>> Hey.\n\n843\n00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:15,841\nI can't make this stuff up.\n\n844\n00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:17,890\nIt is comedic gold as we say, right.\n\n845\n00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,430\nSo that is detection,\nwhat about suppression, right?\n\n846\n00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,840\nSo let's talk about stopping\nthe fires as quickly as possible.\n\n847\n00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,240\nHere we're talking about, for instance,\nfire ratings for extinguishers, right.\n\n848\n00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:29,520\nJust one example of this, where we\nlook at what kind of extinguisher and\n\n849\n00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,610\nwhat kind of fire is that\nextinguisher rated for, right?\n\n850\n00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,620\nSo we have fire classes and\nwe have four classes.\n\n851\n00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,660\nActually five, but we'll focus on four.\n\n852\n00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,720\nSo let's talk about what they are.\n\n853\n00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,930\nSo we have class A, class B,\nthese are fire types or\n\n854\n00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,840\nrating types for fire classes.\n\n855\n00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,540\nClass A, class B, Class C, and Class D.\n\n856\n00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,400\nThere is also a Class K,\nbut that's kitchen fires.\n\n857\n00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,930\nWe're not gonna worry too much about that.\n\n858\n00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,600\nWe don't tend to see those\ntoo often in IT settings.\n\n859\n00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,520\nIf you're cooking the data center, by\nthe way, and you set off the fire alarm,\n\n860\n00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,640\nbecause your deep fryer-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n861\n00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,090\n>> Or something catches fire.\n\n862\n00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,510\nListen, what can I tell you.\n\n863\n00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,205\nYou get what you pay for, I suppose.\n\n864\n00:39:06,205 --> 00:39:08,200\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> So when we talk about class A,\n\n865\n00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,130\nremember that if you went to college and\nyou lived away from home\n\n866\n00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,340\nwhen you went to college, you lived in\nthe dorm, they have those restrictions.\n\n867\n00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,220\nYou can't cook in the dorm room.\n\n868\n00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,126\nBut then everybody would\nalways have the hot plate.\n\n869\n00:39:18,126 --> 00:39:18,835\n>> You got the hot plate,\ntoaster ovens going.\n\n870\n00:39:18,835 --> 00:39:21,175\n>> Got the toaster oven,\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n871\n00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:22,990\nSo, two,\nthree in the morning you're hungry.\n\n872\n00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,865\n>> Trying to cook with Sterno.\n\n873\n00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:28,200\n>> [LAUGH] Cuz you know you want\nto cook with a flammable gel\n\n874\n00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200\nlike liquid that burns\nanything it touches.\n\n875\n00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:30,730\n>> Absolutely.\n>> Right,\n\n876\n00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,420\nin one of our prior episodes we\ndid the whole thermite thing and\n\n877\n00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,970\ntalked about thermite, right,\nthat's like thermite junior.\n\n878\n00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,650\nIt doesn't burn through anything, but\n\n879\n00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,170\nit will burn relentlessly\non anything it touches.\n\n880\n00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:40,980\n>> And it sticks.\n\n881\n00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,190\n>> And it sticks, it's basically\na gel that's a flammable gel.\n\n882\n00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:50,100\nYes, you wanna definitely play with Sterno\nin the dorm room, that's always good.\n\n883\n00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,795\nSo let's get back our notes here.\n\n884\n00:39:52,795 --> 00:39:54,080\n[LAUGH] Oh my God.\n\n885\n00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,450\nI'm glad it's only Friday once a week.\n\n886\n00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,167\nSo Class A, right.\n\n887\n00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:01,208\nSo the type of fire class\nA extinguishers typically\n\n888\n00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:04,542\nwould deal with would be\ncommon combustibles, right.\n\n889\n00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:05,625\nSo things that are burning.\n\n890\n00:40:05,625 --> 00:40:09,083\nThis may be wood, this may be paper,\nanything like that.\n\n891\n00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,376\nCommon combustibles.\n\n892\n00:40:10,376 --> 00:40:13,780\nSo we're going to see things like water\nand foam being used for this right.\n\n893\n00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,420\nThis is the kind of stuff we would use\nto put out the fire would be water or\n\n894\n00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,140\nfoam more often than not,\nor foam water or foam.\n\n895\n00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:24,160\nA class B fire would typically be\na liquid fire of some kind right.\n\n896\n00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,270\nSo this would be things like gasoline or\noil fires things of that nature, right?\n\n897\n00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:33,290\nAnd we would want to use gas or\nCO2 or something like that,\n\n898\n00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:38,080\nmaybe a foam or\na dry powder to put out the fire here.\n\n899\n00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,370\nBut we're not going to use water.\n\n900\n00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,620\nWater spreads the fire and makes it worse.\n\n901\n00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:44,640\nBecause then the oil or the combustible\nliquid is flowing everywhere, right?\n\n902\n00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,230\nSo no water.\n\n903\n00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:48,070\nClass C is going to be electrical.\n\n904\n00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:52,410\nThese are electrical fires, and electrical\nfires, again, definitely no water.\n\n905\n00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:57,810\nThat would be bad, but again, things\nlike gas, CO2, powder, so extinguishers\n\n906\n00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:01,840\nused in electrical fires are going to be\ndry extinguishers traditionally, right?\n\n907\n00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:05,470\nSo gas, powder, CO2,\nsomething like that, all right?\n\n908\n00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:09,320\nAnd then class D will be\ncombustible materials, but\n\n909\n00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,620\nthese will be typically\nchemical combustibles.\n\n910\n00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,400\nSo, metals, and things of that nature.\n\n911\n00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,800\nSo, sodium, magnesium, potassium,\nchemicals that are going to burn.\n\n912\n00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,840\nThings like that.\n\n913\n00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,280\nMetals, right, potentially combustible\nmetals, that we're talking about.\n\n914\n00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,940\nAnd so dry powder only.\n\n915\n00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,000\nNo liquid of any kind.\n\n916\n00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,620\nYou spray or put liquid on a combustible\nmetal fire, it will explode.\n\n917\n00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:35,150\nNot just burn and spread, but\nit will actually explode.\n\n918\n00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,600\nWhich can be catastrophic, obviously,\nif you're standing near it.\n\n919\n00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,008\nSo you don't want that to happen.\n\n920\n00:41:39,008 --> 00:41:42,770\nSo just to understand that again from\na knowledge management standpoint,\n\n921\n00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,660\npreparing for some questions, got to\nmake sure we understand the classes of\n\n922\n00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,160\nfire ratings here,\nthe kind of combustible and\n\n923\n00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:53,420\nkind of suppression mechanism that\nwe may bring to the party here.\n\n924\n00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,240\nIf something's going on.\n\n925\n00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,550\nWe also quickly want to throw\nout the idea of plenum, and\n\n926\n00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:01,230\nthis idea of a plenum grade cable which\nis going to be cable that is rated for\n\n927\n00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,680\ncrawl spaces,\nthat is treated in such a way.\n\n928\n00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,760\nThat it will smolder.\n\n929\n00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,390\nIt will not catch fire, but rather it\nwill smolder and not spread the fire for\n\n930\n00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,050\na period of time.\n\n931\n00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:14,720\nSo it's got a fire rating, if you will,\nbe fire what you call retardant\n\n932\n00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,390\nas opposed to fire resistant, for\nit will spread fire over time, but\n\n933\n00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:22,610\nit will really prevent the spread of\nfire for a period of time, right?\n\n934\n00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:24,310\nSo slow burn, if you will, right?\n\n935\n00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,080\nSlow, it will just kind of fizzle out.\n\n936\n00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,760\nWhereas if you ever like said,\nwe've probably done this as a kid, and\n\n937\n00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,980\nset fire to like a straw or\nsomething that's plastic,\n\n938\n00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,740\nit just crinkles up and burns and\ngets all that acrid smoke..\n\n939\n00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:36,250\n>> Then it could end up\nacting like a wick and\n\n940\n00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,932\ncarry that fire right through a firewall\nthat's supposed to prevent [INAUDIBLE]\n\n941\n00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:39,580\n>> Or through conduit, right,\n\n942\n00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,001\nthrough the conduit that\npunches through the firewall.\n\n943\n00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:43,880\nAbsolutely, so\nconduit is a carrier, potentially.\n\n944\n00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,620\nA conduit will create a channel for\nfire to transit.\n\n945\n00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,980\nSo that's one of the reasons you can't\npoke holes in firewalls, even with pipes.\n\n946\n00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,100\nBecause potentially the fire could run\nright through the firewall instead of\n\n947\n00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,170\nburning through it.\n\n948\n00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,310\nSo that's an issue.\n\n949\n00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:58,660\nBut plenum grade cable is used\nin crawl spaces above and below.\n\n950\n00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,290\nSo in data centers in the raised\nfloors underneath, plenum grade cable.\n\n951\n00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,760\nIn the ceilings up above,\nplenum grade cable.\n\n952\n00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,207\nThis is crawl space, graded cable\nthat will be fire-retardant and\n\n953\n00:43:08,207 --> 00:43:10,030\nfire-resistant, depending on the ratings.\n\n954\n00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:12,140\nSo just want to make\nsure we're aware of that.\n\n955\n00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,100\nAnother thing to consider here when we\ntalk about fire suppression is the use of\n\n956\n00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,290\ngases to suppress fire.\n\n957\n00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:18,700\nWe do no longer.\n\n958\n00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,570\nDo no longer.\n\n959\n00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,000\nIn other words no longer use.\n\n960\n00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,535\nI should say that in\na more forthright way.\n\n961\n00:43:23,535 --> 00:43:25,300\n>> [LAUGH]\n>> We no longer use a halon.\n\n962\n00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:29,700\nHalon which was a gas that was used,\nit was a fire-suppression gas.\n\n963\n00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,140\nYou may still find some of these systems,\nalthough very unlikely today because\n\n964\n00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,510\nthey had about a 10-year shelf life\nbefore they had to be recharged and\n\n965\n00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:41,830\nwe've stopped the use of Halon,\nreally until,\n\n966\n00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:45,300\nprobably the early 90s, early to mid\n90s is when we would see it being used.\n\n967\n00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,610\nSo, probably by,\naround the early 2000s you\n\n968\n00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:51,690\nwould've seen almost all these systems,\nnot all of them go out of.\n\n969\n00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:54,180\nYou know, go out of service and\nbe replaced.\n\n970\n00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,570\nSo you may still see halon stickers, but\n\n971\n00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:00,800\nwhat you really are looking at now\nis an FM200, most likely, system.\n\n972\n00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,360\nA system that has been replaced,\nhalon with FM200, which is another gas.\n\n973\n00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,510\nThe reason we replace halon\nis the Montreal Protocol\n\n974\n00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:12,330\nwas signed in the early 90s,\nlate 80s, early 90s.\n\n975\n00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,500\nWhich was a greenhouse gas\nenvironmental protocol\n\n976\n00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,050\nthat prevents the use of gases like halon.\n\n977\n00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:21,890\nBecause they are seen as greenhouse\ngases that basically are going to not\n\n978\n00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,780\nonly cause environmental damage, but\nare going to screw up the ozone layer,\n\n979\n00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:29,620\nwhich is obviously very,\nvery problematic for us.\n\n980\n00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,280\nSo the Montreal Protocol,\n\n981\n00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,240\nsomething we probably want to make\na note on there very quickly as well,\n\n982\n00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,700\nwas the reason that we no longer use\nhalon, it blocked the use of halon.\n\n983\n00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:44,300\nAnd it has forced us to replace those\nsystems with gases like FM-200.\n\n984\n00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,190\nThere's many other gases we can use,\n\n985\n00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:49,350\nargon, and\nthere's a variety of other ones, NAF.\n\n986\n00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:53,900\nThere's different versions of\nNEF that can be used, aragonite,\n\n987\n00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,990\nInterjam, there's a bunch of\ndifferent ones that may be there.\n\n988\n00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:00,950\nThe Montreal Protocol,\nthe Montreal Protocol is what was used for\n\n989\n00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:03,990\nwhat the agreement was that\nbanned the use of halon and so\n\n990\n00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:05,080\nthese systems are interesting,\n\n991\n00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,370\nbecause they're gas-powered, meaning\nthey're going to have sprinkler heads.\n\n992\n00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:10,290\nBut they're dry sprinkler\nheads- they shoot gas out.\n\n993\n00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:15,260\nAnd so if there is a fire, what happens is\nyou have a set of warning lights, clacks,\n\n994\n00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,770\nand sirens that go off.\n\n995\n00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:20,970\nYou typically have some sort of\ndelay on these systems, 30 seconds,\n\n996\n00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,590\na minute, whatever it may be, so that\nthe people that are working in this area\n\n997\n00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:28,810\ncan either get out through the safety\ndoor or can put on breathing gear.\n\n998\n00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,730\nBecause the minute you shoot Halon or\n\n999\n00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:35,260\nany of these gases into a room,\nyou suck the oxygen out of the room.\n\n1000\n00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,070\nThe way it kills the fires, it basically\nit binds chemically to the oxygen, and\n\n1001\n00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,170\nsuffocates fire, along with everybody\nelse happens to be sitting in there\n\n1002\n00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:44,170\nthat may be a mouth breather as well.\n\n1003\n00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:45,730\nSo unless your good at holding your breath\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1004\n00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:47,280\n>> for longer than the amount of time it\n\n1005\n00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,680\ntakes to kill the fire,\n\n1006\n00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,140\nyou basically are screwed-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1007\n00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:50,940\n>> for lack of a better way\n\n1008\n00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,130\nof putting that right.\n\n1009\n00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:55,480\nSo as a result you go through training\nwhere you have to know how to go grab\n\n1010\n00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,640\nbreathing gear, where it's located\nthose units have to be serviced and\n\n1011\n00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,540\nthere always has to be enough gear on\nhand for the people working in the room.\n\n1012\n00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,930\n>> Right.\n>> This is where we get into things like\n\n1013\n00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,440\ntraining vendors and people that come in\nto visit, what that means because they\n\n1014\n00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,290\nhave to be basically thrown out of\nthe room within a certain amount time or\n\n1015\n00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:14,020\nthey're going to die if they\ncan't put on breathing gear.\n\n1016\n00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:14,835\nAnd you may be able to put it on.\n\n1017\n00:46:14,835 --> 00:46:16,725\nIf you don't know how to turn it on and\nuse it.\n\n1018\n00:46:16,725 --> 00:46:17,645\n>> Right.\n>> That's not going to\n\n1019\n00:46:17,645 --> 00:46:19,135\ndo you any good because there's no oxygen.\n\n1020\n00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,805\nSo this is really, really important stuff.\n\n1021\n00:46:21,805 --> 00:46:23,525\nSo these massive data centers.\n\n1022\n00:46:23,525 --> 00:46:24,695\nLike Google's data centers,\n\n1023\n00:46:24,695 --> 00:46:27,920\nMicrosoft's data centers,\nthat use these kind of systems.\n\n1024\n00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,480\nRight,\n>> Right.\n\n1025\n00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,010\n>> for\nthe most part are going to be automated.\n\n1026\n00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:31,720\nThere aren't that many human beings there.\n\n1027\n00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:35,170\nBut in the areas where there are,\nyou will find there's breathing gear and\n\n1028\n00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,350\nthere are training systems\nthat go on relentlessly or\n\n1029\n00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,420\ntraining cycles around how\nto be secure and safe.\n\n1030\n00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,330\n>> Right.\n>> Because what happens is we block off\n\n1031\n00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,510\nthese areas we have fire\ndoors that come down and\n\n1032\n00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,420\nbasically lock off these areas and\nsmother the fire.\n\n1033\n00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,230\nAnd if you're stuck inside you have to\nhave enough oxygen as a system to support\n\n1034\n00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:52,470\nyou until somebody comes along and\nopens the door.\n\n1035\n00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:53,730\n>> Right.\nAbsolutely.\n\n1036\n00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:54,720\n>> So just be aware of that.\n\n1037\n00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,348\n[CROSSTALK] Huh?\n\n1038\n00:46:55,348 --> 00:46:56,460\n>> Life come first, right?\n\n1039\n00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,260\n>> Only if you're smart.\n\n1040\n00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,660\nOtherwise,\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1041\n00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,700\n>> May not, right?\n\n1042\n00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,400\n>> True.\n>> All right, so,\n\n1043\n00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,080\nlet's talk about water sprinklers.\n\n1044\n00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,190\nWe just talked about gas suppression and\ndry sprinklers,\n\n1045\n00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,520\nlet's talk about water sprinklers.\n\n1046\n00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,210\nWe have different types of sprinklers that\nare used with water to suppress fire.\n\n1047\n00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:11,410\nIt's pretty common, even in data centers.\n\n1048\n00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:13,120\nWe just want to understand\nhow this is done.\n\n1049\n00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,160\nSo we have what are known\nas wet pipe systems.\n\n1050\n00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,020\nWet pipe systems will be fully charged.\n\n1051\n00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,590\nThe water is always in there, ready to go.\n\n1052\n00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:22,800\nThey are usually going to be discharged\nas we said things like in your\n\n1053\n00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,350\nhotel room is a wet pipe system.\n\n1054\n00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:28,070\nWith that little cylinder of liquid that's\nholding up a piston you pull that thing\n\n1055\n00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:31,160\nout to break it and boom, the water\ncomes flying out of the sprinkler head.\n\n1056\n00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,590\nWhat we call, wet pipe.\n\n1057\n00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,210\nWe have dry pipe.\n\n1058\n00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:35,548\nSo yeah.\nWe'll just let you make note.\n\n1059\n00:47:35,548 --> 00:47:36,660\n>> Go ahead.\n>> Just fully charged.\n\n1060\n00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:37,420\nWater is in the pipe.\n\n1061\n00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:38,260\nThat's fine.\n\n1062\n00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,440\nAbsolutely.\nVery good.\n\n1063\n00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,810\nSo water is in the pipe.\n\n1064\n00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,390\nWhat's what we want to know\nabout a wet pipe system.\n\n1065\n00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:44,500\nDry pipe.\n\n1066\n00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:47,420\nUnlike wet pipe, right,\nno water in the system.\n\n1067\n00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,530\nSo what happens is the water\nis not in the pipe,\n\n1068\n00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:51,470\nbut rather is in a holding tank somewhere.\n\n1069\n00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:54,230\nStep where you see on floors,\nor up above on the buildings,\n\n1070\n00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:57,680\nhave these massive water tanks, and\nit's gravity fed system typically,\n\n1071\n00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,680\nalthough there may be air pressure,\ndepending on kind of system we use.\n\n1072\n00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:03,083\nAnd water is then going\nto flow into the pipes.\n\n1073\n00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:07,706\nAfter the alarm is set off, we open up the\nmain valves at the water holding system at\n\n1074\n00:48:07,706 --> 00:48:10,400\nthe tank, and\nwater flows down and floods out.\n\n1075\n00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,190\nSo Dry pipes have a delay, right.\n\n1076\n00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,664\nThey won't come on right away,\nand they're not going to be,\n\n1077\n00:48:14,664 --> 00:48:16,402\nthere's not going to be any water in them.\n\n1078\n00:48:16,402 --> 00:48:20,870\nAnd hen preaction, what we call preaction,\nall one word, preaction systems,\n\n1079\n00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,170\nright, we have water there.\n\n1080\n00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:27,770\nWater is held in there in the system,\nbut there's air in the pipes.\n\n1081\n00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:30,670\nSo there's water in the holding tank,\nbut not in the pipes themselves.\n\n1082\n00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:34,450\nAnd so\nwe pre-pressurize the pipes with air.\n\n1083\n00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:38,900\nAnd so as a result when we let that\ngo what happens is that the air\n\n1084\n00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,620\nflows out of the system and\nthen the water flows in.\n\n1085\n00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,430\nRight?\nBehind it.\n\n1086\n00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:45,258\nAnd so there's a delay as well, right?\n\n1087\n00:48:45,258 --> 00:48:48,888\nBut that preaction system is\ngoing to be air pressurized.\n\n1088\n00:48:48,888 --> 00:48:51,280\nAnd so we'll just want to make\nsure that we are aware of that.\n\n1089\n00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,390\nSo when the air pressure in the pipes\ngoes down, basically water flows in,\n\n1090\n00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:56,340\nthat's effectively how you\nwant to think of that.\n\n1091\n00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,840\nAnd then we have the last\none which is deluge.\n\n1092\n00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,700\nDeluge.\n\n1093\n00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,900\nJust like the name implies,\nkind of like the flood, right?\n\n1094\n00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,140\nAll comes pouring out.\n\n1095\n00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,740\nA deluge system has\nthe sprinkler heads wide open.\n\n1096\n00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:11,010\nThink of these shower heads that are like,\nrainfall heads that are just big and\n\n1097\n00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:13,125\nhefty and all the water comes\nflowing out of them right away.\n\n1098\n00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:17,500\nSo wide open it allows the most\nlargest volume of water to be\n\n1099\n00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,390\nbasically affected we dumped on the system\nin the shortest amount of time, and so\n\n1100\n00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:23,770\nwe just start streaming.\n\n1101\n00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:26,880\nIt's almost like a fire hose pouring out\nof the ceiling is what we see there.\n\n1102\n00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,880\nJust be aware of that.\n\n1103\n00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,700\nThat is a deluge, right a deluge system.\n\n1104\n00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,590\nSo please be aware of that as well.\n\n1105\n00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:37,160\nSo a deluge system is going to be the last\nkind of system that we talk about.\n\n1106\n00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,212\nDeluge, take out the d.\n\n1107\n00:49:39,212 --> 00:49:42,839\nI'm sorry take out the D, deluge, right,\nyeah, so that's how we're going to spell\n\n1108\n00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,538\nthat and make sure we're good with that,\nabsolutely correct.\n\n1109\n00:49:45,538 --> 00:49:47,770\nAll right very good,\nlet's talk about locks a little bit.\n\n1110\n00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:48,930\nWe've talked about water suppression,\n\n1111\n00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:52,060\nall that kind of stuff, let's talk\nabout locks, no good physical security\n\n1112\n00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,250\ndiscussion would be good without\nthe discussion about locks.\n\n1113\n00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,760\nThe only inexpensive access\ncontrol mechanisms right?\n\n1114\n00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,110\nSeen as relatively\ninexpensive widely used.\n\n1115\n00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:02,090\nThey are considered to\nbe delaying devices.\n\n1116\n00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:04,170\nRight so\nwe consider them a delaying device.\n\n1117\n00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:06,740\nSo there are different\nkinds of locks out there.\n\n1118\n00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:10,700\nWe have mechanical locks, mechanical\nlocks will be the locks that are gonna be\n\n1119\n00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,870\nthe old fashioned locks we're used to.\n\n1120\n00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:16,680\nPadlocks, combination locks,\nkey locks things like that.\n\n1121\n00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:21,870\nRight so we have padlocks, padlocks\nare called warded locks by the way.\n\n1122\n00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:22,830\nWarded locks.\n\n1123\n00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:27,685\nWarded locks will be a lock,\na ward ed, warded locks, So\n\n1124\n00:50:27,685 --> 00:50:32,470\nw-a-r-d-e-d warded, that's the kind of\nlock that we refer to as a padlock.\n\n1125\n00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,910\nWe also have what is\nknown as a tumbler lock.\n\n1126\n00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:39,120\nA tumbler lock will be a lock that is the\nlock, though we typically use with a key,\n\n1127\n00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,210\nwe're used to turning the key,\n\n1128\n00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:43,200\nputting the key in, right, and\nit has pins in it and moves around.\n\n1129\n00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,850\nNow, I know we had a couple,\nI think we had a couple pictures on these.\n\n1130\n00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:46,580\nProbably just want to show.\n\n1131\n00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,360\n>> What do you want to start with?\n\n1132\n00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,400\n>> Let's start with the warded lock.\n\n1133\n00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,090\nThere's just a typical padlock, right.\n\n1134\n00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:53,970\nSo we put the key inside,\nand that key will turn but\n\n1135\n00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:58,710\nthe idea is that we typically refer\nto this as a very basic padlock.\n\n1136\n00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:00,030\nNothing fancy, right?\n\n1137\n00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:03,180\nAnd then, if we have a tumbler lock\nthere's a lot more pieces in something\n\n1138\n00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,390\nlike this where it's got the spring\nloaded pins that are going up and\n\n1139\n00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:09,120\ndown based on the ridges and\ngrooves on the key and\n\n1140\n00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,900\nthen we move those up to a certain\ndegree when we put the key in and\n\n1141\n00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,220\nturn it, we effectively are triggering\nthe lock or unlock mechanism.\n\n1142\n00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,370\nThat's going to be a tumbler lock.\n\n1143\n00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:20,470\nSo I just wanna make sure we know the\ndifference between the two, padded lock or\n\n1144\n00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:22,910\nrather a awarded lock and a tumbler lock.\n\n1145\n00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:26,340\nThis is a cryptographic lock or\nsome kind of a lock here\n\n1146\n00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:30,640\nas we see that will allow us to be able to\ngo in and do what's called a cypher lock,\n\n1147\n00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,920\ncryptographic lock,\ncypher lock, same thing.\n\n1148\n00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,130\nWhere I punch in some sort of code.\n\n1149\n00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,910\nWe see this on more secure systems.\n\n1150\n00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:38,250\nYou have to punch in the code\nin order to be able to access.\n\n1151\n00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:40,670\nIt may have a card swipe of some kind,\nright?\n\n1152\n00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:44,720\nIn some of the James Bond movies they\nhave the cryptographic locks that\n\n1153\n00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,880\nare music based, things like that.\n\n1154\n00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,850\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1155\n00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,710\nBut these are traditionally\ncalled cipher locks.\n\n1156\n00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:51,990\nThese are called cipher\nlocks more often than not.\n\n1157\n00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:58,070\nWe may also have things like device locks,\nwhere we chain our laptop or\n\n1158\n00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,520\nsomething down to a desk, right?\n\n1159\n00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,320\nA little cable of some kind.\n\n1160\n00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,630\nYou ever use those things?\n\n1161\n00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:03,530\nI never use those things.\n\n1162\n00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,825\n>> No.\n>> I figure if you want it that badly,\n\n1163\n00:52:04,825 --> 00:52:07,670\nyou're just gonna cut the leg off and\ntake it anyway.\n\n1164\n00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:09,850\nI might as well not piss\nyou off in the process.\n\n1165\n00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:11,250\nThat's right.\n>> I've seen somebody lock one of those\n\n1166\n00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,530\nthings to a table that's movable.\n\n1167\n00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,850\n>> Yes you just pick the table up and\nwalk right away with it.\n\n1168\n00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,880\nYeah I don't waste a lot\nof times with those things.\n\n1169\n00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,570\nI just take my laptop with me when I'm\ntraveling and I'll leave it in my room.\n\n1170\n00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,460\n>> Exactly.\n\n1171\n00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,425\n>> I take it wherever I go.\n\n1172\n00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:23,219\nJust be aware of that, right?\n\n1173\n00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:24,890\nSo some things to consider.\n\n1174\n00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:28,180\nWe also want to talk quickly about\nthis idea, what's called lock bumping.\n\n1175\n00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,910\nLock bumping,\nwhere if the lock is not very strong,\n\n1176\n00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:35,440\nnot a very good constructed lock,\nthe strength is not very good.\n\n1177\n00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,060\nYou can take tumbler locks and\nyou actually can bump them with a pick or\n\n1178\n00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:43,290\na key, which is how we see like a flat\nkey being made, a skeleton key, or a pick\n\n1179\n00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,250\nbeing inserted where you can effectively\nget the tumblers to line up and\n\n1180\n00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,960\npick the lock and open it up.\n\n1181\n00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,709\nSo refer to this as lock bumping,\nthis is just a term that we use.\n\n1182\n00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,180\nWe also wanna talk this\nidea of piggybacking.\n\n1183\n00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:57,570\nPiggybacking is not a lock thing,\nbut rather a scan once and\n\n1184\n00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:59,630\nwalk many kind of concept right?\n\n1185\n00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:03,640\nAlmost like the opposite\nof a single sign on on SSL.\n\n1186\n00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,970\nScan once or login once and access many.\n\n1187\n00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:09,200\nSo, we often talk about piggybacking in\nthis section which is where somebody will\n\n1188\n00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:13,090\nswipe their card and multiple people\nwill walk through at the same time.\n\n1189\n00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,520\nThat's another reason why\nwe use those pressure pads\n\n1190\n00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,540\ninside the man traps in data centers.\n\n1191\n00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,070\nWe don't want two people\ngoing in on one swipe right?\n\n1192\n00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:20,890\nSo just be aware of that.\n\n1193\n00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:24,170\nIt's another term we use, just\na vocabulary item you want to have some\n\n1194\n00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:26,610\nfamiliarity with as we go through this.\n\n1195\n00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,750\nAlright so\nlet's talk a little bit about fencing.\n\n1196\n00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,870\nWe've talked about locks,\ntalked about sprinklers,\n\n1197\n00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:33,370\ntalked about all this\ndifferent kind of stuff.\n\n1198\n00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:35,620\nSo obviously fencing is\nalso very important.\n\n1199\n00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,570\nWe want to make sure we have fences in\nplaces where they may be appropriate,\n\n1200\n00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:41,420\nand we have different heights of\nfences that we want to focus on.\n\n1201\n00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,425\nSo a fence that is typically three\nto four feet in height very small,\n\n1202\n00:53:45,425 --> 00:53:48,180\nreally just deter the casual person,\nright?\n\n1203\n00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,140\nAnybody who's real serious is gonna\nget over that pretty quickly.\n\n1204\n00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:56,410\nFences that are 6 to 7 feet in height are\ntypically gonna be considered too high to\n\n1205\n00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:59,100\nclimb easily, so\nthey may deter most people,\n\n1206\n00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,670\nunless they show up with ladder and\nare pretty prepared.\n\n1207\n00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:04,680\nRight that kind of thing and\nthen fences that are eight feet and\n\n1208\n00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,560\nhigher are really gonna be most likely\nthe most, offer the most deterrent\n\n1209\n00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,970\ncapabilities, especially if we\nadd barb wire to them on the top.\n\n1210\n00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:15,710\nSo, strands of barb wire they're\nfacing out or facing in.\n\n1211\n00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,020\nOr perhaps both so you know in jails\nyou often see kind of like this,\n\n1212\n00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,910\nup the top of the fence where\none goes in each direction and\n\n1213\n00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,960\nas a result it's very hard to\nclimb over into or out off.\n\n1214\n00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,970\nSo, those are typically going\nto be seen as being the most or\n\n1215\n00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:28,960\noffering the most deterrent capabilities.\n\n1216\n00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,500\nSo just be aware of that when we talk\nabout a fence, but we wanna make sure we\n\n1217\n00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,700\nthink about fences, very important\nto think about that as well.\n\n1218\n00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,720\nThe gauge and mesh size of\nthe fence is always important.\n\n1219\n00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,390\nThe bigger the holes in the fence,\n\n1220\n00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,950\nthe easier it may be to reach through and\nyou know, do things.\n\n1221\n00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:46,460\nThe smaller the mesh, the smaller the\ngauge, the harder it is to get through.\n\n1222\n00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,520\nSo you want to think about that.\n\n1223\n00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,075\nThere's also a certain kind\nof a fence called a pidas.\n\n1224\n00:54:51,075 --> 00:54:53,100\nP-I-D-A-S.\n\n1225\n00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,820\nPidas fencing,\nwhich has an interwoven mesh\n\n1226\n00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:00,350\nof electronic sensors like a sensor\nnet interwoven into the fence.\n\n1227\n00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:02,320\nSo if you cut through\nthe fence chaining and\n\n1228\n00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,700\nthe linking to get in, we often see that\nin movies, oh, let's cut through it.\n\n1229\n00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,420\n>> Yeah.\n>> When you do that,\n\n1230\n00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:09,710\nyou set off the alarm grid because\nyou basically break the wire mesh.\n\n1231\n00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:11,490\nWhich sets off the monitoring systems.\n\n1232\n00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:15,170\nWe see this around secure installations,\nyou see this in military, and\n\n1233\n00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:16,900\ngovernment installations,\nthey use this kind of fence.\n\n1234\n00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,230\nIt's very expensive, by the way,\nbut it's very effective.\n\n1235\n00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:21,780\nYou know, because if anybody,\ncuts through the fence,\n\n1236\n00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,450\nthey immediately set off an alarm,\nyou know that kind of thing right?\n\n1237\n00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:27,170\nSo just be aware of that, obviously\nwanna make sure we're aware of that.\n\n1238\n00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,130\nAlso lighting, right?\n\n1239\n00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,360\nAnother area we want to spend a little\ntime on just educating us about,\n\n1240\n00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:32,640\ntalking a little bit about.\n\n1241\n00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,430\nSo lighting is an area obviously\nvery important for us.\n\n1242\n00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:37,690\nWant to create total coverage or\n\n1243\n00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:40,850\nat least if possible have general\ncoverage when we deal with lighting.\n\n1244\n00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:42,480\nWe do not want islands, right?\n\n1245\n00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,100\nWhat we often hate to see is\nyou're walking down a walkway.\n\n1246\n00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,480\nYou see a little pool of light then\nthere's a big black dark space,\n\n1247\n00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:49,560\nthen another pool of light.\n\n1248\n00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,040\n>> So artsy, and so.\n\n1249\n00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,980\n>> Yeah, it's also very bad,\nbecause the bad guys hide in the dark.\n\n1250\n00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,790\nAnd to pick off the good guys as\nthey walk through the light, right?\n\n1251\n00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:59,880\nSo you never wanna see that,\nyou see that in the movies, right?\n\n1252\n00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,833\nYou know somebody's gonna just get it,\nright, when the go.\n\n1253\n00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:02,458\n>> Yeah, absolutely.\n\n1254\n00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:03,029\n[LAUGH]\n>> Right,\n\n1255\n00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:05,000\nthey don't show up on the other side,\nso, right?\n\n1256\n00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,069\nSo make sure we know,\nreally no islands of lighting,\n\n1257\n00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:10,125\ntotal coverage if at all possible.\n\n1258\n00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:11,127\nVery important.\n\n1259\n00:56:11,127 --> 00:56:14,056\nWe want to make sure that we have\nspecifically as we talk about this\n\n1260\n00:56:14,056 --> 00:56:17,096\ncritical areas really need to have\nillumination that reaches out at\n\n1261\n00:56:17,096 --> 00:56:18,340\nleast eight feet, right.\n\n1262\n00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,040\nWe want to have a good eight foot\ncoverage around critical areas so\n\n1263\n00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,680\nnobody can get in there unless we see\nthem with, you know, other monitoring.\n\n1264\n00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,780\nAnd we want to have that illumination\nbe at a brightness of what we call two\n\n1265\n00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,150\nfoot candles, right?\n\n1266\n00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:30,210\nTwo foot candles.\n\n1267\n00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:33,410\nWe measure illumination so we have\nan overall critical coverage area of eight\n\n1268\n00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:36,510\nfeet with an illumination\nrating of two foot candles.\n\n1269\n00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:39,380\nIn the old days,\nwe used to measure lighting based on,\n\n1270\n00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:41,955\nyou carried a candle with you and\nwhat was the radius of light.\n\n1271\n00:56:41,955 --> 00:56:43,275\nYou saw from the candle.\n\n1272\n00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:44,940\nIt's how we measured lighting early on.\n\n1273\n00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:46,303\n[CROSSTALK] And so\nwe still talk about it that way.\n\n1274\n00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:50,126\nA two foot candle illumination rating\nmeans what a single candle would\n\n1275\n00:56:50,126 --> 00:56:52,022\nilluminate for a two foot radius.\n\n1276\n00:56:52,022 --> 00:56:55,207\nThe brightness of that is\nwhat we would talk about.\n\n1277\n00:56:55,207 --> 00:56:59,157\nSo we want that brightness rating of a two\nfoot candle and an overall coverage rating\n\n1278\n00:56:59,157 --> 00:57:02,237\nof approximately eight feet while we\ndeal with lighting that is on very very\n\n1279\n00:57:02,237 --> 00:57:05,627\nspecific areas that are going to be\nimportant right, so just be aware of that.\n\n1280\n00:57:06,887 --> 00:57:10,217\nSo lighting should point away\nfrom critical areas, out so\n\n1281\n00:57:10,217 --> 00:57:13,947\nthat the people that are the guards behind\nthe lights are not blinded right, so\n\n1282\n00:57:13,947 --> 00:57:17,597\nwe call this glare protection, we want\nit to blind the people coming up and\n\n1283\n00:57:17,597 --> 00:57:20,510\nnot blind the people looking so\nthis is obviously very important.\n\n1284\n00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:23,160\nSo this is why we have the lights\npointing out when you drive up to\n\n1285\n00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:23,985\na secure facility.\n\n1286\n00:57:23,985 --> 00:57:25,390\n>> Mm-hm.\n>> It's very important to think about\n\n1287\n00:57:25,390 --> 00:57:27,720\nthat, so I just want to make sure\nyou're aware of that as well.\n\n1288\n00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,305\nSo let's also talk a bit about closed\ncircuit TV and generally just this idea of\n\n1289\n00:57:33,305 --> 00:57:37,395\nvideo and monitoring and cameras and\nthis kind of stuff, again, adding\n\n1290\n00:57:37,395 --> 00:57:40,885\nin all these different points and areas\naround things that we wanna be aware of.\n\n1291\n00:57:40,885 --> 00:57:45,032\nSo closed circuit TV,\nvery important, CCTV or CFTV.\n\n1292\n00:57:46,272 --> 00:57:49,872\nClose framework TV or something like that,\nso closed circuit TV,\n\n1293\n00:57:49,872 --> 00:57:53,232\ngeneral video systems right, monitors, you\nmay have these in your home by the way,\n\n1294\n00:57:53,232 --> 00:57:56,202\nyou may have the IP cameras, things like\nthat for a home system, we have them\n\n1295\n00:57:56,202 --> 00:58:01,012\nin business's typically, so the idea there\nis we basically have these systems and\n\n1296\n00:58:01,012 --> 00:58:04,182\nwe can monitor what's going on in\nareas in an automated fashion right?\n\n1297\n00:58:04,182 --> 00:58:09,060\nSo we have different kinds of lenses, we\nhave what are known as fixed focal length,\n\n1298\n00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,750\nthese are lenses that are of\na certain type that just, basically\n\n1299\n00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:15,840\ndon't zoom in but rather, just provide\na standard picture, fixed focal length.\n\n1300\n00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,080\nThen we have zoomed, or vary focal,\nwe call them vary focal,\n\n1301\n00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,495\nbut a zoom lens of vary.\n\n1302\n00:58:21,495 --> 00:58:25,505\nFocal lens, is a lens that can go\nin on a target and come back, and\n\n1303\n00:58:25,505 --> 00:58:29,875\noffer you basically this up close and\nthen kind of a panoramic view.\n\n1304\n00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:32,155\nSo vary focal versus a fixed focal lens.\n\n1305\n00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:34,435\nJust want to make sure we\nknow the difference there.\n\n1306\n00:58:34,435 --> 00:58:37,125\nWe also want to think about depth\nof field, what can we see and\n\n1307\n00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:38,565\nhow far can we see it?\n\n1308\n00:58:38,565 --> 00:58:40,445\nTo what level of details\nwith these systems,\n\n1309\n00:58:40,445 --> 00:58:42,840\njust want to make sure\nthat we're aware of that.\n\n1310\n00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,590\nWe also want to think about the iris,\n\n1311\n00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:48,230\nwhich is the light\naperture inside the lens.\n\n1312\n00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:50,700\nHow much light will it let in,\nso is it a manual iris,\n\n1313\n00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,800\nwhere we have to turn it to open it up,\nto stop up or stop down,\n\n1314\n00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,160\nas we would talk about in photography,\nor do we have an automatic iris,\n\n1315\n00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,595\nwhich will automatically adjust for\nthe light coming in.\n\n1316\n00:58:59,595 --> 00:59:00,320\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1317\n00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:04,180\n>> This is important because people try\nto blind cameras with either lasers or\n\n1318\n00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,500\nlights, or they'll shine\na bright light at the camera.\n\n1319\n00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:09,050\nAnd if it's not an automatic\nadjustment iris,\n\n1320\n00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:11,610\nit'll basically knock out the camera and\nyou won't be able to see anything, right?\n\n1321\n00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:13,480\nSo.\nThis is also something to be aware of and\n\n1322\n00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,640\nconsider as your thinking\nabout this right this kind of\n\n1323\n00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,810\nstuff that we want to\nmake sure we're aware of.\n\n1324\n00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:21,930\nYou'll also we talk about generally\njust aggregating up some of these other\n\n1325\n00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:24,960\nmechanisms that we could use for\ndetecting things right?\n\n1326\n00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,730\nSo like acoustic monitoring, sound\nvibration monitoring, acoustic monitoring\n\n1327\n00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:30,870\n>> You break glass.\n\n1328\n00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:34,120\nWe tend to pick that up,\nif we have acoustic monitoring.\n\n1329\n00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,480\nWe may have, as we talked about,\nsmoke detection.\n\n1330\n00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,390\nWe may have electronic circuit monitoring.\n\n1331\n00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:41,750\nMost home alarms and\nalarm systems work this way.\n\n1332\n00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,800\nYou break the electrical circuit\non the gird It sets it off.\n\n1333\n00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,470\nRight.\n\n1334\n00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:47,860\nWe might have microwave or ultrasonic or\n\n1335\n00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:52,980\nelectrostatic monitoring where if you\nchange the temperature rate in the room,\n\n1336\n00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:55,290\nyou see this like\nThe Mission Impossible movie, right?\n\n1337\n00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:57,210\n>> Yeah. Yeah. >> Where Tom Cruise\nis wearing the body suit and\n\n1338\n00:59:57,210 --> 00:59:58,060\nhe's hanging above the-\n>> Yup.\n\n1339\n00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,610\n>> Pressure sensitive floor in the vault.\n\n1340\n00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:02,860\nThe first one where's he's trying\nto get in and steal the oculus and\n\n1341\n01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:06,760\nthat basically is going to be monitoring,\nall this crazy security there.\n\n1342\n01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,840\nI love the fact that Freddy\nsneaks into the CIA supposedly,\n\n1343\n01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:12,865\nhe's in the HVAC system.\n\n1344\n01:00:12,865 --> 01:00:16,875\nYou remember in the air conditioning\nsystem, crawls through the vent.\n\n1345\n01:00:16,875 --> 01:00:19,105\nHe's up there, gets over the secure vault,\n\n1346\n01:00:19,105 --> 01:00:22,240\nis able to open up the grid that\nprotects the one access point.\n\n1347\n01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,965\n>> Uh-huh.\n>> And he's got the laser grid, but\n\n1348\n01:00:23,965 --> 01:00:27,522\nall he does is put the little cool mirror\ndevice in and moves the lasers over to\n\n1349\n01:00:27,522 --> 01:00:30,507\nreflect them and basically it's\njust big enough by the way for\n\n1350\n01:00:30,507 --> 01:00:34,142\nhim to be able to set himself in and\nput the hoist in and be able to get down.\n\n1351\n01:00:34,142 --> 01:00:36,972\nSo, whoever designed this,\nkudos, good job, right.\n\n1352\n01:00:36,972 --> 01:00:39,990\nAnd so he is hanging there and\nhe's hanging over the floor and\n\n1353\n01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:43,340\nthe floor's got the pressure plate\nin it so he can't touch it but\n\n1354\n01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:47,010\nhe's hanging there, right, and it's you\nknow, it's sensitive to these things.\n\n1355\n01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,690\nIt's got a heat sensor in the room so\n\n1356\n01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:51,020\nhe has to wear the body\nsuit to absorb his heat.\n\n1357\n01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,050\nBut then he's sweating so\n\n1358\n01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:55,050\nwhat happens of course, very,\nvery critical moment in the movie, right?\n\n1359\n01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:57,860\nTension filled,\nsweat's dripping it's about to fall and,\n\n1360\n01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,520\nreaches out his hand and grabs-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1361\n01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,630\n>> That drop of sweat before\n\n1362\n01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:01,130\nit hits the floor.\n\n1363\n01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:03,100\nBecause the floor is so sensitive-\n>> Yeah.\n\n1364\n01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,950\n>> That a drop of sweat would set it off.\n\n1365\n01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:06,780\nYet the idiot who designed this thing-\n>> [LAUGH]\n\n1366\n01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,700\n>> Was stupid enough to understand,\n\n1367\n01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,340\n>> That he had to put lasers up there, but\n\n1368\n01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,410\nmade the hole big enough that\na man could get through.\n\n1369\n01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:14,100\nAgain, good job, right?\n\n1370\n01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,220\nSo when you do design, right?\n\n1371\n01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,720\nThis is really important.\n\n1372\n01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:20,770\nIf you're a CISSP, right,\nand you do design and\n\n1373\n01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:23,160\nthis is the kind of system you build,\nright?\n\n1374\n01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,570\nDon't be that guy.\n\n1375\n01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:25,390\nDon't be that guy.\n\n1376\n01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,060\nBecause, obviously, clearly,\ndidn't do his job very well.\n\n1377\n01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,300\nOr her job, to be fair, we don't\nknow who it would have been, right?\n\n1378\n01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,200\nBut whoever it was,\n>> They clearly didn't pay attention to\n\n1379\n01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,800\nthis class, this offering, and\ndid not watch this particular episode.\n\n1380\n01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:37,380\nHad they,\n\n1381\n01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:41,060\nthey would have known what not to do when\nit came to environmental design, right?\n\n1382\n01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,740\nSo don't be that person, right?\n\n1383\n01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:45,870\nI just want to make sure we design\nsystems that are built properly, right?\n\n1384\n01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,650\nSo at the end of the day what\ndo we need to really do?\n\n1385\n01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:50,220\nWe're talking about all these\ndifferent kinds of monitoring, right,\n\n1386\n01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:51,110\nhow do we do this?\n\n1387\n01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:54,650\nLet's bring this back together and kind of\nyou know think about how we summarize all\n\n1388\n01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:56,510\nthis stuff and make it make sense.\n\n1389\n01:01:56,510 --> 01:01:59,100\nSo one of the key things you want to\nthink about, all right, is common sense.\n\n1390\n01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,240\nAnd we were just joking about\nthat with that movie reference.\n\n1391\n01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,985\n>> Right.\n>> But it is really, very critical.\n\n1392\n01:02:02,985 --> 01:02:03,540\n>> Mm-hm.\n\n1393\n01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:06,800\n>> When you design systems with all this\ncool whiz bang technology in there, and\n\n1394\n01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:10,390\nleave the most obvious thing\nunaccounted for, you get bad results.\n\n1395\n01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:15,160\nAnd so physical and environmental security\nis as much about common sense, and\n\n1396\n01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:19,520\nreally thinking about what it is that\nthe system has to be able to do.\n\n1397\n01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,720\nIn order to create security as it is\nabout all the cool technology lets\n\n1398\n01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:23,740\nyou do those things.\n\n1399\n01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:28,540\nBecause if we leave at the end of the day,\nif we leave environmental security and\n\n1400\n01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:33,660\nfiscal security out there as a process and\nwe don't bring common sense, right?\n\n1401\n01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,460\nThought processes about what\ncan go wrong to the system and\n\n1402\n01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:37,630\nwalk through those scenarios.\n\n1403\n01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:40,770\nDo that impact analysis that we\nsometimes talk about, right?\n\n1404\n01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:43,550\nAnd make sure we ask the obvious questions\n>> We're going to\n\n1405\n01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:46,280\nhave really expensive systems, that\nare unfortunately just aren't going to\n\n1406\n01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,300\nbe worth much at the end of the day,\nright.\n\n1407\n01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,500\nThe Tom Cruise's of the world\nare going to come across and\n\n1408\n01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,840\nthey're going to steal all our\ninformation from us, right.\n\n1409\n01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,900\nSo, as we wrap up our discussions here\nabout physical and environmental security,\n\n1410\n01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,700\nright, what do we want\nto make sure we know?\n\n1411\n01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,820\nAs a CISSP candidate,\nwant to make sure you're paying attention\n\n1412\n01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,510\nto all of the material that we go through,\nall of the areas of knowledge.\n\n1413\n01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:04,100\nVery
